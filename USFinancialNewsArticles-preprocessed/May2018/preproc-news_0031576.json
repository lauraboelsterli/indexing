    "text": "FRANKFURT, May 14 (Reuters) - Germany’s year-ahead electricity contract hit a new all-time high in the European wholesale market on Monday, lifted by gains in oil, the energy sector’s “lead currency.”\n* German baseload for 2019 delivery reached 40.70 euros ($48.77) a megawatt hour (MWh), a level never seen on the contract that started trading in 2015.\n* This was 0.6 percent up from its close on Friday.\n* Brent crude oil was 0.4 percent up at $77.4 a barrel, with the market’s surge coming in the wake of U.S. sanctions against major exporter Iran. ($1 = 0.8345 euros) (Reporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Mark Potter)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
