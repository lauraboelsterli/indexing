    "text": "May 24, 2018 / 5:23 AM / in 13 minutes UPDATE 1-Deutsche Telekom extends mid-term guidance, pledges higher dividends Reuters Staff\n* Growth metrics through 2021 in line with prior period\n* Dividends to be pegged to adjusted EPS\n* Impact of proposed T-Mobile-Sprint deal not included (Adds CEO quote, U.S. deal context)\nLONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom said it would tie dividend payouts to growing bottom-line profits over the medium term, pledging that its business divisions spanning Germany, Europe and the United States would all show growth from next year.\nIn a statement on Thursday ahead of a two-day investor presentation in Bonn, Europe’s largest telecoms firm said it expected revenues to rise by 1-2 percent per year from 2017 to 2021, adjusted core profits by 2-4 percent and free cash flow by 10 percent.\nIt plans to pay a dividend for the current business year of 0.70 euros ($0.82), up from 0.65 euros last year, driven by growth in free cash flow. Thereafter, payouts would be tied to adjusted earnings per share that are expected to rise to 1.20 euros in 2021 from 1.00 euro this year.\nThe company said it would also consider share buybacks.\n“Over the next few years, we will continue to exhibit a growth profile that is unparalleled in our industry,” CEO Tim Hoettges said in a statement, adding that all of its group units should contribute to this growth from 2019.\nThe mid-term plan does not include the proposed merger of U.S. unit T-Mobile with Sprint. Assuming the deal closes in early 2019, the impact on Deutsche Telekom’s earnings and free cash flow would be negative through 2021.\nThe merger, which would create a No.3 U.S. carrier with 127 million customers, would bring synergies with an estimated net present value of $43 billion. It is, however, subject to regulatory approval. ($1 = 0.8541 euros) (Reporting by Douglas Busvine Editing by Victoria Bryan)",
