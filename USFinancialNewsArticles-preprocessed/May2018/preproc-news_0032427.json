    "text": "MILWAUKEE, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- EnSync, Inc. (NYSE American: ESNC), dba EnSync Energy Systems (\"EnSync Energy,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or the \"Company\"), a leading developer of innovative distributed energy resources (DERs) and business models for commercial, residential and utility installations, today announced third quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to $3.1 million, compared to $0.1 million in the year ago period, with revenue during the quarter largely being contributed by 10 power purchase agreement (\"PPA\") projects; Gross margins improved to 27.2% during the third quarter, compared to a gross margin loss in the year ago quarter, and gross margins of 24.2% in the immediately preceding quarter as the Company becomes more efficient and profitable on its PPA construction and sales efforts; The Company has 12 PPA projects in backlog in various stages of execution. Estimated backlog value for PPA projects, components and systems as of the date of this announcement is approximately $16 million, an increase of 40.4% compared to $11.4 million on February 13, 2018; and Sold the Company's Menomonee Falls corporate headquarters for net proceeds of $1.7 million during the third quarter.\nRecent Business and Product Backlog Highlights\nIn May 2018, EnSync Energy announced the signing of the largest scope PPA in company history, a 750 kW solar and 500 kWh energy storage system at the Keahumoa Place affordable housing development, utilizing our recently launched residential solution, the EnSync Home Energy System; In January 2018, the Company announced the signing of the second largest PPA in its history, a >790 kW solar PPA project at a Hawaii residential community; During the third quarter, signed and subsequently sold a PPA project for 350 kW Phase 2 solar expansion with Hawai'i Pacific University, making it downtown Honolulu's largest solar project; In January 2018, signed a 20-year PPA with the Polynesian Cultural Center for a 396 kW PV and inverter system; During the third quarter, completed commissioning of two Hawaii PPA projects; In February 2018, sold a 20-year PPA for the J. Walter Cameron Center project; and In February 2018, announced a purchase order for a Micro-Utility system that will ship to East Africa, the first order for EnSync Energy on the continent.\nExpansion into Residential \"DER\" Market with EnSync Home Energy System\nIn May 2018, EnSync Energy formally launched the company's leapfrog EnSync Home Energy System for property developers and residential customers which will allow for a completely integrated system with solar, energy storage, power electronics and an Internet of Energy control platform that delivers state-of-the-art functionality and modularity, with industry benchmark economics, safety and system efficiency. The EnSync Home Energy System:\nExpands upon the innovation and expertise that enabled EnSync Energy's leadership in the commercial and industrial (\"C&I\") market to solve the significant market challenges and product shortcomings for residential properties, delivering breakthroughs in performance, functionality, economic benefit and future-enabling capabilities; Brings a phenomenal differentiator to the market with EnSync Energy's True Peer-to-Peer™ energy exchange technology, which enables individual residential units in a property to be linked into a network behind the utility meter to provide highly efficient, direct energy exchange between units; and Includes high-efficiency \"LFP\" lithium-ion batteries, a Matrix Energy Management system with 9 kW AC output capacity, modular energy storage capacity of 9 kWh increments, modular DC-DC converters for photovoltaic and energy storage and the DER Flex™ Internet of Energy control platform, which enables a home to access the same DER Flex™ cloud-based computing platform utilized by EnSync Energy for connectivity between the asset owner, grid network and real-time market data for its C&I customers.\nManagement Discussion\nBrad Hansen, CEO of EnSync Energy, commented, \"Our commercialization strategy of selling custom designed DER systems and distributed generation systems, positions us in one of the largest market growth opportunities that will exist in the next 20 years. To meet this growth opportunity, we have expanded our product portfolio beyond our historic commercial and industrial application to now include utility and residential system applications. On the utility side, through projects like the Africa Micro-Utility system we recently announced, we have entered the independent utility systems business, where we are effectively a proxy for a utility. For our residential application, we recently debuted our new EnSync Home Energy System and subsequently announced our first practical application of what will be its game changing capability – True Peer-to-Peer™ energy exchange -- at the Keahumoa Place affordable property development in Oahu, Hawaii. I am pleased with the progress we have made in developing best-in-class product applications to meet these growth opportunities for years to come.\"\n\"Operationally, we increased our backlog of PPA projects by 40% to a record $16 million compared to our last reporting period, improved our gross margins to their highest levels yet, and signed the largest PPA in the Company's history – for our new residential vertical. Due to the uniqueness of accounting rules surrounding our PPA projects, we recognize revenue as we make progress on execution of our projects which are triggered by 6 to 10 project milestones. Some of these milestones are outside our control which will cause lumpiness in our revenue recognition. All told, I am pleased with the execution during the quarter.\"\nMr. Hansen concluded, \"We have outstanding project development and sales capabilities, innovative and differentiated products and technology, and an ability to mass customize bankable systems capable of addressing virtually any combination of applications you would ever need to perform. Importantly, our products are modular in design, enabling lower cost manufacturing, and rapid site deployment and faster time to money for our clients. These key competitive advantages should allow for us to capitalize on the rapidly growing trends in the marketplace for years to come.\"\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3.1 million, compared to $0.1 million in the year ago period. Revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 quarter was largely derived from 10 PPA contracts in Hawaii.\nGross margins improved to 27.2% during the third quarter, compared to a gross margin loss in the year ago quarter, and compared to gross margins of 24.2% in the immediately preceding second quarter. The improved gross margin is attributable to a favorable mix of projects in the current quarter and continued efficiencies in the procurement, construction and sale process. The Company's expectation is that gross profit margins on future PPA sales should be between 15% and 25%.\nAdvanced Engineering and Development costs were $1.2 million during the third quarter, compared to $1.4 million in the year ago period. Selling, General and Administrative expenses decreased to $2.5 million during the third quarter, compared to $2.7 million in the year ago period, due to a decrease in stock-based compensation. Total Advanced Engineering and Development costs and Selling, General and Administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation of $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively) was $3.5 million during the third quarter, compared to $3.6 million in the year ago period. The Company intends to hold at or below current levels going forward.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders was $(3.0) million, or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $(4.5) million, or $(0.09) per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 was $5.3 million, compared to $5.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nEstimated backlog value for PPA projects, components and systems as of the date of this announcement is approximately $16.0 million.\nConference Call Information\nDate: Tuesday, May 15, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. CT)\nDomestic participant dial in #: (877) 283-0524 or (412) 317-5232\nConference code #: 10120148\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
