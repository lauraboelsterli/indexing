    "text": "US disinvites China from multinational military exercise Published 3 Hours Ago The Associated Press VCG/VCG | Getty Images A PLA Navy fleet including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, submarines, vessels and fighter jets take part in a review in the South China Sea last April.\nThe Pentagon says it has uninvited China from a multinational military exercise to be held this summer in the Pacific.\nA Pentagon statement on Wednesday said the withdrawal of the invitation for the Chinese navy to participate in the Pacific Rim drills is \"an initial response\" to what it called China's militarization of the South China Sea .\nIt cited what it called \"strong evidence\" that China has deployed anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missile systems and electronic jammers to contested areas in the Spratly Island region of the South China Sea. It called on China to remove these systems.\nThe Pentagon also cited its objections to China's recent landing of bomber aircraft at Woody Island.\nChina maintains that the South China Sea is its sovereign territory.",
