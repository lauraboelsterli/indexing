A U.S. trade delegation visited Beijing last week for talks but left without significant progress in efforts to resolve an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.\nChina on Wednesday confirmed that Vice Premier Liu He will visit the U.S. to discuss trade at an appropriate time.
