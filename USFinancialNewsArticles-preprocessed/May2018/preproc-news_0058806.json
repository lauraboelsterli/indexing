    "text": "GOLETA, Calif., May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Resonant Inc. (NASDAQ:RESN), a leader in transforming the way radio frequency, or RF, front-ends are being designed and delivered for wireless devices, today announced its appointment of Marybeth Carberry to the newly created position of Vice President (VP), Business Operations.\nMs. Carberry most recently served from 2015-2017 as Senior Director, North America Sales Strategy and Planning for Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Austin, TX. Prior to that she was with McKinsey & Company in Dallas, TX as a member of the Marketing and Sales Practice. Ms. Carberry also served as Director of Sales Operations and Global Customer Service from 2006-2011 for Entegris in Austin, TX. Her accomplishments include implementation of systems and business processes, and leading sales planning and support. Her career spans over 16 years in sales and finance management positions.\n“We are delighted to announce the appointment of Marybeth as VP of Business Operations,” said George B. Holmes, CEO of Resonant. “Marybeth brings a long list of accomplishments with her and we are fortunate to land someone of her caliber and business acumen. As Resonant continues to grow we need to focus on scalable business processes that maximize our efficiency. We expect Marybeth’s contributions to be instrumental in helping Resonant accomplish its growth goals and create shareholder value.”\nAbout Resonant Inc.\nResonant (NASDAQ:RESN) is transforming the market for RF front-ends (RFFE) by disrupting the RFFE supply chain through the delivery of solutions that leverage our Infinite Synthesized Network (ISN) software tools platform, capitalize on the breadth of our IP portfolio, and are delivered through our services offerings. In a market that is critically constrained by limited designers, tools and capacity, Resonant addresses these critical problems by providing customers with ever increasing design efficiency, reduced time to market and lower unit costs. Customers leverage Resonant’s disruptive capabilities to design cutting edge filters and modules, while capitalizing on the added stability of a diverse supply chain through Resonant’s fabless ecosystem-the first of its kind. Working with Resonant, customers enhance the connectivity of current mobile devices, while preparing for the demands of emerging 5G applications.\nTo learn more about Resonant, view the series of videos published on its website that explain Resonant's technologies and market positioning:\nInfinite Synthesized Networks, ISN Explained What is an RF Filter? RF Filter Innovation Transforming the Mobile Filter Supply Chain\nFor more information, please visit www.resonant.com .\nAbout Resonant’s ISN® Technology\nResonant can create designs for difficult bands, modules and other complex RF Front End requirements that we believe have the potential to be manufactured for half the cost and developed in half the time of traditional approaches. ISN is a suite of proprietary mathematical methods, software design tools and network synthesis techniques that enable us to explore a much larger set of possible design solutions that regularly incorporate our proprietary technology. We then quickly deliver design simulations to our customers, which they manufacture or have manufactured by one of our foundry partners. These improved solutions still use Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) or Temperature Compensated Surface Acoustic Wave (TC-SAW) manufacturing methods and perform as well as those using higher cost manufacturing methods such as Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW). Resonant's method delivers excellent predictability, enabling achievement of the desired product performance in roughly half as many turns through the fab. In addition, because Resonant's models are fundamental, integration with its foundry and fab customers is seamless because its models speak the \"fab language\" of basic material properties and dimensions.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nGreg Falesnik\nMZ North America\n1-949-385-6449\nGreg.Falesnik@mzgroup.us\nSource:Resonant Inc.",
