This translated, in turn, to record quarterly revenues for the second straight quarter and 19 consecutive quarters of profitability. It also represents over 100% growth year-over-year.\n“Consistent revenue generation at an increasing rate is not accomplished by a single quarter’s effort but by sustained execution over time across all facets of the business. It requires exceptional teamwork and a dedication to exceeding customer expectations,” said Jim Souders, CEO of Adaptiva. “We are off to a great start in 2018, and the wheels are in motion for another outstanding year.”\nWhile sales across all product lines were up, Adaptiva experienced growing demand for its recently introduced Windows 10 Accelerator Program in particular. This meticulously designed program provides companies with everything they need for seamless deployment and maintenance of Windows 10 without any unnecessary and costly tools. Sales also substantially increased for Adaptiva’s flagship product, OneSite , a powerful content distribution engine that securely speeds enterprise-wide software deployments via Adaptiva’s breakthrough peer-to-peer technology.\nAdaptiva saw continued strong customer growth in the financial services sector, where a number of new customers were added. Several large existing customers also significantly expanded their deployment of Adaptiva products to help them automate their migrations to Windows 10. Adaptiva currently serves over 50% of the top 20 financial institutions in America as well as several of the world’s largest retailers. The company also added a number of new Fortune 1000 companies in other industries such as energy, transportation, and manufacturing to its customer roster.\nThis quarter, Adaptiva also benefited from increased contributions from its key go-to-market channel partners. These partners understand the value of Adaptiva’s OneSite, Client Health , and Windows 10 Accelerator Program offerings and have established a track record of successfully incorporating these products into their services and solution offerings.\nMoving forward, Adaptiva plans to continue hiring aggressively to maintain its growth trajectory and build on company momentum.
