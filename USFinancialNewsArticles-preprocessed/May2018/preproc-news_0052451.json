Revenue grew by almost 100% over the first quarter of 2017 and by 25% sequentially, illustrating considerable momentum in our business. We also saw strong improvement in our gross margin percentage as the margin enhancement initiatives we began in Q3 last year have started to take hold.\n“We are energized by the tremendous growth achieved in the first quarter and the increased demand for our products and unique services. We remain focused on continuing to drive profitable growth as we expand our presence in both domestic and international markets, capture new customers and grow our market share,” Mr. Pape concluded.\nFor the Quarter Ended March 31, 2018:\nRevenues. Revenues increased approximately $12.6 million to $25.2 million, or 99.5% over the prior year period.\nGross Margin. Gross profit for the quarter grew 124.85% vs prior year quarter and increased as a percentage of sales to 29.7% from 26.4%.\nExpenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million or 47.7% vs. prior year period but decreased as a percentage of sales to 19.4% of sales from 26.3% of sales in the prior year. This increase was due mainly to increases in personnel, occupancy, sales and marketing and information technology related costs to support the ongoing growth of the business.\nEBITDA. EBITDA increased $2.7 million to $3.1 million vs prior year quarter.\nNet income. Net income for the quarter increased to $2.0 million versus a loss of $.06 million in the prior year quarter.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter results today, May 23, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nTo access the live webcast, please visit the XPEL Technologies website at www.xpel.com/investor .\nTo participate in the call by phone, dial (877) 407-8033 approximately five minutes prior to the scheduled start time.

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is a useful measure to allow period-to-period comparison of the Company’s operating performance. EBITDA does not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and is not necessarily comparable to measures presented by other Companies. EBITDA excludes components that are significant in understanding and assessing our results of operations and cash flows. EBITDA does not represent funds available for Management's discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for Net Income prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\nEBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet (loss) income $ 2,016,558 $ (64,848 ) Interest 57,597 48,181 Taxes 591,955 25,253 Depreciation 159,318 167,506 Amortization 259,945 231,754 EBITDA $ 3,085,373 $ 407,846\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523005197/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nInstitutional Marketing Services (IMS)\nJohn Nesbett/Jennifer Belodeau, 203-972-9200\njnesbett@institutionalms.com\nSource: XPEL Technologies Corp.",
