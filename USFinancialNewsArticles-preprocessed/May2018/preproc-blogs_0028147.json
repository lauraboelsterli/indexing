The world-conquering artificial intelligence many fear likely will come from your friendly-neighborhood corporation, says the New Yorker’s Tad Friend , who surveys literature, white papers and scary quotes from Stephen Hawking and philosopher Nick Bostrom for clues into humanity’s fate. Corporations pay developers handsomely and they “lack the constitutional framework” for keeping matters of this importance in check. Because building the first artificial general intelligence matters more than building the first “safe” one, “the race seems designed to go to whichever company assembles the most ruthless task force.”\nKansans not in Kansas anymore. Mechanization has depopulated rural Kansas, leaving towns empty and smaller farmers relying on commodity markets, where they have no control over price. Native Kansan Corie Brown takes the backroads for New Food Economy , chalking up the little victories— a coffee roaster in Saint Francis (population 1,300), a well-stocked grocery store in Downs (population 844), a rebirth in organic farming—in a story that likely won’t end well. Gaze through the grain dust haze and what’s happening in Kansas hints at dramatic demographic shifts worldwide as automation supplants humans. “Such people will not care about the place or the land,” says Laszlo Kulcsar, head of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, and Education at Pennsylvania State University. “They will be people with no other options.”\nAI: Alchemy or engineering? A Google AI researcher says peers have little understanding of the field. Science Magazine’s Matthew Hutson reports that the accusation, made by Ali Rahimi, has attracted support from some of the biggest names in the industry. “People gravitate around cargo-cult practices,” relying on ‘folklore and magic spells,’ says François Chollet, a computer scientist at Google. For the defense, Yann LeCun, Facebook’s chief AI scientist, says focusing too much time on understanding AI blunts innovation. “Engineering is messy,” he says.\nShare this: Previous The Promise and Current State of Blockchain Next Bank of America Confronts AI’s ‘Black Box’ With Fraud Detection Effort",
