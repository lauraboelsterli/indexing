    "text": "2 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—White House officials promised to keep the U.S. in the lead on emerging artificial-intelligence technologies, despite growing competition from China and worries about potential impacts on American workers.\nAt a White House conference on artificial intelligence, Trump technology adviser Michael Kratsios pledged that the administration would make a priority of advancing artificial-intelligence research, through greater research funding and other steps.\n“America has been the global leader in AI, and the Trump administration will ensure our great nation remains the global leader in AI,” said Mr. Kratsios, deputy assistant to the president for technology policy, according to prepared text of a keynote speech.\nRelated\nIf Machines Take Over, Who Will Be in Charge? Companies Grapple With AI’s Opaque Decision-Making Process Digital Assistants Start to Get More Human In addition to increased federal funding, Mr. Kratsios raised the possibility that AI researchers might eventually gain expanded access to the government’s network of national labs, and also the government’s “vast troves of taxpayer-funded data, in ways that don’t compromise privacy or security.”\nArtificial intelligence is software that enables computers to emulate human intelligence, handling tasks such as recognizing and processing images or language in applications including autonomous driving.\nExperts view AI technologies as a big potential growth area for U.S. businesses. But it has raised concerns about the potential for job losses and other harms. It also has emerged as one of the areas at the center of intensifying competition between the U.S. and China for global technological supremacy.\nAbout 40 firms were expected to be represented at the meeting, including tech giants Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. unit Google, Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Big nontech companies participating include Bank of America Corp. , Boeing Co. , General Electric Co. , Ford Motor Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Walmart Inc.\nBut companies generally are sending AI and information-technology specialists, not their chief executives. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and CVS Health Corp. CEO Larry Merlo are among the small group of chief executives attending.\nOrganizers say they don’t believe that President Donald Trump will attend, although son-in-law Jared Kushner is scheduled to give closing remarks.\nThe meeting is being held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and has been cast as a dialogue that will help the administration shape future policies, including removing barriers to AI innovation.\nThe administration is hoping to strike a balance with the event, welcoming the benefits of artificial intelligence while also acknowledging potential political challenges.\nAlready, legislation to speed development of autonomous vehicles has run into opposition in Congress this year, in part over safety concerns. That could encourage a thicket of new rules at the state level, delaying deployment of the technology, advocates for the emerging industry say.\nThe legislation also has stirred political squabbles over the prospect of autonomous trucks, which are viewed with apprehension by drivers and their unions.\nIn his keynote remarks on AI, Mr. Kratsios acknowledged that “to a certain degree, job displacement is inevitable.” But “we can’t sit idle, hoping eventually the market will sort it out,” he added. “We must do what Americans have always done: adapt.”\nHe promised that “President Trump will never forget the American worker,” and said the administration would build on its efforts to create more effective science and technology education opportunities for U.S. workers.\nAI leaders also want government and businesses to work together to help AI grow, while avoiding unwanted harms.\n“The tech sector is committed to ensuring that all Americans reap the benefits of this transformative technology, which has the potential to save lives, improve how we harvest food, transform education and more,” said Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group, in a statement this week.\nSome industry leaders expressed concerns on Thursday that the U.S. risked losing its global edge in AI technology without a more-focused national strategy.\n“Other countries are very organized,” said Naveen Rao, Intel’s vice president and general manager of artificial intelligence. “Some of them can use government to remove barriers to technology adoption in a way we can’t because we operate differently. If we don’t find a way to do that here, we risk losing our edge.”\nSpecific discussion topics will include supporting AI research and development; developing the American workforce to take advantage of AI; removing barriers to AI innovation; and enabling high-impact, sector-specific applications of AI.\nThe event also will focus on applications of AI in specific sectors, including food and agriculture, energy and manufacturing, financial services, health care and transportation and logistics.\nMelika Carroll, a government affairs official at the Internet Association, said: “AI has great potential to transform and improve our daily lives. ... We applaud the Trump administration for furthering this important conversation and ensuring the U.S. is prepared to take advantage of all AI has to offer across every sector of society and the economy.”\n—Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.\nWrite to John D.
