Engie said the weakness of the Brazilian real currency and the dollar against the euro had a negative impact on its results.\nEngie also confirmed its 2018 earnings guidance for 2.45-2.65 billion euros of net recurring income, core earnings of 9.3-9.7 billion euros and a cash dividend of 0.75 euros per share.\n$1 = 0.8390 euros Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
