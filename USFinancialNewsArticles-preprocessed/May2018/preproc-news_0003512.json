(Nasdaq:MERC) (TSX:MERC.U) today reported strong results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Operating EBITDA* in the current quarter increased by 64% to a record $99.4 million from $60.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and by 11% from $89.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, after giving effect to costs of $28.5 million, or $0.44 per basic and $0.43 per diluted share, for the redemption of senior notes and a NAFTA legal cost award, net income was $25.6 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to $9.7 million, or $0.15 per share, 2017, after giving effect to costs of $10.7 million (or $0.17 per basic and $0.16 per diluted share), for the redemption of senior notes, and $41.7 million, or $0.64 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSummary Financial Highlights\nQ1 Q4 Q1 2018 2017 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts) Pulp segment revenues $ 314.2 $ 290.7 $ 242.8 Wood products segment revenues 53.7 47.0 Total revenues $ 367.9 $ 337.7 $ 242.8 Pulp segment operating income $ 74.1 $ 66.9 $ 42.4 Wood products segment operating income 3.0 2.5 Corporate and other operating loss (1.0 ) (2.7 ) (1.0 ) Total operating income $ 76.0 $ 66.7 $ 41.3 Pulp segment depreciation and amortization $ 21.5 $ 21.2 $ 19.1 Wood products segment depreciation and amortization 1.7 1.5 Corporate and other depreciation and amortization 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total depreciation and amortization $ 23.3 $ 22.8 $ 19.2 Operating EBITDA* $ 99.4 $ 89.5 $ 60.6 Loss on settlement of debt $ 21.5 (1) $ ‑ $ 10.7 (2) Legal cost award $ 7.0 $ ‑ $ ‑ Provision for income taxes $ 9.6 $ 11.6 $ 7.5 Net income $ 25.6 $ 41.7 $ 9.7 Net income per common share Basic and diluted $ 0.39 $ 0.64 $ 0.15 Common shares outstanding at period end 65.2 65.0 65.0\n(1) Redemption of 7.75% senior notes due 2022 (the \"2022 Senior Notes\").\n(2) Redemption of 7.00% senior notes due 2019.\n*Operating EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. See page 4 of the financial tables included in this press release for a reconciliation of net income to Operating EBITDA.\nMr. David M. Gandossi, the Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"We are pleased with our performance and results 2018 as:\nwe generated record Operating EBITDA of $99.4 million in the current quarter;\nin 2018 we continued realizing on identified fiber synergies between the Friesau Facility and our German pulp mills. In the first quarter of 2018, including fiber, we estimate we have realized approximately $3.5 million of synergy savings; and\nour pulp mills had solid production in the current quarter, with no scheduled maintenance downtime.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2018, pulp list prices were approximately $1,130, $910 and $1,260 per ADMT in Europe, China and North America, respectively. List prices increased due to continued steady demand, producer downtime, low paper producer inventories and lower levels of recycled fiber availability in China due to recent import restrictions.\nCurrently, the NBSK pulp market is generally balanced with world producer inventories at about 31 days’ supply. We continue to believe that the approximately half a million ADMTs of incremental NBSK pulp capacity expected to come online in mid-2018 will not have a material negative impact on the market in the near term as a result of continued steady demand growth, scheduled producer downtime and declining recovered or waste paper availability in China.\"\nMr. Gandossi continued: \"Lumber markets remained strong in Europe and the U.S. in the first quarter, with prices steady and near multi-year highs. We currently expect lumber markets to remain steady in the near term.\nIn the second quarter of 2018 we have an aggregate of 26 days of scheduled annual maintenance downtime (which will reduce production by approximately 40,800 ADMTs) at our pulp mills, of which 14 days are at our Celgar mill and 12 days are at our Stendal mill. Additionally, one of the two turbines at our Stendal mill will be offline for service for approximately three months commencing in the second quarter and into the third quarter of 2018.\"\nQuarterly Dividend\nA quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share will be paid on July 6, 2018 to all shareholders of record on June 27, 2018. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval and may be adjusted as business and industry conditions warrant.\nSummary Operating Highlights\nQ1 Q4 Q1 2018 2017 2017 Pulp Segment Pulp production ('000 ADMTs) 364.5 382.5 373.8 Pulp sales ('000 ADMTs) 367.1 367.4 375.1 Average NBSK pulp list prices in Europe ($/ADMT) (1) 1,097 997 823 Average NBSK pulp list prices in China ($/ADMT) (1) 910 863 645 Average NBSK pulp list prices in North America ($/ADMT) (1) 1,233 1,183 1,033 Average pulp sales realizations ($/ADMT) (2) 783 716 584 Energy production ('000 MWh) 438.0 469.8 472.2 Surplus energy sales ('000 MWh) 175.7 201.2 202.7 Average energy sales realizations ($/MWh) 107 102 91 Wood Products Segment Lumber production (million board feet) 102.7 104.2 Lumber sales (million board feet) 115.1 97.9 Average lumber sales realizations ($/Mfbm) 418 416 Energy production ('000 MWh) 20.6 25.2 Surplus energy sales ('000 MWh) 20.6 25.2 Average energy sales realizations ($/MWh) 135 123 Average Spot Currency Exchange Rates $ / € (3) 1.2289 1.1778 1.0661 $ / C$ (3) 0.7904 0.7866 0.7555\n(1) Source: RISI pricing report.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nConsolidated ‑ Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by approximately 52% to $367.9 million from $242.8 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to a 34% increase in pulp sales realizations and the inclusion of $53.7 million of wood products segment revenues.\nCosts and expenses in the current quarter increased by approximately 45% to $291.9 million from $201.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of costs and expenses from our wood products segment, the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro denominated costs and expenses and higher per unit fiber costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $9.7 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of the wood products segment.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, our operating income increased by approximately 84% to $76.0 million from $41.3 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations and the inclusion of our wood products segment partially offset by the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro denominated costs and expenses and higher per unit fiber costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we issued $300.0 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2026. In the current quarter we utilized the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to redeem $300.0 million of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022 at a cost, including premium, of $317.4 million and recorded a loss on such redemption of $21.5 million (being $0.33 per share).\nInterest expense in the current quarter decreased to $12.1 million from $13.9 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of a lower interest rate on our outstanding senior notes.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we recognized an expense of $7.0 million, or $0.11 per share, in connection with the legal cost award made by the tribunal in our claim against the Government of Canada under NAFTA.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, income tax expense increased to $9.6 million from $7.5 million in the same quarter of 2017 due to higher taxable income for our German mills.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, after giving effect to costs of $28.5 million, or $0.44 per basic and $0.43 per diluted share, for the redemption of senior notes and a NAFTA legal cost award, net income increased to $25.6 million, or $0.39 per share, from $9.7 million, or $0.15 per share, after giving effect to costs of $10.7 million, or $0.17 per basic and $0.16 per diluted share, for the redemption of senior notes in the same quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Operating EBITDA increased by approximately 64% to $99.4 million from $60.6 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations partially offset by the negative impact of a weaker dollar relative to the euro and higher per unit fiber costs.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nNone of the income or loss items following operating income in our Interim Consolidated Statement of Operations are allocated to our segments, since those items are reviewed separately by management.\nPulp Segment ‑ Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nSelected Financial Information\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Pulp revenues $ 290,551 $ 220,812 Energy and chemical revenues $ 23,684 $ 21,972 Depreciation and amortization $ 21,523 $ 19,116 Operating income $ 74,054 $ 42,360 Pulp revenues in the first quarter of 2018 increased by approximately 32% to $290.6 million from $220.8 million in the same quarter of 2017 due to higher sales realizations partially offset by lower sales volumes.\nEnergy and chemical revenues increased by approximately 8% to $23.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $22.0 million in the same quarter of 2017 due to the positive impact of a weaker dollar on our euro denominated revenues partially offset by lower energy sales volumes.\nPulp production decreased by approximately 2% to 364,486 ADMTs in the current quarter from 373,765 ADMTs in the same quarter of 2017 due to minor maintenance activities at the Stendal mill. We did not have any scheduled maintenance downtime in either the first quarter of 2018 or 2017.\nPulp sales volumes decreased by approximately 2% to 367,074 ADMTs in the current quarter from 375,104 ADMTs in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to slightly lower production.\nIn the current quarter of 2018, list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe and China increased from the same quarter of 2017 and the prior quarter, largely as a result of overall steady demand. Average list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe were approximately $1,097 per ADMT in the first quarter of 2018 compared to approximately $823 per ADMT in the same quarter of 2017 and $997 in the last quarter of 2017. Average list prices for NBSK pulp in China and North America were approximately $910 per ADMT and $1,233 per ADMT, respectively, in the current quarter compared to approximately $645 per ADMT and $1,033 per ADMT, respectively, in the same quarter of 2017 and $863 per ADMT and $1,183 per ADMT, respectively, in the last quarter of 2017. NBSK pulp prices are cyclical and are at or near record highs.\nAverage pulp sales realizations increased by 34% to $783 per ADMT in the first quarter of 2018 from approximately $584 per ADMT in the same quarter of 2017 and by approximately 9% from $716 per ADMT in the last quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher list prices.\nCompared to the same quarter of the prior year the dollar was weaker against the euro and Canadian dollar which increased the dollar cost of our euro and Canadian dollar costs and expenses and contributed to a negative foreign exchange impact on operating income of approximately $20.7 million when compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nCosts and expenses for our pulp segment in the current quarter increased by approximately 20% to $240.5 million from $200.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro denominated costs and expenses and higher per unit fiber costs.\nOn average, in the current quarter overall per unit fiber costs increased by approximately 28% from the same quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated fiber costs, weather related increased demand from Scandinavian pulp mills and lower harvesting activities in our mills' fiber supply areas. Harvesting activities in Germany and British Columbia were impacted by short interruptions resulting from unseasonably wet winter conditions. Additionally, there was reduced pulp log availability in British Columbia as sawmills focused harvesting activities on rebuilding sawlog inventories that were impacted by the summer wild fires. We expect a moderate decline in per unit fiber costs in the second quarter of 2018 as a result of improved harvesting conditions. In the current quarter, per unit fiber costs in Germany and for our Celgar mill were up approximately 11% and 15%, respectively, from the last quarter of 2017.\nTransportation costs for our pulp segment increased by approximately 14% to $19.9 million in the current quarter from $17.4 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated transportation costs.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, pulp segment operating income increased by approximately 75% to $74.1 million from $42.4 million in the same quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher pulp sales realizations partially offset by the negative impact of a weaker dollar relative to the euro and higher per unit fiber costs.\nWood Products Segment ‑ Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nSelected Financial Information\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 (in thousands) Lumber revenues $ 48,168 Energy revenues $ 2,781 Wood residual revenues $ 2,719 Depreciation and amortization $ 1,686 Operating income $ 2,982 In the first quarter of 2018, lumber revenues were $48.2 million, of which approximately 27% of sales volumes were in the U.S. market and substantially all remaining sales were in Europe. European and U.S. lumber markets were generally strong with prices steady and near multi-year highs.\nWe produced 102.7 million board feet of lumber in the first quarter of 2018. Lumber sales volumes were 115.1 million board feet.\nAverage lumber sales realizations in the first quarter of 2018 were $418 per Mfbm compared to $416 per Mfbm in the prior quarter.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, energy and other by-product revenues were approximately $5.5 million.\nOur fiber costs were approximately 80% of our cash production costs. Unseasonably wet winter weather conditions in Germany resulted in lower harvesting activities and high fiber costs in the current quarter. As harvesting activities increase we expect modestly lower fiber costs in the second quarter of 2018.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, operating depreciation and amortization for our wood products segment was $1.7 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, our wood products segment operating income was approximately $3.0 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table is a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Net cash from operating activities $ 76,377 $ 53,385 Net cash used in investing activities (16,351 ) (8,404 ) Net cash from (used in) financing activities (307,733 ) (1) 1,570 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 535 518 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (247,172 ) $ 47,069\n(1) Includes cash used for the redemption of 2022 Senior Notes of $317.4 million.\nThe following table is a summary of selected financial information as at the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands)\nFinancial Position Cash and cash equivalents $ 213,566 $ 143,299 (1) Working capital $ 476,151 $ 421,873 Total assets $ 1,507,180 $ 1,407,271 (1) Long-term liabilities $ 771,195 $ 743,578 Total equity $ 584,494 $ 550,666",
