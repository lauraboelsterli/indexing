REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\nRosneft Vietnam BV, a unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), is concerned that its recent drilling in an area of the South China Sea that is claimed by China could upset Beijing, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Wednesday.\n“As we have repeatedly asserted, all of Vietnam’s maritime economic activities, including oil and gas activities, have been licensed and carried out in maritime zones entirely under Vietnamese sovereignty and jurisdiction,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters in a statement.\nVietnam’s oil and gas activities are conducted in accordance with the 1982 U.N.
