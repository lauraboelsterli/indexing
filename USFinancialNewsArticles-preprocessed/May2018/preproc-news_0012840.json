(NASDAQ: SWIR) (TSX: SW) today reported results for its first quarter ending March 31, 2018. All results are reported in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as otherwise indicated below.\n“In the first quarter of 2018, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth in our higher margin Enterprise Solutions and IoT Services lines of business,” said Jason Cohenour, President and CEO. “With the acquisition of Numerex, we have added significant scale to our recurring revenue base and IoT services capabilities. We expect to leverage our stronger IoT Services business platform to expand our leadership position in Device to Cloud solutions for the IoT.”\nRevenue 2018 was $186.9 million, an increase of 15.9% compared to $161.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Product revenue was $162.9 million, up 7.8% year-over-year and Services and Other revenue was $24.0 million, up 138.6% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly revenue for the three business segments was as follows: (i) Revenue from OEM Solutions was $135.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 2.1% compared to $132.4 million in the first quarter of 2017; (ii) Revenue from Enterprise Solutions was $29.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 34.5% compared to $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2017; and (iii) Revenue from IoT Services was $22.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 217.6% compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. IoT Services results include the first full quarter of contribution from Numerex.\nGAAP RESULTS\nGross margin was $62.1 million, or 33.2% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $55.5 million, or 34.4% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses were $72.0 million and loss from operations was $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating expenses of $56.8 million and loss from operations of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was $8.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $92,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nNON-GAAP RESULTS (1)\nGross margin was 33.4% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses were $58.6 million and earnings from operations were $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating expenses of $46.4 million and earnings from operations of $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net earnings were $3.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net earnings of $7.8 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") were $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\n(1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results by Quarter\" below.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2018 were $70.6 million, representing an increase of $5.6 million compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in cash was primarily due to cash flows from operating activities partially offset by capital expenditures.\nAccounting Standard Adoption\nWe adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition (ASC 606) effective January 1, 2018. Our first quarter 2018 financial results reflect the adoption of this new standard and prior periods have been adjusted accordingly.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the second quarter of 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $195 million to $203 million and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.25.\nThis Non-GAAP guidance reflects current business indicators and expectations. Inherent in this guidance are risk factors that are described in greater detail in our regulatory filings. Our actual results could differ materially from those presented above. All figures are approximations based on management's current beliefs and assumptions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe disclose non-GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information on actual operating performance and assist in comparisons from one period to another. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nNon-GAAP gross margin excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related social taxes and certain other nonrecurring costs or recoveries.\nNon-GAAP earnings (loss) from operations excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related social taxes, amortization related to acquisitions, acquisition-related and integration expense, restructuring expense, impairment and certain other nonrecurring costs or recoveries.\nIn addition to the above, non-GAAP net earnings (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share exclude the impact of foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of certain balance sheet accounts, unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on forward contracts and certain tax adjustments.\nWe use the above-noted non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes and to allow us to assess the performance of our business before including the impacts of the items noted above as they affect the comparability of our financial results. These non-GAAP measures are reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors as part of the ongoing internal assessment of our operating performance. We also use non-GAAP earnings from operations as one component in determining short-term incentive compensation for management employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss) plus stock-based compensation expense and related social taxes, acquisition-related and integration expense, restructuring expense, impairment, certain other nonrecurring costs or recoveries, amortization, foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of certain balance sheet accounts, unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on forward contracts, interest and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes and we believe that it is an important indicator of our operating performance and our ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow that will fund future working capital needs and capital expenditures.\nConference call and webcast details\nSierra Wireless President and CEO, Jason Cohenour, and CFO, David McLennan, will host a conference call and webcast with analysts and investors to review the results on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 5:30 PM Eastern Time (2:30 PM PT).
