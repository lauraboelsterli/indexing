    "text": "TORONTO, May 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Partners Value Investments LP (the “Partnership”) announced today its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. All amounts are stated in US dollars.\nThe Partnership recorded a decrease in net book value during the first quarter of $357 million ($4.04 per unit) to $2.9 billion ($32.99 per unit). The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the Quote: d market price of Brookfield Asset Management common shares. The market price of a Brookfield share decreased from $43.54 per share at December 31, 2017 to $39.00 per share at March 31, 2018.\nNet income for the quarter was $18.7 million, of which $13.1 million was attributable to the Equity Limited Partners ($0.15 per Equity LP unit), slightly down from $13.4 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net income was due to investment valuation losses in the current period compared to gains in the prior year quarter, largely offset by foreign exchange gains in the period.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the three months ended March 31\n(Thousands, US dollars) 2018 2017 Investment income Dividends $ 18,744 $ 18,216 Other investment income 764 1,394 19,508 19,610 Expenses Operating expenses (1,251 ) (1,118 ) Financing costs (1,210 ) (781 ) Retractable preferred share dividends (6,789 ) (6,358 ) 10,258 11,353 Other items Investment valuation gains (losses) (11,643 ) 12,582 Amortization of deferred financing costs (501 ) (473 ) Income taxes (488 ) (2,812 ) Income from equity accounted investment 206 — Foreign currency gains (losses) 20,851 (1,578 ) Net income (loss) $ 18,683 $ 19,072 Net income (loss) attributable to: Equity Limited Partners 13,055 13,443 General Partner — — Preferred Limited Partners 5,628 5,629 $ 18,683 $ 19,072 Financial Profile and Net Book Value\nThe Partnership’s principal investment is its interest in 86 million Class A Limited Voting Shares (“Brookfield shares”) of Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
