    "text": "May 31, 2018 / 7:13 AM / Updated 3 hours ago South Africa's rand steady ahead of trade, PPI data Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nJOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand held firm against the dollar early on Thursday, building on its previous-session strength ahead of trade and producer price inflation figures.\n* At 0646 the rand was trading at 12.5200 to the dollar.\n* The rand rallied on Wednesday as the greenback lost gains after lower-than-expected U.S. GDP numbers and an ease in worries about Italy’s political turmoil.\n* Producer Price Inflation figures for April and trade balance data are due at 0930 GMT and 1200 GMT respectively.\n* The yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 3.5 basis points to 8.505 percent.\n* The Johannesburg Stock Exchange opened firmly on the front foot, with the Top-40 index up 1 percent soon after the bell.
