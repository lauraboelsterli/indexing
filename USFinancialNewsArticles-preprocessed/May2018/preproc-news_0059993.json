    "text": "MOSCOW, May 29 (Reuters) - Former fencer Stanislav Pozdnyakov was elected president of the Russian Olympic Committee, the committee said on Tuesday, as the country works to regain the trust of international sports bodies after a string of doping scandals.\nPozdnyakov, who had served as the committee’s first vice-president since 2016, led the Russian delegation at this year’s Pyeongchang Games while the country was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as punishment for alleged state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Sochi Games.
