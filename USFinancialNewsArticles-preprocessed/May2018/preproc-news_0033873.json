    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SherpaShare has announced today the acquisition of GigXL, a driving economy data pioneer dedicated to helping the country's one million rideshare drivers earn a better living. SherpaShare will acquire GigXL's data engine and other technology assets. In addition, technology veteran and GigXL co-founder Chi-Chao Chang will join SherpaShare as an independent board member.\n\"GigXL and SherpaShare share the same goal: to leverage data to help rideshare drivers thrive,\" said Jianming Zhou, co-founder, and CEO of SherpaShare. \"The acquisition will help us broaden our array of tools that help Uber and Lyft drivers.\"\nGigXL was co-founded by Chi-Chao Chang and Leo Tenenblat in January 2017 with the long-term vision of providing analytics for all gig economy workers, starting with drivers. They believe that workers will increasingly rely on their available insights as well as crowdsourced data to make informed choices every day.\n\"I look forward to helping SherpaShare strengthen its position as the leading independent company serving rideshare drivers,\" said Chang. \"It has always been my goal to help independent workers leverage data in new ways. Our partnership with SherpaShare will allow us to accomplish that much more quickly and effectively than would otherwise be possible.\"\nChang, with over 18 years of experience managing product, engineering, and data science teams, is currently the Chief Technology Officer at GoFundMe. Previously he was a director of product management at Facebook where he helped quadruple content search quality and engagement.\nAfter finishing a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Cornell University, Chang started his 11-year career at Yahoo serving in various leadership roles. He also held senior executive positions in several start-ups. In addition to his new board member role at SherpaShare, he is currently a board director at AISense, a leading-edge tech startup and Peninsula Bridge, a leading non-profit organization that supports underserved students in the Bay Area.\nAbout SherpaShare\nSherpaShare supplies the rideshare industry's leading app that helps over 100,000 rideshare drivers boost their bottom line. The app has allowed drivers to track over 1 billion miles and save millions of dollars in taxes. In addition, rideshare drivers leverage SherpaShare to manage expenses , find revenue-maximizing routes and hotspots and connect with other drivers.\nContact:\nJennifer Israel\njennifer@sherpashare.com\nwww.SherpaShare.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sherpashare-acquires-data-pioneer-gigxl-300648150.html\nSOURCE SherpaShare",
