    "text": "FOSTER CITY, Calif., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ: QLYS), a pioneer and leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the quarter, the Company reported revenues of $64.9 million, net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") of $9.1 million, non-GAAP net income of $15.0 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $24.6 million, GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.22, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.36.\n\"Our strong quarterly results reflect the power of our platform model to drive profitable growth. As customers embark on their digital transformation journey, visibility, accuracy, immediacy, scale and transparent orchestration across on-premise, endpoint, cloud and mobile environments have become a necessity, which are the hallmarks of the Qualys Security and Compliance Cloud Platform,\" said Philippe Courtot, chairman and CEO of Qualys. \"The 2018 RSA Conference was a turning point for Qualys as it became clear that Qualys has built a disruptive platform that truly helps customers consolidate their security and compliance stack, while enabling them to secure their digital transformation initiatives effortlessly and at scale, building security in and not bolting it on.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues: Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 22% to $64.9 million compared to $53.1 million for the same quarter in 2017.\nGross Profit: GAAP gross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 20% to $49.0 million compared to $40.8 million for the same quarter in 2017.

As a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating income was 28% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 23% for the same quarter in 2017.\nNet Income: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.1 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $21.9 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2017.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements related to: our ability to maintain leadership in securing global IT environments and helping customers secure their digital transformation initiatives; the growth of our business, including adoption of our existing solutions and our new offerings to both existing and new customers; our expectations regarding the introduction of new solutions; the capabilities of our platform; the expansion of our partnerships and the related benefits of such partnerships; our strategy and our business model and our ability to execute such strategy; our guidance for revenues, GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter and full year 2018, and our expectations for the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding and effective income tax rate for the second quarter and full year 2018. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our ability to continue to develop platform capabilities and solutions; the ability of our platform and solutions to perform as intended; customer acceptance and purchase of our existing solutions and new solutions; real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services; our ability to retain existing customers and generate new customers; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns and length of our sales cycle; our ability to manage costs as we increase our customer base and the number of our platform solutions; the market for cloud solutions for IT security and compliance not increasing at the rate we expect; competition from other products and services; fluctuations in currency exchange rates, unexpected fluctuations in our effective tax rate on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth and our ability to anticipate future market needs and opportunities; any unanticipated accounting charges; and general market, political, economic and business conditions in the United States as well as globally. The contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2018.\nThe in this press release are based on information available to Qualys as of the date hereof, and Qualys disclaims any obligation to update any , except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Qualys monitors operating measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. In computing these non-GAAP financial measures, Qualys excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses and acquisition-related expenses that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business. Qualys also monitors Adjusted EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, other (income) expense, net, non-recurring expenses, and acquisition-related expenses that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business). Qualys believes that these non-GAAP operating metrics help illustrate underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses, as well as the related tax effects, that are excluded in non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA.\nFurthermore, Qualys uses these operating measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business and evaluating its performance. Qualys believes that non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional tools for investors to use in comparing its recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 excludes $0.6 million of amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of Nevis Networks and NetWatcher and $0.3 million of compensation expense from the acquisition of NetWatcher that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business.\nQualys has not reconciled non-GAAP net income per diluted share guidance to GAAP net income per diluted share because Qualys does not provide guidance on the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income (i.e., stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses). The actual dollar amount of reconciling items in the second quarter and full year 2018 is likely to have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP net income per diluted share in the second quarter and full year 2018. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP net income per diluted share guidance to the GAAP net income per diluted share guidance is not available without unreasonable effort.\nIn order to provide a more complete picture of recurring core operating business results, the Company's non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share include tax adjustments required to achieve the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which could differ from the GAAP effective tax rate. The Company believes its estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% in 2018 is a reasonable estimate under its global operating structure. The Company intends to re-evaluate the non-GAAP effective tax rate on an annual basis. However, it may adjust this rate during the year to take into account events or trends that it believes materially impact the estimated annual rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other significant events.\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included with the financial statements contained in this press release. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating its business internally and as such has determined that it is important to provide this information to investors.\nQualys, Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch
