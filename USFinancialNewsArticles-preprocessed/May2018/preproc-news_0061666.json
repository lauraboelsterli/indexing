    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Wednesday that the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 that ended this week with no trace found may be resumed if new evidence comes to light.\n“We have to come to a stage where we cannot keep searching for something we cannot find,” Mahathir told a news conference.\n“If we find any new information, we may resume the search,” he said.\nFlight MH370, carrying 239 people, vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, becoming one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries.\nA privately funded underwater search for the missing jet ended on Tuesday.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff Writing by Praveen Menon Editing by Robert Birsel\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
