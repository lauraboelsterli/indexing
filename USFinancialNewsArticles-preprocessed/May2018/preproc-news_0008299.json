German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes Slovak Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini (not pictured) in Berlin, Germany, May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nMerkel said Iran’s missile progamme and its political influence in Syria needed to be discussed, adding that this was a widespread position in the European Union.\n“We will continue with our argumentation, namely keeping the JCPOA (nuclear deal) plus expansion of the negotiating framework,” Merkel said.\nMerkel said it was important for Israel to quickly make the information it has on Iran available to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled on Monday what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme that could encourage the United States to pull out this month of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers.
