    "text": "SANTA FE, Texas—If the bullet that passed through the back of Rome Shubert’s head had taken a different trajectory of even a millimeter, he would have been paralyzed or killed, the doctors told him. Mr. Shubert, 16 years old, was shot in the head by the gunman who opened fire at Santa Fe High School—and he lived to talk about it.\n“The doctors said it was the perfect shot,” Mr. Shubert said from his home here Friday afternoon. “I’m just glad I’m alive.”\n... RELATED VIDEO A shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, Friday morning left at least 10 dead and others injured. The suspect identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a student at the high school, is in custody. Photo: Associated Press. ",
