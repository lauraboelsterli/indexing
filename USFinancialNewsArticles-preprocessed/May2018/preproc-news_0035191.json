    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Alize Cornet has pulled out of the Strasbourg International tournament because of a groin injury but hopes to be ready for the French Open.\nFILE PHOTO: Tennis - Australian Open - Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 17, 2018. France's Alize Cornet reacts during her match against Germany's Julia Goerges. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo Cornet, who was cleared of an anti-doping violation on Tuesday after a charge against her for missing three out-of-competition drug tests was dismissed, picked up the injury last week in Madrid, where she was beaten in the first round by Elina Svitolina.\n“I am very disappointed that I cannot take part in the Strasbourg tournament but unfortunately I have not fully recovered from an adductor muscle injury,” the world number 32 said on Twitter on Thursday.\n“I am going to do everything to be ready for the French Open.”\nCornet, who won the Strasbourg tournament in 2013, reached the last 16 at Roland Garros last year.\nThe French Open runs from May 27-June 10.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Toby Davis\n ",
