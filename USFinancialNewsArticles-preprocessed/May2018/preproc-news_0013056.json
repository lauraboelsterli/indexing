Lodzinski, Chief Executive Officer of Earthstone Energy, Inc., commented, “We are very pleased with the progress we have made over the past year and through the first quarter as reflected in our financial results. Production, revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDAX have increased appreciably while we have maintained low levels of leverage. Our per unit metrics continue to improve as evidenced particularly by the continued improvement in lease operating expense per barrel of oil equivalent which decreased in the first quarter by 22% and 47%, respectively, compared to full year 2017 and first quarter 2017. Further we are developing our acreage while maintaining significant liquidity. We will continue to focus clearly on fundamentals, including operations, by controlling costs and improving efficiency and will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. Operationally, we continue to improve spud to spud drill times and are on track with our drilling and completion program for the year. We will continue to build scale through organic development, acreage trades and field level acquisitions, while working toward larger acquisitions or mergers.”\nOperational Update\nMidland Basin - In the Midland Basin, we completed two operated wells in January of 2018 that were the last two of a five well operated completion program which began in late 2017. We spud five wells in the first quarter with our continuously running rig on our operated leasehold acreage. In April, 2018, we initiated completions on an eight well program on our operated acreage in which we have an average working interest of 79.3%. This will be a continuous completion program which we anticipate finishing in the second quarter. Total operated and non-operated production in the first quarter averaged approximately 7,567 Boepd (60% oil).\nEagle Ford - In the Eagle Ford, we completed the last six of an eleven well completion program in southern Gonzales County, Texas in January of 2018. During the first quarter, we spud five wells with plans to complete these wells early in the third quarter. Our average working interest in these five wells is 16.7%. Total operated and non-operated production in the first quarter averaged approximately 2,095 Boepd (63% oil).\nSelected Financial Data (unaudited)\n($000s except where noted) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total Revenues 40,895 15,343 Net Income 12,191 729 Net Income Per Common Share (1) Basic 0.19 0.03 Diluted 0.19 0.03 Adjusted EBITDAX (2) 25,293 6,137 Production (3) : Oil (MBbls) 546 257 Gas (MMcf) 1,044 632 NGL (MBbls) 150 64 Total (MBoe) (4) 870 426 Average Daily Production (Boepd) 9,664 4,735 Average Prices: Oil ($/Bbl) 63.07 48.77 Gas ($/Mcf) 2.57 2.68 NGL ($/Bbl) 25.30 17.62 Total ($/Boe) 47.02 36.00 Adj. for Realized Derivatives Settlements: Oil ($/Bbl) 55.11 47.03 Gas ($/Mcf) 2.63 2.46 NGL ($/Bbl) 25.30 17.62 Total ($/Boe) 42.10 34.63 (1) Net Income Per Common Share attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator.\nWe define “Adjusted EBITDAX” as net income plus, when applicable, accretion of asset retirement obligations; depletion, depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; transaction costs; (gain) on sale of oil and gas properties; unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives; stock-based compensation; and income tax expense (benefit).\nOur Adjusted EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand our operations. Adjusted EBITDAX is one of several metrics that we use as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements. For example, Adjusted EBITDAX can be used to assess our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure and to assess the financial performance of our assets and our company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDAX for the periods indicated:\n($000s) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income 12,191 729 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 41 152 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 9,708 7,889 Interest expense, net 613 337 Transaction costs — 803 (Gain) on sale of oil and gas properties (449 ) — Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts 1,000 (5,046 ) Stock based compensation (non-cash) 1,940 1,311 Income tax expense (benefit) 249 (38 ) Adjusted EBITDAX 25,293 6,137 II. Net Income Per Combined Diluted Share\nWe define “Net income per combined diluted share” as the combination of (i) net income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. and (ii) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, divided by the combination of (iii) diluted weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock and (iv) weighted average shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding.\nNet income per combined diluted share, as used by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that Net income per combined diluted share is a metric used by our management team and by other users of our consolidated financial statements in order to view the overall results of the controlled entity.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income per diluted share to net income per combined diluted share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. $ 5,321 $ 729 Diluted weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding 27,911,924 22,585,474 Net income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. per diluted share $ 0.19 $ 0.03 Non-GAAP Measure Numerator: Net income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. $ 5,321 $ 729 Add: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 6,870 — Net income $ 12,191 $ 729 Non-GAAP Measure Denominator: Diluted weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding 27,911,924 22,585,474 Weighted average shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding 35,903,732 — Diluted weighted average shares of combined Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding 63,815,656 22,585,474 Net income per combined diluted share $ 0.19 $ 0.03 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income per diluted share to net income per combined diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nNet income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. $ 2,324 Diluted weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding 26,425,780 Net income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. per diluted share $ 0.09 Non-GAAP Measure Numerator: Net income attributable to Earthstone Energy, Inc. $ 2,324 Add: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 3,173 Net income $ 5,497 Non-GAAP Measure Denominator: Diluted weighted average shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding 26,425,780 Weighted average shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding 36,059,065 Diluted weighted average shares of combined Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding 62,484,845 Net income per combined diluted share $ 0.09\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503006510/en/\nEarthstone Energy, Inc.\nMark Lumpkin, Jr., 281-298-4246\nExecutive Vice President – Chief Financial Officer\nmark.lumpkin@earthstoneenergy.com\nor\nScott Thelander, 281-298-4246\nDirector of Finance\nscott@earthstoneenergy.com\nSource: Earthstone Energy, Inc.",
