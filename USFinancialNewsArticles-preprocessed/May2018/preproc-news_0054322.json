    "text": "2 COMMENTS As hedge funds scour the globe for weak spots in what have been mainly placid markets, Italy is becoming a prime target.\nBets by hedge fund against Italian bonds have risen to levels not seen since the financial crisis, in a reminder of latent risks in the eurozone. Bets have mounted throughout the year, with the trend accelerating in recent days, on fears that Italy’s likely new antiestablishment coalition government will add to the country’s large debt pile and potentially loosen ties with the European Union.\nOn Friday, yields on the 10-year Italian government-bond rose to 2.538%, their highest level since 2014, with the spread versus German debt going above 2 percentage points for the first time since June 2017. Italian banks, meanwhile, were the biggest losers in European stock markets.\nInvestors’ concerns have heightened as the European Central Bank slowly unwinds the huge stimulus that has supported Italian , and other nations’, debt. That stimulus helped dispel fears of a eurozone breakup that had spurred the region’s debt crisis at the start of the decade.\nAmong big-name managers profiting from the selloff in Italian bonds is Alan Howard, the secretive billionaire co-founder of hedge fund firm Brevan Howard. A little-known hedge fund run personally by Mr. Howard has been betting that Italy’s borrowing costs will rise relative to Germany’s, said two people familiar with the fund’s positioning.\nA spokesman for Brevan Howard declined to comment.\nItaly’s election in March gave two antiestablishment political parties—League and the 5 Star Movement—a parliamentary majority. A leaked draft agreement between the two parties included proposals to write off debt and increase spending. The debt proposal was later abandoned.\nThe two parties have also said they want to review “the economic governance infrastructure of Europe” and 5 Star and the League have flirted in the past with the idea of Italy leaving the eurozone.\nDemand to borrow Italian government bonds—a good gauge of investors short selling, or betting on falling prices—is up 33% to $33.3 billion worth of debt this year to Tuesday, according to data group IHS Markit . In contrast, demand to borrow bonds from EU countries excluding Italy has risen 5% this year.\nOver the past week demand to borrow Italian bonds has risen by $1.2 billion. That takes demand close to its highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. Demand to borrow bonds from EU countries excluding Italy has fallen by $800 million over the past week.\nThe figures are a good gauge of short selling interest because that strategy involves borrowing a security and then selling it in the open market, in the hope of buying it back at a lower price.\nConnecticut-based Discovery Capital Management—headed by Robert Citrone, an alumnus of Julian Robertson’s U.S. hedge fund giant Tiger Management—has also been betting on Italian bond spreads widening, said a person familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Discovery declined to comment.\nHedge funds are notoriously secretive about their trading positions, and individual short positions in government bonds aren’t publicly disclosed.\nClouds form above an Italian flag.

Photo: Vincenzo Tersigni/Zuma Press Profits from Mr. Howard’s position in Italy are among bets that have his helped the fund gain 7.5% this month and 13% this year, said one of the people. That makes it one of the top-performing funds to be betting on global bonds and currencies this year.\nBetting against Italian bonds—known as BTPs—has been a difficult trade to pull off in recent years. Despite the country’s 130% debt-to-GDP ratio and lackluster economic growth, ECB bond-buying, or quantitative easing, has suppressed yields and often made shorting the bonds unprofitable.\nBut traders say that has changed as the ECB slowly unwinds its stimulus package and political risk rises in Italy.\n“QE has destroyed any sense of risk in the sovereign bond market and we may be due for a very rude wake-up call once the dust settles,” said Joseph Oughourlian, founder of London-based hedge fund Amber Capital.\nAmber has hedged its positions in Italian banks by betting that the spread between Italian and German government bonds will widen and shorting Italian corporate bonds. It has also shifted its positions in Italian bank stocks by selling what it sees as weaker lenders.\nMr. Oughourlian said the new government’s spending plans could push the country’s deficit up by €150 billion ($128 billion) while Rome could try to renegotiate its relationship with Europe.\n“What’s most troubling is that markets haven’t yet woken up to this major political risk,” he said.\nBets against Italy also reflect growing investor concerns about the rest of Europe’s so-called periphery, its weaker mainly southern countries. Their bond and stock markets have also been boosted by QE.\nYields on Portuguese, Spanish and Greek bonds were higher Friday.\n“We’ve seen increased interest in owning volatility, particularly in European banks—not just Italy but other peripheral names,” said James Conway, EMEA head of equity trading strategy at Citigroup. “The theme [we’re seeing] is owning protection on the periphery.”\n—Jon Sindreu contributed to this article.\nWrite to Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.com",
