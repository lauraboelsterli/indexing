He has worked in conjunction with The Spence Law Firm for nearly 30 years, partnering with the firm on some of the largest personal injury lawsuits in New Mexico history.\nMr. Wallin, a partner in The Spence Law Firm NM, LLC, said, \"Having seen the devotion and commitment shown to their clients for decades, I'm pleased to formally join the Spence firm lawyers.
