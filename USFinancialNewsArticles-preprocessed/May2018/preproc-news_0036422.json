    "text": "(Adds details, forecast, recasts first paragraph)\nMay 14 (Reuters) - Spanish oil and gas engineering company Tecnicas Reunidas now expects its 2018 profit margin will be at the lower end of its official guidance due to project delays and cancellations, its CEO said.\nTecnicas Reunidas reported on Monday that its margin on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) was just 0.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with guidance of 1.5-2.5 percent for the full year.\nThe news sent shares in the company down nearly 4 percent.\nIf no new projects are awarded, EBIT margin for the year would be at the lower end of the outlook range, though reaching a 4 percent target for 2019 was “doable” as the company worked through the backlog, Chief Executive Juan Llado said in a conference call.\nThe company’s first-quarter backlog fell to 9.7 billion euros ($11.6 billion) after two consecutive quarters of growth.\nTecnicas Reunidas saw less activity in 2017 with a gap between project completions and new project awards.\nThe company issued a profit warning in November as it witnessed a sharp contraction of margins with an increase in idle costs and some cost overruns.
