    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zamansky LLC announces that it is investigating Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ:SYMC) (“Symantec”) and its Board of Directors (the “Board”) for possible breach of fiduciary duty to investors. Symantec shares plunged 33% today after its announcement that its audit committee is conducting an investigation of the company after a whistleblower raised concerns about its financial statements.\nAccording to Jake Zamansky, investment fraud attorney, we are investigating Symantec’s Board for a possible shareholder derivative case. Zamansky LLC is investigating whether Symantec’s Board potentially breached fiduciary duties to shareholders. Symantec informed investors that it is conducting an internal investigation which will delay the filing of its annual report and may lead to a restatement of previous earnings.\nWhat Symantec Investors Can Do\nIf you are an investor in Symantec who is still holding his or her shares, and you wish to discuss your legal rights, you may, without obligation or cost to you, email jake@zamansky.com or call the law firm at (212) 742-1414.\nAbout Zamansky LLC\nZamansky LLC is a leading investment fraud law firm with a practice representing investors in securities, mutual fund, hedge fund and ERISA class action litigation, and FINRA securities arbitration.
