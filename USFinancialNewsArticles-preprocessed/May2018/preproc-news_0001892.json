    "text": "NOVI, Mich., - Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CPS) today reported results for the first quarter 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nSales increased 7.2 percent to a record $967.4 million Net income reached a first quarter record $56.8 million or $3.07 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA increased to a first quarter record $122.6 million or 12.7 percent of sales Adjusted net income increased 14.2 percent to a first quarter record $63.8 million or $3.45 per diluted share Net new business awards totaled $140 million for the quarter\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company generated net income of $56.8 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of $122.6 million on sales of $967.4 million. These results compare to net income of $41.7 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of $111.0 million on sales of $902.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Company's adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales (\"Adjusted EBITDA Margin\") for the first quarter of 2018 was 12.7 percent compared to 12.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"We are pleased to have started the year with solid operating performance and strong financial results,\" stated Jeffrey Edwards, chairman and CEO of Cooper Standard. \"Our sales growth continues to outpace global light vehicle production and our team's further advancements toward world-class operations are helping to reduce costs and expand margins.\"\nThe Company's first quarter net income, excluding restructuring and other special items (\"adjusted net income\"), totaled $63.8 million, or $3.45 per diluted share, compared to $55.9 million, or $2.95 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in adjusted net income was driven primarily by improvements in operating efficiency and lower selling, general administrative and engineering (\"SGA&E\") expense. These were partially offset by customer price reductions and inflation. Higher material costs were offset by purchasing lean initiatives and supply chain optimization.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. Definitions of these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures, calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are provided in the attached supplemental schedules.\nNotable Developments\nDuring the first quarter, Cooper Standard launched 50 new customer programs and was awarded $140 million in annual net new business.\nNew contract awards for the Company's recent product innovations, including both new and replacement business, totaled $70 million in the quarter. Cooper Standard's expanding portfolio of commercialized innovation products includes: MagAlloy™; ArmorHose™; ArmorHose™ TPV; Gen III Posi-Lock; TP Microdense; and Fortrex™.\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, Cooper Standard received an Automotive News PACE Award for its Fortrex™ lightweight elastomeric material in automotive sealing applications. The annual PACE (Premier Automotive Suppliers' Contribution to Excellence) Awards honor supplier innovations that have entered the market and are delivering measurable customer benefits.\nConsolidated Results\nFirst quarter 2018 sales increased by $65.3 million or 7.2 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was largely attributable to $53.0 million of favorable exchange rate fluctuations, primarily in Europe and Asia, and favorable volume and mix, net of customer price reductions.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by $11.7 million or 10.5 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to net operational efficiencies of $25.0 million, purchasing efficiencies and lower SGA&E expense, partially offset by customer price reductions and commodity price pressure.\nThe Company has adopted a new accounting standard related to Compensation - Retirement Benefits (ASU 2017-07) that reclassifies the presentation of the components of net periodic benefit costs in the statements of net income. As a result, prior period data have been recast.\nSegment Results\nNorth America\nThe Company's North America segment reported sales of $499.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 3.1 percent when compared to $484.2 million in sales reported in the first quarter 2017. The year-over-year improvement was largely attributable to favorable volume and mix, partially offset by customer price reductions.\nNorth America segment profit was $64.7 million, or 13.0 percent of sales, in the first quarter. This compared to segment profit of $62.3 million or 12.9 percent of sales in the first quarter 2017. The year-over-year change in segment profit was driven primarily by net operational efficiencies and favorable volume and mix, partially offset by customer price reductions and inflation.\nEurope\nThe Company's Europe segment reported sales of $292.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 11.8 percent when compared to sales of $261.5 million in the first quarter 2017. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by unfavorable volume and mix net of customer price reductions.\nThe Europe segment reported a profit of $2.6 million in the first quarter compared to segment loss of $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year improvement was largely attributable to net operational efficiencies, including savings from restructuring, lower restructuring expense, the non-recurrence of a prior period fixed asset impairment, favorable foreign exchange and lower SGA&E expense, partially offset by unfavorable volume and mix, customer price reductions, commodity price pressure and inflation.\nAsia Pacific\nThe Company's Asia Pacific segment reported sales of $149.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12.5 percent when compared to sales of $132.6 million in the first quarter 2017. The year-over-year increase was largely attributable to favorable foreign exchange and favorable volume and mix, net of customer price reductions.\nAsia Pacific segment profit was $3.6 million in the first quarter, compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter 2017. The year-over-year improvement was largely attributable to net operational efficiencies and lower SGA&E expense offset by lower volume and mix, and customer price reductions.\nSouth America\nThe Company's South America segment reported sales of $26.6 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12.3 percent when compared to sales of $23.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was largely attributable to improved volume and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nThe South America segment reported a loss of $1.5 million in the first quarter, compared to a segment loss of $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year improvement was due primarily to improved volume and mix, and purchasing efficiencies, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow\nAt March 31, 2018, Cooper Standard had cash and cash equivalents totaling $420.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities in the first quarter 2018 was $10.6 million and free cash flow for the quarter (defined as net cash used/provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures) was an outflow of $78.4 million. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of certain customer payments and lower utilization of the Company's accounts receivable factoring program during the quarter.\nIn addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company had $200.0 million available under its amended senior asset-based revolving credit facility (\"ABL\") for total liquidity of $620.2 million at March 31, 2018.\nTotal debt at March 31, 2018 was $758.2 million. Net debt (defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) was $338.0 million. Cooper Standard's net leverage ratio (defined as net debt divided by trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA) at March 31, 2018 was 0.7 times.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company entered into a third amendment to its Term Loan Facility to reduce the interest rate. The lower rate will reduce cash interest expense by approximately $0.8 million annually through the remaining term of the loan.\nOutlook\nBased on the results achieved in the first quarter and the market outlook for the rest of the year, the Company is maintaining its previous guidance for the full year 2018 as summarized below:\nPrevious Guidance\n(2/15/2018)\nCurrent Guidance\nSales\n$3.55 - $3.60 billion\nUnchanged\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 1\n12.7% - 13.3%\nUnchanged\nCapital Expenditures as a percent of sales\n5.5% - 5.9%\nUnchanged\nCash Restructuring\n$25 - $35 million\nUnchanged\nEffective Tax Rate\n20% - 24%\nUnchanged\n1 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA margin range to projected net income margin range because full-year net income will include special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end. Due to this uncertainty, we cannot reconcile projected adjusted EBITDA margin range to a comparable US GAAP net income margin range without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Details\nCooper Standard management will host a conference call and webcast on May 2, 2018 at 9 a.m. ET to discuss its first quarter 2018 results, provide a general business update and respond to investor questions. A link to the live webcast of the call (listen only) and presentation materials will be available on Cooper Standard's Investor Relations website at www.ir.cooperstandard.com/events.cfm .\nTo participate by phone, callers in the United States and Canada should dial toll-free 800-949-4315 (international callers dial 678-825-8315) and provide the conference ID 95008497 or ask to be connected to the Cooper Standard conference call.

cash shown in the statement of cash flows\n$\n422,682\n$\n518,461\nNon-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and free cash flow are measures not recognized under U.S. GAAP and which exclude certain non-cash and special items that may obscure trends and operating performance not indicative of the Company's core financial activities. Management considers EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and free cash flow to be key indicators of the Company's operating performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company's performance. In addition, similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in the Company's financing arrangements and management uses these measures for developing internal budgets and forecasting purposes. EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted to reflect income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the Company's core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. Adjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the Company's core operating performance. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares, respectively, outstanding during the period. Net debt is defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and is useful to both management and investors in evaluating the Company's ability to service and repay its debt.\nWhen analyzing the Company's operating performance, investors should use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and free cash flow as supplements to, and not as alternatives for, net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and not as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. Other companies may report EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, net debt and free cash flow differently and therefore the Company's results may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. In addition, in evaluating adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, it should be noted that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to or in excess of the adjustments in the below presentation. This presentation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by special items. Reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow follow.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table provides reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA from net income:\n(Unaudited; Dollar amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.\n$\n56,792\n$\n41,706\nIncome tax expense\n11,891\n11,890\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n9,800\n11,239\nDepreciation and amortization\n36,259\n31,857\nEBITDA\n$\n114,742\n$\n96,692\nRestructuring charges\n7,125\n9,988\nLoss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt (1)\n770\n—\nImpairment charges (2)\n—\n4,270\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n122,637\n$\n110,950\nSales\n$\n967,391\n$\n902,051\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n12.7\n%\n12.3\n%\n(1) Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility.\n(2) Non-cash impairment charges related to fixed assets.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nThe following table provides reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and the respective earnings per share amounts:\n(Unaudited; Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.\n$\n56,792\n$\n41,706\nRestructuring charges\n7,125\n9,988\nLoss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt (1)\n770\n—\nImpairment charges (2)\n—\n4,270\nTax impact of adjusting items (3)\n(901)\n(95)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n63,786\n$\n55,869\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic\n17,991,488\n17,742,994\nDiluted\n18,511,113\n18,972,550\nEarnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n3.16\n$\n2.35\nDiluted\n$\n3.07\n$\n2.20\nAdjusted earnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n3.55\n$\n3.15\nDiluted\n$\n3.45\n$\n2.95\n(1) Loss on refinancing and extinguishment of debt related to the amendment of the Term Loan Facility.\n(2) Non-cash impairment charges related to fixed assets.\n(3) Represents the elimination of the income tax impact of the above adjustments by calculating the income tax impact of\nthese adjusting items using the appropriate tax rate for the jurisdiction where the charges were incurred.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe following table defines free cash flow:\n(Unaudited; Dollar amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n$\n(10,556)\n$\n3,689\nCapital expenditures\n(67,858)\n(58,270)\nFree cash flow\n$\n(78,414)\n$\n(54,581)\n releases/cooper-standard-reports-record-first-quarter-results-300640506.html\nSOURCE Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.",
