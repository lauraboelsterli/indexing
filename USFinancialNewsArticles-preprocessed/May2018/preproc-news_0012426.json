    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Parsley Energy, Inc. (NYSE: PE) (\"Parsley,\" \"Parsley Energy,\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company has posted to its website a presentation that supplements the information in this release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet oil production increased 15% quarter-over-quarter and 57% year-over-year to 59.3 MBo per day. Total net production averaged 93.4 MBoe per day. (1) Parsley placed 21 gross operated horizontal wells on production in the Delaware Basin during 1Q18 at an average completed lateral length of approximately 9,600 feet, representing more lateral footage than the Company completed in the Delaware Basin during all of 2017. Parsley registered Company-record initial production rates for wells completed in Glasscock and Pecos Counties, as detailed below. The Company demonstrated strong cost control during the first quarter of 2018. Parsley reported lease operating expense (\"LOE\") per Boe of $3.43, (1) below the Company-provided guidance range for full-year average LOE per Boe. Both general and administrative expense (\"G&A\") per Boe and cash based G&A per Boe, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to $4.16 (1) and $3.56, (1) respectively. The Company amended its revolving credit agreement on April 30, 2018, thereby increasing its borrowing base from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion while maintaining the Company's elected commitment amount of $1.0 billion.\n\"Parsley Energy made a confident first step toward executing our simplified 2018 development program,\" said Bryan Sheffield, Parsley's Chairman and CEO. \"Accelerated development last year not only gave Parsley a head start on securing high quality services and equipment, the corresponding production uplift also means we are benefiting disproportionately from currently higher oil prices. While Parsley is well positioned to benefit from ongoing oil price strength, operational continuity at a steady development pace remains our highest priority this year.\"\nOperational Update\nParsley's strong sequential production growth was driven by solid operational execution and favorable well productivity across its acreage footprint, highlighted by efficient Delaware Basin operations and a rapid return to full production following winter weather events in January. Volume growth was also supplemented by an increase in non-operated completion activity.\nActivity Overview\nDuring the first quarter, the Company spud 43 and placed on production 41 gross operated horizontal wells. Parsley's working interest on wells placed on production was approximately 97%, with an average completed lateral length of approximately 9,100 feet. Completion activity was nearly evenly distributed between the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, where the Company placed on production 20 and 21 gross operated horizontal wells, respectively. We expect that development activity will be weighted more to the Midland Basin for the remainder of the year, consistent with prior Company commentary.\nNotable Well Results\nWith four rigs currently active in Glasscock County, recent well results in Glasscock bode well for the production contribution associated with this sizable portion of Parsley's development program. Among these results, the two-well Catfish Hunter 12-1 pad registered strong peak 30-day production rates of 2,022 Boe per day (69% oil) and 2,004 Boe per day (72% oil), respectively. Both wells targeted the Wolfcamp B interval and were completed with approximately two-mile laterals.\nParsley increased Delaware Basin oil production by more than 50% during 1Q18 as compared to 4Q17 through a combination of strong well results, cycle time improvement, and enhanced net revenue interests associated with mineral ownership on 18 of 21 wells placed on production during the quarter. Parsley's 1Q18 Delaware Basin activity included the three-well Trees State 31-34 pad in Pecos County targeting the Upper Wolfcamp A, Lower Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B zones. Early results from this pad are outstanding, including two Company-record Delaware wells with respective peak 30-day production rates of 2,115 Boe per day (85% oil) and 1,940 Boe per day (86% oil) on approximately two-mile laterals. Notably, these wells are among the first to be completed in the southeast portion of Parsley's Pecos County acreage position. The 21 gross operated horizontal wells Parsley placed on production during 1Q18 represent more lateral footage than the Company completed in the Delaware Basin during all of 2017.\nNon-Operated Activity\nNon-operated development activity increased during the first quarter with 15 gross (6 net) horizontal wells placed on production, the timing of which was slightly ahead of Company forecasts. Non-operated activity for the remainder of 2018 is expected to be minimal.\nTakeaway Positioning\nDuring 1Q18, Parsley reported an unhedged oil price realization of $61.99/Bbl net of transportation costs, representing a differential of just $0.90/Bbl relative to the average NYMEX WTI price for the quarter.\nBy virtue of proactive steps taken to bolster the Company's firm transportation capacity and diversify its regional pricing exposure, Parsley now enjoys certain advantages with respect to its takeaway and marketing arrangements. Parsley currently has firm transport agreements covering 95,000 Bo per day of gross operated oil production. Additionally, the Company has diversified pricing agreements with large scale oil purchasers that price a portion of Parsley's barrels relative to Magellan East Houston, Cushing, and Midland benchmarks. During 2017, Parsley also layered on Midland-Cushing basis swaps that provide additional regional price protection during 2018.\n\"Our proactive marketing strategy has put us in a position of strength from both a flow assurance and realized pricing standpoint,\" said Matt Gallagher, Parsley's President and COO. \"Given the interconnect flexibility, oil quality, scale, and growth visibility we can provide, our crude production is attractive to premier purchasers.\"\nFinancial Update\nDuring 1Q18, the Company recorded net income attributable to its stockholders of $82.9 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to net income of $49.9 million, or $0.16 per share, during 4Q17. Excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, certain items that the Company does not view as indicative of its ongoing financial performance, and adding back the non-controlling interest allocated to Class B stockholders, adjusted net income for 1Q18 was $81.1 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to $95.9 million, or $0.30 per share, in 4Q17. (2)\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and exploration expense (\"Adjusted EBITDAX\") for 1Q18 was $282.3 million, up 30% compared to the same measure in 4Q17. (2)\nParsley demonstrated strong cost control during the first quarter of 2018. The Company reported LOE per Boe of $3.43, (1) below the Company-provided guidance range for full-year average LOE per Boe. Both G&A per Boe and cash based G&A per Boe, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to $4.16 (1) and $3.56, (1) respectively. Favorable trends in cash operating costs and strong realized pricing drove a robust operating cash margin of $35.65 per Boe, or 77% of average realized price per Boe. (3)\nParsley reported capital expenditures of $424 million during the quarter, comprised of $373 million for drilling and completion activity and $51 million for facilities and infrastructure, including saltwater disposal wells. In addition to spending associated with the above-mentioned 43 operated horizontal spuds and 41 operated horizontal wells placed on production, reported 1Q18 capital expenditures include $14 million of expenses associated with non-operated activity. With planned activity weighted more to the lower-cost Midland Basin for the remainder of 2018, we expect gross development costs per operated well to decrease from 1Q18 levels. We expect net development costs per operated well to decrease for the same reason, along with an expected reduction in average working interest.\nLiquidity and Hedging\nParsley amended its revolving credit agreement on April 30, 2018, thereby increasing its borrowing base from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion while maintaining the Company's elected commitment amount of $1.0 billion. As of March 31, 2018, Parsley had approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity, consisting of $500 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and an undrawn amount of $991 million on the Company's revolver. (4)\nAlmost all of Parsley's expected 2018 oil production is subject to hedge protection, and the Company recently added to its 2019 hedge position. Parsley's hedging strategy protects its balance sheet and anticipated cash flow while retaining significant exposure to higher commodity prices. For details on Parsley's hedging position, please see the tables below under Supplemental Information and/or the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, upon availability, for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nParsley Energy will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its results for the first quarter of 2018 on Friday, May 4 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Central Time).

Accordingly, all references to 1Q18 production volumes and per Boe unit costs likewise reflect this adoption, which has the effect of increasing certain natural gas and NGLs volumes and revenues, offset by a corresponding transportation and processing cost such that there is no change to reported net income. The recognition and presentation of oil volumes and associated revenues and expenses are unaffected by the adoption of ASC 606.\nPreviously provided full-year guidance for production volumes and unit costs incorporated the anticipated effect of the adoption of ASC 606.\nFor more information on ASC 606 and a reconciliation of 1Q18 production and unit costs under ASC 605 and as adjusted under ASC 606, please see the table and associated commentary below under Supplemental Information and/or the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, upon availability, for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(2)\n\"Adjusted EBITDAX\" and \"adjusted net income\" are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). For definitions and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDAX and adjusted net income to GAAP financial measures, please see the tables and associated commentary below under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\n(3)\n\"Operating cash margin\" as used in this release represents the Company's average sales price (without realized derivatives) per Boe less lease operating expense per Boe, transportation and processing costs per Boe, production and ad valorem taxes per Boe, and cash based general and administrative expense per Boe (exclusive of stock-based compensation), each of which reflects the adoption of ASC 606.

borrowings\n$\n491\n$\n881\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company's consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration and abandonment costs, net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), change in Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\") liability, stock-based compensation, acquisition costs, (gain) loss on sale of property, asset retirement obligation accretion expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, inventory write down, (gain) loss on derivatives, net settlements on derivative instruments, net premium realizations on options that settled during the period.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows the Company to more effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures, and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to the GAAP financial measure of net (loss) income for each of the periods indicated.\nParsley Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nAdjusted EBITDAX\n(Unaudited, in thousands) (1)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nAdjusted EBITDAX reconciliation to net income:\nNet income attributable to Parsley Energy, Inc. stockholders\n$\n82,890\n$\n29,442\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n22,573\n8,848\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n121,199\n68,970\nExploration and abandonment costs\n5,411\n2,763\nInterest expense, net\n29,845\n16,965\nIncome tax expense\n23,325\n18,402\nEBITDAX\n285,243\n145,390\nChange in TRA liability\n82\n20,549\nStock-based compensation\n5,069\n4,209\nAcquisition costs\n4\n1,344\nLoss on sale of property\n111\n—\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations\n354\n136\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n3,891\nInventory write down\n61\n—\nLoss (gain) on derivatives\n10,793\n(24,616)\nNet settlements on derivative instruments\n(2,873)\n(301)\nNet premium realization on options that settled during the period\n(16,526)\n(4,854)\nAdjusted EBITDAX\n$\n282,318\n$\n145,748\n(1)\nCertain reclassifications to prior period amounts have been made to conform with current presentation.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted net income is not a measure of net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure used by management to evaluate financial performance, prior to non-cash gains or losses on derivatives, net cash received for derivative settlements, net premiums received on options that settled during the period, (gain) loss on sale of property, exploration and abandonment costs, acquisition costs, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and change in TRA liability, while adjusting for noncontrolling interest and the associated changes in estimated income tax. Management believes adjusted net income is useful because it may enhance investors' ability to assess Parsley's historical and future financial performance. Adjusted net income should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, consolidated net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
