    "text": "PHOENIX, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quote: Media, Inc. (OTCQB:QMCI), a leading provider of market data, financial web content solutions and cloud-based applications, announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, showing 17% revenue growth, as well as profitability for the Company.\n“We are very pleased with our results this quarter for many reasons, foremost of which is the fact that we established profitability,” said Robert J. Thompson, Quote: Media’s Chairman of the Board. “Quote: Media improved its bottom line by $490,366 moving to a profit of $8,161 this quarter compared to a loss of $482,205 in Q1 2017.\n“Our top line revenue increased significantly. Our revenue in the first quarter rose to $2,667,240, which is an increase of $378,787 compared to the $2,288,453 reported in the comparative period in 2017. Additionally, our gross margin grew from 43% in the first quarter of 2017 to 49% in this reported quarter.\n“In December 2017 we announced a financial restructuring that eliminated over $12 million of debt from our balance sheet and reduced our annual interest expense by about $1.3 million. The early impact of that restructuring on our operating performance is evidenced in these reported results.\n“Our strengthened financial position allows us to attract and service much larger clients with our newly expanded product lines and enhanced data coverage.\n“In coming quarters, we are focused on extending our marketing reach and working diligently to create and introduce additional, exciting new product and service offerings. We expect that we will continue to post strong financial results throughout the remainder of 2018.”\nAbout Quote: Media\nQuote: Media is a leading software developer and cloud-based syndicator of financial market information and streaming financial data solutions to media, corporations, online brokerages, and financial services companies.
