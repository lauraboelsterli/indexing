    "text": "May 26, 2018 / 6:45 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago RPT-Turkey, Russia agree 10.25 pct natural gas discount, Ankara to get $1 bln payment-Erdogan\n(Repeats to additional subscribers)\nISTANBUL, May 26 (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia have Moscow, on Saturday.\nSpeaking at an election rally in eastern Turkey’s Erzurum, Erdogan said a $1 billion payment will be made to Turkey under the deal, which followed a Turkish request for a discount on gas first made in 2015.\nTurkey had gone to arbitration after its request was not met, Erdogan said.\n“After long talks, we reached agreement on a 10.25 percent price discount on the natural gas we receive from Russia, covering the years 2015 and 2016,” he said.\n“With the agreement which we have reached, a payment of $1 billion will be made to our country to cover the discount for the natural gas we received in those two years,” he added.\nTurkey is the biggest consumer of Russian gas after Germany. Russia’s Gazprom, which has a de facto monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, supplies gas to Turkey’s Black Sea coast via an underwater pipeline called Blue Stream with a capacity of 16 bcm per year.\nGazprom did not respond to a request for comment.
