    "text": "UPDATE 3-Creditors lead efforts to sell Brazil's Odebrecht rail unit -sources Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl Published 3:26 PM ET Thu, 10 May 2018 Reuters\n(Adds detail on hurdles to complete Peru deals; adds details of talks to sell Supervia)\nSAO PAULO, May 10 (Reuters) - Brazilian creditors of conglomerate Odebrecht SA are leading the efforts to sell the group's commuter rail unit, Supervia Concessionaria de Transporte Ferroviario SA, as banks raise pressure on the corruption-ensnared group to accelerate asset sales, three people with knowledge of the matter said.\nOdebrecht hired Banco BTG Pactual SA as an adviser months ago to sell Supervia, the sources added, asking for anonymity because talks are still private.\nBut failure to reach an agreement with potential acquirers following talks with investors caused creditors, led by Itau Unibanco Holding SA, to intervene, joining the efforts to sell the company through their investment banking units.\nAccording to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter, Odebrecht did not agree on Supervia's valuation with the first group interested, United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co PJSC.\nLast month, Odebrecht's construction unit failed to repay $144 million in bonds and said Odebrecht SA was still in negotiations with Banco Bradesco and Itaú to receive new loans to make the repayment within the 30-day grace period.\nTalks for the loans are still ongoing, but other two people with knowledge of the matter said no agreement has been reached yet. Banks say Odebrecht's asset sales program is proceeding more slowly than expected. Supervia was seen by the banks as an example of the delayed assets sale.\nOdebrecht has not received all the proceeds from the deals it announced, mostly due to legal hurdles to close deals in countries such as Peru.\nFor instance, Odebrecht sold its hydroelectric plant Chaglla in northern Peru last August to a consortium led by China Three Gorges Corp for $1.39 billion, but so far has not received the proceeds.\nBut creditors say in the case of Supervia, there is no pending legal issue preventing the sale.\nSince Mubadala expressed interest in Supervia, two other groups, Starboard Restructuring Partners and RTM Brasil, showed interest and plan a joint bid, according to one of the sources.\nBTG Pactual, Itaú, Mubadala and Starboard did not immediately comment on the matter. Odebrecht said in an emailed statement to Reuters that its transportation unit \"is in talks with another investor to sell its stake in Supervia.\"\nOdebrecht acquired 60 percent of Supervia in 2011. The company operates urban commuter trains in 12 cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro and transports around 750,000 people daily.
