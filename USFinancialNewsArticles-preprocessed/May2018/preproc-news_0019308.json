Our Q2 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $8 million to $10 million, which reflects an anticipated prolonged spring break-up. Our full year guidance remains unchanged at $50 million to $60 million. We anticipate steady improvements to our business in 2018 predicated on the continuation of the recent strength in commodity prices and associated activity levels. Our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for full year 2018 is based on a WTI forecast of $60 to $70 per barrel.\n\"On April 30, 2018, we achieved another milestone on the path to merging with Tervita Corporation as the plan of arrangement resolution was approved with overwhelming support by our securityholders. Looking forward, the next steps in the process include receiving approval from the Competition Bureau and the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. We remain on track for the arrangement to close late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2018.\"\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nQ1 2018 revenue of $61.7 million increased by 2% compared to prior year, primarily driven by increased utilization in Drilling Services and production related waste volumes received at our Heavy Oil facilities, partially offset by decreased mining contributions from Heavy Oil Onsite. Net loss for the quarter was $10.4 million compared to $14.5 million in prior year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily related to the reversal of impairment of certain Heavy Oil assets and increased contributions from the Oilfield division, partially offset by increased restructuring and other expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $12.7 million, a 21% increase compared to prior year driven by increased contributions from Drilling Services and Heavy Oil Facilities as well as G&A savings of $0.7 million, partially offset by decreased contributions from Heavy Oil Onsite. Our contract model continued to provide predictable cash flow. These contracts are of varying lengths, generally are not tied directly to commodity price changes or drilling activity and provide a solid foundation for our business, particularly in depressed markets. On a trailing-twelve month (\"TTM\") basis, contracts represented 16% of our revenue.\nHeavy Oil\nIn the first quarter, Heavy Oil revenue decreased by 7% to $20.1 million as increased SAGD volumes received at our facilities were more than offset by decreased mining contributions from Onsite. Net earnings before taxes in the quarter were $7.3 million, a $5.5 million increase over last year primarily driven by decreased depreciation and amortization and the reversal of impairment on certain Heavy Oil assets. Divisional EBITDA remained flat to prior year.\nOilfield\nIn the first quarter, Oilfield revenue increased 6% over prior year to $41.7 million, primarily driven by improvements in Drilling Services. Net earnings before taxes in the quarter were $2.6 million, a 38% decline over prior year, due to increased contributions from both business units being more than offset by increased depreciation and amortization. Divisional EBITDA increased by 16% over prior year to $11.1 million primarily as a result of improved drilling activity.\nCorporate and Other\nCapital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $8.5 million, an increase of $6.4 million over prior year. Expenditures for the quarter were primarily focused on growth projects. In the first quarter G&A was $6.9 million, a decrease of 9% over prior year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by our disciplined focus on managing overheads. Restructuring and other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $2.4 million compared to $0.7 million in the prior year. The current year expense is primarily comprised of transaction costs related to the proposed merger transaction with Tervita Corporation announced on March 1, 2018.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 28, 2018, we entered into an arrangement agreement (the \"Arrangement Agreement\") with Tervita Corporation (\"Tervita\"), pursuant to which Tervita has agreed, through a series of transactions, to acquire all of our issued and outstanding common shares on the basis of: (i) 0.1467 of a Class A Common share (\"Amalco Share\") of Amalco (as defined herein); and (ii) 0.0307 of one warrant (\"Amalco Warrant\") to purchase one Amalco Share, for each outstanding common share of Newalta, and Newalta and Tervita will amalgamate to form \"Tervita Corporation\" (\"Amalco\"). Each Amalco Warrant will be exercisable for a period of two years from the closing of the Arrangement (as defined herein) at a price of $18.75 per equivalent Amalco Share. The transaction is to be completed by way of a plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\") under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta).\nAt the annual and special meeting of the securityholders of Newalta held on April 30, 2018, the Arrangement, among other matters, was approved by: (i) 99.83% of the votes cast by securityholders of Newalta who voted on the Arrangement, voting together as a single class; and (ii) pursuant to the rules and policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\"), 99.81% of the votes cast by shareholders of Newalta who voted on the Arrangement. Additionally, at the annual and special meeting of shareholders of Tervita held on April 30, 2018, the Arrangement, among other matters, was approved by 100% of the votes cast by shareholders of Tervita who voted on the Arrangement, voting together as a single class. On May 2, 2018, Tervita received conditional listing approval for the Amalco Shares and Amalco Warrants from the TSX. Such listing is subject to Amalco meeting minimum listing requirements and fulfilling all other application listing requirements of the TSX. Completion of the Arrangement remains subject to regulatory approvals including pursuant to the Competition Act (Canada), as well as approval by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions, the Arrangement is expected to close by the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2018.\nFor additional details, please see the full text of the Arrangement Agreement included in our joint information circular dated March 23, 2018 filed under Newalta's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com .\nThe following section contains forward-looking information as it outlines our Outlook for 2018. Our Outlook is based on several key assumptions including growth capital contributions, commodity prices and activity levels in the oil and gas industry. Changes to these assumptions could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our Forward-Looking Information later in this document. We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in carrying out our activities including market conditions, ability to expand the business, competition, regulation, and the ability to attract and retain personnel. A complete list of our risk factors is disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Information Form.\nOUTLOOK & BUSINESS DRIVERS\nOur business performance is tied to drilling and production related activities in western Canada and the United States. Sustained, stable oil and gas prices enable our customers to make capital decisions to invest in the drilling and completion of new wells and reactivation of shut-in wells. Activity levels, which correlate to the generation of production waste volumes, will vary among plays based on their cost profile. We provide enhanced value solutions to our customers, enabling them to extract greater value from their operations irrespective of cost profile.\nThe key drivers of our business performance are as follows:\nCrude Oil Prices\nCrude oil prices (primarily Canadian benchmarks WCS and CLS) directly impact the value of the products we recover from waste. Relative strength and stability of crude oil benchmarks impact confidence amongst producers and play a key role in determining their capital budgets, which in turn drives activity levels.\nDrilling Activity\nDrilling Services performance is driven by active rigs and is the first business line to respond to changes in activity. Wells drilled and completed in the areas we serve drive waste volumes into our facilities. Drilling activity in the areas we serve is dependent on the cost profile of the play, with low cost profile shale play activity being initiated at lower oil prices than the more expensive profile plays such as in heavy oil areas. At higher asset utilization levels, we generally see increased pricing for our services.\nProduction Impact & Other\nPrimarily comprised of the net impact of production related waste volumes and shifts in waste mix, net impact of contributions from Onsite contracts and, to a lesser extent, customer pricing and operational efficiencies. We typically see a time lag between the deployment of producers' capital budgets, including turnarounds and workovers, and the subsequent production related waste volume increases to our business. The composition of waste volumes impacts the degree of processing complexity and the amount of recoverable oil. CHOPS waste volumes are also dependent on the drilling of new wells to replace production volumes lost through their naturally steep decline curves. SAGD waste volumes are dependent on the number, timing and length of event-based upsets occurring in the normal course of SAGD facility operations. The timing and amount of mining contributions will be dependent on the approval of producers' mitigation plans to meet the Tailings Management Framework. We continue to work with producers to develop solutions to meet these requirements. We continue to prudently manage our operational and corporate cost structure.\nOutlook\nOur outlook for 2018 is based on our expectation of year-over-year trends including:\nIncreased commodity prices: Strengthening WTI, CLS and WCS prices The wide WTI-WCS differential experienced in the early part of 2018 is expected to improve but remain wider than in 2017 Marginal increases in drilling and completions activity in the areas we serve Production related activity improvements, driven by: Return on capital investments to realize operational efficiencies Waste volumes at our Oilfield Facilities remaining relatively flat Incremental improvements in CHOPS waste volumes Increased demand for project work Disciplined focus on maintaining our streamlined cost structure and business processes\nSpecifically, we anticipate the second quarter results to be impacted by lower drilling activity and production levels due to a prolonged spring breakup.\nOur Q2 and full-year 2018 guidance ranges are:\nRevenue of $50 million to $60 million for the second quarter and $235 million to $260 million for the full year; and Adjusted EBITDA of $8 million to $10 million for the second quarter and $50 million to $60 million for the full year.\nThe following table outlines the factors we expect to impact Adjusted EBITDA performance in the second quarter and full year of 2018:\nFactor\nActual (1)\nAssumption\nExpected impact on Adjusted EBITDA\ncompared to prior year period (1)\nQ1 2018\nQ2 and Full Year 2018\nQ2 2018\n2018\nWest Texas Intermediate (US$/bbl)\nQ1: $62.87\nQ2 2018: $65 – $70\n2018: $60 – $70\nCanadian Light Sweet (CDN$/bbl) (2)\nQ1: $72.28\nQ2 2018: $75 – $80\n2018: $67 – $77\n$0.25M – $0.75M ↑\n$1M – $3.5M ↑\nWestern Canadian Select (CDN$/bbl) (2)\nQ1: $48.84\nQ2 2018: $65 – $70\n2018: $52 – $62\n$0.25M – $0.75M ↑\n$0.5M – $2.5M↑\nDrilling activity (2) over prior year\nQ1: 25%\nQ2 2018: (10%) - Flat\n2018: 5% – 15%\n$0.5M ↓ – Flat\n$1M – $6M ↑\nProduction Impact & Other (3)\nQ1: $0.2M\n$1.5M – $1M ↓\n$3M – $3.5M ↑\nAdjusted EBITDA Guidance\n$8M – $10M\n$50M – $60M\n(1)\nM refers to millions.\n(2)\nImpact derived from annual sensitivities based on forecast performance and volumes outlined in the \"Sensitivities\" section of our 2017 Annual Report and may be adjusted for expected volumes. The actual impact from crude oil prices may vary with fluctuations in volumes.\n(3)\nThis factor is expected to have an impact on our performance through the year and cannot be quantified on any linear sensitivity.\nManaging debt leverage and use of cash and capital are our highest priorities. We expect to remain within our debt covenants throughout 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis and Financial Statements\nThe condensed consolidated and MD&A, which contain additional notes and disclosures, are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or our website at www.newalta.com under Investor Relations/Financial Reports.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call on May 9, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the quarter.
