    "text": "NEW YORK, May 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE:LXP), a real estate investment trust focused on single-tenant real estate investments, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nGenerated Net Loss attributable to common shareholders of $(16.0) million, or $(0.07) per diluted common share. Generated Adjusted Company Funds From Operations available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted (“Adjusted Company FFO”) of $62.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share. Disposed of six properties for an aggregate of $62.7 million. Repurchased and retired 795,775 common shares at an average price of $7.94 per share. Repaid $60.0 million, net, on the revolving credit facility. Completed 209,000 square feet of new leases and lease extensions with portfolio 97.2% leased at quarter end.\nSubsequent Events\nAcquired two industrial properties for an aggregate cost of $92.5 million.\nAdjusted Company FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. It and certain other non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled later in this press release.\nT. Wilson Eglin, Chief Executive Officer and President of Lexington Realty Trust, commented, “In our continued effort to further reduce our suburban office exposure, we disposed of an aggregate of $62.7 million of primarily office assets during the first quarter. Furthermore, we continue to explore ways to maximize value in our office portfolio and focus our investment strategy on single-tenant industrial assets.”\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total gross revenues were $102.6 million, compared with total gross revenues of $96.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to revenue generated from 2017 property acquisitions and new leases, partially offset by property sales and lease expirations.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareholders\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net loss attributable to common shareholders was $(16.0) million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $40.4 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. The change between periods relates primarily to the timing of gains on sales and impairments recognized on real estate.\nAdjusted Company FFO\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Lexington generated Adjusted Company FFO of $62.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Company FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $57.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. The increase was primarily attributable to the items discussed above under “Revenues”.\nDividends/Distributions\nAs previously announced, during the first quarter of 2018, Lexington declared a regular quarterly common share/unit dividend/distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $0.1775 per common share/unit, which was paid on April 16, 2018 to common shareholders/unitholders of record as of March 29, 2018. Lexington also declared dividends of $0.8125 per share on its Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred”) for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, which are expected to be paid on May 15, 2018 and August 15, 2018, respectively, to Series C Preferred Shareholders of record as of April 30, 2018 and July 31, 2018, respectively.\nTRANSACTION ACTIVITY\nPROPERTY DISPOSITIONS Primary Tenant Location Property Type Gross\nDisposition\nPrice\n($000) Annualized\nNet Income (1)\n($000) Annualized\nNOI (1)\n($000) Month of\nDisposition %\nLeased Kelsey-Hayes Company (2) Livonia, MI Office $ 21,000 $ 1,144 $ 1,637 February 100 % Vacant Canton, OH Other 2,975 463 465 February 0 % Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tillon, Inc.

As of March 31, 2018, there were approximately 5.8 million common shares remaining to be repurchased under the authorization.\n2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE\nLexington now estimates that its net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2018 will be within an expected range of $0.54 to $0.57. Lexington is reaffirming that its Adjusted Company FFO for the year ended December 31, 2018 is expected to be within a range of $0.95 to $0.98 per diluted common share. This guidance is forward looking, excludes the impact of certain items and is based on current expectations.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 CONFERENCE CALL\nLexington will host a conference call today, May 8, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

For more information, including Lexington's Quarterly Supplemental Information package, or to follow Lexington on social media, visit www.lxp.com .\nContact:\nInvestor or Media Inquiries for Lexington Realty Trust:\nHeather Gentry, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations\nLexington Realty Trust\nPhone: (212) 692-7200 E-mail: hgentry@lxp.com\nThis release contains certain forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties or other factors not under Lexington's control which may cause actual results, performance or achievements of Lexington to be materially different from the results, performance, or other expectations implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the headings “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” in Lexington's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including risks related to: (1) the authorization by Lexington's Board of Trustees of future dividend declarations, (2) Lexington's ability to achieve its estimates of net income attributable to common shareholders and Adjusted Company FFO for the year ending December 31, 2018, (3) the successful consummation of any lease, acquisition, build-to-suit, disposition, financing or other transaction, (4) the failure to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, (5) changes in general business and economic conditions, including the impact of any legislation, (6) competition, (7) increases in real estate construction costs, (8) changes in interest rates, (9) changes in accessibility of debt and equity capital markets, and (10) future impairment charges. Copies of the periodic reports Lexington files with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available on Lexington's web site at www.lxp.com . Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe Lexington's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects”, “may,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “will likely result,” “is optimistic,” “goal,” “objective” or similar expressions. Except as required by law, Lexington undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the occurrence of unanticipated events. Accordingly, there is no assurance that Lexington's expectations will be realized.\nReferences to Lexington refer to Lexington Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries. All interests in properties and loans are held, and all property operating activities are conducted, through special purpose entities, which are separate and distinct legal entities that maintain separate books and records, but in some instances are consolidated for financial statement purposes and/or disregarded for income tax purposes. The assets and credit of each special purpose entity with a property subject to a mortgage loan are not available to creditors to satisfy the debt and other obligations of any other person, including any other special purpose entity or affiliate. Consolidated entities that are not property owner subsidiaries do not directly own any of the assets of a property owner subsidiary (or the general partner, member of managing member of such property owner subsidiary), but merely hold partnership, membership or beneficial interests therein which interests are subordinate to the claims of the property owner subsidiary's (or its general partner's, member's or managing member's) creditors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Definitions\nLexington has used non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G in this Quarterly Earnings Release and in other public disclosures.\nLexington believes that the measures defined below are helpful to investors in measuring our performance or that of an individual investment. Since these measures exclude certain items which are included in their respective most comparable measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reliance on the measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are weighed in balance with other GAAP measures. These measures are not necessarily indications of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, they should not be used as an alternative to the respective most comparable GAAP measures when evaluating Lexington's financial performance or cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities or liquidity.\nCash Rent: Cash Rent is calculated by making adjustments to GAAP rent to remove the impact of GAAP required adjustments to rental income such as adjustments for straight-line rents relating to free rent periods and contractual rent increases. Cash Rent excludes lease termination income. Lexington believes Cash Rent provides a meaningful indication of an investment's ability to fund cash needs.\nCompany Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”): FAD is calculated by making adjustments to Adjusted Company FFO (see below) for (1) straight-line adjustments, (2) lease incentive amortization, (3) amortization of above/below market leases, (4) lease termination payments, net, (5) non-cash interest, net, (6) non-cash charges, net, (7) cash paid for tenant improvements, and (8) cash paid for lease costs. Although FAD may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), Lexington believes it provides a meaningful indication of its ability to fund cash needs. FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of operating performance to net income, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Company FFO: Lexington believes that Funds from Operations, or FFO, which is a non-GAAP measure, is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Lexington believes FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. As a result, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing perspective that may not necessarily be apparent from net income.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as “net income (or loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for non-consolidated partnerships and joint ventures.” NAREIT clarified its computation of FFO to exclude impairment charges on depreciable real estate owned directly or indirectly. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nLexington presents FFO available to common shareholders and unitholders - basic and also presents FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted on a company-wide basis as if all securities that are convertible, at the holder's option, into Lexington’s common shares, are converted at the beginning of the period. Lexington also presents Adjusted Company FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted which adjusts FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted for certain items which we believe are not indicative of the operating results of Lexington's real estate portfolio. Lexington believes this is an appropriate presentation as it is frequently requested by security analysts, investors and other interested parties. Since others do not calculate these measures in a similar fashion, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by others. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of Lexington’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nGAAP and Cash Yield or Capitalization Rate: GAAP and cash yields or capitalization rates are measures of operating performance used to evaluate the individual performance of an investment. These measures are estimates and are not presented or intended to be viewed as a liquidity or performance measure that present a numerical measure of Lexington's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows. The yield or capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the annualized NOI (as defined below, except GAAP rent adjustments are added back to rental income to calculate GAAP yield or capitalization rate) the investment is expected to generate (or has generated) divided by the acquisition/completion cost (or sale) price.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”): NOI is a measure of operating performance used to evaluate the individual performance of an investment. This measure is not presented or intended to be viewed as a liquidity or performance measure that presents a numerical measure of Lexington's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows. Lexington defines NOI as operating revenues (rental income (less GAAP rent adjustments and lease termination income), tenant reimbursements and other property income) less property operating expenses. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, Lexington's NOI may not be comparable to other companies. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expenses, other nonproperty income and losses, and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing a perspective on operations not immediately apparent from net income. Lexington believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.\nLEXINGTON REALTY TRUST AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited and in thousands, except share and per share data) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Gross revenues: Rental $ 94,522 $ 88,654 Tenant reimbursements 8,115 7,445 Total gross revenues 102,637 96,099 Expense applicable to revenues: Depreciation and amortization (46,537 ) (42,891 ) Property operating (11,477 ) (12,116 ) General and administrative (8,996 ) (9,457 ) Non-operating income 546 2,621 Interest and amortization expense (20,331 ) (19,725 ) Impairment charges and loan loss (53,049 ) (7,992 ) Gains on sales of properties 22,774 34,193 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes and equity in earnings of non-consolidated entities (14,433 ) 40,732 Provision for income taxes (503 ) (422 ) Equity in earnings of non-consolidated entities 113 1,910 Net income (loss) (14,823 ) 42,220 Less net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 508 (180 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Lexington Realty Trust shareholders (14,315 ) 42,040 Dividends attributable to preferred shares – Series C (1,572 ) (1,572 ) Allocation to participating securities (70 ) (71 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders $ (15,957 ) $ 40,397 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders - per common share basic $ (0.07 ) $ 0.17 Weighted-average common shares outstanding – basic 238,072,081 237,179,526 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders - per common share diluted $ (0.07 ) $ 0.17 Weighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted 238,072,081 241,088,049\nLEXINGTON REALTY TRUST AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited and in thousands, except share and per share data) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Assets: Real estate, at cost $ 3,792,977 $ 3,936,459 Real estate - intangible assets 564,947 599,091 4,357,924 4,535,550 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization 1,179,078 1,225,650 Real estate, net 3,178,846 3,309,900 Assets held for sale — 2,827 Cash and cash equivalents 90,214 107,762 Restricted cash 7,479 4,394 Investment in and advances to non-consolidated entities 17,485 17,476 Deferred expenses, net 30,098 31,693 Rent receivable – current 5,878 5,450 Rent receivable – deferred 56,038 52,769 Other assets 25,958 20,749 Total assets $ 3,411,996 $ 3,553,020 Liabilities and Equity: Liabilities: Mortgages and notes payable, net $ 682,994 $ 689,810 Revolving credit facility borrowings 100,000 160,000 Term loans payable, net 596,957 596,663 Senior notes payable, net 495,407 495,198 Trust preferred securities, net 127,221 127,196 Dividends payable 48,438 49,504 Accounts payable and other liabilities 27,284 38,644 Accrued interest payable 11,051 5,378 Deferred revenue - including below market leases, net 32,130 33,182 Prepaid rent 16,130 16,610 Total liabilities 2,137,612 2,212,185 Commitments and contingencies Equity: Preferred shares, par value $0.0001 per share;
