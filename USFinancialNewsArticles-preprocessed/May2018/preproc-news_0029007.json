The next day, Longfin CEO Meenavalli stated that the company would file its 10-K within three days; however, no such filing was made by then or during trading on April 2, 2018.\nOn this event, the price of Longfin’s shares plummeted.\nAbout ClaimsFiler\nClaimsFiler has a single mission: to serve as the information source to help retail investors recover their share of billions of dollars from securities class action settlements.
