    "text": "SINGAPORE, May 17 (Reuters) - Singapore Telecommunications Ltd on Thursday reported a 19 percent fall in its fourth-quarter net profit, hurt by lower contributions from its regional associates in Indonesia and India as well as adverse currency movements.\nSingtel, Southeast Asia’s largest telecom operator, posted net profit of S$781 million ($583 million) for the three months ended in March, compared with S$963 million a year ago. Underlying net profit, which excludes one-time items, fell nearly 18 percent to S$807 million.\nIt forecast consolidated revenue to grow by low single digits and EBITDA to remain stable for the year ending March 2019.\nSingtel owns stakes in a number of regional telecom operators including India’s Bharti Airtel, whose earnings were hit by intense competition. Another regional associate, Indonesia’s Telkomsel, was hurt by a decline in voice and SMS revenues and slower data growth, Singtel said.\nThe company posted record full-year net profit of S$5.45 billion, including a gain on the divestment of its stake in broadband unit NetLink NBN Trust. Analysts had expected, on average, net income of S$4.87 billion.\n$1 = 1.3398 Singapore dollars Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
