In the fiscal year to date, it has risen to 13% versus 0% in the comparable year-ago period.\nDeliveries of a key beryllium-aluminum product to a commercial customer in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector were 66% higher in the quarter sequentially, and 35% higher YOY.\nOrder bookings in the Copper Alloys division were off 5% sequentially but up 29% YOY.\nAs announced on May 12, 2018, IBC was awarded by Lockheed Martin a new 3-year contract valued at a minimum of $7.8 million to manufacture a key beryllium-aluminum component for the F-35 Lightning II.\nFRANKLIN, Ind., May 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IBC Advanced Alloys Corp. (“ IBC ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX-V:IB) (OTCQB: IAALF) announces its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which is the Company’s third fiscal quarter of 2018.\nThe Company swung to operating profitability for the first time since the quarter ended on June 30, 2008, posting increased sales, higher gross profit, and expanded gross margins. The Company’s improved performance was driven by stronger order bookings and improved productivity enabled by previous capital equipment upgrades.\n“IBC had an excellent quarter thanks to the hard work of our employees and focus on reducing costs and improving gross margins,” said IBC President and CEO Duncan Heinz (USMC, ret.). “Achieving operational profitability was a key goal for the Company. Further, once we absorb the fundraising expenses we have incurred in the current quarter, I expect continued significant improvement in many areas of operations in the next 12 months, as we look to strengthen our ability to serve a growing customer base as well as look to capitalize on opportunities in existing and new markets.”\nThe Company posted a 9.7% increase in year-on-year sales for the quarter, with Engineered Materials division sales up 18% and Copper Alloys division sales 6.8% higher. Over the nine months of its fiscal year 2018 to date, IBC’s consolidated sales rose 23% to $14 million compared to the year-ago period sales of $11.5 million. Copper Alloy division sales rose 13.6% and Engineered Materials sales jumped 52.8%.\nThe Company swung to an operating profit of $62,000 ($0.00 per share) on total revenue of $5.1 million. That compares to a loss in the year-ago period of $707,000 ($0.02/share) on revenue of $4.7 million and a sequential quarterly loss of $402,000 ($0.01/share) on revenue of $4.7 million. The Company cut its losses in the nine months of fiscal year 2018 by 70% to $942,000, compared a comparable year-ago period loss of $3.2 million.\nThe Company’s consolidated gross margin rose 280% in the quarter to 19%, as compared to a 5% gross margin in the comparable year-ago period. The Company’s nine months of fiscal year 2018 gross margin turned to a positive 13% from a gross margin of 0% in the comparable year-ago period.\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SGA”) expenses in the quarter remained relatively flat from the year-ago quarter and have been reduced by 15.0% over the nine months of fiscal year 2018, compared to the comparable year-ago period.\nFISCAL Q3-2018 SEGMENT AND CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS RESULTS\nA summary of the Company’s results, on a consolidated and segment-by-segment basis, of operations to loss before other items (“operating income (loss)”) follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nCopper\nAlloys\n$ Eng.\nMat.\n$ Corp.\n$ Consol-\nidated\n$ Copper\nAlloys\n$ Eng.\nMat.\n$ Corp.\n$ Consol-\nidated\n$ Sales 3,714 1,435 - 5,149 3,479 1,216 - 4,695 Cost of sales Materials 1,798 247 - 2,045 1,854 155 - 2,009 Labor 534 318 - 852 518 322 - 840 Subcontract 194 46 - 240 438 162 - 600 Overhead 484 410 - 894 447 384 - 831 Depreciation 95 100 - 195 91 83 - 174 Change in finished goods (19) (34) - (53) (154) 173 - 19 3,086 1,087 - 4,173 3,194 1,279 - 4,473 Gross profit (loss) 628 348 - 976 285 (63) - 222 SG&A expenses 406 260 188 854 386 241 230 857 Operating\nincome (loss)\n222\n88 (188) 122 (101\n) (304) (230) (635) Gross margin 17 % 24% - 19% 8 % (5%) - 5% Consolidated operations highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include the following:\nSales revenue increased by 9.7%, to $5.1 million from $4.7 million; Gross profit increased by 340% to $976,000 from $222,000; Operating loss improved by 119% to income of $122,000 from a loss of $635,000; and Gross margin increased 280%, moving to 19% from 5%.\nCopper Alloy division highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include the following:\nSales revenue increased by 6.8% to $3.7 million from $3.5 million; Gross profit increased 120% to $627,000 from $285,000; Operating profit/loss improved to income of $222,000 from a loss of $101,000; March 2018 quarterly order bookings decreased 3.8% to $3.1 million from $3.2 million; and Gross margin increased 113% improving to 17% from 8%.\nEngineered Materials division highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include the following:\nSales revenue increased by 18% to $1.4 million from $1.2 million; Gross profit swung to a positive $348,000 from a loss of $63,000; Operating loss improved by 129% to income of $88,000 from a loss of $304,000; and Gross margin shifted to a positive 24% from a negative 5%.\nFISCAL YEAR-TO-DATE SEGMENT AND CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nA summary of IBC’s results of operations to loss before other items (“operating income (loss)”) for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 follows:\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nCopper\nAlloys\n$ Eng.\nMat.\n$ Corp.\n$ Consol-\nidated\n$ Copper\nAlloys\n$ Eng.\nMat.\n$ Corp.\n$ Consol-\nidated\n$ Sales 9,956 4,219 - 14,175 8,767 2,762 - 11,529 Cost of sales Materials 4,883 839 - 5,722 4,510 664 - 5,174 Labor 1,634 923 - 2,557 1,649 850 - 2,499 Subcontract 261 132 - 393 438 162 - 600 Overhead 1,605 1,238 - 2,843 1,346 1,133 - 2,479 Depreciation 281 299 - 580 384 248 - 632 Change in finished goods (7) 207 - 200 (152) 273 - 121 8,657 3,638 - 12,295 8,175 3,330 - 11,505 Gross profit (loss) 1,299 581 - 1,880 592 (568) - 24 SG&A expenses 1,336 714 544 2,594 1,229 691 1,136 3,056 Operating\nincome (loss) (37) (133) (544) (714) (637) (1,259) (1,136) (3,032) Gross margin 13% 14% - 13% 7% (21%) - 0% For more information on IBC and its innovative alloy products, go here .\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors:\n\"Duncan Heinz”\nDuncan Heinz, President, CEO and Director\nContact:\nJim Sims, Investor and Public Relations\nIBC Advanced Alloys Corp.\n+1 (303) 503-6203\nEmail: jim.sims@ibcadvancedalloys.com\nWebsite: www.ibcadvancedalloys.com\n@IBCAdvanced $IB $IAALF\nAbout IBC Advanced Alloys Corp.\nIBC is a leading beryllium and copper advanced alloys company serving a variety of industries such as defense, aerospace, automotive, telecommunications, precision manufacturing, and others.
