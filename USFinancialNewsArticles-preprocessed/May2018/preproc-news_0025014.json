Survivors sit outside their destroyed house after a dam burst, which unleashed water at nearby homes, in Solio town near Nakuru, Kenya May 10, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya\n“So far it is 47 dead. We are still on the ground,” Japheth Kioko, the police chief for Rongai division, told Reuters by telephone. Reporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Ed Cropley",
