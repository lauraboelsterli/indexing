(NASDAQ:KOOL), a market leader in automated cell processing and point-of-care, autologous cell-based therapies, today announced the pricing of its public offering of 9,166,667 units (the “Units”), with each Unit consisting of one common share, $0.001 par value (the “Common Shares”) or Common Share equivalent and one common warrant to purchase one Common Share (the “Warrants”). Cesca is offering the Units at a price of $0.60 per Unit.\nH.C.
