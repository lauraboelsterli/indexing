    "text": "1 Hour Ago | 02:24\nTesla's move to shut down production of its Model 3 for six days is a \"big deal\" but it's not necessarily a bad thing, tech analyst turned venture capitalist Gene Munster told CNBC on Tuesday.\nThe electric automaker plans to pause production at its California factory at the end of Ma y to work on fixes to its assembly line, sources inside the company told Reuters.\n\"This manufacturing shutdown is evidence that things are moving in a good direction,\" Munster said on \" Closing Bell. \" VCG/VCG | Getty Images A Tesla Model 3 car is on display during the Auto China 2018 at China International Exhibition Center on April 25, 2018 in Beijing, China.\nTesla had previously warned of 10 days of temporary shutdowns this quarter to address issues that have delayed volume production of its new Model 3 sedan.\nMunster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, explained that Tesla's desire to re-engineer the manufacturing process requires the shutdown. However, he said he is \"delighted\" about the new technology it plans to implement, which he called \"a whole new paradigm around manufacturing.\"\nMeanwhile, Munster is also not concerned about the recent management shakeup at Tesla. Tech\nOn Monday, CEO Elon Musk told employees that the company plans to \"flatten\" its structure as it works to improve communication and trim activities \"that are not vital\" to its success.\n\"Elon Musk has been very deliberate at stepping in and taking more control of company in the last few weeks,\" Munster said, pointing out that Musk sees the next three months as \"critical window\" for Tesla's success.\n\"I'm comfortable that they are moving things in a good direction,\" he said.\nâ€”CNBC's Robert Ferris and Reuters contributed to this report.",
