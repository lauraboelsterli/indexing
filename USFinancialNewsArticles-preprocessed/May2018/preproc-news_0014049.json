    "text": "38 COMMENTS When Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone saw Sen. Bernie Sanders’s rallies on TV during the 2016 presidential campaign, he was shocked by the number of young people there. It troubled him that they were so enthusiastic for higher taxes and spending and an expanded government role in health care, child care and higher education. “If these kids are moving up in our system now, we’re in trouble,” he recalls thinking.\nMr. Langone decided that capitalism needed a full-throated defense. To make the case, he has written a book, part memoir and part free-market manifesto, called “I Love Capitalism.”\nMr. Langone, 82, sees himself as a capitalist success story. The Long Island-born son of first-generation Italian-Americans, he co-founded Home Depot in 1978 and has sold other companies he helped to found for hundreds of millions of dollars, serving along the way on such high-profile corporate boards as General Electric and Yum Brands . Forbes estimates that his net worth is over $3 billion.\n“Show me where the silver spoon was in my mouth,” he writes. “I’ve got to argue profoundly and passionately: I’m the American Dream.”\nHis book recounts his rise from modest roots. His father was a plumber and his mother a cafeteria worker. Mr. Langone worked odd jobs during high school, caddying and digging ditches. With savings and his parents’ help, he attended Bucknell University, where he majored in economics and political science.\nAfter graduating, he sought work on Wall Street, but he says that his blue-collar Italian background prevented him from landing a job at the top firms. Instead he took an analyst job in the investment department at Equitable Life Insurance Society, an insurance firm, while serving in the Army and going to business school at night.\nHe held out hope of working on Wall Street and eventually landed a sales job at a small firm called R.W. Pressprich. The first initial public offering he worked on was Ross Perot’s Electronic Data Systems. He worked his way up to become president at R.W. Pressprich, then left in 1974 to start his own investment firm, Invemed Associates.\nThrough Invemed, he helped to finance and co-found Home Depot. It went public in 1981. Today it is one of the country’s largest retailers, with over 400,000 employees and a market capitalization of over $210 billion. He remains one of the company’s largest shareholders.\nMore Weekend Confidential\nAn Aspiring Actor’s Improbable Journey From War-Torn Congo April 27, 2018 At 90, Mary Higgins Clark Is Still Cranking Out Page-Turners April 20, 2018 Business Is a Family Affair for Subway’s Suzanne Greco April 14, 2018 Those successes have fueled his belief in capitalism. Private ownership incentivizes people to create businesses that then grow and create jobs for others, he argues. “When capitalism works the way it should, it works for everybody,” he writes.\nHe worries that some young people think that the U.S. “should be headed, toward something that, in my mind, resembles socialism: Guaranteed income. Free college tuition. Single-payer health care,” he writes. “I disagree. Strongly.” He argues that such policies discourage people from bettering themselves. “I disagree with socialism not (as you might believe) because I’m a rich guy trying to hold on to my money,” he writes. “I disagree because socialism is based on the false notion that we should all be exactly equal in every single way.”\nHe does believe that income inequality is a problem in the U.S., but he doesn’t blame capitalism. “I don’t have a magic solution,” he says. While he’s supported Home Depot’s practice of paying above the minimum wage, he’s not sure the law should raise it for all employers. “I do know that nobody can live on $20,000 a year,” he writes. “But I worry that mandating a higher minimum might hurt the people you want to try to help: the more you increase the costs of any factor of production, the more incentive you give owners to figure out a way to change that factor of production,” and possibly automate it, cutting jobs.\nAnd he welcomes at least some role for government. “You need cops, you need the military, and you need infrastructure,” he says. He also believes that capitalism’s beneficiaries should give back, and that it’s a failing when they don’t. He estimates that he spends 70% of his time on philanthropy now. New York University’s Medical Center bears his and his wife’s names after they gave it $200 million in 2008.\nHis strong belief in capitalist rewards famously drew fire back in 2003 for his role while head of the New York Stock Exchange’s compensation committee in awarding former NYSE chief Richard Grasso a $140 million pay package. Then and now, Mr. Langone stands by his decision. “Dick Grasso, who’d begun as a unionized clerk, had the motivation to stay on and become president of the NYSE and in 1995 be elected chairman and CEO,” he writes. “He was compensated appropriately, and his pension grew proportionally.”\nToday, Mr. Langone lives with his wife, Elaine, on Long Island and has homes in Manhattan, North Carolina and Florida. He spends his down time playing golf, reading and doing investment analysis, which he considers exciting enough to be a hobby.\nHe says he still enjoys simple pleasures—among his favorite foods are bagels, pasta and meatloaf—but acknowledges, “I like all the trappings of success absolutely.”\n“I have custom-made suits and airplanes, and I have businesses... and I have guys that make paintings for me,” he says, pointing to a LeRoy Neiman painting of the New York Stock Exchange on his conference room’s wall. “But I’d also like to think if it didn’t happen, I’d still be OK.”\nWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com",
