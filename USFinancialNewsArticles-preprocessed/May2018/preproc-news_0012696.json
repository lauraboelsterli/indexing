    "text": "10:32 AM EDT\nNASA successfully launched its InSight lander Saturday, setting off its mission to Mars .\nThe InSight lander – short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport – is set to arrive on Mars in November 2018. It was launched attached to the Atlas V rocket from the Space Launch Complex 3 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California before it later detached to make its way over to the Red Planet. LIFTOFF! Humanity’s next mission to Mars has left the pad! @NASAInSight heads into space for a ~6 month journey to Mars where it will take the planet’s vital signs and help us understand how rocky planets formed.

InSight will explore more of Mars than has ever been studied before. InSight will dig close to 16 feet into the surface of Mars to study the planet’s temperature. It will also take the first measurements of marsquakes. The Atlas V rocket also brought on two mini satellites that will follow the InSight on its mission. NASA's InSight lander just hitched a ride to Mars on an Atlas V rocket; the first interplanetary mission to leave from California.

Check out my ride. It's lit! Don’t forget to set your clocks and tune in to @NASA TV starting at 3:30 a.m. PT tomorrow, May 5. https://t.co/DZ8GsDTfGc pic.twitter.com/tSg65rWUgj\n— NASAInSight (@NASAInSight) May 5, 2018 I can’t think of a better way to start my day! @NASA is making history during today’s launch of @NASAInSight – the first spacecraft to launch to another planet from the West Coast. We’re going to Mars!
