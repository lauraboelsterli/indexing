    "text": "May 29, 2018 / 2:57 PM / Updated 43 minutes ago 3D printer maker Stratasys loses CEO, shares vacillate Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nMay 29 (Reuters) - Shares in 3D printer maker Stratasys Ltd recovered to trade up 1 percent on Tuesday after plunging initially on the news that Ilan Levin was stepping down as both a director and chief executive officer.\nIn a statement before markets opened in New York, the company said Elchanan Jaglom, currently chairman of the board, would serve as CEO until a successor is appointed.\nThe Minnesota-based company, whose shares have lost more than a third of their value in the past year, did not disclose the reason behind Levinâ€™s resignation and was not immediately available for comment.\nShares of the company fell about 7 percent in premarket trade but recovered to gain 1.1 percent on the day at $19.21 an hour after opening.\nStratasys, which offers desktop 3D printers and prototyping systems for manufacturing, earlier this month reported quarterly revenue and profit which missed Wall Street estimates as it battled a drop in demand from customers in government, aerospace and the automotive sector.
