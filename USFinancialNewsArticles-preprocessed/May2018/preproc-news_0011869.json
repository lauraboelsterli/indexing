    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 10:07 PM / Updated 4 hours ago North Korea's Kim tells China he is committed to denuclearisation Ben Blanchard 4 Min Read\nBEIJING (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting Chinese diplomat on Thursday that he is committed to denuclearisation, China’s foreign ministry said, as diplomatic efforts to bring lasting peace to the Korean peninsula gather pace.\nChina is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite its anger at North Korea’ repeated nuclear and missile tests, and its support for strong U.N. sanctions against the North.\nHowever, China has also welcomed moves by North Korea to improve ties with South Korea and the United States.\nThe Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, is visiting North Korea following last week’s historic meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North’s Kim Jong Un, when both pledged to improve ties.\nThe North surprised the world several days before the summit by declaring it would dismantle its nuclear test site to “transparently guarantee” its dramatic commitment to stop all nuclear and missile tests.\nMeeting in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, Kim told Wang that recent positive changes on the peninsula were beneficial to a peaceful resolution, China’s foreign ministry\n“Kim Jong Un said achieving the denuclearisation of the peninsula is the firm position of the North Korean side,” the ministry said.\nWang told Kim that North Korea had seized the day and made a decisive decision, bringing positive changes.\nLast week’s summit talks between the leaders of the two Koreans had brought about an opportunity for a political resolution, Wang added.\nChina supported an end to the state of war on the peninsula, North Korea’s shift to economic development and the resolution of North Korea’s legitimate security concerns during the denuclearisation process, he said.\n“China is willing to maintain communication with North Korea on this and increase coordination.”\nThe 1950-53 Korean War, which technically is still going on because a peace treaty has yet to be signed.

Korea Summit Press Pool/Pool via Reuters/Files\nWang also met North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho. ‘POSITIVE ROLE’\nIn an earlier statement, he said China hoped dialogue between North Korea and the United States would be successful and that substantial progress would be made, referring to an upcoming meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.\n“China is willing to strengthen communication with North Korea and continue to play a positive role in seeking a political solution to the Korean peninsula issue,” Wang said.\nSouth Korea’s presidential official said high-level inter-Korean talks would be held in mid-May to work on implementing the agreement reached by Kim and Moon.\nNorth Korea’s Kim said at last week’s summit that he would discuss details of denuclearisation at the North Korea-U.S. summit, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said, citing South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon.\nChina had largely sat on the sidelines while the two Koreas improved ties, until Kim made a secretive trip to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in late March.\nBeijing has been keen to show that it has an indispensable role to play in seeking a lasting solution, concerned that its interests may be ignored, especially as Pyongyang and Washington edge closer together.\nThe widely read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial any suggestion China was being marginalised “is a shallow attempt to manipulate public opinion”.\nChina preferred quieter diplomacy, it said, pointing to the secrecy surrounding Kim’s meeting with Xi.

U.S. President Donald Trump has started claiming credit for the Kim-Trump summit before it even starts,” it said.
