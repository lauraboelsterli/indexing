    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., May 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Propel Media, Inc. (OTCPink:PROM), a performance focused digital media and advertising company, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company achieved revenue of $20.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nPerformance Highlights for the First Quarter 2018:\nRevenue of $20.9 million, which represents an increase of 12% as compared to $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 Gross margin of 73%, which represents an increase of 17% as compared to 63% in the first quarter of 2017 Operating income of $8.1 million, which represents an increase of 20% as compared to $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million, which represents an increase of 24% as compared to $7.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 DeepIntent, the integrated data and programmatic buying platform which the Company acquired in June of 2017, continues to focus on delivering high-value campaigns for pharma and healthcare clients, as well as several other key initiatives.\n“The Company’s first quarter performance was excellent. The business performed well, and we were able to reduce our user acquisition spend which, in turn, increased our gross margins. In addition, we continued to focus on building out DeepIntent’s product offerings and sales pipeline, particularly in the pharma vertical. Finally, last week, with payments of $4.4 million, we were able to fully satisfy what had been $18.5 million of future obligations, which better positions us as we move to the next steps in our plan to refinance our term and revolving loans” said Marv Tseu, Chief Executive Officer of Propel Media.\nFurther details concerning the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 is set forth in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 14, 2018.\nAbout Propel Media\nPropel Media connects digital marketers with unique audiences through intent-based technology that delivers superior performance with measurable results. We “Do Digital Differently” with a distinctive approach to digital powered by proprietary contextualization technology and a unique supply of ad inventory.

These statements may be identified, without limitation, by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates”, “expects,” “will” or comparable terms or the negative thereof. Such statements are based on management’s current estimates, assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data as of the date hereof. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of events, factors and conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Propel Media and not all of which are known to Propel Media, including, without limitation those risk factors described from time to time in Propel Media’s reports filed with the SEC. Among the factors that could cause Propel Media’s actual results to differ materially are: loss of key advertising customers; inability to acquire new advertising customers; limitations on its ability to acquire new users profitably or at all; inability to protect its intellectual property; inability to comply with the covenants in its credit facility; inability to obtain necessary financing or enter into equity arrangements with existing or new institutional shareholders; inability to execute its acquisition strategy; inability to effectively manage its growth; failure to effectively integrate the operations of acquired businesses; competition; loss of key personnel; increases in costs of operations; continued compliance with government regulations; and general economic conditions. Further, investors should keep in mind that Propel Media’s financial results in any particular period may not be indicative of future results. Propel Media is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise, except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, which is based upon the adjusted EBITDA which we report to our lenders, is a key measurement monitored by management, and is determined by taking net (loss) income (the nearest GAAP measure) and adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, stock based compensation, bank fees, losses from extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring items, noncash items, merger and other onetime expenses and severance. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measure presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the table following the financial statements attached to this press release.\nPropel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets As of March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Assets (unaudited) Current assets Cash $ 8,764,000 $ 5,081,000 Accounts receivable, net 7,418,000 9,502,000 Prepaid expenses & other current assets 975,000 1,157,000 Total current assets 17,157,000 15,740,000 Property and equipment, net 3,658,000 3,315,000 Intangible assets 1,135,000 1,201,000 Goodwill 6,028,000 6,028,000 Deferred tax assets, net 18,807,000 18,932,000 Other assets 138,000 137,000 Total assets $ 46,923,000 $ 45,353,000 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Deficit Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 2,494,000 $ 4,419,000 Accrued expenses 4,867,000 4,252,000 Advertiser deposits 1,444,000 2,137,000 Current portion of long-term debt 66,095,000 6,181,000 Current portion of obligations to transferors 5,522,000 - Total current liabilities 80,422,000 16,989,000 Long-term debt, less current portion, net - 60,725,000 Obligations to transferors, less curent portion, net 9,846,000 15,203,000 Total liabilities 90,268,000 92,917,000 Stockholders' Deficit Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value, authorized 1,000,000 shares, - - no shares issued or outstanding Common Stock, $0.0001 par value, authorized 500,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 250,010,162 at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 25,000 25,000 Additional paid-in capital 3,964,000 3,717,000 Accumulated deficit (47,334,000 ) (51,306,000 ) Total stockholders’ deficit (43,345,000 ) (47,564,000 ) Total liabilities and stockholders' deficit $ 46,923,000 $ 45,353,000\nPropel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 20,920,000 $ 18,632,000 Cost of revenues 5,562,000 6,933,000 Gross profit 15,358,000 11,699,000 Operating expenses: Salaries, commissions, benefits and related expenses 4,245,000 3,085,000 Technology, development and maintenance 1,577,000 817,000 Marketing and promotional 90,000 17,000 General and administrative 510,000 353,000 Professional services 421,000 276,000 Depreciation and amortization 462,000 397,000 Impairment of software and video library - 20,000 Operating expenses 7,305,000 4,965,000 Operating income 8,053,000 6,734,000 Other expense: Interest expense, net (2,824,000 ) (2,911,000 ) Total other expense (2,824,000 ) (2,911,000 ) Income before income tax expense 5,229,000 3,823,000 Income tax expense (1,257,000 ) (1,425,000 ) Net income $ 3,972,000 $ 2,398,000 Net income per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.02 $ 0.01 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 250,010,162 250,010,162\nPropel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Information (Unaudited) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net income $ 3,972,000 $ 2,398,000 Depreciation and amortization 462,000 397,000 Impairment charges - 20,000 Interest expense 2,824,000 2,911,000 Stock-based compensation expense 247,000 229,000 Taxes 1,263,000 1,427,000 Bank fees 26,000 27,000 Amortization of DeepIntent deferred purchase price 238,000 - Other one-time expenses 160,000 - Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) $ 9,192,000 $ 7,409,000 Press Contact:\nDavid Shapiro\nPropel Media\npress@propelmedia.com\nSource:Propel Media",
