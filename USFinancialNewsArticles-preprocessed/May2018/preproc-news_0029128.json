    "text": "Q4: 19.3 percent\nSource: Thomson Reuters\n3. Inflation remains moderate. Today's 10-year Treasury auction kept 10-year yields at 3 percent. April's Producer Price Index, a measure of inflation at the wholesale level, saw core prices (excluding food, energy and trade) well within expectations, despite somewhat higher costs for some commodities: Core PPI\n(YOY, less food, energy, trade)\nApril: 2.5 percent\nFeb.: 2.7 percent\nJan.: 2.5 percent\nIt's not just the S&P 500 that is breaking out of a downtrend. Sectors that were market leaders earlier in the year — semiconductors, banks, consumer discretionary and FAANG stocks — are also showing improving trading patterns.\nCommodity price inflation remains a concern, but many companies have discussed passing on the higher prices or improving productivity. Companies in those sectors that are having trouble doing either, like consumer staples, are facing margin erosion and are being discounted.\nWhat's missing is more volume on days when the market is up. The highest volume days of the year have all been on big down days, none of the big up days has seen heavy volume.\nFinally, here's an important point: Breaking out of a downtrend does not mean we are in a convincing uptrend. Sideways may be the most likely trade as we hit very notable seasonal patterns (sell in May, mid-term elections).\nOne data point to watch: The small-cap Russell 2000 is 1 percent from breaking out to a historic high. The number to beat is 1,615, which it hit on Jan. 24 this year. Bob ",
