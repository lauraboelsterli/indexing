REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo\n“Every euro that we invest in Erasmus is an investment in our future,” Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said of the scheme that allows university students to spend a year studying in another EU member state.\n“It is the very essence of a borderless Europe,” he added.\nThe proposal, which requires the approval of member states, would triple the number of participants to 12 million in the next seven-year period and would expand it to youth workers, school pupils, trainees and sports coaches.
