    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 1:40 PM / Updated an hour ago Mexico rejects Trump's comments that some immigrants are 'animals' Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Thursday that recent remarks by U.S. President Donald Trump describing some unauthorized immigrants as “animals” were absolutely unacceptable, and that a formal complaint would be filed with the State Department.\n“President Trump referred to some immigrants, perhaps he had criminal gangs in mind, I don’t know, as animals, not as persons,” Videgaray said in an interview with local TV station Televisa.\n“In the opinion of the Mexican government this is absolutely unacceptable and we are going to formally communicate this to the U.S. State Department today,” he said.\nTrump made the remarks during a White House meeting on Wednesday, according to several media reports.
