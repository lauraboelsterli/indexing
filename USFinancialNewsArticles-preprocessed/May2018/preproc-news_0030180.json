    "text": "ADEN, May 13 (Reuters) - Yemen’s Aden refinery is seeking 150,000 tonnes of oil products for the local market in two separate tenders, the state news agency SABA said on Sunday.\nThe refinery is seeking 30,000 tonnes of unleaded petrol and 30,000 tonnes of diesel in its first tender, as fuel supplies ran low because of Yemen’s civil war.\nAden refinery is also seeking 60,000 tonnes of petrol and 30,000 tonnes of heating oil for electricity generation in Aden in its second tender.\nThe document stated that offers should be presented in U.S. dollars with a deadline of May 21.
