    "text": "Reblog Co. has suspended F-150 production at two assembly plants after a fire last week at one of its supplierâ€™s facilities created a parts shortage. The Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker said Wednesday it is working to offset U.S. production losses as the shortage of die-cast components has affected the manufacture of F-150 and Super Duty vehicles. Ford halted F-150 production at its Kansas City, Mo., assembly plant, and will suspend production at a Dearborn plant, at the end of the afternoon shift Wednesday.",
