    "text": "WINNIPEG, May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Medicure Inc. (\" Medicure \" or the \" Company \") (TSXV:MPH, OTC:MCUJF), a cardiovascular pharmaceutical company, today reported its results from operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Highlights:\nRecorded net revenue from the sale of AGGRASTAT ® (tirofiban hydrochloride) of $27.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 1 for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.6 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; and Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43.4 million, which includes the gain on the sale of the Apicore business which occurred in October 2017, compared to net income of $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Results\nNet revenues from AGGRASTAT ® for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $27.1 million compared to $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $5.0 million compared to $7.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company recorded a restatement to its 2016 revenues, adjusted EBITDA and net income reducing those amounts by $674,833 and increasing accounts payable and accrued liabilities by the corresponding amount pertaining to an additional accrual for product discounts required at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company continues to experience an increase in patient market share held by the product and an increase in the number of new hospital customers using AGGRASTAT ® leading to the highest hospital demand for AGGRASTAT ® in the Company's history. Although, there was an increase in use of AGGRASTAT ® , the lower net income was largely due to a stronger Canadian dollar compared to its US counterpart and increased competitive pricing of generic Integrilin.\nMedicure continues to focus on expanding the customer base for AGGRASTAT ® and diversification of revenues with the acquisition of additional cardiovascular drugs for the US market, such as the recently launched ZYPITAMAG TM (pitavastatin).\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.6 million compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA for the year is the result of the lower revenues which were due primarily to lower discounted prices for AGGRASTAT ® and a higher Canadian dollar. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was negative $0.6 million compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43.4 million or $2.78 per share which includes income of $11.5 million or $0.74 per share from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations of $31.9 million or $2.04 per share, which includes the operations of Apicore and the gain on the sale of the Apicore business. This compares to net income of $27.0 million or $1.80 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $51.5 million or $3.27 per share primarily relating to the gain on the sale of the Apicore business compared to net income of $23.8 million or $1.53 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had unrestricted cash totaling $5.3 million compared to $12.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash is due to higher interest payments made during the year relating to the debt obtained in November 2016 and the acquisition of additional common shares of Apicore during the period, as well as the repayment of the Company's long-term debt from the proceeds of the sale of the Apicore business. Cash from operating activities of approximately $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2017, which were settled subsequent to year end.\nAll amounts referenced herein are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.\nNotes\n(1) The Company defines EBITDA as \"earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other income or expense\" and Adjusted EBITDA as \"EBITDA adjusted for non-cash and one-time items\". The terms \"EBITDA\" and \"Adjusted EBITDA\", as it relates to the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 results prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), do not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS. It is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nConference Call Info:\nTopic: Medicure's Fiscal Year End 2017 Results\nCall date: Wednesday, May 2, 2018\nTime: 7:00 AM Central Time (8:00 AM Eastern Time)\nCanada toll-free: 1 (888) 465-5079 Canada toll: 1 (416) 216-4169\nUnited States toll-free: 1 (888) 545-0687\nPasscode: 6477570#\nWebcast: This conference call will be webcast live over the internet and can be accessed from the Medicure investor relations page at the following link: http://www.medicure.com/investors.html\nYou may request international country-specific access information by e-mailing the Company in advance.
