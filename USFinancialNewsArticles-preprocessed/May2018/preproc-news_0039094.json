    "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Kuwait’s U.N. Ambassador Mansour al-Otaibi said on Tuesday he would propose a draft United Nations Security Council resolution on “protection of the Palestinian civilians,” though he added “we’re not talking about peacekeeping.”\nSpeaking ahead of a Security Council meeting on recent violence in Gaza, al-Otaibi told reporters he would likely circulate the draft resolution to the 15-member council on Wednesday. It was unclear when it could be put to a vote.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. ",
