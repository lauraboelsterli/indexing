When the tender offer expires, AbbVie will determine the lowest price within the range of prices specified above that allows AbbVie to purchase up to an aggregate of $7.5 billion of its common stock.\nTo tender AbbVie shares, stockholders must follow the instructions described in the \"Offer to Purchase\" and the \"Letter of Transmittal\" that are being filed by AbbVie with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents contain important information about the terms and conditions of the tender offer. All shares purchased by AbbVie will be purchased at the same price, in cash and subject to applicable withholding and without interest. All shares tendered at prices higher than the purchase price determined by AbbVie will be promptly returned to stockholders at AbbVie's expense.\nThe tender offer and withdrawal rights will expire at midnight Eastern Time, at the end of the day on May 29, 2018, unless extended or terminated by AbbVie.

No person is authorized to make any such recommendation. Stockholders must make their own decision as to whether to tender their shares and, if so, how many shares to tender and the price or prices at which their shares should be tendered. In doing so, stockholders should read carefully the information in, or incorporated by reference in, the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal (as they may be amended or supplemented), including the purposes and effects of the offer.
