    "text": "BOSTON, May 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- 908 Devices, a pioneer of purpose-built analytical devices for chemical and biomolecular analysis, announced the recent appointment of Nicolas Barthelemy to its Board of Directors . Nicolas brings over 25 years of extensive life science expertise to the company, and a long-standing track record in the manufacturing, distribution and commercialization of scientific instrumentation, reagents and services.\nNicolas currently serves on the Board of Directors at Repligen, Fluidigm, Genewiz and Biocare Medical, and is a prior member of Avantor's and Essen Bioscience's Boards. He was previously President and Chief Executive Officer of Biotheranostics, Inc., a molecular diagnostics company he successfully spun off from bioMérieux and recapitalized. Under his leadership, he raised $32M in capital, doubled the company's revenue to $25M, and accelerated its growth rate 4X. Before joining Biotheranostics, Nicolas held positions of Chief Commercial Officer, President of the Cell Systems Division, and other senior executive roles at Life Technologies (formerly Invitrogen) until its acquisition by Thermo Fisher Scientific. In these positions, he made key contributions to the company's rapid $700M to $4B revenue growth over 9 years. For his contributions at Life Technologies, he received the CEO Life Award. Nicolas also brings extensive M&A experience to 908 Devices with involvement in more than 25 acquisitions and divestitures to date.\n\"The breadth and depth of Nicolas' expertise in the research, clinical and bioprocessing markets and his strong background in global commercialization strategy strengthens our life science leadership exponentially,\" said Dr. Kevin J.
