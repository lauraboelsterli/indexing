    "text": "May 4 (Reuters) - China’s iron ore futures fell on Friday, the first day it allowed foreign investors to trade the contract in a bid to boost its sway over pricing for one of its top commodity imports.\nOpening the door to international players is expected to increase trading in the contract, which was launched in 2013 and is already among China’s most liquid derivatives.\nMajor Western traders previously had access to the iron ore contract through local Chinese entities, but Dalian’s decision to internationalise means foreign companies no longer need to set up local Chinese units, opening the door to more market participants.\nThe most actively traded September iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was down 1.7 percent at 469 yuan ($74) a tonne by 0106 GMT.\nThat followed a two-day spike that pushed the contract to its highest level in more than a week on Thursday.
