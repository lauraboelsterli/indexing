    "text": "MILPITAS, Calif., May 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aviat Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVNW), (\"Aviat Networks\" or the \"Company\"), the leading expert in microwave networking solutions, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter and nine-months ended March 30, 2018.\nCommenting on the Company's fiscal 2018 third quarter results and business activity, Michael Pangia, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aviat Networks stated, \"While third quarter results were somewhat mixed, our outlook for the fourth quarter and 2019 fiscal year (\"Fiscal 2019\") remains very strong. We've added new customers, expanded successfully into new verticals and demand for our recently launched products is building. Our private networks business is strong, with new state contracts and new utility accounts on the horizon. Our international business is expected to return to growth, we have added new Tier-1 accounts, we are expanding our addressable market, and we're well-positioned as 5G adoption begins to build steam over the next 12-18 months.\"\nMr. Pangia continued, \"I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program, enabling us to purchase up to $7.5 million of our common stock. Based on our improving outlook and the momentum we have built, we believe our stock represents a compelling investment and we intend to be more active on the investor relations front, while taking steps such as the stock repurchase program, to enhance valuation over the long-term.\"\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Results Comparisons\nThe Company reported total revenues of $62.1 million for its fiscal 2018 third quarter, as compared to $58.7 million in the comparable fiscal 2017 period, an increase of $3.4 million or 5.8%. Revenue in North America increased by $2.6 million or 8.8% and international revenue increased by $0.8 million or 2.8%. On a sequential basis, total revenue increased by $0.4 million or 0.6%.\nGAAP gross margin for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was 29.2%, as compared to 30.2% in the fiscal 2017 third quarter, a decrease of 100 basis points. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was 29.1%, as compared to 30.2% in the fiscal 2017 third quarter, a decrease of 110 basis points. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin were primarily impacted by a change in project mix in North America when comparing the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 third quarter periods.\nGAAP total operating expenses for the fiscal 2018 third quarter were $19.5 million, as compared to $17.7 million reported in the fiscal 2017 third quarter, an increase of $1.8 million or 10.4%. Non-GAAP total operating expenses for the fiscal 2018 third quarter, excluding the impact of share-based compensation and strategic alternative costs, were $19.0 million as compared to $17.0 million reported in the fiscal 2017 third quarter, an increase of $1.9 million or 11.4%. The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were primarily related to the impact of foreign currency conversion, additional expenses associated with research and development and sales to support product development and growth initiatives, as well as a temporary increase in benefit-related costs. The remaining year-over-year variance was primarily related to a bad debt recovery in the fiscal 2017 third quarter which did not repeat in the fiscal 2018 third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency conversion and higher medical expenses, total operating expenses were in line with the Company's prior guidance.\nGAAP operating loss was $1.4 million for the fiscal 2018 third quarter, as compared to operating income of $0.1 million for the comparable fiscal 2017 period. Non-GAAP operating loss was $0.9 million for the fiscal 2018 third quarter as compared to non-GAAP operating income of $0.7 million for the comparable fiscal 2017 period. The Company reported a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or a loss of $0.49 per diluted share, and a non-GAAP loss from continuing operations of $1.4 million, or a loss of $0.26 per diluted share. This compares to a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $0.4 million, or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share for the comparable fiscal 2017 period, and non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks of $0.4 million, or an income of $0.07 per diluted share for the comparable fiscal 2017 period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $0.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million in the comparable fiscal 2017 period.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $38.5 million as of March 30, 2018, as compared to $36.2 million as of June 30, 2017, an improvement of $2.3 million.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 along with the accompanying notes, is provided in Table 3 below.\nFiscal 2018 Nine-Month Results Comparisons\nThe Company reported total revenues of $180.0 million for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period, as compared to $185.4 million in the comparable fiscal 2017 period, a decrease of $5.4 million or 2.9%. As expected, North America revenue increased year-over-year, up $2.6 million or 2.7%, offset by a decline in international revenue of $8.1 million or 9.1%.\nGAAP gross margin for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was 31.8%, as compared to 30.3% in the fiscal 2017 nine-month period, an increase of 150 basis points. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was 31.8%, as compared to 30.5% in the fiscal 2017 period, an increase of 130 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by a favorable mix shift in North America and improved services margins as a result of process improvement initiatives throughout the Company.\nGAAP total operating expenses for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period were $57.0 million, as compared to $56.6 million reported in the fiscal 2017 nine-month period, an increase of $0.5 million or 0.8%. Non-GAAP total operating expenses for both the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 nine-month periods, excluding the impact of share-based compensation and strategic alternative costs, were $54.8 million. Foreign currency conversion, when comparing the fiscal 2018 and 2017 nine-month periods, adversely impacted GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses. Additionally, consistent with the Company's strategy, both sales and research and development expenses were up for the comparable fiscal 2018 and 2017 nine-month periods, offset by continued reductions in general and administrative expenses through ongoing cost controls.\nGAAP operating income for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $0.3 million, as compared to a GAAP operating loss of $0.3 million in the fiscal 2017 period, an improvement of $0.6 million. Non-GAAP operating income for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $2.3 million, as compared to non-GAAP operating income of $1.7 million, an increase of $0.6 million year-over-year. The Company reported GAAP income from continuing operations of $1.8 million, or income of $0.32 per diluted share in the fiscal 2018 nine-month period, as compared to GAAP income from continuing operations of $0.7 million, or income per diluted share of $0.12, in the fiscal 2017 nine-month period. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations for both the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 nine-month periods was $0.9 million, and on a diluted per share basis was $0.17 and $0.16, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $5.7 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $6.2 million in the comparable fiscal 2017 period.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period along with the accompanying notes is provided in Table 3 below.\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Outlook\nThe Company anticipates revenue in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter to be in the range of $63.0 million to $70.0 million, non-GAAP gross margin to be between 30% to 32% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $19.0 million. At the mid-point of the ranges provided, this would result in non-GAAP operating income of approximately $1.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 million. For fiscal 2018, the Company anticipates revenue to be in the range of $243.0 million to $250.0 million, non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 31.5% and non-GAAP operating expense to be approximately $74.0 million. This would result in fiscal 2018 non-GAAP operating income, using the mid-point of the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter ranges, of approximately $3.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $8.5 million. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $1.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million in fiscal 2017, significant year-over-year improvements.\nConference Call Details\nAviat Networks will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on May 14, 2018 to discuss its financial results for the fiscal 2018 third quarter and nine-month period.

Management of Aviat Networks monitors gross margin, research and development expenses, selling and administrative expenses, operating (loss) income, income tax provision (benefit), net (loss) income attributable to Aviat Networks, diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to Aviat Networks, adjusted (loss) income before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") attributable to Aviat Networks adjusted to exclude certain costs, charges, gains and losses, on a non-GAAP basis for planning and forecasting results in future periods, and may use these measures for some management compensation purposes. These measures exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses as shown on the attached Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table (Table 3). As a result, management is presenting these non-GAAP measures in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP to better communicate underlying operational and financial performance in each period. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on results in any given period. Management also believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance the ability of an investor to analyze trends in Aviat Networks' business and to better understand its performance. Aviat Networks' management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Aviat Networks presents these non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its financial performance.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. We also believe these non-GAAP measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in our business and to understand our performance. In addition, we may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as a guide in our forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning process and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP follow.\nTable 3\nAVIAT NETWORKS, INC.\nFiscal Year 2018 Third Quarter Summary\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (1)\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 30, 2018\n% of\nMarch 31, 2017\n% of\nMarch 30, 2018\n% of\nMarch 31, 2017\n% of\nRevenue\nRevenue\nRevenue\nRevenue\n(In thousands, except percentages and per share amounts)\nGAAP gross margin\n$ 18,132\n29.2\n%\n$ 17,732\n30.2\n%\n$ 57,318\n31.8\n%\n$ 56,213\n30.3\n%\nWTM inventory write-down recovery\n(127)\n(48)\n(317)\n(131)\nPerformance bond expense\n-\n-\n-\n365\nShare-based compensation\n53\n48\n152\n151\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n18,058\n29.1\n%\n17,732\n30.2\n%\n57,153\n31.8\n%\n56,598\n30.5\n%\nGAAP research and development expenses\n$ 4,754\n7.7\n%\n$ 4,264\n7.3\n%\n$ 14,696\n8.2\n%\n$ 13,682\n7.4\n%\nShare-based compensation\n(36)\n(38)\n(114)\n(100)\nNon-GAAP research and development expenses\n4,718\n7.6\n%\n4,226\n7.2\n%\n14,582\n8.1\n%\n13,582\n7.3\n%\nGAAP selling and administrative expenses\n$ 14,745\n23.7\n%\n$ 13,284\n22.6\n%\n$ 42,571\n23.7\n%\n$ 42,527\n22.9\n%\nShare-based compensation\n(446)\n(479)\n(1,423)\n(1,260)\nStrategic alternative costs\n(43)\n-\n(920)\n-\nNon-GAAP selling and administrative expenses\n14,256\n23.0\n%\n12,805\n21.8\n%\n40,228\n22.3\n%\n41,267\n22.3\n%\nGAAP operating (loss) income\n$ (1,365)\n(2.2)\n%\n$ 73\n0.1\n%\n$ 303\n0.2\n%\n$ (339)\n(0.2)\n%\nWTM inventory write-down recovery\n(127)\n(48)\n(317)\n(131)\nPerformance bond expense\n-\n-\n-\n365\nShare-based compensation\n535\n565\n1,689\n1,511\nStrategic alternative costs\n43\n-\n920\n-\nRestructuring charges\n(2)\n111\n(252)\n343\nNon-GAAP operating (loss) income\n(916)\n(1.5)\n%\n701\n1.2\n%\n2,343\n1.3\n%\n1,749\n0.9\n%\nGAAP income tax provision (benefit)\n$ 1,015\n1.6\n%\n$ 779\n1.3\n%\n$ (2,188)\n(1.2)\n%\n$ (826)\n(0.4)\n%\nTax refund from Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n-\n-\n1,322\n3,741\nAMT credit related to valuation allowance release\n-\n-\n3,303\n-\nAdjustment to reflect pro forma tax rate\n(715)\n(479)\n(1,537)\n(2,015)\nNon-GAAP income tax provision\n300\n0.5\n%\n300\n0.5\n%\n900\n0.5\n%\n900\n0.5\n%\nGAAP (loss) income attributable to Aviat Networks\n$ (2,623)\n(4.2)\n%\n$ (399)\n(0.7)\n%\n$ 1,791\n1.0\n%\n$ 650\n0.4\n%\nShare-based compensation\n535\n565\n1,689\n1,511\nStrategic alternative costs\n43\n-\n920\n-\nRestructuring charges\n(2)\n111\n(252)\n343\nNigeria FX loss on dividend receivable\n51\n10\n188\n218\nWTM inventory write-down recovery\n(127)\n(48)\n(317)\n(131)\nPerformance bond expense\n-\n-\n-\n365\nGain on liquidation of subsidiary\n-\n(349)\n-\n(349)\nTax refund from Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n-\n-\n(1,322)\n(3,741)\nAMT credit related to valuation allowance release\n-\n-\n(3,303)\n-\nAdjustment to reflect pro forma tax rate\n715\n479\n1,537\n2,015\nNon-GAAP (loss) income attributable to Aviat Networks\n$ (1,408)\n(2.3)\n%\n$ 369\n0.6\n%\n$ 931\n0.5\n%\n$ 881\n0.5\n%\nDiluted (loss) income per share of common stock\nGAAP\n$ (0.49)\n$ (0.08)\n$ 0.32\n$ 0.12\nNon-GAAP\n$ (0.26)\n$ 0.07\n$ 0.17\n$ 0.16\nShares used in computing diluted (loss) income per share of common stock\nGAAP\n5,344\n5,310\n5,632\n5,392\nNon-GAAP\n5,344\n5,511\n5,632\n5,392\nADJUSTED EBITDA:\nGAAP (loss) income attributable to Aviat Networks\n$ (2,623)\n(4.2)\n%\n$ (399)\n(0.7)\n%\n$ 1,791\n1.0\n%\n$ 650\n0.4\n%\n of property, plant and equipment\n1,391\n1,404\n3,981\n4,540\nInterest\n(44)\n(35)\n(125)\n(140)\nShare-based compensation\n535\n565\n1,689\n1,511\nStrategic alternative costs\n43\n-\n920\n-\nRestructuring (recovery) charges\n(2)\n111\n(252)\n343\nNigeria FX loss on dividend receivable\n51\n10\n188\n218\nWTM inventory write-down recovery\n(127)\n(48)\n(317)\n(131)\nPerformance bond expense\n-\n-\n-\n365\nGain on liquidation of subsidiary\n-\n(349)\n-\n(349)\nProvision for income taxes\n1,015\n779\n(2,188)\n(826)\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Aviat Networks\n$ 239\n0.4\n%\n$ 2,038\n3.5\n%\n$ 5,687\n3.2\n%\n$ 6,181\n3.3\n%\n(1)\nThe adjustments above reconcile our GAAP financial results to the non-GAAP financial measures used by us. Our non-GAAP (loss) income attributable to Aviat Networks excluded share-based compensation, and other non-recurring charges (recovery). Adjusted EBITDA was determined by excluding depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment, interest, provision for or benefit from income taxes, and non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments, as set forth above, from the GAAP (loss) income attributable to Aviat Networks. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP items provides meaningful supplemental information to investors, when viewed in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, our GAAP results. However, the non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nTable 4\nAVIAT NETWORKS, INC.\nFiscal Year 2018 Third Quarter Summary\nSUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE OF REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHICAL AREA\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nMarch 30, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nMarch 30, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n(in thousands)\nNorth America\n$ 31,756\n$ 29,188\n$ 99,743\n$ 97,125\nInternational:\nAfrica and Middle East\n17,623\n17,335\n43,767\n48,454\nEurope and Russia\n3,638\n4,012\n11,898\n11,329\nLatin America and Asia Pacific\n9,076\n8,165\n24,590\n28,535\n30,337\n29,512\n80,255\n88,318\nTotal Revenue\n$ 62,093\n$ 58,700\n$179,998\n$ 185,443\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aviat-networks-announces-fiscal-2018-third-quarter-and-nine-month-financial-results-300648011.html\nSOURCE Aviat Networks, Inc.",
