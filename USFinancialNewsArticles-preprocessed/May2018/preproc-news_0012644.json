    "text": "ST. LOUIS, May 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Edgewell Personal Care Company (NYSE: EPC) today announced results for its second fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, 2018.\nExecutive Summary\nNet sales were $608.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 0.5% when compared to the prior year period on a reported basis, and down 3.4% on an organic basis. (Organic basis excludes sales impact from the Jack Black acquisition, the Playtex gloves divestiture, and the translational benefit from currency.) GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") were $1.20 for the second quarter as compared to $1.14 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS were $1.31 for the second quarter, compared to $1.21 in the prior year quarter. Completed the acquisition of Jack Black, L.L.C., a leading U.S. men's prestige skincare company. Launched \"Project Fuel,\" an enterprise-wide initiative designed to transform the Company's business and cost structure, deliver substantial cost savings, increase agility and provide the capabilities and financial resources needed to drive growth and shareholder value. Project Fuel is expected to deliver an estimated $225 million in gross cost savings over the fiscal year 2019 to 2021 time horizon. Updated financial outlook for fiscal 2018.\nThe Company reports and forecasts results on a GAAP and \"Non-GAAP\" basis, and has reconciled Non-GAAP results and outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measures later in this release. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a more detailed explanation, including definitions of various Non-GAAP terms used in this release. All comparisons used in this release are with the same period in the prior fiscal year unless otherwise stated.\n\"In what continues to be a very challenging environment, with declining categories and intense competitive pressure, we grew sales during the quarter in International markets and Sun and Skin Care, we successfully executed our new product launches and we held or gained value share in most markets in Razors and Blades and Sun Care,\" said David Hatfield, Edgewell's Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board. \"However, with unprecedented volatility in the Wet Shave category, we are revising our full year outlook for net sales and EPS to reflect increased risks in the marketplace,\" Mr. Hatfield continued. \"To address these market challenges over the longer term, and to increase our competitiveness, we have launched 'Project Fuel,' a transformational initiative that we believe will fundamentally change all aspects of our business, deliver substantial cost savings, improve agility, and generate the resources needed to fuel investment in our brands and our strategic growth initiatives. Project Fuel is designed to enhance shareholder value by delivering sustainable profit growth and cash generation.\"\nFiscal 2Q 2018 Operating Results (Unaudited)\nNet sales were $608.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of 0.5% when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding a $2.4 million benefit from one month of the Jack Black acquisition, a $3.8 million negative impact from the Playtex gloves divestiture, and a $19.3 million benefit from currency, organic net sales decreased 3.4%. From a geographic perspective, organic net sales in North America declined 7%, while increasing 4% in total International markets. Volumes were lower in North America Wet Shave, Infant Care and Feminine Care, offset in part by higher volumes in global Sun and Skin Care and International Wet Shave. Price mix was unfavorable in the quarter due to higher Sun Care returns and an increase in Wet Shave promotional spend in North America.\nGross margin decreased 100 basis points to 49.7%, primarily driven by unfavorable price mix due to increased Sun Care returns and higher promotional activity in support of new Wet Shave products. Volume mix negatively impacted margin by 10 basis points, while cost mix was a 30 basis point negative impact, largely driven by unfavorable transactional currency.\nAdvertising and sales promotion expense (\"A&P\") was $75.6 million, or 12.4% of net sales, a decrease from prior year spend of $82.5 million, or 13.5% of net sales. The decrease in A&P was primarily driven by reduced brand support within Feminine Care and a $4.5 million reduction in spend generated by the Zero-Based Spending (\"ZBS\") initiative to centralize creative asset development for our global brands.\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&A\") was $103.5 million, or 17.0% of net sales, as compared to $103.9 million, or 17.0% of net sales, in the prior year. Excluding $2.6 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with Jack Black and unfavorable currency translation, SG&A as a percent of net sales improved 50 basis points over the prior year. The operational improvement in SG&A was largely driven by savings generated through the ZBS initiative and lower compensation expense related to reduced headcount, offset in part by higher e-commerce investments.\nThe Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expense of $3.7 million in support of Project Fuel, consisting of consulting, program management and severance costs.\nOther income, net was $0.2 million during the quarter as compared to $6.6 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting a negative impact from foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses in the quarter and revaluation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures.\nEarnings before income taxes were $85.8 million during the quarter compared to $89.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating income increased to $110.1 million in the quarter from $105.8 million in the prior year period.\nThe effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 39.7% as compared to 26.2% in the prior year period, and included a net charge of $17.4 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). This is comprised of a $96.7 million one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, offset by a $79.3 million benefit from the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was 24.8% compared to 26.6% in the prior year period. The current period rate was favorably impacted by the lower U.S. tax rate from the enactment of the Tax Act, offset by unfavorable tax adjustments.\nGAAP net earnings for the quarter were $65.1 million ($1.20 per share) compared to earnings of $65.7 million ($1.14 per share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted net earnings in the quarter were $70.9 million ($1.31 per share), as compared to $69.6 million ($1.21 per share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNet cash from operating activities was $73.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to cash from operating activities of $15.1 million during the same period in the prior year. The improvement in operating cash flow was driven by changes in working capital, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and other operating liabilities.\nProject Fuel\nProject Fuel is an enterprise-wide transformational initiative designed to address all aspects of the Company's business and cost structure. The project will incorporate the Company's existing ZBS and global productivity initiatives and will include a new global restructuring initiative .\nIn addition to the expected cost savings and improved profitability, Project Fuel is designed to strengthen the Company's challenger culture and reinforce its consumer-centric organizational focus. It is designed to simplify the organization and streamline ways of working in order to increase competitiveness, speed and agility, and ensure the Company has the skills, capabilities and investments needed to compete in a rapidly changing world.\nProject Fuel is expected to achieve an estimated $225 million in total gross savings through the end of the 2021 fiscal year. These savings initiatives will materially affect Supply Chain, Operations, Commercial and Sales Organizations, and Corporate G&A, and will affect all business Segments. It is expected that the savings generated will be used to fuel investments in strategic growth initiatives and brands, offset operational headwinds from inflation and other input costs, and improve the overall profitability of the Company.\nTo implement the restructuring element of Project Fuel, the Company estimates one-time pre-tax charges to be approximately $120 to $130 million, with an additional capital investment of $60 to $70 million through the end of the 2021 fiscal year. The Company anticipates that the majority of the one-time charges associated with these initiatives will be incurred by the end of the 2019 fiscal year.\nFiscal 2Q 2018 Operating Segment Results (Unaudited)\nFollowing is a summary of second quarter results by segment. All comparisons are with the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nWet Shave (Men's Systems, Women's Systems, Disposables, Shave Preps)\nWet Shave net sales increased $2.6 million, or 0.8%. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased 4.0% versus the prior year, with International markets increasing by 6% and North America declining 14%. Men's Systems organic net sales were flat, as sales growth from International Hydro and Private Label was largely offset by declines in North America. Women's Systems organic net sales declined low-single digits as growth from the Intuition f.a.b. launch and strong growth in Asia and Latin America was more than offset by declines in North America and Europe. Disposables organic net sales were down mid-single digits, largely driven by declines in North America, while International grew modestly. Wet Shave segment profit decreased $3.4 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable price mix. A&P spending was lower in the quarter, reflecting the benefit of ZBS savings and the timing of spend related to new product launches in the year.\nSun and Skin Care (Sun Care, Wipes, Gloves, Bulldog, Jack Black)\nSun and Skin Care net sales increased $1.7 million, or 1.1%. Excluding the Jack Black acquisition, the impact of the Playtex gloves sale and the impact of currency movements, organic net sales increased $0.5 million, or 0.3%, including a $1.6 million decline related to the Company's exiting of the private label Sun Care business. Higher Sun Care volumes in North America were largely offset by negative price mix related to returns. Bulldog net sales increased over 100% organically, compared to the prior year, and Wet Ones generated strong growth due to the flu season in North America. Sun and Skin Care segment profit decreased $2.0 million, or 3.9%, driven primarily by higher returns and higher warehouse and distribution costs.\nFeminine Care (Tampons, Pads, Liners)\nFeminine Care net sales decreased $2.9 million, or 3.5%. The decline was driven by Tampons, specifically in the Gentle Glide and o.b. brands. Total Liners, led by Carefree, increased 5.7%, and total Pads were essentially flat in the quarter. Feminine Care segment profit increased $8.5 million, or 531.3%, due to lower product costs and lower A&P and overhead spending, offset in part by lower volumes.\nAll Other (Infant Care, all other brands)\nAll Other net sales decreased $4.3 million, or 12.4%. Excluding the impact of currency movements, organic net sales decreased $4.5 million, or 13.0%, primarily due to the impact of the Toys R Us liquidation and distribution losses in feeding products. All Other segment profit decreased $3.4 million, or 44.2%.\nUpdated Full Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018, net sales are expected to decline approximately 50 basis points, while organic net sales are expected to be down approximately 3% (previously 1%.) Organic net sales exclude an approximate 230 basis-point increase from favorable foreign currency translation and a 30 basis-point combined increase from the Jack Black and Bulldog acquisitions, net of the Playtex gloves divestiture. The lowered outlook for organic net sales is largely due to increased category and competitive pressure in Wet Shave in the U.S., the impact of significant trade inventory reductions in Wet Shave in Japan, primarily impacting third quarter net sales and profit, and the impact to Infant Care from the expected Toys R Us liquidation.\nThe Company's outlook for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 (previously $3.80 to $4.00 ), including the charge related to the Tax Act, the gain related to the sale of the Playtex gloves business, Jack Black integration costs and Project Fuel restructuring charges. The outlook for Adjusted EPS in now expected to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60 (previously $3.90 to $4.10). The Company estimates that approximately $0.40 of the full year Adjusted EPS reduction versus the prior outlook is attributable to expectations for fiscal third quarter performance. Full year Adjusted operating income margin as a percent of net sales is now anticipated to be down approximately 120 basis points versus the prior year.\nThe Company's ZBS initiative is anticipated to drive $25 - $30 million in net savings in fiscal 2018. Benefits from the ZBS program will be reinvested into marketing spend and the Company's strategic growth initiatives.\nFor fiscal 2018, Project Fuel related restructuring charges and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $40 million and $16 million, respectively.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the 2018 fiscal year is estimated to be in the range of 22% to 24%.\nThe Company anticipates that fiscal 2018 free cash flow will be above 100% of GAAP net earnings.\nWebcast Information\nIn conjunction with this announcement, the Company will hold an investor conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.

Segment performance is evaluated based on segment profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses, share-based compensation costs, costs associated with restructuring initiatives, Jack Black, L.L.C. (\"Jack Black\") integration costs, the sale of the Playtex gloves business and the amortization of intangible assets. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of such charges from segment results reflects management's view on how it evaluates segment performance.\nOn March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Jack Black, a leading U.S. based luxury men's skincare products company based in the United States, for approximately $90.3, net of cash acquired.
