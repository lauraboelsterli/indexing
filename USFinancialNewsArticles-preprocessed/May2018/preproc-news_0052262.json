    "text": "MONTREAL, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Velan Inc. (TSX:VLN) (the “Company”), a world-leading manufacturer of industrial valves, announced today its financial results for its fiscal year and fourth quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nHighlights\nSales of US$102.6 million for the quarter Net loss 1 of US$8.2 million for the quarter, including a one-time tax expense of US$4.3 million resulting from passage of U.S. tax reform legislation Order backlog of US$464.5 million at the end of the quarter Net new orders received (“Bookings”) of US$72.9 million for the quarter Net cash 2 of US$61.0 million at the end of the quarter Returned US$1.7 million to shareholders in the quarter and US$7.3 million in the fiscal year by way of dividends and share repurchases Quarterly dividend reduced to CA$0.03 per share, payable June 29, 2018\nThree-month periods ended Fiscal years ended (millions of U.S. dollars, excluding per share amounts) February 28,\n2018 February 28,\n2017 February 28,\n2018 February 28,\n2017\nSales $ 102.6 $ 102.8 $ 338.0 $ 331.8 Gross profit 17.3 28.9 68.6 88.5 Gross profit % 16.9 % 28.1 % 20.3 % 26.7 % EBITDA 2 (1.2 ) 12.6 (4.4 ) 26.2 EBITDA 2 per share – basic and diluted (0.05 ) 0.58 (0.20 ) 1.21 Net earnings (loss) 1 (8.2 ) 3.7 (17.8 ) 7.7 Net earnings (loss) 1 per share – basic and diluted (0.38 ) 0.17 (0.82 ) 0.36\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 (unless otherwise noted, all amounts are in U.S. dollars and all comparisons are to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017):\nNet loss 1 amounted to $8.2 million or $0.38 per share compared to net earnings 1 of $3.7 million or $0.17 per share last year. EBITDA 2 amounted to a negative balance of $1.2 million or $0.05 per share compared to a positive balance of $12.6 million or $0.58 per share last year. The $11.9 million decrease in net earnings 1 is primarily attributable to significantly weaker margins, increased administration costs and the negative effects of the U.S. tax reform legislation passed during the current quarter, which resulted in a one-time tax expense inclusion of $4.3 million.\nSales remained relatively stable for the quarter, decreasing by $0.2 million or 0.2% from the prior year. While sales were lower in the current quarter when compared to the comparative period in the prior year, they were stronger when compared to the previous three quarters of the current fiscal year. Sales for the quarter were improved in the Company’s Italian subsidiary, while its North American operations realized lower sales due to delays in shipments of certain large project orders caused by various customer-related, supply chain and internal operational issues.\nBookings decreased by $53.0 million or 42.1% for the quarter. The decrease in bookings is primarily attributable to the Company’s French operations which had won $55 million in large project orders in the prior year comparable quarter to supply valves towards the construction of a nuclear power plant in the U.K. While bookings remained relatively flat if these orders are not taken into account, the Company’s North American operations continue to struggle as the current highly competitive environment in many of its markets continues to put downward pressure on pricing and lead times, despite the fact that the outlook in most of these markets are beginning to show signs of improvement.\nGross profit percentage decreased by 1,120 basis points from the prior year quarter. Despite the fact that sales remained relatively stable and that the Company maintained control over its labour and overhead costs, the gross profit percentage decreased significantly due primarily to shipping a product mix with a greater proportion of projects with lower margins, a decrease in production which reduced the amount of current period direct labour and production overhead costs that could be capitalized, and warranty provisions. In addition, shipping delays due to customer-related and internal operational issues resulted in an increase in provisions for inventory ageing, which had a direct negative impact on the Company’s margins. The lingering pricing pressure and the Company’s inherent fixed overhead costs due to its large global manufacturing footprint continue to have a negative impact on its gross profit percentage, particularly in its North American operations which saw a 320 basis point increase in its material cost as a percentage of sales in the quarter. The Company aims to address these latter issues through its strategic initiatives, namely materials management, targeting higher margin segments and overhead reduction.\nAdministration costs for the quarter increased by $3.7 million or 19.5% for the quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales commissions and freight charges as well as an increase in costs associated with the Company’s ongoing asbestos litigation. The fluctuation in asbestos costs is due more to the timing of settlement payments than to changes in long-term trends.\nYear Ended Fiscal 2018 (unless otherwise noted, all amounts are in U.S. dollars and all comparisons are to the prior fiscal year):\nEBITDA 2 amounted to a negative balance of $4.4 million or $0.20 per share compared to a positive balance of $26.2 million or $1.21 per share last year. Despite an increase in sales, the $30.6 million decrease in EBITDA 2 is primarily attributable to significantly weaker margins and increased administration costs.\nNet loss 1 amounted to $17.8 million or $0.82 per share compared to net earnings 1 of $7.7 million or $0.36 per share last year. The $25.5 million decrease in net earnings 1 is primarily attributable to a lower EBITDA 2 and the negative effects of the U.S. tax reform legislation passed during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year, which resulted in a one-time tax expense inclusion of $4.3 million.\nSales amounted to $338.0 million, an increase of $6.2 million or 1.9% compared to last year. Sales were positively impacted by an increase in shipments from the Company’s Italian subsidiary, which were offset by decreased shipments from the Company’s North American operations. Delays in shipments of certain large project orders caused by various customer-related, supply chain and internal operational issues, and lower shipments of non-project commodity valves negatively impacted the Company’s North American operations.\nBookings amounted to $320.9 million, a decrease of $127.3 million or 28.4% compared to last year. This decrease is due primarily to lower project orders booked by the Company’s French, German and Italian subsidiaries, all of which had recorded significant large project orders in the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by improved bookings in the Company’s North American operations.\nDespite the fact that sales outpaced bookings in the year, the Company ended the year with a backlog of $464.5 million, an increase of $26.3 million or 6.0% since the beginning of the current fiscal year. This increase in backlog was substantially due to the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro spot rate against the U.S. dollar over the course of the year.\nGross profit percentage decreased by 640 basis points from 26.7% to 20.3%. This decrease is due primarily to the Company’s North American operations, which shipped a product mix with a greater proportion of projects with lower margins, coupled with pricing pressure brought on by fierce competition and continued weakness in certain markets; this loss of margin was only partially offset by the material cost savings achieved by the Company’s supply chain improvement initiatives. Furthermore, the Company’s North American operations were impacted by a significant backlog of project valves which it was not able to deliver due to various customer-related issues and internal operational issues.\nAdministration costs amounted to $85.4 million, an increase of $9.5 million or 12.5%. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales commissions and freight charges resulting from the higher sales volume, an increase in technology license fees paid on the sale of certain highly-engineered cryogenic valves by the Company’s French operations, and an increase in costs recognized in connection with the Company’s ongoing asbestos litigation. The fluctuation in asbestos costs for the year is due more to the timing of settlement payments in these two years rather than to changes in long-term trends.\nThe Company ended the year with net cash 2 of $61.0 million, a decrease of $11.5 million or 15.9% since the beginning of the year. This decrease is primarily attributable to cash used in operations, investments in property, plant and equipment, long-term debt repayments as well as distributions to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.\nForeign currency impacts:\nBased on average exchange rates, the euro strengthened 4.9% against the U.S. dollar when compared to the same period last year. This strengthening resulted in the Company’s net profits and bookings from its European subsidiaries being reported as higher U.S. dollar amounts in the current year.\nBased on average exchange rates, the Canadian dollar strengthened 1.8% against the U.S. dollar when compared to the same period last year. This strengthening resulted in the Company’s Canadian dollar expenses being reported as higher U.S. dollar amounts in the current year.\nBased on spot exchange rates, the euro strengthened 15.3% against the U.S. dollar when compared to the rate at the end of the last fiscal year. This strengthening resulted in losses of $1.8 million incurred on foreign exchange forward contracts used by the Company to hedge the net monetary position of its European subsidiaries. This strengthening also resulted in a positive cumulative translation adjustment of $15.9 million which was recorded directly in equity through other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe net impact of the above currency swings was generally unfavourable on the Company’s net loss 1 , although it was generally favourable on the Company’s equity.\n“Fiscal year 2018 was a very challenging year in terms of both sales and net earnings 1 . Margins were negatively impacted by both lower volumes and competitive pressures, in spite of some of our cost savings efforts. In addition, our fourth quarter tax provisions also reflected the costs of the recent US tax reform changes,” said John Ball, CFO of Velan Inc. “. Regardless, our balance sheet remains strong as we made efforts to conserve cash and manage working capital. For this reason, the quarterly dividend has been adjusted to CA$0.03 per share, effective June 2018. The challenge for fiscal year 2019 is to follow through on a number of strategic sales and cost reduction initiatives.”\nYves Leduc, President and CEO of Velan Inc., said, “Fiscal year 2018 was my first year as CEO of the Company and it was by far the most challenging. Our results are deeply disappointing as we suffered a loss on slightly increasing revenues. The poor bookings experienced by our North American operations in the prior year were not followed with the expected recovery this year. The usual strong performance of our French operations, coupled with the impressive sales recovery of our Italian operations, could not offset our performance in North America. Meanwhile, the complexity of our project manufacturing business keeps increasing at a pace faster than our improvements. This, combined with sharply contracting margins in project valves, contributed to a notable margin decline, again mostly in our North American operations. While we are making progress in transforming the Company through our strategic plan, Velocity 2020, which was launched last year, such improvements are overshadowed by our business results. As such, we are currently re-assessing our strategic plan to determine how it can be adapted to include ways to simplify our business and rapidly broaden our cost reduction initiatives. Simply put, we will need to make important changes to improve our operating results.”\nDividend\nThe Board declared an eligible quarterly dividend of CA$0.03 per share, payable on June 29, 2018, to all shareholders of record as at June 15, 2018.\nConference call\nFinancial analysts, shareholders, and other interested individuals are invited to attend the fourth quarter conference call to be held on Thursday, May 24, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. (EDT).
