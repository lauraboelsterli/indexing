    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 4:23 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago Xerox says CEO, board to stay after agreement with Icahn, Deason expires Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) said on Thursday its current board and management team, which included Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson, will stay, after a settlement agreement it had reached with dissenting shareholders to oust them expired. FILE PHOTO - Xerox chief executive officer, Jeff Jacobson (L), smiles as he stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., January 4, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\nXerox had said on Tuesday its CEO and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, handing over to new management which will reconsider a controversial deal with Japanâ€™s Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ).\nThe New York Supreme Court held a hearing on Thursday on an objection by Fujifilm to the agreement. The judge held off a decision and the schedule for the next hearing has not been decided.\nThe deal would terminate if the court does not act before 8:00 p.m. ET on May 3, 2018, Xerox said on Tuesday.
