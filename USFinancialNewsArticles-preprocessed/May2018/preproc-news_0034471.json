That's in addition to the $1.4 trillion borrowers owe in loan debt already. And the amount of money students make right out of college can affect how quickly you can pay back the loans you took out to pay for your education .\nBased on the data, here are the top 10 highest-paying entry-level jobs for new grads:\n1. Commercial Real Estate Loan Officer Median annual base salary: $76,589\n2. Data Architect Median annual base salary: $75,745\n3. Aerospace Engineer Median annual base salary: $71,674\n4. Cash Management Officer Median annual base salary: $70,907\n5. Community Development Representative Median annual base salary: $70,136\n6. Product Engineer Median annual base salary: $69,470\n7. Corporate Bonds Trader Median annual base salary: $68,827\nshow chapters These public colleges offer the best value 10:06 AM ET Thu, 11 May 2017 | 01:21 8. Content Specialist Median annual base salary: $66,230\n9. Graphical User Interface Programmer Median annual base salary: $65,983\n10. Implementation Specialist Median annual base salary: $65,839\n\"Many top-paying jobs are in the engineering field … proving that engineering is a career path that pays well,\" notes GOBankingRates. \"The other high-paying entry-level jobs continue to fit mostly into the technology field — along with some in the business field,\" too.\nOf course, how much money you make will depend on your individual circumstances, like the amount of experience you have heading into the workforce, what company you land a job with and what state you work in.\nAnd, while these numbers can provide useful insight , they shouldn't deter you from pursuing a career that doesn't make the list. A surprising number of big-name companies also commit to helping employees work their way up to a six-figure job .\nTo get a more personalized glimpse at how much you can expect to make, check out these wage calculators that estimate your salary based on your college, education level, company and age.\nLike this story?
