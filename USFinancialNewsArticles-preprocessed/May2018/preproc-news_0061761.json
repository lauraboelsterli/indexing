The lion cub triplets of lioness Zarina are seen for the first time at their enclosure at the Zoo in Frankfurt, Germany, May 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nThe cubs are lioness Zarina’s first litter, the zoo said. Their sex has not been determined as they have yet to be examined, keepers said.\nSince their birth, the triplets have remained with their mother and keepers hope their father Kumar will meet them soon. Slideshow (3 Images)\n“I have no doubt that he would like to go and see them. That’s all he wants the whole time. He walks around and looks and calls out and shows that he already wants to be with them,” Anni Fuchs, head of the big cats section at the zoo, said.\n“Only Zarina isn’t quite ready for that yet. They’ll be united when we think that the time is right.” Reporting by Reuters Television; Editing by Alison Williams",
