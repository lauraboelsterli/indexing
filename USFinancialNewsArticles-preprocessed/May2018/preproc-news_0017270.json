Articles of amalgamation to amalgamate Peeks Social Subco, Personas, and Riavera Subco were filed on May 2, 2018, resulting in the creation of a single wholly-owned subsidiary named Peeks Social Technologies Holding Inc. (the “Transaction”).\nShareholders of both Peeks Social and Personas overwhelmingly approved the Transaction as reported on April 19 and May 2, 2018. The closing of the Transaction has resulted in the acquisition of the technology assets of the Peeks Social livestreaming product and in the Company receiving 100% of the gross revenue generated by these assets. Details of the Transaction can be found in the Company’s Information Circular dated March 19, 2018, as posted under the Company’s profile on SEDAR.\nPrior to the Transaction, Personas was a private company controlled by Mr. Mark Itwaru, Chairman & CEO of the Company.
