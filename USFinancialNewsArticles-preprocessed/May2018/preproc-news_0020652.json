    "text": "EAST PALO ALTO, Calif., Finjan Holdings , Inc. (NASDAQ:FNJN), a cybersecurity company, today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of Finjan’s outstanding common stock of up to $10 million.\nUnder the repurchase program, Finjan may, but is not obligated to, repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, in accordance with applicable securities laws. The repurchases will be funded using the Company’s available cash balances and cash generated from future operations, and the timing of such repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the price of Finjan’s common stock, general market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by Finjan’s management. No time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program and the program may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion.\n“This repurchase program demonstrates our confidence in Finjan’s long-term growth prospects and our commitment to delivering shareholder value,” stated Phil Hartstein, President and CEO of Finjan Holdings. “We believe this is an attractive use of our cash given the value of our intellectual property assets and our strong balance sheet. Our financial flexibility puts us in a position to increase shareholder returns, while at the same time continuing to explore internal and external opportunities that will drive future growth.”\nABOUT FINJAN\nEstablished more than 20 years ago, Finjan is a globally recognized leader in cybersecurity.
