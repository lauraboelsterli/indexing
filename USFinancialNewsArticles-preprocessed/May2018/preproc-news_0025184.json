    "text": "May 10, 2018 / 8:55 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago FTSE sails on sterling slide after BoE Danilo Masoni , Kit Rees 3 Min Read\nMILAN (Reuters) - The UK’s top share index hit a fresh 3-1/2 month high on Thursday after a decision by the Bank of England to keep rates on hold pushed sterling lower, while shares in Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) surged after it settled a probe in the United States.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo\nThe FTSE index closed 0.5 percent higher at 7,700.97 points, outperforming a slightly negative European market.\nSterling dropped after the Bank of England held interest rates steady as expected, but trimmed some losses after Governor Mark Carney told the BBC that he expected a rate rise over the course of the next year if there are no shocks to the economy.\n“In light of the current uncertainty, the Bank is, understandably, inclined towards a more hesitant rather than pre-emptive approach to normalising policy,” Karen Ward, chief market strategist for the UK and Europe at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said, referring to uncertainty around Brexit.\nWeakness in the pound against a surging dollar has been supporting the FTSE recently, helping the internationally-exposed index recover from losses suffered at the start of the year.\nAway from economics, the FTSE was boosted by a 3.8 percent move higher in RBS’ ( RBS.L ) shares after it agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities.\nAnalysts, who had estimated the U.S. could impose a fine of up to $12 billion, said the bank could reinstate a dividend.\n“It’s a happy day for RBS, with the DoJ settlement coming in well below what we had feared,” said Neil Wilson, Chief Market Analyst at Markets.com.\n“The settlement also paves the way for a quick return to annual profits after ten years of losses and dividends will once again start flowing,” Wilson added.\nNext’s ( NXT.L ) shares were the biggest risers, up more than 6 percent after a strong outlook and trading update, while ITV ( ITV.L ) jumped after saying that advertising growth was in-line in the first quarter.\nBT ( BT.L ), however, fell 7.4 percent.\nTraders said its latest update showed a disappointing guidance, while Jefferies analysts highlighted that the company missed on the opportunity of announcing a bolder mover of fibre roll out while the 13,000 job cuts were bigger then expected.\nRandgold ( RRS.L ) was another weak spot, down 7 percent after its quarterly profit fell, while\nAmong mid-caps, Superdry ( SDRY.L ) plummeted more than 19 percent after the fashion retailer said it expected 2018 full-year gross margins to decline and it gave a weaker than expected revenue forecast for 2019.
