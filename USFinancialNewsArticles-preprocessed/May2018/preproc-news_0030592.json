    "text": "The U.S. moved its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday afternoon sparking deadly clashes between Palestinian protestors and the Israeli military. President Donald Trump in December broke with decades of White House policy and recognized the contested city as Israel’s capital.\nWhy has the U.S. moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?\nIsrael declared an independent state in 1948 and took permanent control of West Jerusalem following a conflict with Arab states. It then annexed the eastern half of the city after the 1967 Six Day War against the Arab nations. Since then, Israeli officials have lobbied the international community to recognize Jerusalem as their capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as their capital in a future state.\nThe U.S. Congress in 1995 passed a law stating that the U.S. Embassy should be based in Jerusalem, however, a clause in the legislation allowed the U.S. president to delay the move every six months by signing a waiver. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all signed such waivers, often citing national security concerns. But Mr. Trump pledged to finally make the move. U.S. officials said Mr. Trump views the moves as separate from the peace process and he didn’t want to sign another waiver in December.\nWhat have Palestinians done in response?\nThe opening ceremony comes in the wake of a series of Palestinian protests at the fence between Israeli territory and the Gaza Strip in recent weeks. Those demonstrations have primarily called on Israeli officials to allow Palestinian refugees and their ancestors to return to homes in Israel.\nThe Israeli military says the protests are being used as a cover for militants belonging to Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Strip, to commit terror attacks in Israel after a mass breach of the fence.\nThousands of protesters were injured at the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel ahead of the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. On Monday, Hamas called on thousands of Palestinians to elevate those demonstrations and protest the embassy’s opening. Demonstrators clashed with the Israeli military at the Gaza fence, leaving dozens of protesters dead.\nThose killed with Israeli live fire included a 12- and a 14-year-old, according to Gaza’s ministry of health, who said scores more were injured. An Israeli military spokesman said the protests are larger and more violent than what they have seen in the last month and a half\nHamas also encouraged Palestinians to demonstrate on Tuesday, known as Nakba Day or the “Day of the Catastrophe”, marking the day after the establishment of Israel. A coalition of all Palestinian political factions, known as the National and Islamic Forces, has called on Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to protest the embassy relocation.\nWhat is this move likely to mean for peace talks?\nThe White House has said it expects to push forward with a still-secret plan to secure what Mr. Trump has called “the ultimate deal” for Middle East peace. The last round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations collapsed under the Obama administration in 2014. U.S. officials have said their plan is mostly finished and the White House is seeking the right time to present it.\nBut Palestinians have already said the decision to open a U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem means they no longer recognize the U.S. as the main broker of peace talks. Palestinian officials are refusing to meet with representatives of the Trump administration and so it’s not clear whether a peace plan, if presented, will move the end of hostilities closer.\nMr. Trump’s decision to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv has faced fierce criticism from European and Arab officials who have said it is likely hamper any future peace negotiations.\nWhere is the new embassy going to be located in Jerusalem?\nThe embassy opening is the culmination of nearly six months of State Department preparations following Mr. Trump’s December declaration of the city as Israel’s capital. The department spent about $400,000 to retrofit a consular building in the Arnona neighborhood to serve as the embassy. The building straddles West Jerusalem and what is called No Man’s Land, a contested area that lies in between the 1949 armistice lines. State Department officials have said they would also look for a site to build an entirely new embassy and transfer most current diplomatic staff there from Tel Aviv.\nWhat happened at the opening ceremony?\nHundreds of U.S. and Israelis attended the event Monday afternoon, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, hosted by U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin led a U.S. delegation that included Republican lawmakers but no Democrats. White House adviser Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter, also attended. The U.S. president addressed the event via video link from Washington.\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com",
