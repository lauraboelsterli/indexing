    "text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan, May 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation Limited (NASDAQ:APWC) (\"APWC\" or the \"Company\"), a leading manufacturer of wire and cable products for the telecommunications and electric-power industries in the Asia-Pacific region, today announced the Company's twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, all data are reported in US dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the event or result reported.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results (Ended December 31, 2017), and 2016 comparative results FY 2017 FY 2016 CHANGE Revenues $ 425.2 million $ 384.6 million 10.6 % Gross Profit $ 39.7 million $ 31.6 million 25.6 % Net Income/(Loss) $ 8.7 million $ 2.9 million 205.6 % EPS (1) $ 0.63 $ 0.21 200.0 % (1) Earnings per share are based on 13.82 million shares issued and outstanding in each of FY 2017 and FY 2016\nFull Year 2017 Results\nRevenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, were $425.2 million, an increase of 10.6%, from $384.6 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a 35.0% revenue increase in the Thailand region due to the Company obtaining more government projects and the appreciation of the Baht against the US dollar and also due to a 8.1% revenue increase in the North Asia region, primarily attributable to an increase in orders transferred from other wire and cable manufacturers who were forced to close by the Chinese government because of strict enforcement of environmental regulations. Revenues in the Company’s ROW region decreased by 14.9%, primarily due to more intense competition from the products imported from China. The Company’s North Asia region includes China and Hong Kong; the Thailand region contains the operations and sales inside Thailand; the ROW region includes Singapore, Australia and the other markets where APWC has operations or sales outside of the Thailand region and North Asia region.\nGross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased by 25.6% to $39.7 million from $31.6 million in the same period last year. Gross margin was up by 13.5%, growing from 8.2% in 2016 to 9.3% in 2017. In the Thailand region, gross margin grew following an increase in our product sales to higher margin Thailand government projects. In the North Asia region, gross margin increased primarily due to the appreciation of RMB against USD while the copper price remained stable, notwithstanding intense competition in the local markets. The ROW region’s gross margin increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to the higher margin distributed products sold by APEC, our Australian operating subsidiaries.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $27.2 million, compared to $26.3 million reported in 2016. Operating income was $16.6 million, compared to operating income of $7.3 million in 2016.\nNet income attributable to APWC shareholders was $8.7 million for the full year of 2017, compared to net income of $2.9 million in 2016. Net income per share was $0.63 in 2017, while a net income of $0.21 per share was reported for 2016. The weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding was 13.82 million in each of 2017 and 2016. Financial Condition\nAPWC reported $46.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $48.2 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCurrent assets totaled $283.0 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $244.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Working capital was $181.8 million as of December 31, 2017. Short term bank loans were $41.2 million at December 31, 2017, up from $28.2 million at the end of 2016. The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2017. Shareholder's equity attributable to APWC was $153.3 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $136.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nAPWC used $16.9 million in cash from operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.0 million of cash provided by operating activities in the corresponding period in 2016. The Company slightly reduced capital expenditures to $4.9 million in 2017, compared to $5.0 million in 2016.\nWe encourage shareholders to visit the Company’s website for further information.\nAbout Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation\nAsia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation is principally engaged in the manufacture and distribution of telecommunications (copper and fiber optic) and power cable and enameled wire products in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Thailand, China, Singapore and Australia.
