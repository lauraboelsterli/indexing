(NYSE: PBF) today reported first quarter 2018 income from operations of $95.7 million as compared to income from operations of $0.8 million of 2017. Excluding special items, first quarter 2018 income from operations was $8.0 million as compared to income from operations of $16.8 million of 2017. Special items 2018 results, which increased operating income, include a net, non-cash, after-tax gain of $64.5 million, or $0.56 per share, lower-of-cost-or-market (\"LCM\") inventory adjustment.\nThe company reported first quarter 2018 net income of $41.8 million and net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $30.4 million or $0.27 per share. This compares to net loss of $20.0 million, and net loss attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $31.1 million or $(0.29) per share 2017. Adjusted fully-converted net loss 2018, excluding special items, was $33.4 million, or $(0.29) per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as described below, compared to an adjusted fully-converted net loss of $22.7 million or $(0.20) per share, 2017. PBF Energy's financial results reflect the consolidation of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX), a master limited partnership of which PBF indirectly owns the general partner and approximately 44.1% of the limited partner interests as of quarter-end.\nTom Nimbley, PBF Energy's Chairman and CEO, said, \"During the first quarter we completed approximately 70 percent of our planned maintenance for the year by executing turnarounds in our East Coast, Gulf Coast and Mid-continent regions. Our Torrance operations were strong during the quarter and with our other assets now out of turnaround, we feel we are well positioned for the coming summer driving season.\" Mr. Nimbley continued, \"Looking forward, market fundamentals appear favorable. Demand continues to drive inventories of gasoline and distillate to more normalized levels and the distillate market in particular appears to be very strong. Our focus remains the safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operation of our five-asset refining system and positioning ourselves to benefit from prevailing market conditions.\"\nPBF announces successful closing of upsized $3.4 billion credit facility\nPBF's subsidiary, PBF Holding Company LLC, announced today that it and certain of its subsidiaries' have entered into a new five year revolving credit agreement.

Our new credit facility provides us with increased financial flexibility and ability to grow.\"\nBank of America N.A. is the Administrative and Collateral Agent for the 28-bank syndicate participating in the facility. Bank of America N.A., ABN Amro Capital USA LLC, BNP Paribas, Citibank N.A., Credit Agricole CIB, Deutsche Bank, MUFG Bank, Ltd., Natixis, Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo acted as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners.

Declares Dividend\nThe company announced today that it will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share of Class A common stock on May 30, 2018, to holders of record as of May 15, 2018.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter 2018, we expect East Coast total throughput to average 340,000 to 360,000 barrels per day; Mid-Continent total throughput is expected to average 150,000 to 160,000 barrels per day; Gulf Coast total throughput is expected to average 180,000 to 190,000 barrels per day and West Coast total throughput is expected to average 155,000 to 165,000 barrels per day.\nFor the full-year 2018, we expect East Coast total throughput to average 330,000 to 350,000 barrels per day; Mid-Continent total throughput is expected to average 150,000 to 160,000 barrels per day; Gulf Coast total throughput is expected to average 175,000 to 185,000 barrels per day and West Coast total throughput is expected to average 160,000 to 170,000 barrels per day.\nAdjusted Fully-Converted Results\nAdjusted fully-converted results assume the exchange of all PBF Energy Company LLC Series A Units and dilutive securities into shares of PBF Energy Inc. Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, resulting in the elimination of the noncontrolling interest and a corresponding adjustment to the company's tax provision.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis earnings release, and the discussion during the management conference call, may include references to Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures including Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (Loss) excluding special items, Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income (Loss) per fully-exchanged, fully-diluted share, gross refining margin, gross refining margin excluding special items, gross refining margin per barrel of throughput, EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), EBITDA excluding special items, Adjusted EBITDA and projected EBITDA related to the refinery acquisitions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\nFOOTNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\n(1) During the third quarter of 2017, we determined that we would revise the presentation of certain line items on our consolidated statements of operations to enhance our disclosure under the requirements of Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X. The revised presentation is comprised of the inclusion of a subtotal within cost and expenses referred to as \"Cost of sales\" and the reclassification of total depreciation and amortization expense between such amounts attributable to cost of sales and other operating costs and expenses. The amount of depreciation and amortization expense that is presented separately within the \"Cost of sales\" subtotal represents depreciation and amortization of refining and logistics assets that are integral to the refinery production process. The historical comparative information has been revised to conform to the current presentation. This revised presentation does not have an effect on our historical condensed consolidated income from operations or net income, nor does it have any impact on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income or statements of cash flows.\n(2) Adjusted fully-converted information is presented in this table as management believes that these Non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare our results across the periods presented and facilitates an understanding of our operating results. We also use these measures to evaluate our operating performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The differences between adjusted fully-converted and GAAP results are explained in footnotes 3 through 7.\n(3) Represents the elimination of the noncontrolling interest associated with the ownership by the members of PBF Energy Company LLC (\"PBF LLC\") other than PBF Energy Inc., as if such members had fully exchanged their Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock.\n(4) Represents an adjustment to reflect our estimated annualized statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 26.4% and 39.4% for the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively, applied to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for all periods presented. The adjustment assumes the full exchange of existing PBF Energy Company LLC Series A Units as described in footnote 3.\n(5) The Non-GAAP measures presented include adjusted fully-converted net income (loss) excluding special items, income from operations excluding special items, EBITDA excluding special items and gross refining margin excluding special items. The special items presented for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and for the three months ended March 31, 2017 relate to a lower of cost or market (\"LCM\") inventory adjustment as discussed further below. Additionally, the cumulative effects of all prior period special items on equity are shown in footnote 14.\nAlthough we believe that Non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of special items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and performance of our business and allow for useful period-over-period comparisons, such Non-GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nLCM inventory adjustment - LCM is a GAAP guideline related to inventory valuation that requires inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market is determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and an LCM inventory adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the current period.\nThe following table shows the LCM inventory reserve as of each date presented (in thousands):\n2018\n2017\nJanuary 1,\n$\n300,456\n$\n595,988\nMarch 31,\n212,803\n612,027\nThe following table includes the corresponding impact of changes in the LCM inventory reserve on income from operations and net income (loss) for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet LCM inventory adjustment benefit (charge) in income from\noperations\n$\n87,653\n$\n(16,039)\nNet LCM inventory adjustment benefit (charge) in net income (loss)\n64,504\n(9,726)\n(6) Represents an adjustment to weighted-average diluted shares outstanding to assume the full exchange of existing PBF LLC Series A Units as described in footnote 3 above.\n(7) Represents weighted-average diluted shares outstanding assuming the conversion of all common stock equivalents, including options and warrants for PBF LLC Series A Units and options for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock as calculated under the treasury stock method (to the extent the impact of such exchange would not be anti-dilutive) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of options and warrants to purchase 3,982,000 and 7,364,616 shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock and PBF LLC Series A Units because they are anti-dilutive for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(8) EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these Non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to our GAAP results in order to provide additional metrics on factors and trends affecting our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures of operating performance that are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n(9) We operate in two reportable segments: Refining and Logistics. Our operations that are not included in the Refining and Logistics segments are included in Corporate. As of March 31, 2018, the Refining segment includes the operations of our oil refineries and related facilities in Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, Toledo, Ohio, New Orleans, Louisiana and Torrance, California. The Logistics segment includes the operations of PBF Logistics LP (\"PBFX\"), a growth-oriented master limited partnership which owns or leases, operates, develops and acquires crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX's assets consist of rail and truck terminals and unloading racks, tank farms and pipelines, a substantial portion of which were acquired from or contributed by PBF LLC and are located at, or nearby, the company's refineries. PBFX provides various rail, truck and marine terminaling services, pipeline transportation services and storage services to PBF Holding and/or its subsidiaries and third party customers through fee-based commercial agreements.\nPBFX currently does not generate significant third party revenue and intersegment related-party revenues are eliminated in consolidation. From a PBF Energy perspective, the Company's chief operating decision maker evaluates the Logistics segment as a whole without regard to any of PBFX's individual segments.\n(10) As reported by Platts.\n(11) Gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel of throughput are Non-GAAP measures because they exclude refinery operating expenses, refinery depreciation and amortization and gross margin of PBFX. Gross refining margin per barrel is gross refining margin, divided by total crude and feedstocks throughput. We believe they are important measures of operating performance and provide useful information to investors because gross refining margin per barrel is a helpful metric comparison to the industry refining margin benchmarks shown in the Market Indicators Tables, as the industry benchmarks do not include a charge for refinery operating expenses and depreciation. Other companies in our industry may not calculate gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel in the same manner. Gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel of throughput have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n(12) Represents refinery operating expenses, including corporate-owned logistics assets, excluding depreciation and amortization, divided by total crude oil and feedstocks throughput.\n(13) We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity less than 24 degrees. We define medium crude oil as crude oil with API gravity between 24 and 35 degrees. We define light crude oil as crude oil with API gravity higher than 35 degrees.\n(14) The total debt to capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total equity. This ratio is a measurement that management believes is useful to investors in analyzing our leverage. Net debt and the net debt to capitalization ratio are Non-GAAP measures. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from total debt. We believe these measurements are also useful to investors since we have the ability to and may decide to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to retire or pay down our debt. Additionally, as described in footnote 5 above, we have also presented the total debt to capitalization and net debt to capitalization ratios excluding the cumulative effects of special items on equity.\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in thousands)\nTotal debt\n$\n2,181,046\n$\n2,191,650\nTotal equity\n2,915,825\n2,902,949\nTotal capitalization\n$\n5,096,871\n$\n5,094,599\nTotal debt\n$\n2,181,046\n$\n2,191,650\nTotal equity excluding special items\n2,898,526\n2,950,154\nTotal capitalization excluding special items\n$\n5,079,572\n$\n5,141,804\nTotal equity\n$\n2,915,825\n$\n2,902,949\nSpecial Items (Note 5)\nAdd: Non-cash LCM inventory adjustment\n212,803\n300,456\nAdd: Change in tax receivable agreement liability\n(276,430)\n(276,430)\nAdd: Debt extinguishment costs\n25,451\n25,451\nLess: Recomputed income taxes on special items\n724\n(22,425)\nAdd: Net tax expense on TCJA related special items\n20,153\n20,153\nNet impact of special items to equity\n(17,299)\n47,205\nTotal equity excluding special items\n$\n2,898,526\n$\n2,950,154\nTotal debt\n$\n2,181,046\n$\n2,191,650\nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n362,963\n573,021\nNet Debt\n$\n1,818,083\n$\n1,618,629\nTotal debt to capitalization ratio\n43\n%\n43\n%\nTotal debt to capitalization ratio, excluding special items\n43\n%\n43\n%\nNet debt to capitalization ratio\n38\n%\n36\n%\nNet debt to capitalization ratio, excluding special items\n39\n%\n35\n%\n(15) The Logistics segment includes 100% of the income from operations of the Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC (\"TVPC\"), as TVPC is consolidated by PBFX. PBFX records net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the 50% equity interest in TVPC held by PBF Holding. PBF Holding (included in the Refining segment) records equity income in investee related to its 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in TVPC. For the purposes of the consolidated PBF Energy financial statements, PBF Holding's equity income in investee and PBFX's net income attributable to noncontrolling interest eliminate in consolidation.\n(16) The Logistics segment includes 100% of the assets of TVPC as TVPC is consolidated by PBFX. PBFX records a noncontrolling interest for the 50% equity interest in TVPC held by PBF Holding. PBF Holding (included in the Refining segment) records an equity investment in TVPC reflecting its noncontrolling ownership interest. For the purposes of the consolidated PBF Energy financial statements, PBFX's noncontrolling interest in TVPC and PBF Holding's equity investment in TVPC eliminate in consolidation.\n(17) The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 effective January 1, 2018. The new guidance requires the bifurcation of net periodic benefit cost. The service cost component is presented within Income from operations, while the other components are reported separately outside of operations. This guidance was applied retrospectively in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, the Company reported income of $278 ($240 related to its Refining segment and $38 related to its Corporate segment) and expense of $101 ($85 related to its Refining segment and $16 related to its Corporate segment), respectively, related to the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost in Other income (expense).\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pbf-energy-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-declares-dividend-of-0-30-per-share-300641804.html\nSOURCE PBF Energy Inc.",
