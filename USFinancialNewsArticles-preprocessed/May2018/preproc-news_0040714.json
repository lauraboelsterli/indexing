    "text": "TOKYO, May 17 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average rose on Thursday after Wall Street gained overnight, with financial stocks rallying on an increase in U.S. bond yields while tech shares attracted buyers after the yen weakened.\nThe Nikkei ended 0.5 percent higher at 22,838.37.\nWall Street indexes ended higher as small-cap stocks surged, even as a rise in U.S. bond yields to near their highest in seven years suggested more competition for equities and investors fretted over global politics.\nJapanese banks and insurers, which invest in higher-yielding products such as foreign bonds, rallied. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group soared 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, while T&D Holdings surged 2.1 percent.\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit 3.10 percent on Wednesday for the first time since July 2011.\n“Investors are still worried about rising U.S. yields. But as long as the yield’s rise is gradual, the market is likely to withstand it,” said Masashi Oda, general manager of the strategic investment department at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management.\nThe weaker yen supported big exporters such as tech companies. Advantest Corp gained 1.6 percent, Kyocera Corp added 1.3 percent and Sumco advanced 2.2 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.5 percent to 1,808.37.
