Photo: State Street Global Advisors\nRakhi Kumar is the head of environmental, social and governance investments and asset stewardship for State Street Global Advisors. The firm has $2.7 trillion under management and garnered international attention last year when it unveiled the bronze statue of “Fearless Girl” near Wall Street in a campaign to push for board diversity. Ms. Kumar spoke with Risk & Compliance Journal in an edited interview about sustainability as part of corporate strategy for long-term returns and how that translates into engagement across the world.\nHow is the current proxy season different from last year’s, when SSGA launched its board diversity campaign?\nMs. Kumar: We are taking voting action and engaging with companies. More companies are clearly aware of the need for greater gender diversity in boardrooms. Some of the biggest changes are in Canada and Japan. Canada’s proxy season is later in the year but we are having some conversations. Companies in Japan understand our position but there is very little commitment to change, they say there’s a lack of talent for senior positions. We will take voting action at Japanese companies. We voted against 500 directors in the U.K., U.S. and Australia last year, and 152 companies that didn’t have a woman on their board actually added one.\nWhat are SSGA’s other priorities this proxy season?\nMs. Kumar: Environmental issues such as climate change and water, and executive compensation. We are looking at how companies are incorporating sustainability in their long-term strategy, at how that ties in with overall compensation and incentives. To understand compensation we need to understand strategy, and within strategy we want to understand sustainability.\nWhat do you think has given rise to an increasingly proactive stance among large investment management firms in recent years?\nMs. Kumar: First there is the rise of stewardship codes. We have been part of the group that led the effort to establish the U.S. framework. Investors are more sophisticated and the idea of risk has also evolved. What has led to some ESG [environmental, social and governance] factors becoming more important is the understanding of the low-probability-but-high-impact nature of these factors such as climate risk, health and safety.\nFor instance, take a food company that didn’t wash its lettuce properly, or a financial company that had flawed sales incentive plans; these aren’t typically high-probability risks. But when they manifest themselves the impact on shareholder value is significant.\nThe 'Fearless Girl' sculpture was installed near Wall Street in New York in March 2017. Photo: JUSTIN LANE/EPA/Shutterstock\nWhat drove SSGA to seek greater engagement with companies on ESG risks?\nMs. Kumar: There are some macro reasons such as the [U.N.-sponsored] Principles on Sustainable Investing and the Stewardship Code, but particularly the say-on-pay rule in the U.S. and other markets brought a sea change with asset managers’ owners.\nWe redesigned our entire program in 2014 to align with who we are as investors. Most of our assets are in long-term strategies. At the same time we saw the rise in ESG focus, as governance is material in every company and the environmental and social factors are important to long-term shareholders. When people say they are concerned the growth of index investing will lead to less corporate governance, it’s just the opposite.\nHow do you identify with which companies to engage?\nMs. Kumar: First we screen by sector and we talk to companies through different regions. This year we are looking at the pharmaceutical sector, materials and retail. We are being proactive in seeking meetings with management and that will account for about 50% of our meetings. In addition we are calling for gender diversity at these companies. We have devised a screen to proactively identify [poor diversity] and we will take voting action. We are taking a comply-or-explain approach, where the company has to explain why they don’t think they need greater diversity, if that is the case.\nIn our framework we try to determine if a company has identified the material ESG risks it is facing, how it is positioned for the future, both for risks and opportunities. About 70% of companies are doing the ‘identify, incorporate and communicate’ process around ESG risks. Some are doing one or two of these steps effectively and there’s about 20% of them not undertaking the steps to establish a sustainable strategy.\nWrite to Mara Lemos Stein at mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com.

Regardless of whether fintech companies decide to become a bank chartered institution, they can increase their potential for success by having solid risk management controls in place. That differentiation might open doors to market share and revenue growth, as well as provide a level of comfort to a variety of stakeholders.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
