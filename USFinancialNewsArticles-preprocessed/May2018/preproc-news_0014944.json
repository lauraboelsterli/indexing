    "text": "MILAN, May 7 (Reuters) - European shares were supported in early trading on Monday by some good earning updates and gains in Nestle after the Swiss-based food giant agreed a tie-up with Starbucks.\nA 12 percent drop in Air France on management turmoil and weakness among financials weighed, however, keeping the pan-European STOXX 600 index up only 0.1 percent, while UK markets were closed for a public holiday, reducing activity.\nNestle rose 0.6 percent after news it will pay $7.15 billion as part of a global coffee alliance in which the food group is getting the rights to market Starbucks products around the world outside U.S. coffee companyâ€™s shops.\nAir France fell 12 percent after its CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday he would resign after staff rejected a pay deal, plunging the airline into turmoil amid a wave of strikes at its French brand that has cost the company 300 million euros.\nOver the weekend, the French government urged Air France managers and unions to resolve the stand-off.\nElsewhere, shares in Danish healthcare equipment maker Ambu and in Norway-focused independent oil company Aker BP rose 8.3 and 4.9 percent respectively following well-received earning updates.
