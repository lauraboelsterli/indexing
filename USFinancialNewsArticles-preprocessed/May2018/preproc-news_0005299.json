    "text": "May 2, 2018 / 11:23 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago Sri Lankan rupee hits all-time low; cenbank intervenes Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nCOLOMBO, May 2 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee hit a fresh low on Wednesday on importer demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said, but recovered after the central bank intervened in the market.\nThe local unit gained for the first time in seven sessions on Tuesday, after hitting a record low in the previous five straight sessions as dollar demand from importers and banks surpassed greenback sales by exporters.\nDeputy central bank governor Nandalal Weerasinghe on Wednesday said the central bank intervened on Tuesday and Wednesday after high volatility.\nThe central bank on Friday said it would intervene to support the rupee when necessary and that there was no reason for the rupee to be under pressure given the country’s record $10 billion foreign currency reserves.\nThe rupee hit an all-time low of 157.90 per dollar during trade, but ended at 157.80/158.00 per dollar, marginally weaker from Tuesday’s close of 157.70/90.\nIt fell 0.9 percent last week and 1.5 percent in April.\n“Still we see downward pressure on the currency because there are some debt outflows expected next week,” a currency dealer said.\nThe rupee has weakened 2.7 percent so far this year. It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 288.6 million rupees so far this year through April 25, central bank data showed. $1 = 156.7000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sunil Nair",
