    "text": "Lawsuit Seeks to Better Integrate New Jersey Schools Updated May 17, 2018 1:42 p.m. ET\nA coalition of civil rights advocates Thursday filed suit against New Jersey to prod the state to better integrate its public schools.\nThe suit organized by the New Jersey Coalition for Diverse and Inclusive Schools argues that residential segregation, along with policies that require most children to attend neighborhood schools, violates students’ right to equal protection and the state constitution’s guarantee of a “thorough and efficient” education.\n“The state has been aware for decades of this intolerable degree of separation by race and poverty, but has never confronted it,” Gary Stein, a retired New Jersey Supreme Court Justice who is the chairman of the coalition, said in a release. The group said children of color in highly segregated schools are more likely to score lower on standardized tests, quit school and skip college.\nFiled in Superior Court in Mercer County on behalf of several children of various racial backgrounds, the suit names as defendants the state Board of Education and Lamont Repollet, acting education commissioner. Spokespeople for the commissioner, board and attorney general’s office didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.\nThe coalition includes leaders of various religious groups and the Latino Action Network, Advocates for Children of New Jersey and NAACP New Jersey State Conference. It was filed on the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 desegregation ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.\nThe coalition says the lawsuit is one of the first filed nationwide since 1964 to challenge statewide school segregation. The issue is contentious in many districts, including New York City, where parents in the Upper West Side and Brooklyn are debating ways to change enrollment policies to diversify classrooms. Some city parents have protested changes that might hurt their children’s access to desirable schools.\nNew Jersey had almost 1.4 million public school students last year in nearly 700 districts: 45% were white, 27% Latino, 16% black and 10% Asian, the suit said. About 270,000 African-American and Latino students attend schools where at least 90% of the students are children of color, the suit said. Of 213,000 black students in New Jersey, about 25% go to public schools where less than 1% of students are white, the suit said.\nThe suit says segregation harms all students, including white students, by creating homogeneous classrooms. “Given the narrowness of their social experiences, students in segregated schools are at greater risk of adopting prejudicial views,” it said.\nThe coalition asks the court to strike down a provision of the law that requires students to almost always attend their local school. It suggests several remedies, such as increasing the number of magnet schools that draw students from urban and suburban areas to learn together, and adding programs that let children attend schools beyond their own districts’ borders.\nThe group cites the creation of magnet schools in Hartford, Conn., and nearby communities, after the Connecticut Supreme Court held that racially segregated public schools violated the state constitution. That magnet school program attracts white students from the suburbs into Hartford for specialized programs.\nPatrick Fletcher, superintendent of River Dell Regional School District in New Jersey, said many students wouldn’t want to leave their own neighborhoods because families often have strong connections to schools as hubs for sports, clubs and social activities. He said that whether suburban, rural or urban, “in any community that has that tie, they will resist the opportunity to go somewhere else.”\nThe suit also asked the court to strike down a provision of state law that requires charter schools to give priority to students from the charter’s home district. Charters are generally opened in high-poverty urban areas that have predominantly black and Latino children, and so typically serve mostly children of color.\nFormer New Jersey education commissioner Christopher Cerf, who is not involved in the litigation, said that it would be a protracted process. “Any lawsuit that seeks to use the courts to upend an established status quo generally has a very heavy burden but the Supreme Court of New Jersey, particularly in the context of race, has been very assertive in its willingness to take on the status quo,” he said. “There is no question the underlying factual allegations are accurate and troubling.”\nWrite to Leslie Brody at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT",
