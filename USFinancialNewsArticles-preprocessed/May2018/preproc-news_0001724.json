He will report directly to Russell Goldsmith, chairman and chief executive officer of City National Bank and chairman of RBC Wealth Management-U.S. Sappington will also report to the bank’s president, Chris Warmuth, who oversees private banking. Sappington will join the executive committee of City National Bank and the senior management committee of RBC Wealth Management-U.S.\n“We are delighted to welcome Bill to City National,” Goldsmith said. “He is a proven and strategic leader with an impressive track record of success in both wealth management and private banking.
