We are also pleased with the early response to our expanded application in breast reconstruction neurotization.”\n“We accelerated investment in our commercial team during the past two quarters, adding 15 direct sales reps and expanding our sales infrastructure with additional investments in sales management, sales training, surgeon education, and marketing,” continued Zaderej. “We believe these organizational changes provide the framework to drive execution of our growth plans throughout the year.”\nAdditional First Quarter and Recent Operational Highlights\nIncreased active accounts in the first quarter to 604, up 30% from 465 a year ago Ended the quarter with 68 direct sales representatives, a 28% increase over the past two quarters, including 10 specialty sales representatives focused on our expanded applications in Oral and Maxillofacial and Breast Reconstruction Neurotization, as well as 19 independent distributors Conducted three national education programs in the first quarter Increased the number of clinical presentations related to our surgical portfolio by thirteen Trained surgeons on the ReSensation™ surgical technique at approximately two-thirds of our targeted breast neurotization centers The investigators of the AxoGen sponsored CHANGE study received the “Hand Journal Award,” a recognition given by the journal’s editorial board to the manuscript that is considered the most impactful and interesting of the year Ended the quarter with $30.6 million in cash compared to $36.5 million at the end of Q4 2017. Net cash burn in Q1 was $5.9 million and includes $2.5 million for payment of the 2017 all-employee annual performance bonuses, awards, and related costs Ended the quarter with $25 million of total bank debt, equivalent to the end of 2017\n“We are seeing a greater focus on both our core markets and our expanded applications at scientific conferences and educational events across the country,” said Zaderej. “This increased awareness of our product portfolio, combined with our investment to further strengthen our commercial organization, leave us well positioned to continue growing our platform for nerve repair.”\n2018 Financial Guidance\nManagement reiterates 2018 revenue will grow at least 40% over 2017 revenue and gross margins will remain above 80%.

We are passionate about helping to restore peripheral nerve function and quality of life to patients with physical damage or discontinuity to peripheral nerves by providing innovative, clinically proven and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and health care providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve, or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves, can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.\nAxoGen's platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products, including Avance ® Nerve Graft, an off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site, AxoGuard ® Nerve Connector, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix (ECM) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves, AxoGuard ® Nerve Protector, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments, and Avive ® Soft Tissue Membrane, a minimally processed human umbilical cord membrane that may be used as a resorbable soft tissue covering to separate tissue layers and modulate inflammation in the surgical bed. Along with these core surgical products, AxoGen also offers AcroVal ® Neurosensory & Motor Testing System and AxoTouch ® Two-Point Discriminator. These evaluation and measurement tools assist health care professionals in detecting changes in sensation, assessing return of sensory, grip, and pinch function, evaluating effective treatment interventions, and providing feedback to patients on peripheral nerve function. The AxoGen portfolio of products is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and several other European and international countries.\nCautionary Statements Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Press Release contains “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations or predictions of future conditions, events, or results based on various assumptions and management's estimates of trends and economic factors in the markets in which we are active, as well as our business plans. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “continue,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding our assessment on our internal control over financial reporting, our growth, our 2018 guidance, product development, product potential, financial performance, sales growth, product adoption, market awareness of our products, data validation, our visibility at and sponsorship of conferences and educational events. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. Forward-looking statements in this release should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect AxoGen's business and its market, particularly those discussed in the risk factors and cautionary statements in AxoGen's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. The forward-looking statements are representative only as of the date they are made and, except as required by law, AxoGen assumes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, we use the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, which measures earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA which further excludes non-cash stock compensation expense. We also use the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Common Share - basic and diluted which excludes non-cash stock compensation expense from Net Loss and Net Loss Per Common Share - basic and diluted, respectively. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of AxoGen’s GAAP financial measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity and that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business.\nContacts:\nAxoGen, Inc.\nPeter J.
