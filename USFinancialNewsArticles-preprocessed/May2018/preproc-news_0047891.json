    "text": "May 22, 2018 / 4:35 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Trump says there is no deal with China to lift ban on ZTE Corp Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nWASHINGTON, May 22 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday said there is no deal with China on ZTE Corp , as lawmakers from both parties worked to block him from easing penalties on the Chinese telecommunications company.\nAccording to sources familiar with discussions on a possible deal, Washington would lift its ban on U.S. firms supplying ZTE in return for agricultural concessions from China. The ban has threatened the viability of ZTE, China’s second-largest telecoms maker.\nTrump made the remarks to reporters ahead of a meeting with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in at the White House.
