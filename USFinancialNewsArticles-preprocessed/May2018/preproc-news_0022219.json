    "text": "DUBLIN, May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced the first quarter of 2018 and updated financial guidance for 2018.\n\"The first quarter was highlighted by strong revenue growth, cash flow generation and execution across the organization that led to significant progress toward our 2018 goals,\" said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. \"The recent submission of our supplemental NDA for Xyrem for pediatric narcolepsy patients and FDA acceptance of our NDA for solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy or OSA result from our focused investment in advancing our promising R&D pipeline. Over the next 18 months, we look forward to fueling our portfolio with innovative product candidates and delivering on multiple regulatory milestones and product launches.\"\nGAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $46.0 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $86.5 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $182.4 million, or $2.98 per diluted share, compared to $141.2 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Reconciliations of applicable GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information are included at the end of this press release.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts and percentages)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nTotal revenues\n$\n444,613\n$\n376,053\n18\n%\nGAAP net income\n$\n45,991\n$\n86,511\n(47)\n%\nAdjusted net income\n$\n182,371\n$\n141,222\n29\n%\nGAAP EPS\n$\n0.75\n$\n1.41\n(47)\n%\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n2.98\n$\n2.31\n29\n%\nTotal Revenues\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nXyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution\n$\n316,777\n$\n272,326\nErwinaze® / Erwinase® (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi)\n50,627\n51,388\nDefitelio® (defibrotide sodium) / defibrotide\n35,061\n35,900\nVyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection\n26,228\n—\nPrialt® (ziconotide) intrathecal infusion\n6,126\n7,717\nOther\n6,028\n6,347\nProduct sales, net\n440,847\n373,678\nRoyalties and contract revenues\n3,766\n2,375\nTotal revenues\n$\n444,613\n$\n376,053\nTotal revenues increased 18% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to an increase in net product sales of Xyrem and the launch of Vyxeos.\nXyrem net product sales increased 16% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nErwinaze/Erwinase net product sales in the first quarter were consistent with the same period in 2017. The company is currently experiencing supply disruptions and expects that there may be further supply challenges during 2018.\nDefitelio/defibrotide net product sales in the first quarter of 2018 were consistent with the same period in 2017. The company continues to expect inter-quarter variability in Defitelio net sales given that veno-occlusive disease is an ultra-rare disease.\nVyxeos net product sales were $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. Vyxeos launched in the U.S. in August 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n2018\n2017\nGAAP:\nCost of product sales\n$\n33,919\n$\n25,065\nGross margin\n92.3\n%\n93.3\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n207,213\n$\n144,255\n% of total revenues\n46.6\n%\n38.4\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n62,667\n$\n44,928\n% of total revenues\n14.1\n%\n11.9\n%\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n2018\n2017\nNon-GAAP adjusted:\nCost of product sales\n$\n32,225\n$\n23,819\nGross margin\n92.7\n%\n93.6\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n131,979\n$\n118,450\n% of total revenues\n29.7\n%\n31.5\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n47,292\n$\n40,786\n% of total revenues\n10.6\n%\n10.8\n%\nOperating expenses changed over the prior year period primarily due to the following:\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis due to higher expenses resulting from expansion of the company's business, including expenses supporting the potential EU launch of Vyxeos and U.S. launch of solriamfetol. SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2018 on a GAAP basis also included an estimated loss contingency of $57.0 million related to an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation of our support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In April 2018, the company reached an agreement in principle with the DOJ on a proposal for a civil settlement of potential claims relating to the investigation, subject to negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement and other contingencies. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis due to an increase in expenses related to the company's ongoing pre-clinical and clinical development programs and regulatory activities. R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2018 on a GAAP basis also included milestone payments of $11.0 million related to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) acceptance for filing of the company's New Drug Application (NDA) for solriamfetol.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $708.2 million, and the outstanding principal balance of the company's long-term debt was $1.8 billion. During the first quarter of 2018, we generated $162.4 million of cash from operations, used $34.5 million to repurchase approximately 238,000 ordinary shares under the company's share repurchase program at an average cost of $145.34 per ordinary share and made milestone payments totaling $11.0 million.\nRecent Developments\nIn March 2018, the FDA accepted for filing with standard review the company's NDA seeking marketing approval for solriamfetol, an investigational medicine for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for an FDA decision is December 20, 2018.\nIn April 2018, the company entered into an agreement with Spark Therapeutics, Inc. to purchase a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (PRV) for $110 million that will allow the company to accelerate the review process by the FDA for one of its future regulatory submissions.\nIn April 2018, the company submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for Xyrem in the treatment of pediatric narcolepsy patients with cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nJazz Pharmaceuticals is updating its full year 2018 financial guidance as follows (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):\nRevenues*\n$1,880-$1,930\nTotal net product sales*\n$1,865-$1,910\n-Xyrem net sales*\n$1,320-$1,350\n-Erwinaze/Erwinase net sales\n$190-$220\n-Defitelio/defibrotide net sales\n$145-$165\n-Vyxeos net sales\n$130-$155\nGAAP gross margin %\n93%\nNon-GAAP adjusted gross margin % 1,5\n93%\nGAAP SG&A expenses*\n$660-$699\nNon-GAAP adjusted SG&A expenses 2,5\n$525-$555\nGAAP R&D expenses*\n$232-$255\nNon-GAAP adjusted R&D expenses 3,5\n$205-$225\nGAAP effective tax rate\n18%-21%\nNon-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate 4,5\n17%-19%\nGAAP net income per diluted share*\n$6.60-$7.70\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share* 5\n$12.75-$13.25\n*\nUpdated May 8, 2018\n1.\nExcludes $6-$9 million of share-based compensation expense from estimated GAAP gross margin.\n2.\nExcludes $78-$87 million of share-based compensation expense and $57 million of estimated loss contingency from estimated GAAP SG&A expenses.\n3.\nExcludes $16-$19 million of share-based compensation expense and $11 million of milestone payments from estimated GAAP R&D expenses.\n4.\nExcludes the income tax effect of adjustments between GAAP reported and non-GAAP adjusted net income.\n5.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.

For more information, please visit www.jazzpharmaceuticals.com and follow us on Twitter at @JazzPharma.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Jazz Pharmaceuticals' financial results and guidance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company uses certain non-GAAP (also referred to as adjusted or non-GAAP adjusted) financial measures in this press release and the accompanying tables. In particular, the company presents non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure) and its line item components, as well as certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures derived therefrom, including non-GAAP adjusted gross margin percentage and non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure) and its line item components exclude from reported GAAP net income (and the related per share measure) and its line item components certain items, as detailed in the reconciliation tables that follow, and in the case of non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure), adjust for the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. In this regard, the components of non-GAAP adjusted net income, including non-GAAP cost of product sales, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and non-GAAP research and development expenses, are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall non-GAAP adjusted net income measure.\nThe company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors and analysts. In particular, the company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors' and analysts' ability to meaningfully compare the company's results from period to period and to its forward-looking guidance, and to identify operating trends in the company's business. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are regularly used by investors and analysts to model and track the company's financial performance. Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management also regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the company's business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part on certain of these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures are important internal measurements for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management, the company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts since these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the company uses in assessing its own operating performance and making operating decisions.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the company's condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the company has ceased, and may in the future cease, to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in this press release and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to Jazz Pharmaceuticals' future financial and operating results, including 2018 financial guidance, the company's expectations for advancing its promising R&D pipeline, fueling its portfolio with innovative product candidates and delivering on multiple regulatory milestones and product launches, the company's expectations for future Erwinaze supply challenges and inter-quarter variability in Defitelio net sales, the company's potential use of the PRV to accelerate the review process by the FDA for one of its future regulatory submissions and other statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on the company's current plans, objectives, estimates, expectations and intentions and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with: maintaining or increasing sales of and revenue from Xyrem, such as the potential U.S. introduction of a generic version of Xyrem before the entry dates specified in the company's settlements with certain companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem or on terms that are different from those contemplated by the settlements; ongoing patent litigation and related proceedings; effectively commercializing the company's other products and product candidates; the time-consuming and uncertain regulatory approval process, including the risk that the company's regulatory submissions, including the solriamfetol NDA, the Xyrem supplemental NDA and the marketing authorization application for Vyxeos in the European Union, may not be approved by applicable regulatory authorities in a timely manner or at all; protecting and enhancing the company's intellectual property rights; delays or problems in the supply or manufacture of the company's products and product candidates; complying with applicable U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory requirements; government investigations and other actions, including the risk that the company may not ultimately reach a final settlement with the DOJ to resolve an investigation relating to the company's support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients; obtaining and maintaining appropriate pricing and reimbursement for the company's products; pharmaceutical product development and the uncertainty of clinical success, including risks related to failure or delays in initiating or completing clinical trials; identifying and acquiring, in-licensing or developing additional products or product candidates, financing these transactions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; potential restrictions on the company's ability and flexibility to pursue share repurchases and future strategic opportunities as a result of its substantial outstanding debt obligations; the ability to achieve expected future financial performance and results and the uncertainty of future tax and other provisions and estimates; and other risks and uncertainties affecting the company, including those described from time to time under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports (Commission File No. 001-33500), including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and future filings and reports by the company, including the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Other risks and uncertainties of which the company is not currently aware may also affect the company's forward-looking statements and may cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the forward-looking statements, even if they are subsequently made available by the company on its website or otherwise. The company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information, future events, changes in its expectations or other circumstances that exist after the date as of which the forward-looking statements were made.\nJAZZ PHARMACEUTICALS PLC\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\nProduct sales, net\n$\n440,847\n$\n373,678\nRoyalties and contract revenues\n3,766\n2,375\nTotal revenues\n444,613\n376,053\nOperating expenses:\nCost of product sales (excluding amortization of intangible assets)\n33,919\n25,065\nSelling, general and administrative\n207,213\n144,255\nResearch and development\n62,667\n44,928\nIntangible asset amortization\n53,007\n25,665\nTotal operating expenses\n356,806\n239,913\nIncome from operations\n87,807\n136,140\nInterest expense, net\n(20,605)\n(18,844)\nForeign exchange loss\n(1,728)\n(1,464)\nIncome before income tax provision and equity in loss of investees\n65,474\n115,832\nIncome tax provision\n19,146\n29,160\nEquity in loss of investees\n337\n161\nNet income\n$\n45,991\n$\n86,511\nNet income per ordinary share:\nBasic\n$\n0.77\n$\n1.44\nDiluted\n$\n0.75\n$\n1.41\nWeighted-average ordinary shares used in per share calculations -
