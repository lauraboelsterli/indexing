    "text": "Published: May 28, 2018 9:03 a.m. ET Share Getty Images July 4, 2017 picture of North -Un (C) celebrating the successful test-fire of the intercontinental ballistic missile\nBy Andrew Jeong Chun Han Wong\nU.S. and North Korean officials met to try to forge an agreement on denuclearization that the leaders of both countries could sign at a summit next month, despite doubts over Pyongyang’s willingness to dismantle its nuclear arsenal.\nThe former U.S. ambassador to Seoul, Sung Kim, met with senior North Korean official Choe Son Hui at the inter-Korean demilitarized zone on Monday to discuss the agenda of the planned summit between President Donald Trump and North Un, originally scheduled to be held June 12 in Singapore.\nSeparate teams from the U.S. and North Korea were due to arrive in Singapore later Monday ahead of preparatory meetings there this week, a person with knowledge of the process said. The delegations are respectively led by Joe Hagin, a White House deputy chief of staff, and Kim Chang Son, a close aide to the North Korean dictator, the person said.\nThe flurry of diplomatic activity signaled an effort by both sides to salvage the talks, which only days ago appeared to have collapsed. Trump had said on Thursday that he would withdraw from the summit with Kim, citing “open hostility” from North Korea. But a hastily arranged meeting of the North and South Korean leaders over the weekend, and a conciliatory statement from Trump, appeared to put the meeting back on course.",
