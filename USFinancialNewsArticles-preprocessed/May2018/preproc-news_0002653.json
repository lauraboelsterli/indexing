It is controlled by the family of businessman Boris Mints.\nIn reply to a Reuters request, Budushchee said that its results were affected by a write-off of around 12 billion roubles following the Otkritie bailout, as well as by a fall last year in the value of shares in VTB bank that it holds in its portfolio.\nBudushchee also said that given that the financial assets its holds are being re-evaluated on a regular basis, it may show a positive re-evaluation if market conditions improve in the future. $1 = 63.3930 roubles Reporting by Katya Golubkova; Editing by Mark Potter and Adrian Croft",
