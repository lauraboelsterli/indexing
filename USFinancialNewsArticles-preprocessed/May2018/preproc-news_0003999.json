    "text": "May 4, 2018 / 4:47 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano erupts, forcing evacuations Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Reuters) - The Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island came to life on Thursday, belching ash into the sky and spewing fountains of lava in a residential area where people were ordered to leave their homes, officials said.\nThe eruption occurred after a series of earthquakes on the island over the last couple of days, including a 5.0 tremor at about 10:30 a.m., the U.S. Geological Survey reported on its website.\nResidents in the Puna community of Leilani Estates, home to about 1,700 people, were ordered to evacuate after public works officials reported steam and lava emissions from a crack at about 4:30 p.m. local time, according to media and the county’s Civil Defense Agency.\nResident Ikaika Marzo told Hawaii News Now that he saw “fountains” of lava as high as 125 feet (38 m). Other residents also told the news network that they smelled burning brush and heard tree branches snapping.\nFootage from a drone aired on the Hawaii News Now website showed lava incinerating trees as it crept near structures.\nTwo emergency shelters were opened to take in evacuees, the Civil Defense Agency said.\nGovernor David Ige tweeted that he had activated the Hawaii National Guard to provide help in the emergency response.

Lava flows from the volcano, one of five on the island, have covered 48 square miles (125 sq km), according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nThe leading edge of the lava can reach temperatures of about 2,100 Fahrenheit (1,150 Celsius).
