    "text": "SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” A former insurance company employee who was fired following an arrest has been awarded more than $18 million in damages.\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune reports a San Diego jury awarded 55-year-old Michael Tilkey about $2.6 million in actual damages and nearly $16 million in punitive damages in his in wrongful termination lawsuit.\nTilkey was fired by Allstate Insurance Co. in 2016 after he was arrested in Arizona the prior year following an argument he had with his then-girlfriend. Charges against him were later dismissed.\nHis attorney Joann Rezzo says the firing violated state labor law, which prohibits employers from considering arrest records that don't result in a conviction in a decision to terminate an employee.\nAn Allstate spokeswoman says the company disagrees with the verdict and plans to appeal.\nInformation from: The San Diego Union-Tribune, http://www.utsandiego.com",
