    "text": "How getting remarried can mess up your Social Security\nThe risk with these methods is that there is pressure to come to a deal, and there can be financial blind spots in the process, according to Jeffrey A. Landers, a divorce financial strategist and president of Bedrock Divorce Advisors in New York City.\nYou may have to take your spouse's word on certain areas like bank accounts or closely held businesses because those records cannot be subpoenaed, he said.\n\"I tell my clients, 'Look, you don't have to agree to anything,'\" Landers said. \"If you can't come to a reasonable agreement, then don't agree to anything.\" 5) Look at the big picture\nYou want to strike a balance between protecting your interests and being willing to bargain.\nThe key is to try not to get too hung up on any one area of the deal.\n\"Virtually everything is on the table, so don't get set on one thing or one set of things that you're not willing to negotiate with your spouse,\" said Russ Thornton, a financial advisor at Wealthcare for Women in Atlanta.\nIf you have children together , keep in mind that some financial concessions could help keep peace in the family long term. \"You are going to see them at every baptism, wedding and funeral,\" Gorman said. Adrian Weinbrecht | Getty Images 6) Focus on what's best for you\nWhat worked for your friend, neighbor or family member in their divorce will not necessarily apply to your situation. And if you let outside advice confuse you, it could muddle the divorce process.\n\"Your situation is unique, regardless of what you've heard or read or been told about someone else's experience with divorce,\" Thornton said.\nYou also want to remember that dissolving your marriage is emotionally taxing. By seeing a therapist and exercising or meditating, you can make sure you are in the right frame of mind.\n\"Do the things to ensure you don't get triggered during the process, because that will drive up the costs,\" Buonincontri said.
