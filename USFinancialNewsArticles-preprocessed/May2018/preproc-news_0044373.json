    "text": "NEW YORK, May 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) and Cox Communications, owners of NCC Media, announced the national advertising sales, marketing and technology company has named programmatic ad pioneer Nicolle Pangis to serve as president and CEO. Pangis will lead NCC in the next phase of the company's development, building upon its strength in linear TV to introduce a scaled, data-driven media business for both linear and addressable buying.\nAs NCC president and CEO, Pangis will lead all revenue, business operations and technology development with a focus on partnering with and empowering brands to connect with audiences at scale wherever and whenever they watch content. Pangis previously served as global chief operating officer at GroupM's [m] PLATFORM where she oversaw strategic partnerships, product management and technology development.\n\"NCC has an excellent reputation in the linear ad space, and will now extend that leadership position into the advanced ad business,\" said David Kline, Executive Vice President and President of Media Sales at Charter Communications. \"Nicolle, now armed with premium multi-screen television content, great viewership insights and the scale required to deliver on advertisers needs combined with her past experiences in programmatic digital is the perfect combination needed to drive NCC to great heights.\"\n\"As digital continues to increase, media dollars consolidate and new content enters the market, NCC will provide the advertising ecosystem with a consistent offering that combines the best of television with that of digital,\" said Marcien Jenckes, President of Advertising at Comcast Cable. \"Nicolle is the perfect person to lead the charge at NCC. She understands the needs of marketers and the complete media landscape.\"\n\"NCC Media is a trusted media partner for many of the world's largest advertisers and I'm thrilled to join the company as we launch the next phase in our development,\" said Nicolle Pangis, President and CEO, NCC Media. \"I'm excited to build out the teams and platforms that truly unlock the best of NCC Media and empower our partners and brands with the best products as the evolution of addressable media continues.\"\nPrior to [m]PLATFORM, Pangis was a central figure in the success of Xaxis, a pioneering programmatic digital media business, serving first as global chief revenue officer, followed by global chief operating officer. Key highlights include launching the company's machine learning technology team and playing an instrumental role in the sale of Open AdStream to Appnexus. A recognized leader in the media industry, Pangis has been named to the Adweek 50 list, Ad Age's 40 Under 40, Business Insider's 30 Most Powerful Women in Mobile and Crain's 40 Under 40 and honored as a Working Mother of the Year by Working Mother Media and Advertising Women of New York.\n\"We are excited to have Nicolle on board to lead NCC's transition,\" said Billy Farina, Senior Vice President at Cox Media. \"This is another step in future-proofing NCC and clear sign that we are reinventing the business to meet the demands of brands and marketers.\"\nIn April, NCC made the first step in its transition and announced the creation of a new division within the organization to design, deploy and sell unified advertising solutions across NCC's participants' national footprint. The group will build products that deliver targeted audiences across linear and video on demand (VOD) platforms. It will drive research, data and analytic capabilities to provide advertisers and agencies with the ability to measure the effectiveness of an advertisement and simplify how they manage campaigns.\nAbout Charter\nCharter Communications Inc.
