    "text": "DUBAI, May 28 (Reuters) - Qatari stocks led regional gains on Monday, with other markets generally subdued amid sluggish trading volumes during Ramadan.\nThe Qatar index was up 1.2 percent in early trading, with Qatar National Bank rising by 2.9 percent.\nThe region’s largest bank has been bolstered in recent months by its move to increase its foreign ownership ceiling to 49 percent from 25 percent to boost its weighting on global indexes.\nIndustries Qatar, which has the largest weighting on the index, rose by 1.9 percent.\nQatar stocks have also been boosted by a government announcement last week that it was moving ahead with a draft law to allow full foreign ownership of companies.\nSaudi’s main stock index dropped by 0.2 percent, with Savola Group and developer Dar Al Arkan Real Estate both down 2 percent.\nThe Abu Dhabi index was up 0.4 percent, helped by a 1.9 percent rise for Dana Gas after it said it had received $40 million in payments from the Egyptian government.\nThe Dubai index was broadly flat, edging up by 0.1 percent.
