    "text": "Conference Call and Webcast Scheduled for Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET\nMALVERN, Pa., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Recro Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:REPH), a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company focused on therapeutics for the hospital and other acute care settings, today announced that it will report first quarter financial results on Wednesday, May 9, 2018. Recro's management team will host a conference call and audio webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 to discuss the financial results and recent operational highlights.\nTo access the conference call, please dial (844) 243-4691 (local) or (225) 283-0379 (international) at least 10 minutes prior to the start time and refer to conference ID 1133709. A live audio webcast of the call will be available under \"Events\" in the Investor section of the Company's website, https://ir.recropharma.com/events . An archived webcast will be available on the Company's website approximately two hours after the event and will be available for 60 days.\nAbout Recro Pharma, Inc.\nRecro Pharma is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates through two business divisions, an Acute Care, hospital product division and a revenue-generating contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO division, located in Gainesville, GA. The Acute Care division is primarily focused on developing innovative products for hospital and other acute care settings. The Company’s lead product candidate is a proprietary injectable form of meloxicam, a long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor. IV meloxicam has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical efficacy trials, a large double blind placebo-controlled Phase III safety trial, four Phase II clinical efficacy trials, as well as other safety studies. In 2017, Recro submitted the NDA for IV meloxicam to the FDA for review, it was accepted by the FDA and there is a late May 2018 PDUFA date. As injectable meloxicam is in the non-opioid class of drugs, the Company believes it will overcome many of the issues associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, including respiratory depression, constipation, excessive nausea and vomiting, as well as having no addictive potential while maintaining meaningful analgesic effects for relief of pain. The Company’s CDMO division leverages its formulation expertise to develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products using its proprietary delivery technologies and other manufacturing services for commercial partners who commercialize or plan to commercialize these products. These collaborations can result in revenue streams including royalties, profit sharing, research and development and manufacturing fees, which support continued operations for its CDMO division and it contributes non-dilutive funding for the development and pre-commercialization activities of its Acute Care division.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that involve risks and uncertainties.
