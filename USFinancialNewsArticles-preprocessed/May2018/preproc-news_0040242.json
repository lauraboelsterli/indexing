REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme/File Photo\nThe investigation will take 180 days and could be extended by up to 120 days, the ministry said in a statement.\nThe ministry said earlier this week its initial probe suggested the deal might have violated antitrust law\nIt warned last month the transaction could be blocked if Uber and Grab’s combined market share in Vietnam exceeded 50 percent, the maximum allowed in the country.\nUber [UBER.UL] and Grab announced a deal in March under which Uber would take a 27.5 percent stake in Grab in exchange for its Southeast Asian business.\nThe U.S. company had previously sold operations in China and Russia to local rivals.\nUber and Grab did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comments.
