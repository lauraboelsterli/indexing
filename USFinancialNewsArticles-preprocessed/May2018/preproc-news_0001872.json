(NASDAQ: COHR), one of the world's leading providers of lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of scientific, commercial and industrial applications, today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 30,\nApril 1,\nMarch 31,\nApril 1,\n2018\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2017\nGAAP Results\n(in millions except per share data)\nNet sales\n$\n481.1\n$\n477.6\n$\n422.8\n$\n958.7\n$\n768.9\nNet income\n$\n65.3\n$\n41.9\n$\n41.8\n$\n107.2\n$\n72.3\nDiluted EPS\n$\n2.61\n$\n1.67\n$\n1.69\n$\n4.29\n$\n2.93\nNon-GAAP Results\n(in millions except per share data)\nNet income\n$\n84.3\n$\n88.6\n$\n72.1\n$\n172.9\n$\n135.5\nDiluted EPS\n$\n3.37\n$\n3.54\n$\n2.91\n$\n6.91\n$\n5.49\n2018 SECOND FISCAL QUARTER DETAILS\nFor the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, Coherent announced net sales of $481.1 million and net income, on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, of $65.3 million, or $2.61 per diluted share. These results compare to net sales of $422.8 million and net income of $41.8 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $84.3 million, or $3.37 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $72.1 million, or $2.91 per diluted share. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017 and April 1, 2017 and six months ended March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017 appear in the financial statements portion of this release under the heading \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP net income.\"\nNet sales of fiscal 2018 were $477.6 million and net income, on a GAAP basis, was $41.9 million, or $1.67 per diluted share. These results include additional income tax expense of $41.7 million, or $1.67 per diluted share due to the provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as a benefit of $12.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share from the adoption of new rules for accounting for excess tax benefits and deficiencies for employee stock-based compensation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued rules that allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. Coherent currently anticipates finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the quarter ending September 29, 2018. Non-GAAP net income of fiscal 2018 was $88.6 million, or $3.54 per diluted share.\nAs previously announced, on November 7, 2016, Coherent completed its acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. (\"Rofin\"), one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components. As a result, Rofin's operating results were consolidated for the period from November 7, 2016 through April 1, 2017 in Coherent's six months results ended April 1, 2017. Subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Rofin's operating results are consolidated in Coherent's results for the full quarter and year-to-date.\n\"We experienced a surge in demand across a number of end markets during our second fiscal quarter. Orders for high power fiber lasers were up significantly from metal cutting OEMs in China, Tier 1 automotive component suppliers and EV battery manufacturers. Semiconductor capital equipment orders benefitted from high fab utilization rates and Chinese IC investments as part of Made in China 2025. Bookings across the OEM component and instrumentation space were up due to annual buys in bioinstrumentation, strength from medical OEMs and increasing opportunities in defense and aerospace.\nOur Fiscal 2018 outlook on the FPD business is largely unchanged and the supply chain issue discussed last quarter has been resolved. FPD service demand was similar to last quarter and is expected to accelerate into the second half of the year,\" said John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\"We also made our first investment in the metal additive manufacturing market with the acquisition of privately-held OR Laser, which has developed a compact tool to enable process development across multiple markets, as well as provide production capability for the dental, medical and jewelry markets. OR also developed proprietary software that is intuitive to use and does not require third party add-ons to go from CAD modeling to printed parts. Future projects will be directed towards the automotive and aerospace markets. In addition to the OR investment, we have continued making voluntary prepayments on our debt. The most recent prepayment of €60 million brings the total voluntary reduction to €285 million,\" Ambroseo added.\nCONFERENCE CALL REMINDER\nThe Company will host a conference call today to discuss its financial results at 1:30 P.M. Pacific (4:30 P.M. Eastern). A listen-only broadcast of the conference call and a transcript of management's prepared remarks can be accessed on the Company's website at http://www.coherent.com/Investors/ .
