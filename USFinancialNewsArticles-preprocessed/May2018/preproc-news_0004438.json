(NYSE:GTT), the leading global cloud networking provider to multinational clients, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter highlights:\nRevenue of $260.7 million grew 40.2% over 1Q17 and grew 4.6% over 4Q17. Net loss was $30.7 million, compared to net loss of $13.1 million in 1Q17 and net loss of $49.5 million in 4Q17. 1Q18 net loss was primarily the result of several non-recurring costs, including $7.8 million in exit, transaction and integration costs related to the Custom Connect, Accelerated Connections and Interoute acquisitions, and $17.2 million expense related to a foreign currency hedge entered into in anticipation of the Interoute acquisition. 4Q17 net loss included several significant nonrecurring costs, primarily related to taxes. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) of $62.7 million grew 23.4% over 1Q17 and grew 3.1% over 4Q17. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.1% compared to 27.3% in 1Q17 and 24.4% in 4Q17. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year is due to the Global Capacity acquisition, which had lower standalone margins; on a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA margin actually increased (see page 9). Capital expenditures were $13.2 million (5.1% of revenue) compared to $8.5 million in 1Q17 (4.6% of revenue) and $15.2 million in 4Q17 (6.1% of revenue). Using constant currency (i) 1Q18 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA would have been lower than reported by $4.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, compared to 1Q17, and (ii) 1Q18 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA would have been lower than reported by $1.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, compared to 4Q17.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming (i) Global Capacity’s historical results had been included for all periods presented, and (ii) constant currency:\n1Q18 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, over 1Q17. 1Q18 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.0% and 2.6%, respectively, over 4Q17.\nSee “Annex A: Non-GAAP Financial Information” for more information regarding the computation of Adjusted EBITDA, constant currency and pro forma calculations.\nConference Call Information\nGTT will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 3rd, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.

For these purposes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) defines a “non-GAAP financial measure” as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions or cash flows that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in financial statements, and (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to investors to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better evaluate our performance and profitability. These measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for GAAP, and they may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude severance, restructuring and other exit costs; acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; losses on extinguishment of debt; stock-based compensation; and, from time to time, other non-cash or nonrecurring items.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures we use for planning and forecasting future periods. We further believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and makes it easier to compare our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. In addition, we have debt covenants that are based on a leverage ratio that utilizes a modified EBITDA calculation, as defined in our Credit Agreement. The modified EBITDA calculation is similar to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however, it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the applicable reporting period. Finally, Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to our employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures\nAdjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, which we also refer to as capital expenditures, is a performance measure that is used to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support our expected revenue and to provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies that may utilize different strategies for providing access to fiber-based services and related infrastructure. We use a “capex light” strategy, which means we purchase last-mile services and select core IP network services from other providers on an as-needed basis, pursuant to our customers’ requirements. Many other telecommunications companies spend significant amounts of capital expenditures to construct their own fiber networks and data centers and attempt to purchase as little as possible from other providers. As a result of our strategy, we typically have lower Adjusted EBITDA margins compared to other providers but also spend much less on capital expenditures relative to our revenue. We believe it is important to take both of these factors into account when evaluating our performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures from Net (Loss) Income (amounts in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (30.7 ) $ (13.1 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 1.6 (11.5 ) Interest and other expense, net 38.3 15.9 Loss on debt extinguishment -\n5.7 Depreciation and amortization 39.8 30.4 Severance, restructuring and other exit costs 1.9 10.7 Transaction and integration costs 5.9 8.1 Share-based compensation 5.9 4.6 Adjusted EBITDA 62.7 50.8 Purchases of property and equipment (13.2 ) (8.5 ) Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures $ 49.5 $ 42.3 Constant Currency\nWe evaluate our results of operations both as reported and on a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency data offers valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency results by converting our current-period local currency financial results using prior-period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior-period reported results.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, from time to time we may use or publicly disclose certain “pro forma” financial measures in the course of our financial presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls and otherwise. We believe these certain pro forma financial measures provide a more comparable view of our results relative to prior periods, particularly given the number of acquisitions we have completed in the past.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017, the following unaudited financial information presents historical GTT information as if the acquisition of Global Capacity had occurred on the first day of the period presented, as reported and in constant currency:\n($ in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenue GTT as reported $ 260.7 $ 186.0 Global Capacity, net of pro forma adjustments (1) -\n54.3 Pro Forma Revenue $ 260.7 $ 240.3 Pro Forma % Growth 8.5 % Pro Forma % Growth (Constant Currency) 6.7 % Adjusted EBITDA GTT as reported $ 62.7 $ 50.8 Global Capacity, net of pro forma adjustments (2) -\n3.8 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA $ 62.7 $ 54.6 Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin % 24.1 % 22.7 % Pro Forma % Growth 14.8 % Pro Forma % Growth (Constant Currency) 13.7 % (1) Pro forma adjustments include revenue recognized by acquired companies from GTT, net of revenue recognized by GTT from acquired companies prior to their respective close dates, as well as adjustments in deferred revenue from acquired companies.
