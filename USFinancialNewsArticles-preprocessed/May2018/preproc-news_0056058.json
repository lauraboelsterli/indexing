Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro in action during his first round match against France's Nicolas Mahut REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nThe big Argentine was feeble in the opening set, winning just one game, but he picked up the pace to claim a 1-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 victory on Court Suzanne Lenglen.\nDel Potro, whose career has been plagued by wrist injuries, withdrew from the this monthâ€™s Rome Masters with a groin injury, sparking fears about his prospects in Paris. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 29, 2018 France's Nicolas Mahut in action during his first round match against Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\nWhen he lost the first set in 25 minutes it looked ominous for the 29-year-old but there looked nothing wrong with his movement as he powered past the world number 116.\nFormer U.S. Open champion Del Potro is playing at Roland Garros for only the second time since 2012 and will be a danger in the top half of the draw.
