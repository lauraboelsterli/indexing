Nobody can see how the energy transition will play out over this period,” van Beurden said.\nThe previous two climate resolutions tabled by Follow This in 2016 and 2017 won the support of 2.8 percent and 6.3 percent of the votes, respectively.\nLast week, a group of 60 global investors urged companies to do more to reduce emissions and become more transparent about their plans.\nShell announced late last year an ambition to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2035 and by half by 2050. The targets will include all of Shell’s operations as well as emissions from products consumed by consumers.\nProducing and burning of oil and gas account for around 50 percent of global carbon emissions.\nReporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
