    "text": "May 17, 2018 / 2:53 PM / in 10 minutes Chile copper mine Sierra Gorda reopens following fatal accident Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nSANTIAGO, May 17 (Reuters) - The Chilean copper mine Sierra Gorda, controlled by Polish firm KGHM has returned to normal operations after a temporary shutdown due to a fatal accident earlier this week involving a contract worker, a KGHM spokesman said on Thursday.\nThe man, an employee of equipment supply company Finning, died on Tuesday morning during routine maintenance work. The spokesman told Reuters that normal operations were restored on Wednesday. I\nKGHM took control of Sierra Gorda in 2011 when it bought the Canadian company Quadra FNX for $2.1 billion. The remaining 45 percent of the deposit belongs to Japan’s Sumitomo.\nSierra Gorda produced 101,700 tonnes of Chile’s 5.5 million-tonne total copper output last year.
