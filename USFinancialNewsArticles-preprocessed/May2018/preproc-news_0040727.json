GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump says 'We'll see' on N.Korea summit, to insist on denuclearization U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged on Wednesday it was unclear if his summit with North Korea would go ahead after Pyongyang threatened to pull out of the unprecedented meeting, a move that could deny him a potentially major foreign policy achievement. • U.S., China to launch trade talks; China hawk Navarro's role reduced -officials The United States and China launch trade talks on Thursday in a bid to avert a damaging tariff war, with the White House's harshest China critic relegated to a supporting role, senior Trump administration officials said on Wednesday. • Malaysia police seize handbags, other personal items from ex-PM's home Malaysian police seized handbags and few other personal items from the home of former prime minister Najib Razak in connection with a money laundering probe, a lawyer of the ex-leader said. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading almost flat at 10,768.50. • Indian government bonds are likely to fall in early trade tracking sharp overnight gains in U.S. Treasury yields and crude oil prices. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.90 percent-7.96 percent band today. • The Indian rupee will likely open higher against the dollar amid a mild recovery in emerging market currencies. GLOBAL MARKETS • Retail and technology stocks led Wall Street higher on Wednesday and the small-cap Russell 2000 hit a record peak, even as a rise in U.S. bond yields to an almost seven-year high suggested more competition for equities and investors fretted over geopolitics. • Asian shares held steady, while the euro struggled near five-month lows set a day earlier following a report that Italian populist parties trying to form a coalition could ask the European Central Bank to forgive 250 billion euros of debt. • The dollar stood tall against a basket of currencies, as the euro retreated to a five-month low on concerns the political developments in Italy could cause wider disruptions in the common currency bloc. • U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday as the 10-year yield reached seven-year highs and tested key technical support at 3.10 percent, which may touch off another wave of bond sales if it rises much further above that level. • Oil prices firmed, with Brent crude creeping ever closer to $80 per barrel, a level it has not seen since November 2014, as supplies tighten while demand remains strong. • Gold prices were mostly steady after touching their lowest level this year in the previous session, with the U.S. dollar hovering below its 2018-peak.
