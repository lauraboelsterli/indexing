Angelini, the longtime chairman of the company's board of directors, will retire from the board effective today, after more than 30 years of distinguished service to the company and its affiliates. The Hanover's governance guidelines prohibit directors from continuing beyond age 75.\nAngelini, 75, joined The Hanover's board in 1995 and served as its first chairman from 2002 to 2017, when he was succeeded by current board Chairman P. Kevin Condron. In addition to his role as chairman, Angelini has served as a member of the company's audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees. He currently is chairman of Bowditch & Dewey, LLC, a leading law firm representing businesses, families and institutions throughout the Northeast Region.\nAs chairman, Angelini played a key role in the successful evolution of the company, from a small, regional property and casualty insurer to a national company with a global reach.

I am very confident the company will continue to thrive, building on its unique business model, the strength of its workforce and its cultural dedication to excellence and inclusiveness.
