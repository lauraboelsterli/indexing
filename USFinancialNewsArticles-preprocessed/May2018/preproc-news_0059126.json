    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday slammed Ukraine’s staged murder of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko was an “anti-Russian provocation.”\nBabchenko, a dissident journalist who was reported murdered in Kiev, dramatically reappeared alive on Wednesday in the middle of a briefing by Ukrainian security officials about his own killing. He said had been part of a special Ukrainian operation to thwart a Russian attempt on his life.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Larry King\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
