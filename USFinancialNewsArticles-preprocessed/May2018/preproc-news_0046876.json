May 6, 2018; St. Petersburg, FL, USA; Toronto Blue Jays relief pitcher Roberto Osuna (54) delivers a pitch in the eighth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. Mandatory Credit: Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\nIn a tweet by its communications department, the league announced Osuna’s leave is extended through May 28, the second such extension thus far during its investigation. The leave means that Osuna will continue to collect on his $5.3 million salary but cannot play.\nOsuna, 23, was originally placed on leave on May 8 after he was charged with one account of assault in Toronto. While details about the charge have not been released, Gregor Chisholm of MLB.com reported May 8 that the alleged victim is female.\nOsuna is scheduled to appear in court on June 18.\nAccording to reports, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred could suspend Osuna with or without pay, depending on the legal outcome of Osuna’s case.\nThe four-year MLB veteran was a first-time All-Star last season, saving 39 games and leading the league with 58 games finished. Osuna has 104 saves while averaging 10.2 strikeouts per nine innings in his career.\n—Field Level Media",
