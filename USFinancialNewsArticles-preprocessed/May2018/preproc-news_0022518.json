(NASDAQ:SIEN) (“Sientra” or the “Company”), a medical aesthetics company, today announced its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJeffrey M. Nugent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Sientra, said, “We achieved the highest net revenue in the Company’s history which further reinforced our diversification strategy and will serve as the foundation for another transformational year of growth and expansion. With the recent FDA approval of our PMA supplement, we anticipate that the commercialization of our OPUS-branded silicone breast implants with strong 10-year clinical data and our new Sientra Platinum20™ warranty program will drive market share gains as we strengthen our commitment to the safety, reliability and quality of our products. We also expect that the enhanced protocol for miraDry fresh combined with our recently launched digital marketing campaign will drive meaningful contributions under an expanded commercial organization. Looking ahead, we are excited to continue leveraging our exceptional products, people, and relationships to take share across segments and drive value as a diversified global aesthetics company.”\nMr. Nugent concluded, “Over the last two years, we have successfully navigated through the key initiatives needed to put Sientra in a better position today to capture and drive market share growth. Following a successful follow-on equity offering which generated net proceeds of approximately $108 million, the Company is now well capitalized to execute on our strategic growth initiatives.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nTotal net sales for the first quarter 2018 were $14.7 million, an increase of 96% compared to total net sales of $7.5 million for the same period in 2017. Total net sales increased 30% on a pro forma basis year over year compared to pro forma total net sales of $11.3 million in first quarter 2017.\nNet sales for the Breast Products segment totaled $8.5 million in the first quarter 2018, a 14% increase compared to $7.5 million for first quarter 2017, driven primarily by the continued strong performance of the Company’s breast tissue expanders and record sales of our BIOCORNEUM ® scar management product.\nNet sales for the miraDry segment totaled $6.1 million in the first quarter 2018. There were no sales on a GAAP basis in the first quarter 2017 and there were $3.8 million on a pro forma basis. On a pro forma basis this represents a 61% increase for the miraDry segment.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.6 million, or 58% of sales, compared to gross profit of $5.2 million, or 69% of sales, for the same period in 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the inclusion of miraDry and the higher mix of capital and international sales which carry a lower gross margin than Breast Products.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $27.5 million, an increase of $10.9 million or 66%, compared to operating expenses of $16.6 million for the same period in 2017. Operating expenses in the first quarter 2018 were driven higher primarily by the inclusion of miraDry and the significant investment in its sales and marketing teams.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was ($19.4) million, or ($0.99) per share, compared to a net loss of ($11.4) million, or ($0.61) per share, for the same period in 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported adjusted EBITDA loss of $(15.4) million for the first quarter 2018, compared to a loss of $(9.3) million for the first quarter 2017. The year over year increase can be mainly attributed to the inclusion of miraDry.\nNet cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $16.1 million compared to $26.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2017. as of March 31, 2018 do not include total net proceeds of approximately $108 million from the Company’s recently completed follow-on common stock offering nor does the figure include $10.0 million of cash from the drawdown of the Company’s remaining tranche of term debt under its credit facility with MidCap Financial Services and Silicon Valley Bank following FDA PMA supplement approval.\nAdditional information on the Company’s financial results can be found in Sientra’s Supplemental Financial and Operational Information schedule by visiting the Investor Relations section of Sientra’s website at www.sientra.com .\nConference Call\nSientra will hold a conference call on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the results.\nThe dial-in numbers are (844) 464-3933 for domestic callers and (765) 507-2612 for international callers. The conference ID is 6447955. A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.sientra.com .\nA replay of the call will be available starting on May 9, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. PT/7:30 p.m. ET, through May 16, 2018 at 8:59 p.m. PT/11:59 p.m. ET.

The webcast will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website for 30 days following the completion of the call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSientra has supplemented its US GAAP net income (loss) with a non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the Company, facilitates a more meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results, and assists management in analyzing future trends, making strategic and business decisions and establishing internal budgets and forecasts. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the schedule below.\nThere are limitations in using this non-GAAP financial measure because it is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with Sientra’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure provided in the schedule below.\nAbout Sientra\nHeadquartered in Santa Barbara, California, Sientra is a medical aesthetics company committed to making a difference in patients’ lives by enhancing their body image, growing their self-esteem and restoring their confidence.
