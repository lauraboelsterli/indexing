    "text": "HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United-Guardian, Inc. (NASDAQ:UG) reported today that net income for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 67% and gross sales increased by 28% compared with last year’s first quarter. Net income for the quarter jumped from $634,435 ($0.14 per share) to $1,059,862 ($0.23 per share), and gross sales increased from $2,872,722 to $3,666,947.\nKen Globus, President of United-Guardian, stated, “Our strong first quarter results were due to both increased sales of our cosmetic ingredients, which were up 43% over last year’s first quarter, and strong sales of our pharmaceutical products, particularly our Renacidin ® Irrigation. We are once again receiving steady orders for one of our Lubrajel ® products for sale in China. We are also excited about the reception our new Lubrajel Marine has received in the marketplace. Although it takes time for new cosmetic ingredients to find their way into new cosmetic formulations, we are optimistic that by the end of this year we will start to see larger orders for that product as customer formulations are finalized. We are also hopeful that our new Renacidin web site ( www.renacidin.com ) and our new social media campaign for that product, which is intended to make more patients and physicians aware of the product and should begin shortly, will also lead to increased sales. Based on the excellent first quarter results, as well as strong April sales, we are optimistic that this is going to be a strong year for us, and that the promising sales trend we have experienced so far this year will continue.”\nUnited-Guardian is a manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients, personal and health care products, pharmaceuticals, and specialty industrial products.\nContact:\nRobert S.
