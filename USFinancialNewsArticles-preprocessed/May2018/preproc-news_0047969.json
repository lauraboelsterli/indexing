Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Villarreal vs Real Madrid - Estadio de la Ceramica, Villarreal, Spain - May 19, 2018 Real Madrid's Toni Kroos in action with Villarreal's Rodri REUTERS/Heino Kalis\n“Our club has reached an agreement with Villarreal for the transfer of Rodri. The midfielder, who is from Madrid will be an Atletico player as of July 1 for the next five seasons,” said a statement from the La Liga runners-up.\nThe 21-year-old made his Spain debut in a 1-1 draw against Germany in a friendly on March 23. He was left out of Julen Lopetegui’s 23-man squad for next month’s World Cup in Russia but has been named in the seven-player reserve list.\nRodri came through Atletico’s youth academy but finished his footballing education at Villarreal, making his Liga debut in 2016. He played in 37 of the team’s 38 league games this past campaign, in which they finished fifth in the standings. Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
