A man walks past the Deutsche Bank offices during a snow storm in Manhattan's financial district in New York January 21, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\nThe bank will relocate to One Columbus Circle from 60 Wall Street, according to an internal memo to employees.\nThe move is expected to start in the third quarter of 2021 and will be completed in 2022, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThe new location will consolidate the bank’s New York presence and would reduce its commercial presence in the city by 30 percent, according to the memo.\nChief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said last month that the bank would cut back bond and equities trading and would invest in German retail banking and asset management in Europe.\nThe bank is expected to cut around 1,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce in the United States, Reuters reported last month.
