S&P 500 e-minis were down 3 points, or 0.11 percent.\nRecent data showed inflation hit the Fed’s 2-percent target, while another set of data showed commodity prices have been rising in the wake of the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\n“Our colleagues expect the Committee to upgrade the inflation language to note that inflation has risen and is near their 2 percent objective,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note to clients.\n“They could also note that market-based measures of inflation compensation have risen further in recent months.”\nTraders have priced in a 94.3 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates a quarter percentage point in June, according to the CME Group’s Fedwatch tool.\nData showed U.S. private payrolls rose 204,000 in April, beating expectations by 4,000, but notched their smallest increase since November. The data comes ahead of the more comprehensive U.S. non-farm payrolls reports on Friday.\nA Trump administration delegation including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to visit Beijing on Thursday and Friday for talks with top Chinese officials to settle trade differences.\nAmong decliners was Snap, whose shares plunged more than 19.2 percent after the Snapchat owner fell short of Wall Street forecasts for revenue and regular users.
