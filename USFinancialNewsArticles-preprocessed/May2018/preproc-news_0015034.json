    "text": "* April nonfarm payrolls miss estimates\n* Tepid wage growth eases inflation fears\n* Apple hits record after Berkshire raises stake\n* Indexes up: Dow 1.19 pct, S&P 1.09 pct, Nasdaq 1.5 pct\n* Market had opened lower, before reversing course (Updates to early afternoon)\nBy Sruthi Shankar\nMay 4 (Reuters) - Apple and other technology stocks led a rally on Wall Street on Friday, after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs and wage growth data eased concerns about faster interest rate hikes.\nApple jumped 3.9 percent to a record high of $183.80 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker.\nThe S&P technology sector was up 1.64 percent, the biggest driver on the index.\nThe markets were off to a choppy start after data showed the U.S. economy added 164,000 jobs in April, but missed estimates, while the unemployment rate dropped to near a 17-1/2-year low of 3.9 percent.\nThe Labor Department’s closely watched report showed wage growth of only 0.1 percent in April, also below expectations, easing concerns that inflation pressures were increasing.\n“We have a jobs report that shows continued strength in the labor market, though without any real inflationary pressures through wages,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.\n“It’s sort of the Goldilocks economy, where there is enough strength in the labor market to allow the Fed to raise interest rates, but not enough to require them to do so.”\nAfter choppy futures trading following release of the data, Wall Street opened lower, before reversing course. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 bounced off their 200-day moving averages, a technical level that indicates long-term momentum.\nAt 12:45 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 285.76 points, or 1.19 percent, at 24,215.91, the S&P 500 was up 28.60 points, or 1.09 percent, at 2,658.33 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 106.67 points, or 1.50 percent, at 7,194.83.\nAll the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, and 29 of the 30 Dow members were in the black.\nAfter a two-day meeting, China and the United States reached a consensus on some aspects of their trade row, though some “relatively big” disagreements on other issues remained, China said.\nAmong companies that reported results, Pandora Media jumped 22.4 percent after the music streaming service provider reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.\nCBS Corp rose 5.9 percent after the media company topped revenue and profit estimates for the first quarter.\nFluor Corp sank 21.7 percent, the most on the S&P, after the engineering and construction company posted a surprise quarterly loss due to issues with a gas-fired power project.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 3.25-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 12 new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 39 new lows.
