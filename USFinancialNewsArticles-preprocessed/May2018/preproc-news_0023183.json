    "text": "MONTRÉAL, May 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- New Look Vision Group Inc. ( \"New Look Vision \" or the \" Company\" ) (TSX:BCI), a leader in the Canadian retail optical business with 376 stores across Canada, reported financial results today for the 13 weeks ended March 31, 2018 (“Q1 2018”). This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s management discussion and analysis (the “MD&A\") and interim consolidated financial statements for Q1 2018, which are available on the Company’s website at www.newlookvision.ca/investors and have been posted on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nQ1 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nRevenues reached $69.8 million and adjusted EBITDA (1) reached $11.3 million for Q1 2018, representing increases of 36.7% and 44.1% respectively over last year. The revenue increase was mainly due to a full quarter of ownership of Iris and comparable stores sales growth of 1.8% over last year. This revenue growth, along with improvement in the materials consumed ratio, resulted in the strong adjusted EBITDA performance. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter increased 90 basis points to 16.3%. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased principally as a result of the acquisition of Iris and capital investments made on the Company’s stores and laboratories.\nAdjusted net earnings attributed to shareholders (1) (defined as net earnings adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation, acquisition-related costs, equity-based compensation, and other non-comparable costs) for the first quarter increased by $2.3 million to $6.9 million. Adjusted net earnings per share for the quarter compared to Q1 2017 increased 33.3% to $0.44 per diluted share. The increase is mainly due to higher EBITDA offset by higher depreciation, financial expenses, and income taxes.\nNet earnings attributed to shareholders were $2.2 million, compared to $1.3 million last year, the increase being mainly due to a higher EBITDA, offset by depreciation, financial expenses, and income taxes as mentioned above.\nCash flows from operating activities before income taxes paid and changes in working capital items (1) were $10.2 million or $0.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018, up significantly from $7.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share last year. Income tax instalments paid in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.8 million compared to $1.7 million for 2017.\nWhen adjusted for acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable costs, adjusted cash flows from operating activities (1) were $10.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share, an increase of $2.9 million, or 37.9% over last year.\nPresident & CEO's comments\nAntoine Amiel, the President and CEO of New Look Vision, stated that: \" The year is off to a strong start with solid Q1 results for the Group as a whole, primarily due to the inclusion of Iris and other acquisitions made in 2017, in addition to achieving our 15 th consecutive quarter of comparable store sales growth. As we carry out our strategic growth plan, we continue to generate cost synergies as highlighted by our decreasing operating expense ratio. We maintain our focus on the integration of recent acquisitions and strengthening our position in the consolidating Canadian retail optical industry.\"\nDividend Approval\nPursuant to its previously announced dividend policy, the Board of Directors of New Look Vision declared a dividend of $0.15 per common share. The quarterly cash dividend will be paid on June 29, 2018 to the shareholders of record as of June 22, 2018. The dividend has been designated as an “eligible dividend”, that is a dividend entitling shareholders who are Canadian resident individuals to a higher dividend tax credit.\nAs of April 30, 2018, New Look Vision had 15,491,520 Class A common shares issued and outstanding.\nThrough the dividend reinvestment plan, shareholders residing in Canada may elect to re-invest their cash dividends into New Look Vision shares, without incurring brokerage commissions, fees and transaction costs. Until any further announcement, shares will be issued from treasury at 95% of the weighted average trading price for the five days preceding the dividend payment date. Any shareholder wishing to benefit from this opportunity may do so through his or her broker.\nAttachments\nTable A - Highlights Table B - Consolidated Statement of Earnings Table C - Reconciliation of Net Earnings to Adjusted EBITDA Table D - Reconciliation of Net Earnings to Adjusted Net Earnings Table E - Reconciliation of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Before Income Taxes Paid and Changes in Working Capital Items and Adjusted Cash Flows from Operating Activities Table F - Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Debt\n1) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net earnings, Cash flows from operating activities before income taxes paid and changes in working capital items, and Adjusted cash flows from operating activities are not recognized measures under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities.
