    "text": "Shohei Ohtani pitched six strong innings and Mike Trout hit his 12th home run of the season as the Los Angeles Angels defeated the host Seattle Mariners 8-2 Sunday afternoon at Safeco Field.\nOhtani (3-1), making his first start on the mound since April 24 because of a mild left ankle sprain, didn’t allow a run and gave up just four hits through the first six innings before running into some trouble in the seventh.\nTrout’s three-run shot in the sixth inning off Mariners reliever Chasen Bradford extended the lead to 6-0 as the Angels improved to 13-3 on the road, taking two of three games in Seattle.\nThe Angels’ Zack Cozart led off the second inning with a home run to left field, his fourth of the season, off right-hander Felix Hernandez (4-3). One out later, Chris Young hit another solo homer, his second, to left-center.\nIt remained 2-0 until the sixth. With two outs, Young swung and missed a 1-2 pitch from Hernandez but the ball got past catcher Mike Zunino. The wild pitch allowed Young to reach first base. No. 9 hitter Rene Rivera doubled to right field, scoring Young. After Ian Kinsler walked, Bradford replaced Hernandez. On a 1-0 pitch, Trout homered to left field to double the lead.\nIn 5 2/3 innings, Hernandez allowed five runs on seven hits. He walked four and struck out five.\nOhtani allowed two runs on six hits in six-plus innings, with two walks and six strikeouts.\nThe Mariners finally got to Ohtani in the seventh. Mitch Haniger led off by grounding a ball sharply into center field and Ryon Healy followed by hitting a 3-2 pitch over the left-field wall. It was Healy’s fifth home run of the season. After a walk to Zunino, Ohtani was replaced by Jose Alvarez.\nThe Angels added two runs in the ninth. With one out, Cozart was hit by a pitch and Jabari Blash singled to left field off Mariners reliever Casey Lawrence. After Young walked to load the bases, Rivera hit a two-run single to center.\nAlvarez pitched two hitless innings of relief before Cam Bedrosian walked the bases loaded with one out in the ninth. Noe Ramirez came on and got Dee Gordon to ground into a double play on his first pitch to end the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
