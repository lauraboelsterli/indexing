    "text": "Vaping among teens is on the rise at an alarming rate , spurring federal regulators and health officials to start cracking down on the e-cigarette industry for fear the trend will lead to dire health consequences, especially among preteens and teens. It has also prompted Facebook's Occulus to back a pilot program to see how virtual reality technology can help turn the tide.\nAccording to a study published last year by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, 6.3 percent of 14-year-olds and 9.3 percent of 16-year-olds are vaping. ( E-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that vaporize a fluid, which typically includ es nicotine and a flavor component.)\nAmong the reasons for the increase in e-cigarette use among children: They are easy to get — you can purchase them right online — they are difficult for parents and teachers to detect, and there's a strong belief they are safer than cigarettes.\nYet evidence suggests e-cigarettes serve as a gateway for preteens and teens who go on to use other tobacco products, including cigarettes, which are known to cause disease and premature death. For children, exposure to nicotine in e-liquid products, even in small amounts, could lead to death from cardiac arrest, as well as seizure, coma and respiratory failure.\nNow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is cracking down. A few days ago FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that they are \"conducting a large-scale, undercover nationwide blitz to crack down on the sale of e-cigarettes, specifically Juul products, to minors at both brick-and-mortar and online retailers.\"\nIn addition, the FDA is considering regulating e-cigarettes as an over-the-counter drug . \"Right now we're looking very actively at could we bring e-cigarettes into the over-the-counter regulatory pathway, which would give us many more tools to look at both safety and benefit, and study whether or not an e-cigarette actually does promote smoking cessation and also give us many more tools to actually study the toxicology associated with it and see what effects it might have on the lung,\" Gottlieb said in an interview with Meg Tirrell at CNBC's \"Healthy Returns\" conference on March 28.\nVirtual reality could be the game changer Now a new virtual reality game, called smokeSCREEN VR, is being tested to address the challenges that teens face when it comes to social pressures and the use of e-cigarettes. The pilot program, funded in part by Oculus, a division of Facebook , is a collaboration between PreviewLabs and Play4Real lab, a new division under Yale's Center for Health and Learning Games.\nThe pilot program will investigate how well virtual reality has the ability to influence perception and the experience of peer pressure. If successful, it will be the first of many VR games created by the Yale Center to address health education and behavioral intervention in adolescents and young adults.\nshow chapters The FDA is going after menthol cigarettes—and maybe even fruity e-cig flavors 5:13 PM ET Tue, 20 March 2018 | 01:04 According to Dr. Kimberly Hieftje, a research scientist and director of the Play4Real lab, smokeSCREEN VR is the first pilot-tested VR videogame intervention focusing on e-cigarette prevention in teens. She explained that its purpose is \"to provide unique opportunities for teens to build skills and experience the outcomes of risk-taking in a virtual — yet safe — environment.\"\nA study published last month that was a joint effort between Yale and the Department of Preventive Medicine of the University of Southern California observed that \"videogames offer the opportunity to engage and educate youth through skill-building and role-playing.\"\n\"The goal is to provide teens with the opportunity to practice refusal skills, while also correcting their misconceptions about the safety of e-cigarettes.\" -Dr. Kimberly Hieftje, director of the Play4Real lab If smokeSCREEN VR is found to encourage positive behavior with its young audiences, more games on other topics will be planned. \"Issues I'd like to see our lab focus on are opioid prevention, alcohol use, drug use and risky sexual behavior,\" says Hieftje.\nAdditional areas of concern are obesity, teen pregnancy, behavior leading to injury to themselves or others, and suicide. \"They will be made available through the Oculus store,\" she adds, \"to anyone who wishes to download the game. We hope schools that have access to VR hardware such as Oculus Gear or Oculus Go will use our games as part of their health curriculum.\"\nMore from Modern Medicine:\nControversial study suggests anti-overdose med Narcan increases opioid use\nThird-leading cause of death in US most doctors don't want you to know about\nYouTube's dark side could be affecting your child's mental health\nWhy were e-cigarettes selected as the pilot subject? Hieftje cites a recent Surgeon General's report showing a 900 percent increase with young people in the use of e-cigarettes in the past several years. \"E-cigarettes are the most commonly used form of tobacco among youth in the United States. We know it can lead to nicotine addiction and increased addiction to other drugs. Given the public health issue, we wanted to approach it with a way that was innovative,\" she says.",
