The increase is primarily driven by increased product sales of $74.1 million mainly due to a $63.2 million increase in BioThrax sales as well as sales of products acquired in Q4 2017, partially offset by a $31.6 million reduction in contracts and grants revenue.\nProduct Sales\nFor Q4 2017, product sales were $161.6 million, an increase of 85% as compared to 2016. The increase is principally attributable to a $63.2 million increase in BioThrax ® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) sales as well as a $10.9 million increase primarily due to sales of products acquired in Q4 2017.\n(in millions)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 % Change Product Sales BioThrax ® $ 107.0 $ 43.8 145 % Other 54.6 43.7 25 % Total Product Sales $ 161.6 $ 87.5 85 % Contract Manufacturing\nFor Q4 2017, revenue from the Company’s contract manufacturing operations was $16.2 million, a decrease of 3% as compared to 2016.\nContracts and Grants\nFor Q4 2017, contracts and grants revenue was $15.9 million, a decrease of 66% as compared to 2016. The decrease primarily reflects a reduction in revenue associated with the successful completion of multiple U.S. government contracts as well as reduced R&D activities related to certain ongoing funded development programs.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nFor Q4 2017, cost of product sales and contract manufacturing was $70.3 million, an increase of 84% as compared to 2016. The increase primarily reflects the impact of higher product sales.\nResearch and Development (Gross and Net)\nFor Q4 2017, gross R&D expenses were $28.5 million, an increase of 5% as compared to 2016. The increase primarily reflects increased contract development services performed for NuThrax TM and the EV-035 series of molecules, offset by reduced services related to the task orders performed by the Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM).\nFor Q4 2017, net R&D expense (calculated as gross research and development expenses less contracts and grants revenue) was $12.6 million. For Q4 2016, contracts and grants revenue exceeded gross R&D expense, resulting in a net contribution from funded development programs of $20.4 million.\n(in millions)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 % Change Research and Development Expenses $ 28.5 $ 27.1 5 % Adjustments: - Contracts and grants revenue $ 15.9 $ 47.5 (66 %) Net Research and Development Expenses (Income) $ 12.6 $ (20.4 ) -- Selling, General and Administrative\nFor Q4 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses were $42.0 million, an increase of 19% as compared to 2016. The increase is attributable to higher compensation expense and professional services fees during the period.\nNet Income & Adjusted Net Income\nFor Q4 2017, net income was $33.9 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, versus $32.3 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in 2016.\nNet income per diluted share is computed using the “if-converted” method prior to November 14, 2017, the date the company terminated conversion rights associated with the company’s 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the Notes). This method requires net income to be adjusted to add back interest expense and amortization of debt issuance cost, both net of tax, associated with the Notes. The following table details the adjustments made in this calculation.\n(in millions, except per share value)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Net Income $ 33.9 $ 32.3 Adjustments: + Interest expense, net of tax 0.2 0.9 + Amortization of debt issuance costs, net of tax 0.1 0.2 Net Income, adjusted (“if converted”) $ 34.2 $ 33.4 Net Income Per Diluted Share, adjusted (“if converted”) $ 0.67 $ 0.67 Weighted Average Diluted Shares 51.0 49.6 For Q4 2017, adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $37.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, versus $36.6 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in 2016. See “Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA” for a definition of terms and a reconciliation table.\n(II) Year Ended December 31, 2017 (Unaudited)\nRevenues\nTotal Revenues\nFor the twelve months of 2017, total revenues were $560.9 million, an increase of 15% as compared to 2016. The increase is attributable to significantly increased product sales, notably Other product sales, and contract manufacturing services revenue offset by a decrease in contracts and grants revenue.\nProduct Sales\nFor the twelve months of 2017, product sales were $421.5 million, an increase of 42% as compared to 2016. The increase is principally attributable to higher BioThrax sales to the SNS and higher Other product sales, specifically timing of BAT ® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) - (Equine)] deliveries to the SNS, international sales of VIGIV and Trobigard and sales of ACAM2000 to the CDC and Raxibacumab to BARDA.\n(in millions) Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) 2016 % Change Product Sales BioThrax ® $ 286.6 $ 237.0 21 % Other $ 134.9 $ 59.3 128 % Total Product Sales $ 421.5 $ 296.3 42 % Contract Manufacturing\nFor the twelve months of 2017, revenue from the Company’s contract manufacturing operations was $68.9 million, an increase of 40% as compared to 2016. The increase primarily reflects an increase in fill/finish and manufacturing services to commercial entities.\nContracts and Grants\nFor the twelve months of 2017, contracts and grants revenue was $70.4 million, a decrease of 51% as compared to 2016. The decrease primarily reflects a reduction in revenue associated with the successful completion of multiple U.S. government contracts as well as reduced R&D activities related to certain ongoing funded development programs.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Product Sales and Contract Manufacturing\nFor the twelve months of 2017, cost of product sales and contract manufacturing was $195.7 million, an increase of 49% as compared to 2016. The increase primarily reflects the impact of higher product sales and increased costs associated with the expansion of our contract manufacturing business.\nResearch and Development (Gross and Net)\nFor the twelve months of 2017, gross R&D expenses were $97.4 million, a decrease of 10% as compared to 2016. The decrease primarily reflects lower contract development services costs associated with reduced contract development services performed during the period.\nFor the twelve months of 2017, net R&D expense (calculated as gross research and development expenses less contracts and grants revenue) was $27.0 million. For the twelve months of 2016, contracts and grants revenue exceeded gross R&D expense, resulting in a net contribution from funded development programs of $35.1 million.\n(in millions) Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) 2016 % Change Research and Development Expenses $ 97.4 $ 108.3 (10 %) Adjustments: - Contracts and grants revenue $ 70.4 $ 143.4 (51 %) Net Research and Development Expenses (Income) $ 27.0 $ (35.1 ) -- Selling, General and Administrative\nFor the twelve months of 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses were $143.5 million, unchanged as compared to 2016.\nNet Income & Adjusted Net Income\nFor the twelve months of 2017, net income was $82.6 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, versus $62.5 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in 2016.\nNet income per diluted share is computed using the “if-converted” method prior to November 14, 2017, the date the company terminated conversion rights associated with the company’s 2.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the Notes). This method requires net income to be adjusted to add back interest expense and amortization of debt issuance cost, both net of tax, associated with the Notes.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Adjusted Net Income adjusts for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict, or reflect the non-cash impact of charges resulting from purchase accounting. EBITDA reflects net income excluding the impact of depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes. The Company views these non-GAAP financial measures as a means to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results and comparison to competitors’ operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business.\nThe determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income (Unaudited)\n(in millions, except per share value) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Source Net Income $ 33.9 $ 32.3 N/A Adjustments: + Acquisition-related costs (transaction & integration) 1.5 1.0 SG&A + Non-cash amortization charges 4.1 1.9 COGS, SG&A, Other Income + Exit and disposal costs -- 2.6 SG&A + Impact of purchase accounting on inventory step-up 0.4 1.1 SG&A Tax effect (2.1 ) (2.3 ) N/A Total Adjustments: 3.9 4.3 N/A Adjusted Net Income $ 37.8 $ 36.6 N/A\nAdjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share $ 0.74 $ 0.74\n(in millions, except per share value) Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Source Net Income $ 82.6 $ 62.5 N/A Adjustments: + Acquisition-related costs (transaction & integration) 5.6 1.7 SG&A + Non-cash amortization charges 10.3 8.4 COGS, SG&A, Other Income + Exit and disposal costs 1.5 11.7 SG&A + Impact of purchase accounting on inventory step-up 2.6 1.1 SG&A Tax effect (7.0 ) (8.0 ) N/A Total Adjustments: 13.1 15.0 N/A Adjusted Net Income\n$ 95.7 $ 77.5 N/A Adjusted Net Income Per Diluted Share\n$ 1.90 $ 1.57 Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA (Unaudited)\n(in millions, except per share value) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Net Income $ 33.9 $ 32.3 Adjustments: + Depreciation & Amortization 12.4 9.7 + Provision for Income Taxes 18.0 16.8 + Total Interest Expense 0.9 2.5 Total Adjustments 31.3 29.0 EBITDA $ 65.2 $ 61.3 EBITDA per Diluted Share $ 1.28 $ 1.24\n(in millions, except per share value) Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Net Income $ 82.6 62.5 Adjustments: + Depreciation & Amortization 40.8 34.9 + Provision for Income Taxes 36.0 36.7 + Total Interest Expense 6.6 7.6 Total Adjustments 83.4 79.2 EBITDA $ 166.0 $ 141.7 EBITDA per Diluted Share $ 3.30 $ 2.87 RECONCILIATION OF STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company’s Statement of Operations for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 on a continuing operations basis to that on a combined basis, which takes into account the impact of the Aptevo-related discontinued operations.\n(in millions) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Continuing Operations Discontinuing Operations Combined Revenues: (Unaudited) Product sales $ 296.3 $ 21.2 $ 317.5 Contract manufacturing 49.1 - 49.1 Contracts and grants 143.4 0.2 143.6 Total revenues 488.8 21.4 510.2 Operating expenses: Cost of product sales and contract manufacturing 131.3 11.6 142.9 Research and development 108.3 18.0 126.3 Selling, general and administrative 143.7 23.8 167.5 Income (loss) from operations 105.5 (32.0 ) 73.5 Other income (expense): Interest income 1.1 - 1.1 Interest expense (7.6 ) - (7.6 ) Other expense, net 0.2 (0.0 ) 0.2 Total other expense, net (6.3 ) (0.0 ) (6.3 ) Income (loss) before provision for (benefit) from income taxes 99.2 (32.0 ) 67.2 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 36.7 (21.3 ) 15.4 Net income (loss) $ 62.5 $ (10.7 ) $ 51.8\nSource:Emergent Biosolutions, Inc.",
