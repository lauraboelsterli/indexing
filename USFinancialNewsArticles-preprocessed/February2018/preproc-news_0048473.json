    "text": " 15 PM / Updated 31 minutes ago Abbas calls for international Mideast peace conference by mid-2018 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - During a rare address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for an international Middle East peace conference to be convened by the middle of this year. The Palestinians no longer view Washington as a neutral negotiator and have been calling for a collective approach to try and broker Middle East peace. They are furious at U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December and cut to U.S. funding for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
