(NASDAQ:AVIR) today announced that the reconvened Special Meeting of Stockholders has been further adjourned to 10:00 AM, EST on February 13, 2018 in order to provide the Company’s stockholders additional time to consider the revised deal terms announced on February 7, 2018. The new terms provide Aviragen shareholders with a significantly greater share of the combined company that will result from its merger with Vaxart, Inc. Current Aviragen shareholders will now receive 49% of the combined company, a 22.5% increase over the original deal.\nThe Company filed a Form 8-K on February 7, 2018, which describes the improved deal terms and the updated Proforma Condensed Combined Financial Information. It can be accessed at the following link:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/72444/000143774918001951/avir20180207_8k.htm\nIt was also announced today that the CAS Group has agreed to support the merger of the Company and Vaxart. The CAS Group has agreed at the Special Meeting to exercise all of the voting rights of the shares of Common Stock held by the CAS Group (a) in favor of the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the stockholders of Vaxart pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and (b) in favor of the reverse stock split and (c) otherwise in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Aviragen (the “Board”) on each other proposal set forth in the Company’s proxy statement. In addition, the CAS Group agreed to withdraw its nomination of directors in connection with the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and agreed to vote all shares of Common Stock held by the CAS Group at the Annual Meeting in favor of the directors nominated for election by the Board. The Company has agreed to reimburse the CAS Group for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses up to $200,000 related to, among other things, its solicitation in connection with the Special Meeting. The agreement will be available as an exhibit on Form 8-K to be filed later today.\nThe Aviragen Board of Directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote FOR ALL of the proposals associated with the proposed merger with Vaxart. Stockholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2018 are entitled to and are being requested to vote. If a stockholder has already submitted their proxy card and does not wish to change their vote, no further action is required at this time.\nAviragen encourages stockholders that have not yet voted their shares to vote by 11:59 pm EST on February 12, 2018. Each vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares are owned. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Aviragen common stock properly cast at the Aviragen Special Meeting, presuming a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposed merger. Please take a moment to vote FOR the proposals necessary to approve the proposed merger today – by telephone, by Internet or by signing, dating and returning the WHITE proxy card. Please discard any BLUE proxy card you may receive from the CAS Group.\nStockholders with questions or requiring assistance voting their shares should contact Aviragen’s proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., toll-free at (800) 967-5074. Each vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares are owned.\nAbout Aviragen Therapeutics\nAviragen Therapeutics is focused on the discovery and development of the next generation of direct-acting antivirals to treat infections that have limited therapeutic options and affect a significant number of patients globally.
