    "text": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Construction companies have been banned from using scantily clad women to publicize cladding and other products at one of Britain’s largest trade shows, the latest in a series of business and sports events to stop using female models.\nUK Construction Week said on Tuesday it had released a new code of conduct to promote greater equality, diversity and inclusion after it came under fire on social media over the presence of showgirls at one stand in October last year.\n“It’s the wrong image for the industry to portray,” the trade show’s director, Nathan Garnett, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone, adding the traditionally male-dominated sector was working to attract more women.\nThe move comes at a time of heightened attention over sexism, discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, following a series of scandals affecting the business, sports, entertainment and aid sectors.\nIn January reports that women hired to entertain businessmen and politicians at a men-only charity fundraising gala in London were groped, propositioned and sexually harassed, fueled a public debate over sexual objectification of women.\nOrganizers of Formula One races and darts championships in Britain announced last month that they will no longer use female models to stand next to drivers or accompany players on stage.\nFormula One said it was ending the use of walk-on models because the custom “does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern day societal norms”.\nBritain’s largest betting show said it would review its policies after the nation’s gambling regulator criticized the use of promotional girls in bikinis and pole dancers at an event in London last week, and threatened to boycott future shows.\nIn its new guidelines UK Construction Week urged companies coming to the fair to think about the mix of staff they bring to their stand in terms of gender, age, ethnicity.\nStalls with a theme deemed inappropriate or that objectify women would be closed, according to organizers of the show that attracts more than 600 exhibitors every year, adding clothing must be appropriate for a business event.\nIn October some guest attending the exhibition in Birmingham in central England complained about lightly dressed girls hired by one exhibitor to promote tiles at a Las Vegas-themed stall.\n“We got it wrong last year, and faced criticism on social media. So we’re still learning too,” Garnett said in a statement.\nReporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
