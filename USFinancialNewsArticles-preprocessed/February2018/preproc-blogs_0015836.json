    "text": "The Medicines Company : \"We've got UnitedHealth . We're not going to fool around with this other stuff. That is my go-to choice in that sector.\"\nGranite Construction : \"Granite's very good. I'm more partial to US Concrete .\"\nFord Motor Company : \"Seems like a value trap to me, sir. It's got a 5.5 percent yield, but you know what, it don't matter for a stock going down â€“ 5.5 doesn't get you there. I'm staying away.\"\nChesapeake Energy Corp : \"I haven't liked it for 10 years, so I can't really get on the Chesapeake bandwagon.\"\nAtlassian : \"Oh, man, I like those guys. That is a terrific, very inexpensive program that gets everybody to be able to be together in a company. I like that. Notice it didn't even come down [during the sell-off].\"\nAeroVironment : \"I think that there's a private company that I know that also does agriculture. They do have agricultural drones that actually, I think, may be able to give this company a run for the money. I like the military side more than the ag side. It's down 15 percent, about, for the year. Call me a buyer, not a seller.\"\nConagra Brands : \"It's fine, Conagra. The problem is that there's no real thesis right now to buy these food stocks other than [on] a takeover basis and I don't recommend stocks on a takeover basis.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: My go-to health care stock 15 Hours Ago | 03:59 ",
