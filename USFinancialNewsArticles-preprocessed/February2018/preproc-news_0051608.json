Our management team has been aligned to successfully execute on our strategic imperatives as we seek to deliver innovative, cost-effective product solutions to our customers and drive shareholder returns over the long-term.”\n2018 Outlook (a)\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nGAAP Non-GAAP (b) As Reported Growth Adjusted Growth Sales $1,490 to $1,530 2% to 5% $1,490 to $1,530 2% to 5% Net Income $50 to $60 (25%) to (10%) $102 to $112 13% to 24% EBITDA N/A N/A $305 to $315 7% to 10% Earnings per Diluted Share $1.55 to $1.85 (26%) to (11%) $3.15 to $3.45 12% to 23%\n(a) Except as described below, further reconciliations by line item to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measure for Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share and Adjusted EBITDA, included in our “2018 Outlook” above, are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and visibility of the charges excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure. (b) Adjusted Net Income and EPS for 2018 is expected to consist of GAAP Net Income and EPS, excluding items such as intangible amortization, IP-related litigation costs, consolidation and realignment costs, asset disposition and write-down charges, and loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $58 million. The after-tax impact of these items is estimated to be approximately $46 million, or approximately $1.42 per diluted share. Additionally, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share is expected to exclude the estimated impact relating to our disallowed deduction of the GILTI tax, as mandated by the Tax Reform Act. This disallowed deduction of the GILTI tax (approximately 50% of the total GILTI Tax) is due to the Company making use of its U.S. net operating losses (“NOLs”), and will be eliminated once the Company’s U.S. NOLs are fully utilized in approximately three to five years. This adjustment makes our Adjusted Diluted EPS more comparable with other global companies that are not subject to this disallowed GILTI tax deduction and more comparable to the Company’s results following the full utilization of its U.S. NOLs. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to consist of Adjusted Net Income, excluding items such as depreciation, interest, stock-based compensation and taxes of approximately $203 million. “Driven by our strong performance in the fourth quarter, and top-line growth of five percent for the full year, we exited 2017 with strong momentum, which gives us confidence in our 2018 sales guidance,” continued Mr. Dziedzic. “Our expected sales growth, along with the implementation of our operational excellence strategic imperatives should deliver solid year-over-year growth for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings per Share.”\nSummary of Financial and Product Line Results\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended GAAP 4Q 2017 4Q 2016 Change Organic\nGrowth (b) Medical Sales (a) Cardio & Vascular $ 140,473 $ 125,586 11.9 % 11.1 % Cardiac & Neuromodulation 116,735 115,942 0.7 % 0.7 % Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical 118,523 106,745 11.0 % 8.8 % Total Medical Sales 375,731 348,273 7.9 % 6.9 % Non-Medical Sales 14,750 11,318 30.3 % 30.3 % Total Sales $ 390,481 $ 359,591 8.6 % 7.6 % Net income $ 54,338 $ 7,933 NM Diluted EPS $ 1.68 $ 0.25 NM Year Ended GAAP FY 2017 FY 2016 Change Organic\nGrowth (b) Medical Sales (a) Cardio & Vascular $ 536,794 $ 490,857 9.4 % 9.2 % Cardiac & Neuromodulation 428,349 439,541 (2.5 )% (2.3 )% Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical 439,810 414,701 6.1 % 5.7 % Total Medical Sales 1,404,953 1,345,099 4.4 % 4.4 % Non-Medical Sales 56,968 41,679 36.7 % 36.7 % Total Sales $ 1,461,921 $ 1,386,778 5.4 % 5.3 % Net income $ 66,679 $ 5,961 NM Diluted EPS $ 2.09 $ 0.19 NM\n(a) During the first quarter of 2017, we revised the method used to present sales by product line in order to align the legacy Greatbatch and Lake Region Medical methodologies. We believe the revised presentation will provide improved reporting and better transparency into the operational results of our business and markets. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new product line sales reporting presentation. (b) Organic Growth for sales is a Non-GAAP measure, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange and excludes the results of Nuvectra Corporation (“Nuvectra”) prior to its spin-off on March 14, 2016. Refer to Table C at the end of this release for a reconciliation of these amounts.

(b) Organic Growth for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS are Non-GAAP measures, which exclude the foreign currency exchange impact reported in other (income) expense, net. Refer to Table D at the end of this release for a reconciliation of these amounts.\nDiscussion of Financial and Operational Results for the Fourth Quarter\nMedical segment sales grew on a reported and organic basis on strength in our Cardio & Vascular product line, primarily driven by strong demand for Integer owned product lines and increasing demand for contract manufactured products, as well as increased sales in the Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics and Portable Medical product line resulting from continued ramping of new products and customer inventory management actions. Medical segment sales also benefited from stabilization in our Cardiac Rhythm Management & Neuromodulation product line as our customers experienced growth in the marketplace. Non-Medical segment sales grew on a reported and organic basis as a result of continued recovery in the energy market and new business wins. GAAP and Non-GAAP profitability metrics reflect strong sales growth and margin expansion from productivity in operations, offset by higher incentive compensation costs, a mix shift to lower margin product lines, and a small unfavorable foreign currency impact on intercompany loans. GAAP profitability metrics improved year-over-year primarily due to lower interest expense, a net gain on our cost and equity method investments, and a net benefit resulting from the Tax Reform Act partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs, and increased IP related litigation costs. Organic non-GAAP profitability metrics exclude the negative effect of foreign currency exchange losses, which are reported in other (income) expense, net and are primarily non-cash.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and imposing a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, our consolidated statement of operations reflects a net benefit of $39.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. This is net of an expense of $17.1 million for the one-time deemed repatriation tax and taxes associated with foreign withholding taxes. Offsetting this charge was a $56.5 million benefit recorded from the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate.\nWe are reporting the impacts of the Tax Reform Act provisionally based upon reasonable estimates. The impacts are not yet finalized as they are dependent on factors and analysis not yet known or fully completed, including but not limited to, further analysis of our historical foreign earnings, the issuance of additional guidance, as well as our ongoing analysis of the Tax Reform Act.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EST to discuss these results. The scheduled conference call will be webcast live and is accessible through our website at investor.integer.net or by dialing (866) 393-4306 (U.S.) or (734) 385-2616 (outside U.S.) and the conference ID is 5060888.

Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share consist of GAAP amounts adjusted for the following to the extent occurring during the period: (i) acquisition and integration related charges and expenses, (ii) amortization of intangible assets including inventory step-up amortization, (iii) facility consolidation, optimization, manufacturing transfer and system integration charges, (iv) asset write-down and disposition charges, (v) charges in connection with corporate realignments or a reduction in force, (vi) certain litigation expenses, charges and gains, (vii) unusual or infrequently occurring items, (viii) gain (loss) on cost and equity method investments, (ix) extinguishment of debt charges, (x) the income tax (benefit) related to these adjustments and (xi) certain tax items that are outside the normal provision for the period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share are calculated by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA consists of GAAP net income (loss) plus (i) the same adjustments as listed above except for items (x) and (xi), (ii) GAAP stock-based compensation, interest expense, and depreciation, (iii) GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iv) non-cash gains received from cost and equity method investments during the period. To calculate organic sales growth rates, we convert current period sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using the previous periods foreign currency exchange rates and exclude the amount of sales acquired/divested during the period from the current/previous period amounts, respectively. Organic growth rates for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and organic growth rates provides important supplemental information to management and investors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements contained in this press release and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us and our representatives are not statements of historical or current fact.

Net income amounts are computed using a 35% U.S. tax rate, and the statutory tax rates in Mexico, Germany, France, Netherlands, Uruguay, Ireland and Switzerland, as adjusted for the existence of net operating losses. Expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes (i.e. permanent tax differences) are added back at 100%. (b) In 2013, we filed suit against AVX Corporation alleging they were infringing our intellectual property. Given the complexity and significant costs incurred pursuing this litigation, we are excluding these litigation expenses from adjusted amounts. This matter proceeded to trial during the first quarter of 2016 and a federal jury awarded the Company $37.5 million in damages. To date, no gains have been recognized in connection with this litigation. (c) During 2017 and 2016, we incurred costs primarily related to the transfer of our Beaverton, OR portable medical and Plymouth, MN vascular manufacturing operations to Tijuana, Mexico, the closure of our Arvada, CO site and the consolidation of our two Galway, Ireland sites. In addition, 2017 costs also include expenses related to the closure of our Clarence, NY facility. (d) Reflects acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Lake Region Medical, which was acquired in October 2015. (e) Amounts for 2017 primarily include expenses related to our CEO, CFO and Chief Human Resources Officer transitions. Amounts for 2016 primarily include legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the spin-off of Nuvectra, which was completed in March 2016. (f) As a result of the strategic review of our customers, competitors and markets we undertook during we began to take steps to better align our resources in order to invest to grow, protect, preserve and to enhance the profitability of our portfolio of products. This will include focusing our investment in RD&E and manufacturing, improving our business processes and redirecting investments away from projects where the market does not justify the investment. As a result, during the fourth quarter we incurred charges related to the initial steps of this initiative which included lease termination charges and accelerated amortization of certain intangible assets. (g) Represents debt extinguishment charges in connection with pre-payments made on our Term B Loan Facility during 2017, which are included in interest expense. (h) Tax adjustments for the 2017 periods represent the net tax benefit resulting from the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Tax adjustments include a discrete tax benefit related to certain transaction costs of the Lake Region Medical acquisition and the spin-off of Nuvectra in 2016 and a tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017 in connection with the enactment of regulations under §987 of the Internal Revenue Code, which resulted in an adjustment to our deferred tax assets. (i) The diluted weighted average shares for adjusted EPS for the years ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016 include 168,000 and 249,000, respectively, of potentially dilutive shares not included in the computation of diluted weighted average common shares for GAAP diluted EPS purposes because their effect would have been anti-dilutive in that period. (j) Represents the results of Nuvectra prior to its spin-off on March 14, 2016.\nTable B: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 29,\n2017 December 30,\n2016 December 29,\n2017 December 30,\n2016 Net Income (GAAP) $ 54,338 $ 7,933 $ 66,679 $ 5,961 Interest expense 25,435 27,875 106,460 111,270 Benefit for income taxes (44,422 ) (3,390 ) (44,852 ) (4,776 ) Depreciation 14,575 13,699 56,084 52,662 Amortization (excluding OOE) 11,099 9,411 44,174 37,862 EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 61,025 55,528 228,545 202,979 IP related litigation 1,348 349 4,375 3,040 Stock-based compensation (excluding OOE) 4,618 1,160 12,424 6,933 Consolidation and optimization expenses 5,111 4,686 13,349 26,490 Acquisition and integration expenses 813 5,173 10,870 28,316 Asset dispositions, severance and other 522 1,874 7,182 6,931 Strategic reorganization and alignment 5,891 — 5,891 — Noncash (gain) loss on cost and equity\nmethod investments (868 ) 1,765 2,965 1,495 Nuvectra results prior to spin-off (a)\n— — — 3,665 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $ 78,460 $ 70,535 $ 285,601 $ 279,849\n(a) Represents the results of Nuvectra prior to its spin-off on March 14, 2016.\nTable C: Organic Sales Growth Rate Reconciliation (% Change)\nGAAP\nReported\nGrowth Impact of\nNuvectra\nprior to\nSpin-off (a) Impact of\nForeign\nCurrency (b) Non-GAAP\nOrganic\nGrowth QTD Change (4Q 2017 vs. 4Q 2016) Medical Sales Cardio & Vascular 11.9 % — (0.8 )% 11.1 % Cardiac & Neuromodulation 0.7 % — — 0.7 % Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical 11.0 % — (2.2 )% 8.8 % Total Medical Sales 7.9 % — (1.0 )% 6.9 % Non-Medical Sales 30.3 % — — 30.3 % Total Sales 8.6 % — (1.0 )% 7.6 % YTD Change (2017 vs. 2016) Medical Sales Cardio & Vascular 9.4 % — (0.2 )% 9.2 % Cardiac & Neuromodulation (2.5 )% 0.2 % — (2.3 )% Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical 6.1 % — (0.4 )% 5.7 % Total Medical Sales 4.4 % — — 4.4 % Non-Medical Sales 36.7 % — — 36.7 % Total Sales 5.4 % — (0.1 )% 5.3 %\n(a) Cardiac & Neuromodulation sales for the first quarter of 2016 includes $1.2 million relating to Nuvectra prior to its spin-off on March 14, 2016.
