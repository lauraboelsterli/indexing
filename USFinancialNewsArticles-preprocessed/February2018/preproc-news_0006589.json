Unileverâ€™s decision affected a further 113 jobs.\nBritvic said on Wednesday it would take a one-off charge of about 35-40 million pounds this financial year, mainly related to the closure.\nIts shares were down 3.6 percent to 761 pence at 1000 GMT, despite a 3.3 percent rise in sales in the first-quarter of its financial year, which ends in September. The stock has risen more than 21 percent in the last 12 months.\nExcluding a recent acquisition, sales were up 0.7 percent.\nRevenue in Britain rose 1 percent, including a 4.9 percent rise from carbonated drinks such as Pepsi MAX.\nA sugar tax on UK soft drinks is due to come into force in April, but Britvic said it was well placed to cope, helped by the breadth of its portfolio which includes drinks not covered by the tax. Manufacturers are also rushing to reduce sugar in their drinks.\nBritvic said it had also absorbed a number of one-off costs related to Palmer and Harvey, one of its wholesalers that was recently placed in administration.
