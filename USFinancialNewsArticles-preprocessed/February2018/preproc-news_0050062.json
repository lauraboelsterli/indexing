    "text": "NORTHFIELD, Ill., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Stepan Company (NYSE: SCL) today reported:\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nReported net income was $9.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share versus $8.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $24.6 million, or $1.06 per diluted share versus $12.3 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the prior year.* Current year adjusted net income excludes a $14.9 million net after-tax charge related to the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation. Surfactant operating income was $28.3 million versus $14.6 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to $8.3 million of non-recurring expenses in the prior year, favorable resolution of a European product claim, growth in key global markets and improved internal efficiencies. Global Surfactant sales volume increased 2% versus the prior year. Polymer operating income was $19.0 million versus $16.5 million in the prior year. This increase was mostly attributable to higher European Rigid Polyol and global Specialty Polyol volumes. Global Polymer volume was up 1% versus the prior year. Specialty Product operating income was $2.3 million versus $4.2 million in the prior year primarily due to the timing of orders in our flavor business and lower volume and margins in our food business. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company approved a plan to restructure a portion of its Fieldsboro, NJ production facility. The Company recorded $0.9 million of pre-tax severance expense and $1.3 million of accelerated depreciation for the areas that will be impacted by the shutdown. This decision was made to improve future asset utilization and reduce the Company's North American cost base going forward.\nFull Year Highlights\nReported net income was a record $91.6 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, a 6% increase versus $86.2 million, or $3.73 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income was a record $108.7 million, or $4.65 per diluted share, an 11% increase versus $98.2 million, or $4.25 per diluted share, in the prior year.* Current year adjusted net income excludes a $14.9 million net after-tax charge related to the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation. 2017 marked the seventh record annual income over the last ten years. The Surfactant segment delivered record operating income of $120.0 million, a 20% increase versus prior year. The Polymer segment delivered $82.8 million of operating income, a 14% decrease versus prior year. Despite being down versus prior year, the Polymer results were the second best on record. Specialty Product operating income was $10.0 million versus $10.7 million in the prior year. Total company sales volume declined 1%. Most of the decline was attributable to lower commodity surfactant demand, partially offset by higher global Functional Products and Specialty Polyol end market demand. The effect of foreign currency translation positively impacted net income by $1.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, versus prior year. Free cash flow** for the year was $101 million versus $92 million in the prior year. The Company had no net debt at year-end. The Company entered into a five year $350 million unsecured revolving line of credit in January 2018. The credit agreement allows the Company to make unsecured borrowings, as needed, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.\n\"2017 was a good year as the Company delivered record reported and adjusted net income,\" said F. Quinn Stepan, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Improved product mix, increased asset utilization and enhanced internal efficiencies continued to drive results. Both Surfactants and Polymers benefited from our diversification strategy and we anticipate further contributions in 2018.\nFor the full year, Surfactants delivered record operating income due to improved product mix, lower manufacturing costs, and the accretive impact of our 2016 Brazil acquisition. Sales benefited from our diversification efforts into functional products, higher sales within the household, industrial and institutional end markets and continued growth in more specialized applications.\nPolymers delivered its second best full year results despite increased competitive pressure and higher raw material costs within our North American Polyol business. Global Polyol volumes were up slightly despite share loss in North America. The market for insulation materials remains strong due to continued global energy conservation efforts.\"\n* Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure which excludes deferred compensation income/ expense as well as other significant and infrequent/non-recurring items. See Table II for reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.\n** Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and cash dividends paid.\nFinancial Summary\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\n($ in thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\nNet Sales\n$\n473,823\n$\n420,636\n13\n%\n$\n1,925,007\n$\n1,766,166\n9\n%\nOperating Income\n$\n30,831\n$\n9,932\n210\n%\n$\n146,160\n$\n126,193\n16\n%\nNet Income\n$\n9,884\n$\n8,417\n17\n%\n$\n91,578\n$\n86,191\n6\n%\nEarnings per Diluted Share\n$\n0.42\n$\n0.36\n17\n%\n$\n3.92\n$\n3.73\n5\n%\nAdjusted Net Income *\n$\n24,649\n$\n12,294\n100\n%\n$\n108,691\n$\n98,187\n11\n%\nAdjusted Earnings per Diluted Share *\n$\n1.06\n$\n0.52\n104\n%\n$\n4.65\n$\n4.25\n9\n%\n* See Table II for reconciliations of non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per\nDiluted Share.\nSummary of Fourth Quarter Adjusted Net Income Items\nAdjusted net income excludes non-operational deferred compensation income/expense and other significant and infrequent or non-recurring items.\nU.S. Tax Reform Impact: The fourth quarter includes $14.9 million of net after-tax charges related to the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation. The one-time net impact is comprised of a $19.4 million transition tax expense on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $4.5 million favorable impact related to the re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at a lower future corporate tax rate. Business Restructuring and Asset Impairments: The fourth quarter includes $0.2 million of decommissioning expense related to the Canadian plant closure announced in 2016 and $0.6 million of after-tax severance related to the plan to restructure the Fieldsboro, NJ plant site. The prior year quarter included $4.0 million of after-tax expense comprised of: (i) $1.3 million of severance and decommissioning costs related to the Canadian plant shutdown; (ii) a $1.3 million asset write-down at the Bahia, Brazil site; and (iii) a $1.4 million asset write-down related to engineering costs associated with a project that was canceled. Deferred Compensation: The fourth quarter includes $1.0 million of after-tax income versus $2.7 million of after-tax expense in the prior year. Contract Termination Settlement: The fourth quarter of 2016 included $2.8 million of after-tax income generated on a negotiated customer contract termination fee related to the Bahia, Brazil site.\nPercentage Change in Net Sales\nThe 13% increase in quarterly net sales was primarily due to higher selling prices, which were mostly attributable to the pass through of certain higher raw material costs. Current quarter net sales also benefited from a 1% increase in volume and a 3% positive impact of foreign currency translation.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nVolume\n1\n%\n-1\n%\nSelling Price\n9\n%\n9\n%\nForeign Translation\n3\n%\n1\n%\nTotal\n13\n%\n9\n%\nSegment Results\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\n($ in thousands)\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\nNet Sales\nSurfactants\n$\n324,174\n$\n282,549\n15\n%\n$\n1,297,555\n$\n1,181,563\n10\n%\nPolymers\n$\n131,083\n$\n116,286\n13\n%\n$\n546,634\n$\n498,826\n10\n%\nSpecialty Products\n$\n18,566\n$\n21,801\n(15)%\n$\n80,818\n$\n85,777\n(6)%\nTotal Net Sales\n$\n473,823\n$\n420,636\n13\n%\n$\n1,925,007\n$\n1,766,166\n9\n%\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\n($ in thousands, all amounts pre-tax)\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\nOperating Income\nSurfactants\n$\n28,257\n$\n14,582\n94\n%\n$\n119,990\n$\n99,796\n20\n%\nPolymers\n$\n19,029\n$\n16,510\n15\n%\n$\n82,801\n$\n96,788\n(14)%\nSpecialty Products\n$\n2,250\n$\n4,249\n(47)%\n$\n9,952\n$\n10,698\n(7)%\nSegment Operating Income\n$\n49,536\n$\n35,341\n40\n%\n$\n212,743\n$\n207,282\n3\n%\nCorporate Expenses\n$\n(18,705)\n$\n(25,409)\n(26)%\n$\n(66,583)\n$\n(81,089)\n(18)%\nConsolidated Operating Income\n$\n30,831\n$\n9,932\n210\n%\n$\n146,160\n$\n126,193\n16\n%\nTotal fourth quarter operating income, excluding corporate expenses, increased $14.2 million, or 40%, versus the prior year quarter. Total full year operating income, excluding corporate expenses, increased $5.5 million or 3% versus the prior year.\nSurfactant net sales were $324.2 million for the quarter, a 15% increase versus prior year. Selling prices increased 11% versus the prior year primarily due to the pass-through of certain higher raw material costs. Sales volume increased 2%, mostly due to higher demand in the Functional Product end markets and higher Distribution sales, partially offset by lower Consumer Product commodity volumes. The translation impact of a weaker U.S. dollar increased net sales by 2%. Surfactant operating income increased $13.7 million or 94% versus the prior year, primarily attributable to $8.3 million of non-recurring expenses in the prior year, settlement of a European product claim, savings from the Canadian plant shutdown and improved product mix and growth in Agriculture end markets in Europe. Also, the prior year acquisition in Brazil positively contributed to the current year quarter. Polymer net sales were $131.1 million in the fourth quarter, a 13% increase versus prior year. Selling prices increased 8% primarily due to the pass-through of certain higher raw material costs. Sales volume increased 1% in the quarter primarily due to higher European Rigid Polyol volume and higher global Specialty Polyol volume. This growth was partially offset by lower North American Rigid Polyol and Phthalic Anhydride volumes. North American Rigid Polyol volume was down 2% due to lost share. The translation impact of a weaker U.S. dollar favorably impacted net sales by 4%. Operating income increased $2.5 million or 15% versus the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to the European Rigid Polyol and global Specialty Polyol volume growth and the non-recurrence of a scheduled Phthalic Anhydride maintenance shutdown in the prior year quarter. Higher North American raw material costs partially offset these benefits. Specialty Products net sales were $18.6 million for the quarter, a $3.2 million decrease versus the prior year. Operating income declined $2.0 million versus the prior year quarter primarily due to the timing of orders in our flavor business and lower volume and margins in our food business.\nCorporate Expenses\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\n($ in thousands)\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\nTotal - Corporate Expenses\n$\n18,705\n$\n25,409\n(26)%\n$\n66,583\n$\n81,089\n(18)%\nDeferred Compensation Expense/(Income) *\n$\n(406)\n$\n4,210\nNM\n$\n4,857\n$\n16,805\n(71)%\nRestructuring and Asset Impairment Expense\n$\n1,271\n$\n6,003\n(79)%\n$\n3,069\n$\n7,064\n(57)%\nAdjusted Corporate Expense\n$\n17,840\n$\n15,196\n17%\n$\n58,657\n$\n57,220\n3%\n* See Table III for a discussion of deferred compensation plan accounting.\nCorporate expenses, excluding deferred compensation and business restructuring expenses, increased $2.6 million versus the prior year quarter. Most of this increase was attributable to higher legal expense. Corporate expenses were up $1.4 million, or 3%, on a full year basis.\nIncome Taxes\nThe full year effective tax rate was 34.3% in 2017 compared to 24.3% in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a net tax cost of $14.9 million in 2017. The one-time net impact of $14.9 million was a result of the $19.4 million transition tax expense on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the $4.5 million favorable impact related to the re-measurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at a lower future corporate tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by favorable nonrecurring discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 23% in 2018.\nSelected Balance Sheet Information\nThe Company's net debt level decreased $48.4 million for the quarter while the net debt to total net debt plus equity ratio dropped from 5% to -1%, reflecting cash balances in excess of total debt. The decrease in net debt was attributable to a $34.8 million increase in cash combined with a $13.6 million decline in total debt. The fourth quarter rise in cash was primarily attributable to improved working capital components.\n($ in millions)\n12/31/17\n9/30/17\n6/30/17\n3/31/17\n12/31/16\nNet Debt\nTotal Debt\n$\n290.8\n$\n304.4\n$\n304.4\n$\n316.7\n$\n317.0\nCash\n298.9\n264.1\n223.8\n197.8\n225.7\nNet Debt\n$\n(8.1)\n$\n40.3\n$\n80.6\n$\n118.9\n$\n91.3\nEquity\n740.1\n734.9\n707.3\n673.2\n634.6\nNet Debt + Equity\n$\n732.0\n$\n775.2\n$\n787.9\n$\n792.1\n$\n725.9\nNet Debt / (Net Debt + Equity)\n-1%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n13%\nThe major working capital components were:\n($ in millions)\n12/31/17\n9/30/17\n6/30/17\n3/31/17\n12/31/16\nNet Receivables\n$\n293.5\n$\n314.1\n$\n306.2\n$\n287.5\n$\n263.4\nInventories\n172.7\n163.7\n178.4\n189.8\n173.7\nAccounts Payable\n(205.0)\n(172.4)\n(169.2)\n(163.8)\n(158.3)\n$\n261.2\n$\n305.4\n$\n315.4\n$\n313.5\n$\n278.8\nThe Company had full year capital expenditures of $78.6 million in 2017 versus $103.1 million in the prior year.\nOutlook\n\"After record results in 2016 and 2017, we believe our Surfactant business will continue to benefit from our diversification efforts into functional products, new technologies, expanded sales into our broad customer base globally and the stabilization of commodity surfactant volumes.

Quinn Stepan, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Results will benefit from the lower U.S. corporate tax rate in 2018.\"\nConference Call\nStepan Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT) on February 22, 2018.

The year-to-date pretax impact was $0.1 million of income versus $16.1 million of expense in the prior year. The accounting for the deferred compensation plan results in operating income when the price of Stepan Company common stock or mutual funds held in the plan fall and expense when they rise. The Company also recognizes the change in value of mutual funds as investment income or loss. The quarter end market prices of Stepan Company common stock are as follows:\n2017\n2016\n12/31\n9/30\n6/30\n3/31\n12/31\n9/30\n6/30\n3/31\nStepan Company\n$\n78.97\n$\n83.66\n$\n87.14\n$\n78.81\n$\n81.48\n$\n72.66\n$\n59.53\n$\n55.29\nThe deferred compensation income statement impact is summarized below:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\n($ in thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nDeferred Compensation\nOperating Income (Expense)\n$\n406\n$\n(4,210)\n$\n(4,857)\n$\n(16,805)\nOther, net – Mutual Fund Gain (Loss)\n1,216\n(71)\n4,922\n713\nTotal Pretax\n$\n1,622\n$\n(4,281)\n$\n65\n$\n(16,092)\nTotal After Tax\n$\n1,006\n$\n(2,654)\n$\n40\n$\n(9,977)\nTable IV\nEffects of Foreign Currency Translation\nThe Company's foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies. As a result, foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into U.S. dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period. Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the U.S. dollar over time, foreign currency translation affects period-to-period comparisons of financial statement items (i.e., because foreign exchange rates fluctuate, similar period-to-period local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different U.S. dollar results). Below is a table that presents the impact that foreign currency translation had on the changes in consolidated net sales and various income line items for the three and twelve month periods ending December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016:\n($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nIncrease (Decrease)\nIncrease\nDue to Foreign\nCurrency\nTranslation\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nIncrease\nDue to Foreign\nCurrency\nTranslation\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet Sales\n$\n473.8\n$\n420.6\n$\n53.2\n$\n12.4\n$\n1,925.0\n$\n1,766.2\n$\n158.8\n$\n9.9\nGross Profit\n80.6\n68.7\n11.9\n2.2\n338.3\n338.5\n(0.2)\n2.6\nOperating Income\n30.8\n9.9\n20.9\n1.4\n146.2\n126.2\n20.0\n1.7\nPretax Income\n28.5\n7.0\n21.5\n1.3\n139.2\n113.8\n25.4\n1.6\nTable V\nStepan Company\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nDecember 31\n2017\nDecember 31\n2016\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\n$\n788,736\n$\n685,541\nProperty, Plant & Equipment, Net\n598,443\n582,714\nOther Assets\n83,682\n85,635\nTotal Assets\n$\n1,470,861\n$\n1,353,890\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities\n$\n320,253\n$\n297,265\nDeferred Income Taxes\n10,962\n12,497\nLong-term Debt\n268,299\n288,859\nOther Non-current Liabilities\n130,433\n119,353\nTotal Stepan Company Stockholders' Equity\n740,096\n634,604\nNoncontrolling Interest\n818\n1,312\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity\n$\n1,470,861\n$\n1,353,890\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stepan-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-2017-results-300602404.html\nSOURCE Stepan Company",
