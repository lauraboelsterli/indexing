The SEC said Ameriprise Financial Services Inc, without admitting or denying the findings, agreed to pay a penalty of $230,000. It said that about 1,791 customers of the investment adviser had paid $1.78 million in unnecessary charges due to Ameripriseâ€™s practices. Reporting by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",
