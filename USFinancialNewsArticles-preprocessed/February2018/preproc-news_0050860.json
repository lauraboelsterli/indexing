(NASDAQ:HCKT), a global intellectual property-based strategic consultancy and leading enterprise benchmarking and best practices implementation firm, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, which ended on December 29, 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 net revenue (gross revenue less reimbursable expenses) was $64.5 million, up 2.5%, as compared to prior year. Fiscal year 2017 net revenue was $263.3 million, up 1.3%, as compared to prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 gross revenue was $69.4 million, down 0.9%, as compared to prior year. Fiscal year 2017 gross revenue was $285.9 million, down 0.9%, as compared to prior year. The decrease in gross revenue for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 is a result of decreasing pass-through project reimbursable expenses.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.29, up 53%, when compared to $0.19 for the same period in the prior year. Fiscal year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.85, up 29%, when compared to $0.66 for the same period in 2016. During 2017, the adoption of new accounting pronouncements and new tax legislation favorably impacted income tax expense by a total of $7.8 million.\nPro forma diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.27, up 4%, when compared to $0.26 for the same period in 2016. Fiscal year pro forma diluted earnings per share were $1.00, up 6%, when compared to $0.94 in the same period in 2016. Pro forma information is provided to enhance the understanding of the Company’s financial performance and is reconciled to the Company’s GAAP information in the accompanying tables.\nIn its recent meeting, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a 13% increase in its annual dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share, to be paid semi-annually. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s cash balances were $17.5 million. The outstanding balance of the Company’s Credit Facility was $19.0 million at the end of the quarter.\n“This was a highly transformative year for our organization,” stated Ted A. Fernandez, Chairman & CEO of The Hackett Group, Inc. “We reported solid results while aggressively transitioning our offerings to the rapidly growing cloud and digital transformation opportunities that strongly position us for future growth.”\nBased on the current economic outlook, the Company estimates total net revenue for the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of $66.0 million and $68.0 million or gross revenue (inclusive of reimbursable expenses of 7.5%) to be in the range of $71.0 million and $73.0 million.

These non-GAAP results are provided to enhance the overall users' understanding\nof the Company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. The Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management\nand investors and by excluding certain expenses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors\nand management with an alternative method for assessing operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of ongoing operations and to provide a more\nconsistent basis for comparison between quarters. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in\nfuture periods. In addition, since the Company has historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, it believes the continued inclusion of non-GAAP\nresults provides consistency in its financial reporting. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Hackett Group, Inc.
