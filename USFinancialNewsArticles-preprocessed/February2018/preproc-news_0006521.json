    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that the 2015 Waters of the United States rule will not be applicable for two years while it works to repeal and replace the Obama-era clean water regulation.\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said the delay of the 2015 rule that defined which small waterways can be governed by federal regulations will “reduce confusion and provide certainty to America’s farmers and ranchers.”\nThe agency is currently reviewing public comments for its 2017 proposal to rescind the rule. It is also working with the Army Corps of Engineers to develop a potential replacement rule that “would revise the definition of waters of the United States.”\nReporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ",
