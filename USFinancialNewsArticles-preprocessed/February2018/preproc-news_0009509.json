    "text": "LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Vodafone, the worldâ€™s second largest mobile operator, reported a 1.1 percent rise in organic service revenue for its third quarter, a slight slowdown on the second, due to more promotional activity in some European markets.\nThe company, however, said on Thursday it remained on track to meet its full-year guidance to grow organic adjusted earnings by around 10 percent.\nReporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
