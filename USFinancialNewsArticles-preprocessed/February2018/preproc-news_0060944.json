    "text": "(Reuters) - Ohio on Monday accused four major pharmaceutical distributors of ignoring their responsibilities to ensure that opioids were not being diverted for improper uses, contributing to a drug abuse epidemic in the state. \nThe lawsuit by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine was filed in a state court against McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health Inc, AmerisourceBergen Corp and Miami-Luken Inc and marked the second he has pursued over corporations’ roles in the opioid crisis. \n“They knew the amount of opioids allowed to flow into Ohio far exceeded what could be consumed for medically necessary purposes, but they did nothing to stop it,” DeWine said in a statement. \nThe lawsuit seeks compensatory damages for the increased costs Ohio incurred for healthcare, criminal justice, social services and education. It also seeks punitive damages. \nRepresentatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have previously denied similar allegations in other cases. \nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths natiionwide in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nHundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders. \nDeWine previously in May 2017 sued Purdue Pharma LP, Endo International Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Allergan Plc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd , accusing them of deceptively marketing opioids. They have denied wrongdoing. \nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ",
