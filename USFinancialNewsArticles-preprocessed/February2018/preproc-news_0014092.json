    "text": "LAS VEGAS, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PlayAGS, Inc. (\"AGS\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: AGS) today announced that it has completed the repricing of its existing $513 million term loans under its First Lien Credit Agreement (the \"Term Loans\"). The Term Loans were repriced from 550 basis points to 425 basis points over LIBOR. The LIBOR floor remains at 100 basis points. As a result of the repricing, the Company expects to realize annual cash interest savings of approximately $6.4 million. The repriced Term Loans continue to be due in full in February 2024.\n\"After executing our initial public offering less than two weeks ago, we immediately started work on repricing our Term Loans to reduce our annual interest expense and provide us with more cash to grow and operate the business,\" said David Lopez, Chief Executive Officer of AGS. \"With a stronger credit profile, we are pleased to now be in a position to generate additional cash flows, which provide a future opportunity for incremental deleveraging.\"\nAbout AGS\nAGS, LLC. is a global company focused on creating a diverse mix of entertaining gaming experiences for every kind of player.
