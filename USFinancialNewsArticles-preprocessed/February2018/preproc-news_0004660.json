    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday called for the removal of the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, saying he had acted dishonestly in altering a memo about the Russia probe.\n“It has now come to our attention that Congressman (Devin) Nunes deliberately and materially altered the contents of the memo since it was voted on by the House Republicans,” Pelosi said in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan. “This action is not only dangerous, it is illegitimate, and violates House rules.”\nAny decision to remove Nunes would be one for Ryan to make. The committee had agreed to release the memo, which alleges bias against President Donald Trump at the FBI, in a move supported by Ryan.\nReporting by Tim Ahmann\n ",
