    "text": "(Adds detail about merger defense, dividend, comment from company)\nZURICH, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Clariant’s full-year net profit rose 9.5 percent, well under analyst estimates, as the Swiss specialty chemicals maker was hit by one-time costs amid a bitter fight with an activist shareholder that forced it to abandon a planned merger.\nClariant’s net profit after minority interests rose to 277 million Swiss francs ($297 million), it said on Wednesday, compared to the 332 million franc average estimate of analysts polled by Reuters.\nIt had 180 million francs in one-time costs, compared to 107 million francs in 2016, as Clariant hired Goldman Sachs to help defend itself against activist investor White Tale.\nWhite Tale pressured the Swiss company into abandoning a planned merger with U.S. company Huntsman\nIn January, Saudi Basic Industries Corp bought a 25 percent stake in Clariant from the activist investors. SABIC, the world’s number four chemical firm, said it had no current plans to launch a full takeover.\nFull-year sales rose to 6.38 billion francs, in line with the average analyst poll estimate of 6.34 billion francs.\n“The results are particularly encouraging as all business areas contributed to this expansion,” Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann said in a statement.\n”For 2018, we are confident that we will further grow in local currency, operating cash flow and profitability.”\nClariant proposed a dividend hike of 11 percent to 0.50 francs, matching the poll forecast.\nThe Muttenz-based company stuck to its mid-term target of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation before exceptional items of 16 to 19 percent of sales.\nFor 2017, its adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.3 percent, up from 15.2 percent in 2016.\n$1 = 0.9327 Swiss francs Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Michael Shields\n ",
