    "text": "MAYNARD, Mass., Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acacia Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACIA), a leading provider of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“While we continue to face some headwinds in the market, our fourth quarter 2017 results were in-line with our expectations,\" said Raj Shanmugaraj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acacia Communications. “Our team at Acacia continued to execute well on new product introductions and on our ongoing customer diversification efforts. We are pleased with our product roadmap and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as conditions improve.”\n“In we were able to increase our gross margins and cash balance on a quarter over quarter basis -- demonstrating the strength of our leveraged business model,” said John Gavin, Chief Financial Officer of Acacia Communications. “While we are projecting first quarter 2018 revenue to be down sequentially, like others in our industry, we see signs of improving market conditions in 2018, although we continue to remain cautious.”\nResults for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nRevenue of $86.6 million, decreased 39.2% year-over-year GAAP gross margin of 46.2%; non-GAAP gross margin* of 44.5% GAAP income from operations of $4.9 million; non-GAAP income from operations* of $9.2 million GAAP net loss of $20.4 million; non-GAAP net income* of $11.1 million EBITDA* of $8.0 million; adjusted EBITDA* of $12.3 million GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.52; non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $0.27\nResults for the Full Year 2017\nRevenue of $385.2 million, decreased 19.5% year-over-year GAAP gross margin of 43.6%; non-GAAP gross margin* of 45.4% GAAP income from operations of $37.1 million; non-GAAP income from operations* of $65.5 million GAAP net income of $38.5 million; non-GAAP net income* of $73.1 million EBITDA* of $49.2 million; adjusted EBITDA* of $77.7 million GAAP diluted EPS of $0.92; non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $1.75\nOutlook for the First Quarter of 2018\nThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this press release. Acacia Communications disclaims any obligation to update these\nAcacia Communications’ guidance for its first quarter ending March 31, 2018 is:\nQuarter Ending March 31, 2018 Revenue (millions) $67.0 to $74.0 Non-GAAP Net Income* (millions) $0.3 to $4.3 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS* $0.01 to $0.10 *Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Please refer below to Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information for descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and to the Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures, attached as Schedule D, for reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP financial measures.\nAcacia Communications has not reconciled the above first quarter 2018 guidance for GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because the expected tax benefits derived from any employee equity awards during the first quarter of 2018 cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call\nAcacia Communications will host a conference call to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, recent developments and the Company’s business outlook and strategy at 5 p.m. Eastern Time today. The live webcast of the call, along with the Company’s earnings press release, can be accessed at the Acacia Communications’ Investor Relations website at http://ir.acacia-inc.com .

A replay of the conference call will be available until March 8, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, while an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Acacia Communications’ Investor Relations website for 90 days. The U.S. dial-in for the conference call replay is 1-877-660-6853 (1-201-612-7415 for non-U.S. callers). The replay access code is 13675242.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nSchedule D of this press release provides reconciliations of Acacia Communications’ most comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nAcacia Communications believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, in addition to providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures, provides investors the benefit of viewing the Company’s performance using the same financial metrics that its management team uses in making many key decisions and evaluating how its results of operations may look in the future. Acacia Communications’ management does not believe that items not involving cash expenditures, such as non-cash compensation related to equity awards and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability changes derived from mark-to-market adjustments, are part of its critical decision making process. Also, Acacia Communications’ management does not believe that warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue are reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance. Additionally, Acacia Communications’ management believes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), including the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings, is a unique event that limits comparability with prior periods and does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing business operations for the period in which they were incurred. Therefore, Acacia Communications excludes those items, as applicable, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nAcacia Communications’ non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the metrics described below, as well as the related income tax effects. The income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments is determined by recalculating income tax expense excluding these adjustments.\nNon-GAAP gross profit and gross margin . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit as reported on its consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash charge, and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross margin as the non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue as reported on its consolidated income statements. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP research and development expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP research and development expenses as research and development expenses as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP research and development expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses as sales, general and administrative expenses as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP operating expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP income from operations . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP income from operations because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry.\nNon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS . Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and the change in fair value of the Company’s preferred stock warrant liability, both of which are non-cash charges, as well as warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, and the tax effects of those excluded items. Additionally, the impacts of the Act have been excluded as it is a unique event that limits comparability with prior periods and does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of the Company's continuing business operations for the period in which they were incurred.\nAcacia Communications defines non-GAAP effective tax rate as the non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes divided by non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as the provision (benefit) for income taxes as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements, as adjusted for the tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Company’s preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, as well as the impact of the Act. Non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as GAAP income before provision (benefit) for income taxes, excluding stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Company’s preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue.\nIn order to calculate non-GAAP diluted EPS, Acacia Communications uses a non-GAAP weighted-average share count. The Company defines non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute non-GAAP diluted EPS as GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute diluted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted to reflect the conversion of its redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock and the conversion of its redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants into common stock warrants, both as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. For periods in which there was a GAAP net loss resulting in GAAP diluted net loss per share, the impact of dilutive stock-based awards was added to the GAAP weighted-average share count to calculate the GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nAcacia Communications has presented non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS because the Company believes that the exclusion of the items discussed above facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry and more accurately reflects the underlying performance of our continuing business operations.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA . Acacia Communications defines EBITDA as net income (loss) as reported on the Company’s consolidated income statements before depreciation, interest income, net, and its provision (benefit) for income taxes. Acacia Communications defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, the change in fair value of the Company’s preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications has presented adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by its management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing its business. In particular, Acacia Communications believes that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core operating performance.\nAcacia Communications uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and trends, and make planning decisions. Acacia Communications believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that the Company excludes. Accordingly, Acacia Communications believes that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nAcacia Communications’ non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures rather than gross profit, gross margin, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, income from operations, net income (loss), effective tax rate or diluted EPS, which are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations are:\nAcacia Communications excludes stock-based compensation expense from each of its non-GAAP financial measures, although it has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for its business and an important part of the Company’s compensation strategy;\nAcacia Communications excludes the tax benefits generated from the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and ESPP shares, and the vesting of restricted stock units, including any excess tax benefits and shortfalls recognized by the Company in the year of the taxable transaction, in calculating its non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. The Company believes that excluding these tax benefits enables investors to see the full effect that excluding stock-based compensation expense had on the operating results. These benefits are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying employee equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of exercise or vesting, which factors may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of the Company's business. Similar to stock-based compensation expense, the Company believes that excluding these tax benefits provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of its business operations and facilitates comparison with other periods as well as the results of other companies in its industry;\nAcacia Communications excludes the change in fair value of its preferred stock warrant liability from its non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as it has historically been a recurring non-cash charge but it has not recurred in the periods following the Company’s initial public offering;\nAcacia Communications excludes warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue from its non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as management does not believe the charges are reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance;\nNon-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS do not reflect the impact of the Act, part of which is federal taxes incurred on the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings which will be paid over an eight-year period;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude depreciation expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income, which increases cash available to the Company, as this income is not generated by the Company's core operations;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the provision (benefit) for income tax which may impact cash available to the Company; and\nthe expenses and other items that the Company excludes in its calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results.\nBecause of these limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAcacia Communications’ use of non-GAAP financial measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that Acacia Communications will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.\nInvestors should consider Acacia Communications’ non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Acacia Communications\nAcacia Communications develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost.
