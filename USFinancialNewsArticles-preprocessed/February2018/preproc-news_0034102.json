The 32-year-old Elliott was injured Saturday against the Arizona Coyotes.\nNeuvirth stopped 32 shots.\nKonecny put the Flyers ahead 1-0 with his 14th goal just 1:54 into the first.\nHall tied the game at 1 but Laughton registered his ninth goal 43 seconds later at 4:49 to push the Flyers to a 2-1 advantage.\nGudas scored a rare goal at 10:36 and the Flyers moved to a 3-1 lead. It was just the second goal for Gudas all season.\nThe Devils kept the pressure on Neuvirth and finally were able to close within 3-2 after Sean Couturier’s penalty for tripping had expired. Moore scored at 13:17 to trim the margin to one goal.\nPhiladelphia didn’t waste much time in going back up 4-2 when Giroux connected on the power play though the shot deflected off Devils defenseman Ben Lovejoy’s stick and into the net at 15:59.\nThe wild second period continued with yet another goal as Hischier scored 10 seconds later to get within 4-3.\nOverall, six goals were scored in the second -- three by each team.\nThe fast pace continued in the third and the Devils were able to tie the game late.\nHall scored his second goal -- his 23rd of the season -- with 1:21 remaining in the third to equalize at 4.\nThe best chance in overtime came for the Flyers when Giroux found Voracek in front but was stymied by Kinkaid.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
