    "text": "(Writes through with context)\nLONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Zara fashion chain owner Inditex fell more than 7 percent to a three-year low on Friday after JP Morgan cut its price target for the company weeks before it is due to report annual results.\nInditex, due to report on March 14, will hold a conference call with financial analysts later on Friday, according to traders. Inditex could not immediately confirm whether it planned to hold such a call.\nJPMorgan said it was cutting its price target to 35.5 euros from 38 euros and its forecasts by 5 percent due to negative foreign exchange effects. It said it believed sales slowed in the second half of the fourth quarter.\nInditex was trading 7.7 percent lower by 1240 GMT at 24.78 euros, a three-year low.\nInditex had no immediate comment. Spain’s market regulator declined to comment.\nInditex reports in euros but makes around half of its sales in other currencies, meaning the fluctuations of the euro against a basket of dozens of other currencies affects earnings.\nMany of the Asian and Latin American currencies are dollar-linked meaning a strong euro and weak dollar negatively impact results at the world’s biggest clothes retailer.\nThe euro has risen 2.5 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year.
