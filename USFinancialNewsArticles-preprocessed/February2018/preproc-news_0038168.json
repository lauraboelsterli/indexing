(TSX:SMT, BVL:SMT) (\"Sierra Metals\" or the \"Company\") announces the filing of Sociedad Minera Corona S.A.'s (\"Corona\") audited Financial Statements and the Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the fourth quarter of 2017 (\"Q4 2017\").\nThe Company holds an 81.8% interest in Corona. All amounts are presented in US dollars unless otherwise stated, and have not been adjusted for the 18.2% non-controlling interest.\nCorona's Highlights for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues of US$38.2 million vs. US$31.8 million in Q4 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of US$17.5 million vs. US$14.9 million in Q4 2016 Total tonnes processed of 266,222 vs. 236,650 in Q4 2016 Net production revenue per tonne of ore milled increased by 6% to US$141.10 Cash cost per zinc equivalent payable pound higher by 33% to US$0.57 All in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") per zinc equivalent payable pound higher by 22% to US$0.90 Zinc equivalent production of 35.8 million pounds vs. 36.8 million pounds in Q4 2016 $19.9 million of cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2017 $27.8 million of working capital as at December 31, 2017\nSierra Metals has successfully focused on increasing the production of higher value ore and improving recoveries at the Yauricocha Mine and has also benefited from improvements to metal prices resulting in significant increases in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The Company's continued emphasis at Yauricocha will be to focus on the production of higher value ore, improving recoveries, cost reductions where possible, and improving the Company's production through optimization programs which will directly improve operating margins and cash flow generation.\n\"The Yauricocha Mine had a strong performance in Q4 2017 with continuing operational and exploration successes\" stated Igor Gonzales, President, and CEO of Sierra Metals. \"With the consecutive quarterly increase in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and operating cash flows compared to Q4 2016, we continue to reap the benefits of the operational improvements program completed at Yauricocha. Furthermore, a 6% increase in the net production revenue per tonne of ore milled to US$141.10 continues to demonstrate that the capital investments were well spent.\"\nHe concluded \"With a continued emphasis on processing higher value ore, which in turn has positively impacted operating margins and cash flow, Corona continues to have a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. Management remains very optimistic about continued operational efficiencies and future operational and resource growth at Yauricocha.\"\nThe following table displays selected audited financial information for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:\n(In thousands of US dollars, except cash cost and revenue\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nper tonne metrics)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nVar %\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nVar %\nRevenue\n$\n38,227\n31,849\n20%\n154,153\n97,290\n58%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n17,534\n14,905\n18%\n75,779\n34,991\n117%\nCash Flow from operations\n18,022\n14,830\n22%\n76,269\n25,124\n204%\nGross profit\n18,357\n13,765\n33%\n73,828\n35,773\n106%\nIncome Tax Expense\n(5,717)\n(4,302)\n33%\n(20,682)\n(8,550)\n142%\nNet Income\n10,624\n8,009\n33%\n41,621\n17,234\n142%\nNet production revenue per tonne of ore milled (2)\n141.10\n132.66\n6%\n149.63\n107.95\n39%\nCash cost per tonne of ore milled (2)\n64.90\n56.15\n16%\n62.42\n55.78\n12%\nCash cost per zinc equivalent payable pound (2)\n0.57\n0.43\n33%\n0.50\n0.42\n19%\nAll-In Sustaining Cost per zinc equivalent payable pound (2)\n$\n0.90\n0.74\n22%\n0.78\n0.71\n11%\n(In thousands of US dollars, unless otherwise stated)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n19,908\n36,877\nAssets\n140,414\n128,769\nLiabilities\n50,844\n62,254\nEquity\n89,570\n66,515\n1 Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for depletion and depreciation, interest expense and other financing costs, interest income, share-based compensation, Foreign Exchange (gain) loss and income taxes; see non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the Company's MD&A.\n2 All-In Sustaining Cost per zinc equivalent pound sold are non-IFRS performance measures and include cost of sales, treatment and refining charges, sustaining capital expenditures, general and administrative expense, and selling expense, and exclude workers' profit sharing, depreciation, and other non-cash provisions; Cash cost zinc equivalent pound sold, net production revenue per tonne of ore milled, and cash cost per tonne of ore milled are non-IFRS performance measures; see non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the Company's MD&A.\nCorona's Financial Highlights for the Three Months and Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues of $38.2 million for Q4 2017 compared to $31.8 million in Q4 2016 and revenues of $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $97.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in revenues for Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016 was due to a 12% increase in tonnes processed, higher head grades for copper and zinc, and higher recoveries for silver and copper. Increases in the prices of copper (32%), zinc (25%), lead (27%), and gold (6%) also contributed to the revenue improvement. The 58% increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 was due to a 14% increase in tonnes processed, higher head grades for copper and zinc, higher recoveries for all metals, except gold, and an increase in the prices of all metals, except silver. Cash cost per zinc equivalent pound sold at the Yauricocha Mine of $0.57 for Q4 2017 compared to $0.43 for Q4 2016 and $0.50 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.42 for the same period in 2016. All-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") per zinc equivalent pound sold of $0.90 for Q4 2017 compared to $0.74 for Q4 2016 and $0.78 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.71 for the same period in 2016. The increase in the AISC per zinc equivalent payable pound for Q4 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 were a result of increased sustaining capital expenditures. These included a substantial amount of infill drilling, ventilation improvements, equipment purchases, as well as plant improvements that were completed. The increase was also a result of temporary increases to the mining costs partially due to timing; as well as slight increases including infill drilling and drift development costs that will be utilized within one year, and thus are included in opex. Adjusted EBITDA of $17.5 million for Q4 2017 compared to $14.9 million for Q4 2016 and $75.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $35.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, was due to the increase in revenues discussed previously. Operating cash flows before movements in working capital of $18.0 million for Q4 2017, compared to US$14.8 million for Q4 2016, and $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $25.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in operating cash flows before movements in working capital for Q4 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016 was primarily due to the increase in revenues, discussed previously. Cash and cash equivalents of $19.9 million as at December 31, 2017, compared to $36.9 million as at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $17.0 million which was driven by operating cash flows of $54.9 million, offset by capital expenditures of $18.7 million, debt and interest payments of $21.8 million, intercompany loans of $12.9 million, and dividends paid of $18.4 million. Net income of $10.6 million, or $0.30 per share for Q4 2017 compared to net income of $8.0 million, or $0.22 per share for Q4 2016. Net income of $41.6 million, or $1.16 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17.2 million, or $0.48 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nCorona's Operational Highlights for the Three Months and Year Ended December 31, 2017:\nThe following table displays the production results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:\nYauricocha Production\n3 Months Ended\n12 Months Ended\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n% Var.\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n% Var.\nTonnes processed (mt)\n266,222\n236,650\n12%\n1,023,491\n897,169\n14%\nDaily throughput\n3,043\n2,705\n12%\n2,924\n2,563\n14%\nSilver grade (g/t)\n53.57\n100.37\n-47%\n67.13\n97.69\n-31%\nCopper grade\n0.80%\n0.51%\n58%\n0.79%\n0.54%\n48%\nLead grade\n1.19%\n2.18%\n-45%\n1.48%\n2.52%\n-41%\nZinc grade\n3.91%\n3.63%\n8%\n3.74%\n3.18%\n18%\nGold Grade (g/t)\n0.55\n0.59\n-7%\n0.54\n0.64\n-16%\nSilver recovery\n75.13%\n72.05%\n4%\n74.82%\n65.34%\n15%\nCopper recovery\n78.86%\n64.75%\n22%\n65.45%\n59.26%\n10%\nLead recovery\n81.32%\n81.72%\n0%\n83.64%\n73.07%\n14%\nZinc recovery\n88.25%\n88.49%\n0%\n89.14%\n87.18%\n2%\nGold Recovery\n16.02%\n20.06%\n-20%\n16.30%\n25.19%\n-35%\nSilver ounces (000's)\n330\n550\n-40%\n1,653\n1,841\n-10%\nCopper pounds (000's)\n3,567\n1,720\n107%\n11,719\n6,281\n87%\nLead pounds (000's)\n5,431\n9,295\n-42%\n27,934\n36,440\n-23%\nZinc pounds (000's)\n19,393\n16,776\n16%\n75,151\n54,805\n37%\nGold ounces\n723\n908\n-20%\n2,894\n4,664\n-38%\nZinc equivalent pounds (000's) (1)\n35,758\n36,841\n-3%\n146,816\n140,928\n4%\n(1) Zinc equivalent pounds for Q4 2017 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.77/oz Ag, $3.13/lb Cu, $1.11/lb Pb, $1.45/lb Zn, $1,282/oz Au.
