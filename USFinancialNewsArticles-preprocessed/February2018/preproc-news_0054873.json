    "text": "LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil production at Libya’s El Feel has not been affected so far by ongoing protests, and the oilfield is pumping around 70,000 barrels per day, a Libyan oil source told Reuters on Thursday.\nSome workers at the field were evacuated after guards withdrew in a protest over pay, a local source from the town of Murzuq said on Wednesday.\nThe field is operated by Mellitah, a joint venture between Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) and Italy’s Eni.
