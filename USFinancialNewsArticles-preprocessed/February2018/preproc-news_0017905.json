    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- An affiliate of Rubenstein Partners, L.P., a vertically-integrated real estate investment manager focused on value-added office property opportunities, is acquiring a majority interest in 111 K Street, NE, an 11-story Class-A trophy office building located in the NoMa/Capitol Hill submarket of Washington D.C.\n111 K Street is organized as a condominium regime and Rubenstein will be purchasing or controlling through the condominium regime approximately 80% of the property square footage. The almost 90,000-square-foot boutique building features a diversified tenant roster of full-floor occupants representing non-profits, associations and other business service sectors. Developed in 2010, the Gensler designed trophy property is freestanding with floor-to-ceiling glass offering exceptional views from every office space within the building. In addition, the property offers a superior amenity base, including a rooftop terrace with spectacular views including those of the US Capitol, two conference centers and a fitness facility. A ground floor fast casual restaurant is also planned to open shortly after Rubenstein's purchase.\nThe property is situated in the heart of NoMa at the corner of First and K Streets, NE, two blocks North of Union Station, one of the Country's most traveled transit centers. Tenants have easy accessibility to the Metrorail, MARC, VRE, Amtrak and the new H Street Streetcar, as well as major thoroughfares to Northern Virginia and Maryland. Once an emerging submarket, NoMa has grown into a 24/7 mixed-use area that is strengthening further with development in the immediate vicinity of the property, in addition to points to the East, including the renovation of Uline Arena, Union Market and several recently announced office, residential, retail and hotel projects.\n\"The bones of the building provide a great starting point for Rubenstein's re-branding efforts,\" notes Steve Evans, Regional Director, \"but we intend to enhance these amenities with physical upgrades, better technology and more comprehensive tenant concierge services. In addition, we plan on dramatically improving the building's recognition to the real estate community through better marketing and a focus on leasing the remaining three (3) floors of vacancy to full and partial floor tenants.\"\nAbout Rubenstein Partners\nRubenstein Partners, founded in September 2005, is a private real estate investment management and advisory firm with operations throughout the Eastern United States.
