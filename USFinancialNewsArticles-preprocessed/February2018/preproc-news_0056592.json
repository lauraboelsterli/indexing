    "text": "NEW YORK, Tyme Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TYME) (the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics, today announced that it had commenced an underwritten public offering of up to 12 million shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The Company also intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.8 million shares of common stock from the Company at the offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. All of the shares of common stock to be sold in the offering will be offered by the Company.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for research and further development of its lead clinical program SM-88 and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses. The Company may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own, although it has no current plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions as of the date hereof.\nEvercore Group L.L.C. and Stifel are serving as joint book-running managers and as representatives of the underwriters for the proposed offering. Canaccord Genuity Inc. is also acting as bookrunner.\nThe offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and an accompanying prospectus filed as part of an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on Form S-3 and declared effective on August 16, 2017. A copy of the preliminary prospectus supplement and related base prospectus for the offering has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov . Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the final prospectus supplement, when available, may be obtained from Evercore Group L.L.C. at Attention: Equity Capital Markets, 55 East 52nd Street, 36th Floor, New York, NY 10055, by telephone at (888) 474-0200, or by email at ecm.prospectus@evercore.com ; Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated at Attention: Syndicate, One Montgomery Street, Suite 3700, San Francisco, CA 94104, by telephone at (415) 364-2720, or by email at syndprospectus@stifel.com ; or Canaccord Genuity Inc. at Attention: Syndicate Department, 99 High Street, 12th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, or by telephone at (617) 371-3900.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Tyme Technologies\nTyme Technologies, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics that are intended to be broadly effective across tumor types while having a low toxicity profile. Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, the Company’s therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. The Company’s lead clinical program, SM-88, is a novel combination therapy currently in Phase II development for prostate cancer, and the Company is preparing to initiate an additional Phase II clinical trial in pancreatic cancer.\nForward-Looking Statements/Disclosure Notice\nIn addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements within this press release include, without limitation, statements regarding our drug candidates (including SM-88), their clinical potential and non-toxic safety profiles, our drug development plans and strategies, our completed studies, ongoing and planned clinical trials, preliminary data results and the therapeutic design and mechanisms of our drug candidates; and readers can identify forward-looking statements by sentences or passages involving the use of terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “designed,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on management’s current expectations, which are subject to uncertainty, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any historical results and future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to achieve clinical study start and completion dates; the possibility of unfavorable study results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing data; risks associated with early, initial data, including the risk that the final Phase II data analysis, final results of additional clinical trials, or both, may be different from the preliminary data analysis and may not support further clinical development; whether and when any applications or other submissions for SM-88 may be filed with regulatory authorities; whether and when regulatory authorities may approve any applications or submissions; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters that could affect commercial availability of SM-88; competitive developments; and the factors described in the sections captioned “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (available at www.sec.gov ). The data set forth in these updated analyses are not necessarily predictive of future patient or clinical data outcomes.\nThe information contained in this press release is as of release date and the Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of future events or developments.\nContact\nTyme Technologies, Inc.\nJonathan Eckard\nChief Scientific Affairs Officer\njon.eckard@tymeinc.com\nICR Healthcare\nInvestors\nStephanie Carrington\nStephanie.Carrington@icrinc.com\n646-277-1282\nSource:Tyme Technologies, Inc.",
