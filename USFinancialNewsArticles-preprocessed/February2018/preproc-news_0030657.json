With each of them on board, I know that we will be able to produce incredible results that drive performance outcomes for our clients and, ultimately, for iProspect.\"\nGrossman, who works out of iProspect's Chicago, Illinois office, is responsible for the agency's technology strategy and ongoing platform development, specifically within its proprietary conversion platform technology, LFX™. He will work across all clients, as well as new business, to identify client challenges and deliver best-in-class solutions integrating media and conversion technology.\nPrior to joining iProspect, Grossman served as Chief Technology Officer for Leapfrog Online, a performance marketing solutions company acquired in 2017 by iProspect. During his tenure at the company, Grossman played an integral role in bringing to life the LFX Conversion Platform™. The platform provides instrumentation of the consumer experience, offering automated, rule-driven and machine-learning based decisioning and orchestration of online and offline media, conversion, nurturing and post-conversion interactions with consumers. Grossman also founded and served as managing partner of Pivotal Click, a digital product development firm focused on customer acquisition, which was acquired by Leapfrog in 2008.\n\"Our clients trust iProspect to deliver strong returns on media, and with the LFX™ technology, we ensure those returns pay off beyond ads and campaigns. Media-driven personalization of the entire customer experience is not just a priority, but a necessity,\" said Grossman. \"This is why I am so excited to join the leadership team. I know iProspect will be bringing a unique set of proprietary technology to our clients to unlock true value in their marketing efforts.\"\nLenz, who is based out of iProspect's headquarters in New York, is responsible for overseeing all marketing, communications and new business efforts for the agency within the U.S. She will work closely with the other members of the leadership team to tell the story of iProspect through its unique capabilities and strong assets to resonate across current clients and new business prospects.\nLenz comes to iProspect from parent company Dentsu Aegis Network , where she served as Communications Director for the Americas. In this position, Lenz oversaw all communications efforts across the network, including digital communications strategy, internal and external communications and content creation for social channels. Prior to her time at Dentsu Aegis Network, Lenz served as Vice President of Corporate Communications for IPG Mediabrands, and Director of Corporate Communications in North America for Havas Media. An experienced marketing, media and technology professional, Lenz currently sits on the 4A's Communications Committee.\n\"iProspect has proven itself as a digital leader capable of building its clients' brands through performance,\" said Lenz. \"I look forward to contributing to the next chapter of the agency's growth and working alongside some of the most innovative people in the industry who I have admired for years.\"\nThe addition of Grossman and Lenz to iProspect's leadership team expands the agency's ability to grow within the market and offer the strongest performance solutions to clients.
