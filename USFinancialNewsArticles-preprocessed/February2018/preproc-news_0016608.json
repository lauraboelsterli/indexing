    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC. (NASDAQ: PTEN) today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported net income of $195 million, or $0.88 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $78.1 million, or $0.53 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $787 million, compared to $247 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $5.9 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $319 million, or $2.18 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $2.4 billion, compared to $916 million for 2016.\nThe financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include net after-tax items of $218 million, or $0.98 per share. These items include a benefit of $219 million, or $0.99 per share, related to a non-cash revaluation of deferred tax items arising from lower corporate tax rates as part of recent tax legislation, $8.7 million of pre-tax merger and integration expenses ($6.4 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share), and an $8.4 million pre-tax gain ($6.2 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) related to the sale of certain oil and gas properties. Excluding these items, the net loss per share for the quarter would have been $0.10. Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the aforementioned adjustment to the deferred tax items, as well as merger and integration expenses totaling $74.4 million pre-tax, a non-cash impairment charge totaling $29.0 million and gains from the sale of certain real estate and oil and gas interests totaling $19.6 million. Excluding these items, the net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been $0.80.\nAndy Hendricks, Patterson-UTI's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Before reviewing the financial results, I want to express again that all of us at Patterson-UTI are mourning those who lost their lives in the tragic accident in Oklahoma. There is nothing more important to us than the safety of our employees and others we partner with in the field.\"\nMr. Hendricks added, \"Turning to the fourth quarter, despite widespread concerns for lower industry drilling activity, our rig count rebounded through the quarter. Even with the typical holiday slowdown in Canada, our rig count at the end of the year was near the highest level of 2017. Our average rig count for the fourth quarter was unchanged relative to the third quarter at 161 rigs. For the month of January 2018 our average rig count was 165.\n\"Average rig margin per day for the fourth quarter increased $280 sequentially to $8,010, as a $630 increase in average rig revenue per day offset a $350 increase in average rig operating costs per day. Average rig revenue per day of $20,950 was better than expected, as the market for super-spec rigs remains tight. Average rig operating costs per day increased, as expected, to $12,940 from an unusually low level in the third quarter.\n\"We completed all seven of the previously announced rig upgrades to APEX-XK®, and continue to see strong demand for super-spec rigs. As such, we now have customer contracts to support the upgrade of five additional APEX® rigs - two to become APEX-XK® rigs and three to become APEX-PK™ rigs. These five upgraded rigs are expected to be delivered in the first half of 2018.\n\"As of December 31, 2017, we had term contracts for drilling rigs providing for approximately $540 million of future dayrate drilling revenue, an increase from $470 million at September 30, 2017. Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 96 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter, and an average of 67 rigs operating under term contracts during 2018.\n\"In pressure pumping, revenues increased 12% sequentially to $407 million for the fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 20.4% for the fourth quarter from 19.9% for the third quarter.\n\"Late in the fourth quarter we reactivated one additional frac spread, and ended the year with 1.25 million horsepower active, comprising 23 frac spreads. For 2018 we have several initiatives underway by which to benefit from the expected strength in the pressure pumping market. These initiatives include optimizing our average spread size to gain an extra active spread from already active equipment, relocating a couple spreads out of the Mid-Continent to more profitable markets, and reactivating additional idle frac spreads.\n\"On October 11, 2017, we completed the acquisition of MS Directional, a leading U.S. directional drilling services company. As such, financial results for the fourth quarter include 81 days of post-acquisition contribution. Directional drilling revenues totaled $45.6 million and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 29.4%.\"\nMark S. Siegel, Chairman of Patterson-UTI, stated, \"Looking back on 2017, it was a transformational year for Patterson-UTI. We both strengthened and diversified our company through strategic acquisitions that improved our scale in drilling and pressure pumping and added new services in directional drilling, oilfield rentals, and drilling technology. Patterson-UTI is the only company in the U.S. unconventional market with significant scale in drilling, pressure pumping, and directional drilling.\"\nMr. Siegel, continued, \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by the tragic accident in Oklahoma and their loved ones. We would like to thank the first responders, emergency personnel, authorities and others for their tremendous courage and efforts as well as the local people in and around Quinton, Oklahoma, who dropped everything to offer support to those affected,\" he concluded.\nThe Company declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.02 per share, to be paid on March 22, 2018, to holders of record as of March 8, 2018.\nAll references to \"per share\" in this press release are diluted earnings per common share as defined within Accounting Standards Codification Topic 260.\nThe Company's quarterly conference call to discuss the operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, is scheduled for today, February 8, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill). We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and a comparison of the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBTIDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss). Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures of other companies.\nPATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.\nSelected Costs and Expenses\n(unaudited, dollars and shares in thousands)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nPre-tax\nAfter-tax\nPer share\nNon-cash revaluation of deferred tax items from tax reform\n$\n218,651\n$\n0.99\nMerger and integration expenses\n$\n(8,653)\n(6,416)\n(0.03)\nGain on sale of certain oil and gas properties\n$\n8,417\n6,241\n0.03\n$\n218,476\n$\n0.98\nNormalized effective tax rate\n25.85\n%\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\n219,843\nAdd dilutive effect of potential common shares\n2,061\nWeighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding\n221,904\nPATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.\nPro forma Net Loss per Share for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\n(unaudited, in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet income as reported\n$\n195,402\nNon-cash revaluation of deferred tax items from tax reform\n(218,651)\nAfter-tax merger and integration expenses\n6,416\nAfter-tax gain on sale of certain oil and gas properties\n(6,241)\nPro-forma net loss without items\n$\n(23,074)\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\n219,843\nPro-forma net loss per share\n$\n(0.10)\nPATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.\nPro forma Net Loss per Share for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n(unaudited, dollars and shares in thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet income as reported\n$\n5,910\nPretax merger and integration expenses\n74,451\nPretax non-cash impairment charge\n28,979\nPretax gain on sale of certain real estate and oil and gas interests\n(19,627)\n83,803\nEffective tax rate\n35.1\n%\nAfter-tax amount\n54,388\nNon-cash revaluation of deferred tax items from tax reform\n(218,651)\nPro-forma net loss without items\n$\n(158,353)\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding\n198,447\nPro-forma net loss per share\n$\n(0.80)\nPATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.\nEffective Tax Rate Computation\n(unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nLoss before income taxes as reported\n$\n(31,356)\n$\n(327,801)\nIncome tax benefit as reported\n$\n(226,758)\n$\n(333,711)\nLess: non-cash revaluation of deferred tax items from tax reform\n218,651\n218,651\nNormalized income tax benefit\n$\n(8,107)\n$\n(115,060)\nNormalized effective tax rate\n25.85\n%\n35.10\n%\nPATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.\nContract Drilling Per Day Successive Quarters\n(unaudited, dollars in thousands)\n2017\nFourth\nThird\nQuarter\nQuarter\nContract drilling revenues\n$\n309,580\n$\n301,614\nOperating days - Total\n14,776\n14,841\nAverage revenue per operating day - Total\n$\n20.95\n$\n20.32\nDirect operating costs - Total\n$\n191,269\n$\n186,957\nAverage direct operating costs per operating day - Total\n$\n12.94\n$\n12.60\nAverage margin per operating day - Total\n$\n8.01\n$\n7.73\nPATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.\nPressure Pumping Margin and Adjusted EBITDA\n(unaudited, dollars in thousands)\n2017\nFourth\nThird\nQuarter\nQuarter\nPressure pumping revenues\n$\n406,652\n$\n362,441\nDirect operating costs\n323,607\n290,315\nMargin\n83,045\n72,126\nSelling, general and administrative\n3,926\n4,011\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n79,119\n$\n68,115\nMargin as a percentage of revenues\n20.4\n%\n19.9\n%\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/patterson-uti-energy-reports-financial-results-for-three-and-twelve-months-ended-december-31-2017-300595540.html\nSOURCE PATTERSON-UTI ENERGY, INC.",
