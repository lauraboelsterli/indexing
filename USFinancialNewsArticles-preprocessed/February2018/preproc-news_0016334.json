(NYSE: WGL):\nConsolidated Results\nWGL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: WGL), the parent company of Washington Gas Light Company (Washington Gas) and other energy-related subsidiaries, today reported net income applicable to common stock determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, of $138.0 million, or $2.68 per share, an improvement of $80.0 million, or $1.55 per share, over net income applicable to common stock of $58.0 million, or $1.13 per share, reported for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nOur GAAP net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflects an income tax benefit driven by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which, among other effects, reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we have remeasured our accumulated deferred income tax assets and liabilities, reducing the total net liability by $476.4 million. Of the total reduction, we recognized a $52.9 million income tax benefit (net) in GAAP net income primarily related to non-utility operations and recorded the remaining amount, $423.5 million to regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP operating earnings (as described below) for the quarter have been adjusted to eliminate the re-measurement impact of the legislation; however, both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings continue to benefit from the year-to-year reduction in the corporate tax rate. Amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized, which along with the prospective reduction in the provision for income tax expense, WGL estimates will result in a net reduction in annual costs to customers of approximately $39.5 million. Washington Gas plans to pass these annual tax savings on to customers through reduced rates beginning in the second quarter of WGL's 2018 fiscal year, subject to regulatory commission approvals.\nOn a consolidated basis, WGL uses non-GAAP operating earnings (loss) to evaluate overall financial performance, and evaluates segment financial performance based on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and adjusted EBIT. Operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT are non-GAAP financial measures, which are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. Both non-GAAP operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT adjust for the accounting recognition of certain transactions that we believe are not representative of the ongoing earnings of the company. Additionally, we believe that adjusted EBIT enhances the ability to evaluate segment performance because it excludes interest and income tax expense, which are affected by corporate-wide strategies such as capital financing and tax sharing allocations. Refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” attached to this news release, for a more detailed discussion of management’s use of these measures and for reconciliations to GAAP financial measures.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, operating earnings were $94.9 million, or $1.84 per share, an improvement of $35.5 million, or $0.69 per share, over operating earnings of $59.4 million, or $1.15 per share, for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.\nResults by Business Segment\nRegulated Utility\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2017 2016 (Decrease) EBIT $ 98.4 $ 102.7 $ (4.3 ) Adjusted EBIT $ 101.4 $ 91.4 $ 10.0 For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the decrease in EBIT primarily reflects lower unrealized margins associated with our asset optimization program. In addition, the comparisons of both EBIT and adjusted EBIT reflect: (i) higher customer growth; (ii) new base rates in Virginia and the District of Columbia; and (iii) lower operation and maintenance expenses. These favorable variances were partially offset by lower realized margins associated with our asset optimization program and higher depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the implementation of our new billing system in the second quarter of the prior year, as well as growth in our utility plant.\nRetail Energy-Marketing\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2017 2016 (Decrease) EBIT $ 3.7 $ 29.2 $ (25.5 ) Adjusted EBIT $ 6.5 $ 9.9 $ (3.4 ) For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the comparison in EBIT reflects lower unrealized mark-to-market valuations on energy-related derivatives. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, the decrease in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT reflect: (i) lower realized electric margins due to lower average unit margins and lower sales volume; and (ii) higher operating expenses.\nCommercial Energy Systems\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nIncrease/ (In millions) 2017 2016 (Decrease) EBIT $ 5.6 $ 4.7 $ 0.9 Adjusted EBIT $ 7.3 $ 6.1 $ 1.2 For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the increase in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT primarily reflect higher earnings from our investment distributed generation business, including investments in tax equity partnerships, partially offset by higher operating expenses in our commercial distributed generation business.\nMidstream Energy Services\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase/ (In millions) 2017 2016 (Decrease) EBIT $ 22.2 $ (28.5 ) $ 50.7 Adjusted EBIT $ 28.5 $ 2.7 $ 25.8 For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the increase in EBIT includes higher mark-to-market valuations and the increase in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT reflect higher margins on both our transportation and storage strategies as well as higher income related to our pipeline investments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, WGL Midstream held a $38.2 million equity method investment in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution). On April 22, 2016, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation denied Constitution's application for a Section 401 Certification for the pipeline, which is necessary for the construction and operation of the pipeline. Constitution has pursued various actions to obtain approval for the pipeline, including filing a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that was denied in January 2018. While further actions may be successful in obtaining approval for construction, based on the FERC's ruling, we expect to record an impairment charge of up to $38.2 million in the second quarter. No impairment charge for this investment is included in our first quarter results.\nOther Activities\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase/ (In millions) 2017 2016 (Decrease) EBIT $ (4.2 ) $ (1.2 ) $ (3.0 ) Adjusted EBIT $ (3.5 ) $ (1.2 ) $ (2.3 ) For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the decrease in both EBIT and adjusted EBIT primarily relate to higher internal costs allocated to the planned merger with AltaGas Ltd. (AltaGas).\nOther Information\nDuring the pendency period of the proposed merger between WGL and AltaGas, WGL will not conduct earnings calls and will not give forward year guidance. Additional information regarding financial results and recent regulatory events can be found in WGL's and Washington Gas' combined Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and which will also be available at www.wglholdings.com .\nWGL, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is a leading source for clean, efficient and diverse energy solutions.

Management believes that operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT provide a meaningful representation of our earnings from ongoing operations on a consolidated and segment basis, respectively. These measures facilitate analysis by providing consistent and comparable measures to help management, investors and analysts better understand and evaluate our operating results and performance trends, and assist in analyzing period-to-period comparisons. Additionally, we use these non-GAAP measures to report to the board of directors and to evaluate management’s performance.\nTo derive our non-GAAP measures, we adjust for the accounting recognition of certain transactions (non-GAAP adjustments) based on at least one of the following criteria: • To better match the accounting recognition of transactions with their economics;\n• To better align with regulatory view/recognition;\n• To eliminate the effects of:\ni. Significant out of period adjustments; ii. Other significant items that may obscure historical earnings comparisons and are not indicative of performance trends; and iii. For adjusted EBIT, other items which may obscure segment comparisons. There are limits in using operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT to analyze our consolidated and segment results, respectively, as they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, using operating earnings (loss) and adjusted EBIT to analyze our results may have limited value as they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. We compensate for these limitations by providing investors with the attached reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The following tables present the unaudited reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings to GAAP net income (loss) applicable to common stock (consolidated by quarter):\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nFiscal Year 2018 Quarterly Period Ended (1) (In thousands, except per share data) Dec. 31 Mar. 31 Jun. 30 Sept. 30 Fiscal Year Operating earnings (loss) $ 94,923 $ 94,923 Non-GAAP adjustments (2) (14,351 ) (14,351 ) De-designated interest rate swaps (3) (354 ) (354 ) Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (4) 4,956 4,956 Re-measurement impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (5) 52,866 52,866 Net income (loss) applicable to common stock $ 138,040 $ — $ — $\n—\n$ 138,040 Diluted average common shares outstanding 51,549 51,549 Operating earnings (loss) per share $ 1.84 $ 1.84 Per share effect of non-GAAP adjustments 0.84 0.84 Diluted earnings (loss) per average common share $ 2.68 $ 2.68 Fiscal Year 2017 (6) Quarterly Period Ended (1) (In thousands, except per share data) Dec. 31 Mar. 31 Jun. 30 Sept. 30 Fiscal Year Operating earnings (loss) $ 59,362 $ 59,362 Non-GAAP adjustments (2) (2,324 ) (2,324 ) Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (4) 934 934 Net income (loss) applicable to common stock $ 57,972 $ — $ — $ — $ 57,972 Diluted average common shares outstanding 51,445 51,445 Operating earnings (loss) per share $ 1.15 $ 1.15 Per share effect of non-GAAP adjustments (0.02 ) (0.02 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per average common share $ 1.13 $ 1.13 (1) Quarterly earnings per share may not sum to year-to-date or annual earnings per share as quarterly calculations are based on weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding, which may vary for each of those periods.\n(2) Refer to the reconciliations of adjusted EBIT to EBIT below for further details on our non-GAAP adjustments. Note that non-GAAP adjustments associated with interest expense or income taxes are shown separately and are not included in the reconciliation from adjusted EBIT to EBIT.\n(3) Non-GAAP adjustment related to mark-to-market valuations on forward starting interest rate swaps associated with anticipated future financing. Due to certain covenants in our merger agreement with AltaGas, it is no longer probable that the 30-year debt issuance that the swaps were originally intended to hedge will occur. However, we believe that some form of financing will continue to be required. The hedges were de-designated in January 2017.\n(4) Non-GAAP adjustments are presented on a gross basis and the income tax effects of those adjustments are presented separately. The income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments, both current and deferred, are calculated at the individual company level based on the applicable composite tax rate for each period presented, with the exception of transactions not subject to income taxes. Additionally, the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments includes investment tax credits related to distributed generation assets.\n(5) In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, resulting in, among other effects, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This resulted in a net deferred tax benefit of $52.9 million. This adjustment only reflects the re-measurement impact and not the effect on ongoing earnings of the lower tax rate.\n(6) Prior year non-GAAP measures have been recast to include $6.8 million of pre-tax losses associated with the index price used in certain gas purchases from Antero. The index price used to invoice these purchases had been the subject of an arbitration proceeding; however, in February 2017, the arbitral tribunal ruled in favor of Antero.\nWGL Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nThe following tables summarize non-GAAP adjustments by operating segment and present reconciliations of adjusted EBIT to EBIT. EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes, less amounts attributable to non-controlling interest. Items we do not include in EBIT are interest expense, inter-company financing activity, dividends on Washington Gas preferred stock, and income taxes.

With the exception of certain transactions related to the optimization of system capacity assets as discussed in footnote (b) below, when these derivatives settle, the realized economic impact is reflected in our non-GAAP results, as we are only removing interim unrealized mark-to-market amounts.\n(b)\nAdjustments to shift the timing of storage optimization margins for the regulated utility segment from the periods recognized for GAAP purposes to the periods in which such margins are recognized for regulatory sharing purposes. In addition, lower-of-cost or market adjustments related to system and non-system storage optimization are eliminated for non-GAAP reporting because the margins will be recognized for regulatory purposes when the withdrawals are made at the unadjusted historical cost of storage inventory.\n(c)\nEliminates the estimated financial effects of warm or cold weather in the District of Columbia, as measured consistent with our regulatory tariff. Washington Gas has regulatory weather protection mechanisms in Maryland and Virginia designed to neutralize the estimated financial effects of weather. Utilization of normal weather is an industry standard, and it is our practice to evaluate our rate-regulated revenues by utilizing normal weather and to provide estimates and guidance on the basis of normal weather.\n(d)\nTo reclassify the amortization of deferred investment tax credits from income taxes to operating income for the commercial energy systems segment.
