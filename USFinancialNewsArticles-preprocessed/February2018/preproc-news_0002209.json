    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kymera Therapeutics LLC, a biotechnology company pioneering targeted-protein degradation as a transformative new approach to creating breakthrough medicines for patients, today announced the appointment of industry veteran Mark Nuttall, Ph.D., as chief business officer. Dr. Nuttall joins Kymera from Sanofi Genzyme where he led business development and licensing for Immunology and Inflammation and Neuroscience. The company also announced the appointment of Don Nicholson, Ph.D., CEO of Nimbus Therapeutics, to its Board of Directors.\n\"Mark has an impressive track record helping to shape and advance therapeutic portfolios for the world's leading biopharmaceutical companies. Mark will play an important role in exploring new partnerships and collaborations to advance Kymera's platform and develop game-changing therapies for patients,\" said Laurent Audoly, Ph.D., president and CEO of Kymera Therapeutics.\nDr. Nuttall has more than 25 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry. Prior to Sanofi Genzyme, Nuttall was previously with Johnson & Johnson Innovation leading global strategy for Neuroscience business development and was responsible for leading a team that transformed J&J's CNS portfolio into one of the strongest in the industry.\nDr. Nicholson is CEO of Nimbus Therapeutics. He previously held various strategic, leadership and operational roles at Merck working in diverse therapeutic areas including respiratory disease, inflammation, immunology, bone disease, endocrinology, urology, infectious disease and neurosciences.

This approach has the potential to provide new treatment options for patients with diseases that cannot be addressed by small molecule inhibition. The company completed a successful $30M Series A Financing round in October 2017.\nAbout Kymera Therapeutics\nKymera Therapeutics is a biotechnology company pioneering a transformative new approach to treating previously untreatable diseases.
