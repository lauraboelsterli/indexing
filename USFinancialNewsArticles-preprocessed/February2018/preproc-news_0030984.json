    "text": "February 14, 2018 \nOlympic snowboarder Shaun White apologized Wednesday for calling the sexual misconduct allegations against him “gossip.” \nLena Zawaideh, a former bandmate of White, filed a suit in 2016 alleging that White had harassed her, forced her to watch pornography, sent her pornographic images, and refused to pay her after she was fired, ESPN reports . Also included in the lawsuit were screenshots of text messages between White and Zawaideh in which he asks her to wear a provocative outfit and cut her hair a certain way. \nWhite won his third gold medal in Pyeongchang on Wednesday , adding to the two medals he had already won at previous Olympic Games. When ABC News asked White about the allegations during a press conference, he responded by saying “Honestly, I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not you know, not gossip.” \nSeveral other reporters attempted to ask follow-up questions, which the moderator shot down. White was then rushed offstage. \nLater, White apologized for his “gossip” comment and said he’s “a changed person.” \n“It was a poor choice of words to describe such a sensitive subject in the world today,” White told NBC’s Today show later in the day . “And, you know, I’m just truly sorry. And I was so overwhelmed with just wanting to talk about how amazing today was and share my experience.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
