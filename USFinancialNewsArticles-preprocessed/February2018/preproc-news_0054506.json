    "text": "FRANKLIN, Tenn., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated (NYSE: CHCT) (the \"Company\") today announced results for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of approximately $1.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted common share. Normalized funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $0.37 per diluted common share.\nHighlights include:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company acquired six real estate properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40.2 million. The Company's expected returns on these investments range from approximately 9.0% to 10.5%. Upon acquisition, the properties were 100.0% leased in the aggregate with lease expirations ranging from 2021 through 2032. In addition, we purchased $11.45 million face value of certain promissory notes, secured by accounts receivable of our bankrupt borrower, for $8.75 million from a syndicate of banks, a $2.7 million discount to face value.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend in the amount of $0.3975 per share. The dividend is payable on March 2, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 16, 2018.\nThe Company has three properties under definitive purchase agreements for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.8 million with expected returns ranging from approximately 9.0% to 9.6%. The Company anticipates these properties will close during the first quarter of 2018. However, the Company is currently performing due diligence procedures customary for these types of transactions and cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close.\nThe Company also has three properties under definitive purchase agreements, to be acquired after completion and occupancy, for an aggregate expected purchase price of approximately $40.4 million. The Company expects to close on one of these properties sometime in the first half of 2018 and expects to close on the remaining two properties sometime in the second half of 2018. The Company's expected aggregate return on these investments ranges up to approximately 11%. However, the Company cannot provide assurance as to the timing of when, or whether, these transactions will actually close.\nAbout Community Healthcare Trust Incorporated\nCommunity Healthcare Trust Incorporated is a real estate investment trust that focuses on owning income-producing real estate properties associated primarily with the delivery of outpatient healthcare services in non-urban markets throughout the United States. The Company had investments of approximately $399.1 million in 86 real estate properties, including one mortgage note, as of December 31, 2017, located in 26 states, totaling approximately 2.0 million square feet.\nAdditional information regarding the Company, including this quarter's operations, can be found at www.chct.reit .

However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers funds from operations (\"FFO\"), normalized FFO and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") to be appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"). In particular, the Company believes that normalized FFO and AFFO are useful because they allow investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company's operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events.\nThe Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (\"NAREIT\") definition of FFO. FFO and FFO per share are operating performance measures adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT's operating performance equal to \"net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\" The Company has included normalized FFO which it has defined as FFO excluding certain expenses related to closing costs of properties acquired accounted for as business combinations and mortgages funded and has included AFFO which it has defined as normalized FFO excluding straight-line rent and deferred compensation and may include other non-cash items from time to time. Normalized FFO and AFFO presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.\nFFO, normalized FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company's financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO, normalized FFO and AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere herein.\n(2)\nUpon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No, 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, on January 1, 2017, the Company expects that substantially all of its acquisitions will be accounted for as asset acquisitions. As such, transaction costs related to its acquisitions will be capitalized into the real estate property. The transaction costs of $25,000 above for the three months ended December 31, 2017 relate to costs associated with the acquisition of $8.75 million in promissory notes.\n(3)\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding for FFO are calculated based on the treasury method, rather than the 2-class method.\nCONTACT: W.
