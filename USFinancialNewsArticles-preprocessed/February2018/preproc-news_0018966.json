    "text": "CAPE TOWN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s mines minister on Wednesday declined to say whether President Joseph Kabila had formally signed a new mining code, which has been fiercely opposed by the industry as it raised royalties and taxes.\n“Journalists ask me whether the president has promulgated the code. I won’t answer that question here. The code is with the president,” Martin Kabwelulu told reporters and mining executives at a conference in Cape Town.
