    "text": "Amazon could hit $1 trillion in market cap in the next 12 to 18 months, analyst Dan Ives said Monday.\nThe GBH Insights analyst raised the price target for the e-commerce giant to $1,850 from $1,500.\n\"The Prime membership moat that [CEO Jeff] Bezos & Co. have built is gaining further steam in the field, and the Amazon 'flywheel effect' is further playing out globally among consumers,\" Ives said in a note.\n\"The Bezos strategic path, both on the consumer and enterprise fronts, [is] still in the middle innings of playing out and Amazon remains a 'green light' name to own at these levels,\" he said.\nAmazon's \"1-2 punch\" of consumer retail growth and Amazon Web Services — combined with Whole Foods tailwinds and a move into health care — could push the company past the milestone, Ives said.",
