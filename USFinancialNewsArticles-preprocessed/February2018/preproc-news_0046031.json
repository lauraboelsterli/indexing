    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ankura today announced the appointment of Daron M. Hartvigsen as Managing Director. Based in Washington, DC, he brings over 30 years of experience in information technology, including responding to and mitigating threats to intellectual property, managing information breach events, investigating nation-state intelligence entities, and cyber threat actor prosecutions. He became a trusted advisor to senior US Air Force, Department of Defense, Homeland Security, intelligence, and industry leaders on matters of incident response, intrusion investigations, threat pursuit, computer forensics, intelligence collection, risk management, and cyber threat analysis.\nPrior to joining Ankura, Daron served for 23 years as a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and most recently led AFOSI's most active Cyber Investigations and Operations team. Under his leadership, the Department of Defense twice recognized the unit's contributions when it was selected as the top counterintelligence technologies team of the year for both 2015 and 2016. Daron's AFOSI career culminated in early December 2017 when his unit's partnership with the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service resulted in the prosecution of three foreign nationals for theft of US intellectual property.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Daron served at AFOSI Headquarters, managing the cyber program and transitioning its legacy cyber portfolio from a reactive forensics capability into a leading-edge team that actively countered risk with resources deployed across three primary areas: cyber operations, insider threat, and field cyber support. As part of his responsibilities, he developed and implemented AFOSI's Insider Threat program and routinely briefed senior leaders in the intelligence community regarding significant counterintelligence matters.\nEarlier in his career, Daron served in several roles, including AFOSI liaison officer to the then-emerging Air Force Cyber Command, cybercrime investigator supporting the Air Force's Computer Emergency Response Team, and field agent conducting complex intrusion investigations.\nMarc-Philip Ferzan , Ankura Senior Managing Director, stated, \"Cyber threats have become an unfortunate part of the daily business and geopolitical landscape across the globe. Adding Daron's unique experience and expertise to the Ankura cyber team's highly expert capabilities enables us to provide our clients with comprehensive intelligence and advisory services to mitigate operational and reputational risks in targeted and effective ways.\"\nMr. Hartvigsen stated, \"I am pleased to be joining Luke Tenery , Ted Theisen and the Ankura cyber team in working with a broad range of private and public-sector clients confronting complex and multifaceted cybersecurity challenges. It is a critical time to provide companies operating in the global marketplace with comprehensive cyber intelligence and advisory services. I am looking forward to integrating my capabilities with those of my highly expert colleagues to assist business and government leaders in better understanding viable proactive and reactive cybersecurity strategies to make informed and effective decisions.\"\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/daron-m-hartvigsen-joins-ankura-consulting-as-managing-director-300602821.html\nSOURCE Ankura",
