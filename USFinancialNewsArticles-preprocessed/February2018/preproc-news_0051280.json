( bit.ly/2ohmPC6 )\n“I believe this is the largest value we have seen in the 10 years we’ve been compiling annual ‘highest-paid’ CEO studies,” said Dan Marcec, Director of Content at executive compensation data firm Equilar.\nSpiegel’s official annual salary is $98,078 as of last year.\nShares of Snap only recovered to its IPO price of $17 in the first week of February, having traded below it since July.\nThe company’s shares fell nearly 8 percent on Thursday, to again trade below the IPO price and analysts attributed the losses to users taking issue with Snap’s latest redesign.
