    "text": "SAO PAULO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Brazilian restaurant chain company International Meal Company SA said in a securities filing on Wednesday that its board declined to analyze a merger proposal by privately held company Sapore SA.\nThe board said the reasons for not issuing an opinion were the lack of previous discussions of a merger agreement and that Sapore’s proposal does not grant any premium to the company’s shareholders, according to the filing.
