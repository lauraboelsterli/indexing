    "text": "The Airbus A380 will continue to be made for at least another 10 years and could become a \"sustainable program,\" a senior executive has told CNBC.\nDidier Evrard, executive vice president head of programs at Airbus, confirmed that Emirates' decision in January to purchase 20 of the superjumbos had secured the future of the program.\n\"I think this order was extremely important to secure the life of the program for another 10 years, at least â€” and probably much more. It gives us the potential now to have a sustainable program,\" he said.\nshow chapters We are confident that we have a market for the A350-1000: Airbus 5 Hours Ago | 00:39 Emirates has 96 A380s in its fleet, more than any other airline. It also has a further 46 on order, according to its website .\nEvrard also said that the smaller A350-1000 aircraft faces no danger of direct competition from Boeing's 777 and 787 jets.\n\"We are confident that we have a market,\" Evrard said. \"We are confident that we have the right pricing today.\"\nEvrard was talking to CNBC from the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. On Tuesday, the company delivered its first A350-1000 plane to Qatar Airways .",
