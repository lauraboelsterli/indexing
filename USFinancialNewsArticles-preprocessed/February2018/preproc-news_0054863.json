Dr. Hayden was most recently the President of Global R&D and Chief Scientific Officer at Teva.\n“Michael’s scientific acumen and clinical development track record is unparalleled in this industry,” said Richard M.

He is the co-founder of three biotechnology companies: NeuroVir Therapeutics Inc., Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Aspreva Pharmaceuticals Corp.
