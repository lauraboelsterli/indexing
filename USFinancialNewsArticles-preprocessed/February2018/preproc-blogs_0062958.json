    "text": "The stock market's multi-day sell-off two weeks ago reignited Jim Cramer's battle against the risky, volatility-related exchange-traded products that were responsible for the brutal decline.\n\"I'm calling on Congress to investigate these instruments,\" the host of CNBC's \" Mad Money \" said on Monday. \"I'm calling for the SEC's enforcement arm to look into whether there's culpability and manipulation, while the corporate finance department of the SEC should re-examine the reasoning behind allowing exactly these kinds of products ... to be in the first place.\"\nThese products allow investors to effectively bet on the CBOE Volatility Index , often referred to as the VIX or the market's \"fear gauge,\" which measures expectations of near-term volatility as conveyed by the S&P 500's option prices.\nWhen volatility is low, the returns on these products — often exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or exchange-traded notes (ETNs) — are bountiful. But when the VIX spikes, owners of these products become forced to shed other positions to compensate, sending stocks reeling.\nCramer has railed against these products for years. On Monday, he weighed the consequences of getting rid of them for good.\n\"What would really be lost? OK, some fees. Maybe a few strategies that failed,\" he said. \"What will be gained? How about this. How about a restoration of the integrity of the system, a system that's been challenged, yet again, by instruments that should never have been created.\"\nCramer's game plan: A retail earnings bonanza Peter Foley | Bloomberg | Getty Images A customer looks at boots at a Macy's store in New York. We can't keep it from you any longer, Cramerica. After two weeks of Olympic festivities, Cramer is back and ready to help you navigate the surging stock market .\n\"Things have gotten a little crazy around here,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"That's why I think what we need, more than anything else at the moment, is to get right back in sync immediately.\"\nWithout further ado, Cramer presented his game plan for a busy week of earnings, including reports from Macy's, Lowe's, Foot Locker and a special hearing with the new head of the Federal Reserve.\nOne indicator to rule them all Joe Burbank | Orlando Sentinel | TNS | Getty Images A van is seen in a sinkhole from Hurricane Irma on Monday, Sept. 11, 2017 in Winter Springs, Fla. After an extended Olympics-induced break, Cramer wanted to get back to the market basics he has put forth for investors over the years.\n\"We know that earnings can be ephemeral, bonds can be fickle and the Fed can be downright enigmatic, while currencies and commodities spook easily,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"We need something that's solid as bedrock, which is why I subscribe to a product called the S&P Short Range Oscillator — I've been following it closely every single day of my life since back in 1987. It's the single best indicator of whether the market's overbought or oversold, meaning it tells you when we've gone too far too fast in one direction.\"\nRight now, the oscillator is signaling a potential buying opportunity, so Cramer advised investors on how to play any potential weakness.\nTo pounce or not to pounce: General Mills and Blue Buffalo Robert Nickelsberg | Getty Images A woman shops for Cheerios cereal at a Price Chopper supermarket in South Burlington, Vermont. Every now and then, Cramer spots a stock market story that's being held back from glory for all the wrong reasons.\nOne such story Cramer noticed on Monday was General Mills' $8 billion acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products , a high-end pet food brand.\nShares of General Mills , the consumer packaged goods giant behind such storied brands as Cheerios and Betty Crocker, fell on news of the deal, sliding down to $51 and change from $55 on Thursday.\nThe move itself didn't surprise Cramer. It's not uncommon for an acquirer's stock to decline on news of an acquisition, especially in the troubled food space.\n\"But, and this is the mother of all buts, I think the Blue Buffalo deal is a brilliant move,\" Cramer argued . \"This makes this pullback in General Mills a genuine buying opportunity. GIS already tumbled from $60 down to $55 during the big vortex of selling of these kinds of names. Now it's come down to $51 because of what I consider something that's smart. Call me a buyer at these levels.\"\nNovocure executive discusses two-pronged strategy Scott Mlyn | CNBC William Doyle, Executive Chairman, Novocure If you ask Bill Doyle, the executive chairman of the board of Novocure , the two-pronged strategy for expanding his tumor-tackling biotechnology company is \"relatively simple.\"\nIn an interview with Cramer, Doyle told CNBC that the first part of the company's growth plan will stem from three sources: international expansion, domestic expansion and its patients, as more and more shift to using Novocure's therapy as their primary treatment.\n\"The second part of the strategy, of course, is to use it in other tumors,\" Doyle told Cramer on Monday.\nNovocure's main focus to date has been treating glioblastoma, or GBM, a type of tumor that affects the brain.\n\"The next one in the pipeline is mesothelioma,\" Doyle said. \"This is the lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure, another terrible prognosis.\"\nAnd with three additional Phase 3 trials underway in Novocure's pipeline, including for pancreatic and ovarian cancers, one thing was clear to Doyle:\n\"With the existing business, there's multiple avenues for continued growth,\" the executive said.\nLightning round: Toying with the optics In Cramer's lightning round , he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:\nLumentum Holdings Inc : \"Optics are too hard for me. I'm going to have to say take a pass. We've got a lot of other good semis going, lot of other good tech. Let's just say do Cisco .\"\nPetmed Express Inc : \"Not bad. I do prefer Idexx Labs . It's got much more consistency.\"\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
