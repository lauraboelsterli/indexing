    "text": "TOKYO/GENEVA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization ruling on Thursday largely upheld a Japanese complaint against South Korea’s import bans and additional testing requirements imposed on Japanese seafood because of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.\nIn a ruling that can be appealed by either side, a WTO dispute panel said South Korea’s measures were initially justified but keeping them in place violated the WTO’s sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) agreement, and urged Seoul to take corrective action.
