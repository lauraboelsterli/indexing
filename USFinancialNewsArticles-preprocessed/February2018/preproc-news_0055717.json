Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profitability, came in at 645 million reais, below the consensus estimate of 1.14 billion reais.\nIn a statement filed with securities regulators on Thursday, BRF said it booked a 206 million reais loss related to inventory and booked a 50 million reais loss related to tax changes in Argentina.\nBRF said improved sales of seasonal products in Brazil were offset by lower prices of products exported to Japan and lower volume of sales to Europe.\nThe company posted a 1 billion reais loss last year, as it dealt with fallout from the “Weak Flesh” food safety scandal in which Brazil food inspectors allegedly accepted bribes.\nThe scandal resulted in plant closures, export restrictions and an ensuing management shakeup at BRF. In November, BRF named a new chief executive officer, José Drummond, to lead a turnaround, replacing Pedro Faria.\nStarting in the final quarter of 2016, BRF had reported three consecutive quarterly losses and only returned to profit in the third quarter of 2017.\nReporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler\n ",
