    "text": "LUXEMBOURG, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nTernium S.A. (NYSE:TX) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year period ended December 31, 2017.\nThe financial and operational information contained in this press release is based on Ternium S.A.’s operational data and consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and presented in U.S. dollars (USD) and metric tons.\nSummary of Full Year 2017 Results\nFY 2017 FY 2016 Steel Shipments (tons) 11,597,000 9,764,000 19 % Iron Ore Shipments (tons) 3,551,000 3,310,000 7 % Net Sales (USD million) 9,700.3 7,224.0 34 % Operating Income (USD million) 1,456.8 1,141.7 28 % EBITDA 1 (USD million) 1,931.1 1,548.6 25 % EBITDA Margin (% of net sales) 19.9 % 21.4 % EBITDA per Ton 2 (USD) 166.5 158.6 Income Tax Expense (USD million) (336.9 ) (411.5 ) Net Income (USD million) 1,022.9 706.9 Equity Holders' Net Income (USD million) 886.2 595.6 Earnings per ADS 3 (USD) 4.51 3.03 EBITDA of USD1.9 billion in 2017, a 25% year-over-year increase reflecting higher shipments and EBITDA per ton. Earnings per American Depositary Share (ADS) of USD4.51 in 2017, a year-over-year increase of USD1.48 per ADS. Capital expenditures of USD409.4 million in 2017, down from USD435.5 million in 2016. Net cash use of USD1.6 billion in connection with the acquisition of CSA Siderúrgica do Atlântico (CSA) and related transactions. Consolidation of Ternium Brasil (formerly known as CSA) into Ternium’s financial statements, starting in September 2017. Net debt position of USD2.7 billion at the end of December 2017, up from USD0.9 billion at the end of December 2016 and equivalent to 1.4 times net debt to EBITDA.\nOperating income in 2017 was USD1.5 billion, a USD315.1 million increase compared to operating income in 2016 due to higher steel segment operating income, with an increase in steel shipments partially offset by a decrease in steel operating margin, and higher mining segment operating income. Steel shipments were 1.8 million tons higher compared to the year 2016, reflecting a 1.4 million-ton increase in Other Markets, mainly as a result of the consolidation of Ternium Brasil’s shipments, a 235,000-ton increase in the Southern Region and a 218,000-ton increase in Mexico. Steel revenue per ton increased year-over-year in Mexico and the Southern Region, and it decreased in Other Markets, mainly due to the consolidation of Ternium Brasil slab sales. In addition, operating cost per ton 4 increased as a result of higher raw material and purchased slab costs, partially offset by the consolidation of Ternium Brasil.\nNet income in 2017 was USD1.0 billion, compared to net income of USD706.9 million in 2016. The USD316.0 million increase in the year-over-year comparison was mainly due to the above-mentioned higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate and higher results from the equity in earnings of Usiminas (not consolidated), partially offset by higher net financial expenses. The effective tax rate was affected by the non-cash effect on deferred taxes of the fluctuation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, which appreciated 5% in 2017 and depreciated 17% in 2016. Higher net financial expenses included an USD85.8 million negative year-over-year difference in net foreign exchange results mainly related to the effect of the fluctuations of the Mexican peso and the Argentine peso against the US dollar on a net short local currency position in Ternium’s Mexican subsidiaries and a net short US dollar position in Ternium’s Argentine subsidiary.\nSummary of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\n4Q 2017 3Q 2017 5 4Q 2016 Steel Shipments (tons) 3,411,000 3,070,000 11 % 2,378,000 43 % Iron Ore Shipments (tons) 875,000 938,000 -7 % 855,000 2 % Net Sales (USD million) 2,767.5 2,535.0 9 % 1,849.6 50 % Operating Income (USD million) 350.0 349.8 0 % 246.7 42 % EBITDA 6 (USD million) 502.3 466.1 8 % 350.6 43 % EBITDA Margin (% of net sales) 18.2 % 18.4 % 19.0 % EBITDA per Ton (USD) 147.3 151.8 147.4 Income Tax Expense (USD million) (138.7 ) (103.8 ) (104.8 ) Net Income (USD million) 198.0 232.7 144.8 Equity Holders' Net Income (USD million) 180.2 194.9 118.4 Earnings per ADS (USD) 0.92 0.99 0.60 EBITDA of USD502.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017, 8% higher sequentially, with higher shipments and slightly lower EBITDA per ton. EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2017 included a USD42.7 million non-recurring gain related to a retroactive price adjustment on Ternium México’s electricity sales between December 2016 and October 2017. Earnings per ADS of USD0.92 in the fourth quarter 2017, a sequential decrease of USD0.07 per ADS. Capital expenditures of USD126.5 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to USD100.4 million in the third quarter 2017. Amendment of the slab supply agreement between Ternium and thyssenkrupp’s former Calvert re-rolling facility, extending the period of delivery of the remaining 3.5 million tons of slabs under the contract to 36 months, with new maturity in December 2020.\nTernium’s operating income in the fourth quarter 2017 was USD350.0 million, similar to operating income in the third quarter 2017 as higher steel shipments were offset by a lower steel segment’s operating margin. The company’s steel shipments were 341,000 tons higher sequentially as a result of a 372,000-ton increase in Other Markets, mainly due to the full quarter consolidation of Ternium Brasil’s shipments, partially offset by a 21,000-ton decrease in the Southern Region and 11,000-ton decrease in Mexico, mainly reflecting a seasonal slowdown of steel demand. The sequential decrease in the steel segment’s operating margin was mainly due to a USD30 decline in steel revenue per ton, partially offset by an USD8 decrease in the steel segment’s operating cost per ton and a USD42.7 million non-recurring gain related to sales of electricity in Mexico. The sequential decline in steel revenue per ton was principally related to lower prices in Mexico and the full-quarter consolidation of Ternium Brasil’s slabs sales in the fourth quarter 2017, partially offset by higher prices in the Southern Region. Steel operating cost per ton decreased due to the full-quarter consolidation of Ternium Brasil in the period and lower purchased slab costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.\nCompared to the fourth quarter 2016, the company’s operating income in the fourth quarter 2017 increased USD103.3 million, with higher steel shipments partially offset by lower steel operating margin. Shipments were 1.0 million tons higher compared to the fourth quarter 2016, mainly as a result of an 876,000-ton increase in Other Markets, mostly reflecting the consolidation of Ternium Brasil’s shipments, a 90,000-ton increase in Mexico, and a 68,000-ton increase in the Southern Region. Steel operating margin in the fourth quarter 2017 decreased year-over-year principally due to a USD44 increase in steel operating cost per ton, partially offset by the afore-mentioned USD42.7 million non-recurring gain related to sales of electricity in Mexico. The increase in steel operating cost per ton was mainly due to higher raw material and purchased slab costs, partially offset by the consolidation of Ternium Brasil’s slabs sales in the fourth quarter 2017. Revenue per ton remained relatively stable as the consolidation of Ternium Brasil’s slabs sales were offset by higher realized prices in all of Ternium’s markets.\nThe company’s net income in the fourth quarter 2017 was USD198.0 million, compared to USD232.7 million in the third quarter 2017. The USD34.7 million decrease in net income was mainly due to an increase in the effective tax rate, which was affected by the non-cash effect on deferred taxes of the fluctuation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar in the fourth quarter 2017 (8% depreciation).\nRelative to the prior-year-period, net income in the fourth quarter 2017 increased USD53.3 million, mainly due to the above mentioned higher operating income, partially offset by a consequently higher income tax and an increase of net financial expenses.\nAnnual Dividend Proposal\nTernium’s board of directors proposed that an annual dividend of USD0.11 per share (USD1.10 per ADS), or approximately USD215.9 million in the aggregate, be approved at the company’s annual general shareholders’ meeting, which is scheduled to be held on May 2, 2018. If the annual dividend is approved at the shareholders’ meeting, it will be paid on May 10, 2018, with record-date of May 7, 2018.\nOutlook\nTernium expects higher operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017, mainly as a result of an increase in revenue per ton in Mexico and, to a lesser extent, in Argentina. The company anticipates shipments to remain relatively stable sequentially, as higher shipments in Mexico will be offset by lower shipments in Other Markets.\nThe outlook for the US and Mexican steel industries fundamentals in 2018 is positive. Resilient end-user demand, a reasonable level of inventories in the value chain and adequate steel capacity utilization should favor a healthy performance during the year. However, the recent US Department of Commerce recommendation for trade action against imports of steel under section 232 is introducing an element of uncertainty into the market that will linger until a final decision on the matter is made.\nIn Argentina, Ternium expects economic activity to continue improving during the year as a result of the government’s planned infrastructure projects, further development of the Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas fields and a gradual production increase in the domestic automotive industry. A concurrent recovery of the Brazilian economy, which is the primary destination for Argentina’s manufacturing exports, should also help increase the company’s shipments in the Argentine market, as well as Ternium Brasil’s slab shipments in the Brazilian market.\nAnalysis of Full Year 2017 Results\nNet income attributable to Ternium’s equity owners in 2017 was USD886.2 million, compared to a net income attributable to Ternium’s equity owners of USD595.6 million in 2016. Including non-controlling interest, net income for 2017 was USD1.0 billion, compared to net income of USD706.9 million in the 2016. Earnings per ADS in 2017 were USD4.51, compared to earnings of USD3.03 in 2016.\nNet sales in 2017 were USD9.7 billion, 34% higher than net sales in 2016. The following table outlines Ternium’s consolidated net sales for 2017 and 2016:\nNet Sales (million USD) FY 2017 FY 2016 Dif.

This was principally due to a USD1.8 billion, or 47%, increase in raw material and consumables used, mainly reflecting a 19% increase in steel shipments volume and higher purchased slab, iron ore, coking coal, scrap, zinc and energy costs; and to an USD204.6 million increase in other costs, mainly including a USD113.3 million increase in labor cost, a USD33.8 million increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment, a USD33.3 million increase in services and fees, and a USD22.8 million increase in maintenance expenses. The consolidation of Ternium Brasil in 2017 affected all of the above-mentioned components of the cost of sales, as well as the selling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 were USD824.2 million, or 8.5% of net sales, an increase of USD136.3 million compared to SG&A expenses in 2016 mainly due to higher amortization of intangible assets, labor costs, freight and transport, services and fees expenses, and taxes and contributions (other than income tax).\nOther net operating expense in 2017 was a USD16.2 million, compared to USD9.9 million in 2016. Other net operating expense in 2017 included a USD15.9 million donation related to the Roberto Rocca technical school in Pesquería, Nuevo León, Mexico.\nOperating income in 2017 was USD1.5 billion, or 15.0% of net sales, compared to operating income of USD1.1 billion, or 15.8% of net sales, in 2016.

During 2017, Ternium’s net financial interest results totaled a loss of USD95.2 million, compared with a USD75.8 million loss in 2016. Net foreign exchange results were a loss of USD65.5 million in 2017 compared to a gain of USD20.3 million in 2016. The year-over-year difference in net foreign exchange results of USD85.8 million was mainly related to the effect of the fluctuations of the Mexican peso against the US dollar on a net short local currency position in Ternium’s Mexican subsidiaries. In 2017, the Mexican peso appreciated 5% against the US dollar, compared to a 17% depreciation in 2016. Change in fair value of financial instruments included in net financial results was a USD3.1 million gain in 2017 compared to a USD19.3 million gain in 2016.\nEquity in results of non-consolidated companies was a gain of USD68.1 million in 2017, compared to a gain of USD14.6 million in 2016, mainly due to better results from Ternium’s investment in Usiminas.\nIncome tax expense in 2017 was USD336.9 million, or 25% of income before income tax, compared to an income tax expense of USD411.5 million, or 37% of income before income tax in 2016. Effective tax rate in 2017 included a non-cash gain on deferred taxes due to the 5% appreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar during the year. Effective tax rate in 2016 included a non-cash charge on deferred taxes due to the 17% depreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar during that year.\nNet gain attributable to non-controlling interest in 2017 was USD136.7 million, compared to a net gain of USD111.3 million in 2016.\nAnalysis of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet gain attributable to Ternium’s equity owners in the fourth quarter 2017 was USD180.2 million, compared to net gain attributable to Ternium’s equity owners of USD118.4 million in the fourth quarter 2016.

Effective tax rates in these periods included a non-cash charge on deferred taxes due to the 8% and 6% devaluation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016, respectively, which reduces, in U.S. dollar terms, the tax base used to calculate deferred tax at our Mexican subsidiaries (which have the U.S dollar as their functional currency).\nNet gain attributable to non-controlling interest in the fourth quarter 2017 was USD17.8 million, compared to net gain of USD26.3 million in the same period in 2016.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was USD383.9 million. Working capital increased by USD865.0 million in 2017 as a result of a USD540.2 million increase in inventories and an aggregate USD411.4 million increase in trade and other receivables, partially offset by an aggregate USD86.6 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities. The inventory value increase in 2017 was mainly due to USD258.1 million higher costs of slabs, goods in process and finished goods principally as a result of the pass-through of higher purchased slab, scrap, coal and iron ore prices; USD129.1 million higher steel volume, mainly reflecting increased operating rates in all of Ternium’s facilities; and USD152.9 million higher price and volume of raw materials and supplies. The increase in 2017 in trade and other receivables reflected mostly higher prices and shipments in Ternium’s main steel markets. In addition, during 2017, Ternium made income tax payments in excess of income tax accruals of an aggregate USD273.4 million.\nCapital expenditures in 2017 were USD409.4 million, USD26.1 million lower than in 2016. The main investments carried out during the period included those made for the improvement of environmental and safety conditions at certain facilities, the upgrade and expansion of two hot strip mills, the expansion of connectivity and equipment automation, and in Peña Colorada’s iron ore operations.\nIn 2017, Ternium had negative free cash flow of USD25.5 million 7 . The acquisition of CSA and related transactions in the third quarter 2017 resulted in a net cash use of USD1.6 billion. Net proceeds from borrowings in 2017 were USD2.0 billion. Net dividends paid to shareholders were USD196.3 million and net dividends paid by subsidiaries to non-controlling interest were USD30.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, Ternium’s net debt position was USD2.7 billion 8 .\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter 2017 was USD32.1 million. Working capital increased by USD309.7 million in the fourth quarter 2017 as a result of a USD216.2 million increase in inventories, an aggregate USD76.1 million net decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities, and an aggregate USD17.4 million net increase in trade and other receivables. The inventory value increase in the fourth quarter 2017 was mainly due to USD98.0 million higher steel volume, reflecting mainly a restocking of our operations in Mexico; USD48.7 million higher steel costs, mainly slabs, as a result of the pass-through of higher purchased-slab prices; and USD69.6 million higher price and volume of raw materials and supplies. The decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities included USD63.6 million decrease in Ternium México, mainly reflecting lower purchases of third-party slabs. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter 2017 were USD126.5 million. Consequently, Ternium had negative free cash flow of USD94.4 million 9 in the period.\nConference Call and Webcast\nTernium will host a conference call on February 21, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET in which management will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.
