    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - A group of high-ranking experts will next week discuss the possibility of introducing regulation of crypto-currencies, European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said on Friday.\nSpeaking during a visit to Berlin, Dombrovskis also said he did not see any threat to Latvia’s creditworthiness in view of a probe into whether its central bank chief accepted a bribe, allegations Ilmars Rimsevics has denied as his lawyers fight for him to keep his job.\n“It is more a question of damage to the reputation,” he said, adding that the European Union was looking at the issue.\nReporting by Tom Koerkemeier; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Paul Carrel\n ",
