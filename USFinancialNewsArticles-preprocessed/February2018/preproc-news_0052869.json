    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Germany shocked defending men’s ice hockey champions Canada 4-3 on Friday, beating the Canadian men on Olympic ice for the first time to reach their first gold medal game.\nThe Germans relied on a scrappy defence and opportunistic offence to squeeze past a Canadian team who had looked on course for a third straight Olympic final appearance.\nGermany also knocked out Sweden in the quarter-finals.\nThe win set up a gold medal game against the mighty Russians, who beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in Friday’s first semi-final.\nIt was a day of sporting ignominy for hockey-mad Canada, winners of the last two Olympic gold medals in men’s ice hockey.\nThe Canadian men’s curling team were earlier shut out of the Olympic medals for the first time.
