Our significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforce our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and show confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows.”\nFinancial Summary\nAll comparative percentages are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.\nQ2 FY 2018 Highlights\nRevenue -- Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%, with product revenue up 3% and service revenue up 3%. 33% of total revenue was from recurring offers, up 2 percentage points from the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP net income per share for the respective periods is calculated using diluted shares of 4,966 million and 4,982 million, as the Company had non-GAAP net income for these periods.\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nGROSS MARGINS, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING MARGINS, AND NET INCOME (LOSS)\n(In millions, except percentages) Three Months Ended January 27, 2018 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Y/Y Operating\nIncome Y/Y Net\nIncome\n(Loss) Y/Y GAAP amount $ 5,355 $ 2,143 $ 7,498 $ 4,425 1 % $ 3,073 6 % $ (8,778 ) (474 )% % of revenue 61.5 % 67.4 % 63.1 % 37.2 % 25.9 % (73.8 )% Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 23 31 54 333 387 387 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 144 — 144 60 204 204 Supplier component remediation charge (adjustment), net (13 ) — (13 ) — (13 ) (13 ) Acquisition/divestiture-related costs — 2 2 23 25 25 Significant asset impairments and restructurings — — — 98 98 98 Income tax effect/significant tax matters (1) — — — — — 11,223 (1 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 5,509 $ 2,176 $ 7,685 $ 3,911 2 % $ 3,774 5 % $ 3,146 10 % % of revenue 63.3 % 68.5 % 64.7 % 32.9 % 31.7 % 26.5 % (1) Includes an $11.1 billion charge as related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThree Months Ended January 28, 2017 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Operating\nIncome Net\nIncome GAAP amount $ 5,186 $ 2,090 $ 7,276 $ 4,383 $ 2,893 $ 2,348 % of revenue 61.1 % 67.7 % 62.8 % 37.8 % 25.0 % 20.3 % Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 19 34 53 299 352 352 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 107 — 107 64 171 171 Supplier component remediation charge (adjustment), net (16 ) — (16 ) — (16 ) (16 ) Acquisition/divestiture-related costs — 1 1 61 62 62 Significant asset impairments and restructurings — — — 133 133 133 Income tax effect — — — — — (191 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 5,296 $ 2,125 $ 7,421 $ 3,826 $ 3,595 $ 2,859 % of revenue 62.4 % 68.8 % 64.1 % 33.0 % 31.0 % 24.7 %\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nGROSS MARGINS, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING MARGINS, AND NET INCOME (LOSS)\n(In millions, except percentages) Six Months Ended January 27, 2018 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Y/Y Operating\nIncome Y/Y Net\nIncome\n(Loss) Y/Y GAAP amount $ 10,794 $ 4,131 $ 14,925 $ 9,096 (3 )% $ 5,829 1 % $ (6,384 ) (237 )% % of revenue 60.8 % 66.0 % 62.1 % 37.9 % 24.3 % (26.6 )% Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense 46 65 111 668 779 779 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 283 — 283 121 404 404 Supplier component remediation charge (adjustment), net (32 ) — (32 ) — (32 ) (32 ) Legal and indemnification settlements 122 — 122 — 122 122 Acquisition/divestiture-related costs — 2 2 106 108 108 Significant asset impairments and restructurings — — — 250 250 250 Income tax effect/significant tax matters (1) — — — — — 10,935 (1 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 11,213 $ 4,198 $ 15,411 $ 7,951 — % $ 7,460 — % $ 6,182 4 % % of revenue 63.1 % 67.1 % 64.2 % 33.1 % 31.1 % 25.7 % (1) Includes an $11.1 billion charge as related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSix Months Ended January 28, 2017 Product\nGross\nMargin Service\nGross\nMargin Total\nGross\nMargin Operating\nExpenses Operating\nIncome Net\nIncome GAAP amount $ 11,085 $ 4,075 $ 15,160 $ 9,390 $ 5,770 $ 4,670 % of revenue 62.3 % 66.4 % 63.3 % 39.2 % 24.1 % 19.5 % Adjustments to GAAP amounts: Share-based compensation expense. 40 67 107 614 721 721 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 219 — 219 142 361 361 Supplier component remediation charge (adjustment), net (16 ) — (16 ) — (16 ) (16 ) Acquisition/divestiture-related costs — 1 1 114 115 115 Significant asset impairments and restructurings — — — 544 544 544 Income tax effect/significant tax matters — — — — — (435 ) Non-GAAP amount $ 11,328 $ 4,143 $ 15,471 $ 7,976 $ 7,495 $ 5,960 % of revenue 63.7 % 67.5 % 64.6 % 33.3 % 31.3 % 24.9 %\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\n(In percentages) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 GAAP effective tax rate (1) 371.6 % 20.8 % 203.1 % 21.1 % Total adjustments to GAAP provision for income taxes (351.6 )% 1.2 % (182.1 )% 0.9 % Non-GAAP effective tax rate 20.0 % 22.0 % 21.0 % 22.0 % (1) Includes an $11.1 billion charge as related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP GUIDANCE FOR Q3 FY 2018 Q3 FY 2018 Gross Margin\nRate Operating Margin\nRate Tax Provision\nRate Earnings per\nShare (2) GAAP 61.5% -

These include, among other things, statements regarding future events (such as continued execution on our strategy, our ability to continue to innovate and grow our business, the continued criticality of the network to the business success of our customers, the momentum of our intent-based networking portfolio, continued progress in shifting our business toward more software and recurring revenue, and our ability to continue to execute well, deliver profitable growth and return capital to our shareholders) and the future financial performance of Cisco (including the guidance for Q3 FY 2018) that involve risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the networking industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; the growth and evolution of the Internet and levels of capital spending on Internet-based systems; variations in customer demand for products and services, including sales to the service provider market and other customer markets; the return on our investments in certain priorities, key growth areas, and in certain geographical locations, as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services; the timing of orders and manufacturing and customer lead times; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; variability of component costs; variations in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold; our ability to successfully acquire businesses and technologies and to successfully integrate and operate these acquired businesses and technologies; our ability to achieve expected benefits of our partnerships; increased competition in our product and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; manufacturing and sourcing risks; product defects and returns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; our ability to achieve the benefits of the announced restructuring and possible changes in the size and timing of the related charges; man-made problems such as cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses or terrorism; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; our ability to achieve the benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, engineering, service, marketing and manufacturing activities; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; our ability to manage financial risk, and to manage expenses during economic downturns; risks related to the global nature of our operations, including our operations in emerging markets; currency fluctuations and other international factors; changes in provision for income taxes, including changes in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our income tax returns; potential volatility in operating results; and other factors listed in Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on November 21, 2017 and September 7, 2017, respectively. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Cisco's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K as each may be amended from time to time. Cisco's results of operations for the three and six months ended January 27, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of Cisco's operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Cisco, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, Cisco will not necessarily update the information, since Cisco will only provide guidance at certain points during the year. Such information speaks only as of the date of this release.\nThis release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cisco's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Cisco's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nCisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations.\nFor its internal budgeting process, Cisco's management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, significant gains and losses on investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing and significant tax matters. Cisco's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. For additional information on the items excluded by Cisco from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Cisco\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that has been making the Internet work since 1984.
