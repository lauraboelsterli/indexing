    "text": "By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose across most maturities on Monday, with benchmark 10-year yields hitting a four-year high, benefiting from strong U.S. economic growth prospects and global central banks normalizing years of easy monetary policy. U.S. 10-year yields, which move inversely to prices, have risen in three of the last five sessions. Since a 10-month low hit in September, 10-year yields have risen nearly 90 basis points. The yields' outperformance overall though was being led by U.S. 7-year and 5-year notes. U.S. 30-year yields, meanwhile, climbed to an 11-month high, but were last down on the day. \"Yields have been rising because U.S. fundamentals are solid and also because we're seeing a global normalization of monetary policy that have driven term premiums higher,\" said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist, at Societe Generale in New York. The U.S. equity market, however, has been flustered by the rise in yields, on concerns it could trigger a surge in borrowing costs for U.S. corporations and households that could hamper economic growth. On Monday, Wall Street was trading higher and Braizinha said one reason could be that equity investors believe the current range in the U.S. 10-year note yield of between 2.80-2.90 percent would hold for now. \"I think the stock market is less stressed about this current level,\" he added. In late morning trading, U.S. 10-year yields were up at 2.849 percent, from 2.831 percent late on Friday. Earlier in the session, 10-year yields hit 2.902 percent, the highest since January 2014. U.S. 30-year bond yields fell to 3.123 percent, from Friday's 3.139 percent. The yield on this maturity touched an 11-month peak of 3.139 percent earlier in the session. Analysts also said concerns about U.S. budget deficit spending weighed on Treasury prices. President Donald Trump will unveil his second budget on Monday - seeking to make good on his promise to bolster military spending and requesting funds for infrastructure, construction of a wall along the border with Mexico and opioid treatment programs. Investors are also bracing for U.S. inflation data this week, which should shed more light on whether the recent run-up in yields is justified.
