    "text": "New quarterly net sales record of $258 million, a 12% increase year-over-year Cash flow from operating activities of $11.6 million for the quarter Returned $3.0 million to Share Owners through stock repurchases during the quarter\nJASPER, Ind., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kimball Electronics, Inc. (Nasdaq:KE), a leading global electronic manufacturing services provider of high-quality, durable electronic products, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, (Amounts in Thousands, except EPS) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Sales $ 258,151 $ 230,265 $ 511,355 $ 456,716 Operating Income $ 10,193 $ 12,241 $ 19,783 $ 25,063 Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP)* $ 10,193 $ 12,241 $ 19,783 $ 21,058 Operating Income % 3.9 % 5.3 % 3.9 % 5.5 % Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP) % 3.9 % 5.3 % 3.9 % 4.6 % Net Income (Loss) $ (8,347 ) $ 7,812 $ 133 $ 17,934 Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP)* $ 8,233 $ 7,812 $ 16,713 $ 14,510 Diluted EPS $ (0.31 ) $ 0.28 $ 0.00 $ 0.65 Adjusted Diluted EPS (non-GAAP)* $ 0.31 $ 0.28 $ 0.62 $ 0.52 * A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included below.\nDonald D. Charron, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Double-digit growth in our automotive and medical end market verticals helped us set a new quarterly sales record for the eighth consecutive quarter and kept us on a course to exceed our long-time stated goal of $1 billion in annual sales in fiscal year 2018.”\nMr. Charron continued, “We are pleased to see our margins improve sequentially from the first quarter of this fiscal year, and we continue to focus on yield and throughput improvements on recently launched new programs and further progress on the ramp-up in Romania to help us make sequential, incremental improvement and achieve our new goal of 4.5% operating income.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Overview:\nConsolidated net sales increased 12% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, which included a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency movements. This represents the eighth consecutive quarterly sales record. Income tax expense includes a $16.6 million provisional discrete charge in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) enacted in December 2017, which includes $12.8 million of tax expense for the deemed repatriation of foreign unremitted earnings and $3.8 million for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets at the new applicable tax rates. These discrete tax items are excluded in arriving at Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. See below for additional information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Return on invested capital (“ROIC”) was 9.6% for the first six months of fiscal year 2018, which compares to 10.7% for the same period of the prior year (see reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures for ROIC calculation). Operating activities provided cash flow of $11.6 million during the quarter, which compares to cash flow provided by operating activities of $12.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Cash conversion days (“CCD”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were 60 days, up slightly from 59 days in the same quarter last year. CCD is calculated as the sum of days sales outstanding plus production days supply on hand less accounts payable days. Investments in capital expenditures were $8.7 million during the quarter. $3.0 million was returned to Share Owners during the quarter in the form of common stock repurchases. Cash and cash equivalents were $35.6 million and borrowings outstanding on credit facilities were $11.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nNet Sales by Vertical Market:\nThree Months Ended December 31, (Amounts in Millions) 2017 2016 Percent\nChange Automotive $ 116.4 $ 96.3 21% Medical 72.9 63.4 15% Industrial 52.0 48.4 7% Public Safety 13.8 15.8 (13)% Other 3.1 6.4 (52)% Total Net Sales $ 258.2 $ 230.3 12% Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained within this release are considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, successful integration of acquisitions and new operations, global economic conditions, geopolitical environment, significant volume reductions from key contract customers, loss of key customers or suppliers, financial stability of key customers and suppliers, availability or cost of raw materials, and increased competitive pricing pressures reflecting excess industry capacities. Additional cautionary statements regarding other risk factors that could have an effect on the future performance of the Company are contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States in the statement of income, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, or statement of equity of the Company. The non-GAAP financial measures contained herein include adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and ROIC. These measures include adjustments in the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 for the provisional discrete tax expense related to Tax Reform of $16.6 million and in the six months ended December 31, 2016 related to proceeds from a lawsuit settlement of $4.0 million, $2.5 million net of tax, and a bargain purchase gain on the acquisition of Aircom Manufacturing, Inc. of $0.9 million. Reconciliations of the reported GAAP numbers to these non-GAAP financial measures are included in the financial highlights table below. Management believes it is useful for investors to understand how its core operations performed without the effects of the discrete tax expense related to Tax Reform, proceeds from the lawsuit settlement, and the bargain purchase gain. Excluding these amounts allows investors to meaningfully trend, analyze, and benchmark the performance of the Company’s core operations. Many of the Company’s internal performance measures that management uses to make certain operating decisions exclude these items to enable meaningful trending of core operating metrics.\nConference Call / Webcast Date: February 8, 2018 Time: 10:00 AM Eastern Time Dial-In #: 800-992-4934 (International Calls - 937-502-2251) Conference ID: 9646209 The live webcast of the conference call can be accessed at investors.kimballelectronics.com .
