    "text": "MONTEVIDEO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Uruguay needs financing of $3.077 billion this year and will help meet that amount through multi-lateral borrowing and issuance of $2.7 billion in bonds, the economy ministry said in its quarterly debt report on Thursday.\nThe country ended 2017 with a fiscal deficit of $2.0 billion, or about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.\nProceeds from the bonds due to be issued in 2018 will mostly go toward paying interest on outstanding debt and amortizations, the report said.
