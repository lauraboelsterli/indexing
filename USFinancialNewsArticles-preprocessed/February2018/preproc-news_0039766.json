    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) today announced it has acquired Doerle Food Services, a leading Louisiana broadline distributor with approximately $250 million in annual foodservice distribution sales.\nWith its headquarters in Broussard, Louisiana, Doerle Food Services was founded in 1950 by Paul Doerle, Sr., as a small, local produce distributor. Since then, the family-owned business has grown into a multi-million dollar broadline distributor, servicing parts of a six state area, including Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n“We are excited to welcome Doerle and its rich, long history to the Sysco family,” stated Tom Bené, Sysco’s president and chief executive officer. “Doerle has a sterling reputation of providing the highest quality products, cultivating deep, long-term relationships with customers and suppliers and providing impeccable service. We believe these principles align with Sysco’s vision of being our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner.”\nSysco is acquiring the foodservice distribution business of Doerle Food Services. Doerle Energy & Marine is not part of the transaction. Sysco expects to retain the executive management team of the foodservice distribution business.\n“As part of our strategic M & A plan, Sysco is focused on finding attractive growth opportunities which complement or expand the footprint of our core business,” continued Bené. “The acquisition of Doerle is a great fit for Sysco and reaffirms our commitment to creating value for our customers, associates and shareholders.”\nAbout Sysco\nSysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home.
