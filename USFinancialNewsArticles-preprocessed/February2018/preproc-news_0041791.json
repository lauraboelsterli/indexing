    "text": "February 19, 2018 / 11:38 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Singapore competition agency to look closer at Uber tie-up with ComfortDelGro Reuters Staff 1 Min Read SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s competition commission said on Monday it plans to do further in-depth assessment of the tie-up between the city-state’s top taxi operator, ComfortDelGro, and Uber [UBER.UL], after an initial review. The agency said it had requested further information from both parties to be submitted by March 5, after which it will assess whether their tie-up infringes Singapore’s competition laws. “CCS (Competition Commission of Singapore) is unable to conclusively determine that competition issues will not arise,” it said in a statement. ComfortDelGro said in a statement that “both parties remain committed to this partnership”. ComfortDelGro said in December it would buy a 51 percent stake in a unit of Uber that runs a fleet of private hire vehicles, as the companies seek to bridge the gap with dominant ride-hailing firm Grab.
