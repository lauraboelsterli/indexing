    "text": "- Earnings of $0.11 Per Fully Diluted Share -\n- Core FFO of $0.25 Per Fully Diluted Share -\n- Leased 274,988 Square Feet of Office and Retail Space -\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: ESRT) (the \"Company\"), a real estate investment trust with office and retail properties in Manhattan and the greater New York metropolitan area, today reported its operational and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\n“Our 2017 Core FFO increased 6.7% from 2016 as we continue to consolidate, redevelop and re-lease space to larger, higher credit quality tenants at higher rents and create long-term value for shareholders. During 2017, we leased almost 1.3 million square feet of office and retail space that resulted in market-leading spreads on both new Manhattan office and total portfolio leases of 41.4% and 30.8%, respectively. Tenants continue to be attracted to our well-located, amenity-rich office buildings, which have all been modernized for the 21 st century. We will continue to build upon this leasing momentum by vacating additional space in 2018 for redevelopment,” stated John B. Kessler, Empire State Realty Trust’s President and Chief Operating Officer.\n“For the year, Observatory revenue grew 1.8% and Observatory net operating income grew 2.0% driven by improved revenue mix and active expense management despite reduced attendance,” added Kessler. “We further strengthened our balance sheet with a $450 million private placement of unsecured senior notes and the refinance of our revolving credit facility, term loan and all of our 2017 mortgage maturities. These actions extended our weighted average maturity, lowered borrowing costs and brought new lender relationships. We continue to manage the business with a long-term perspective as we proactively locked in attractive fixed rate capital to fund future growth opportunities and create value for our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nAchieved net income attributable to the Company of $0.11 per fully diluted share.
