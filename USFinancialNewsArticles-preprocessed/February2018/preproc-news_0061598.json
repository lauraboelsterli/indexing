    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Trusted Counsel (Ashley), LLC, an Atlanta-based corporate and intellectual property law firm, today announced that it is expanding its team of seasoned lawyers with the addition of Thomas Wardell.\nAs a respected legal expert with more than 40 years of corporate counseling, Wardell joins the firm as Senior Counsel to provide clients with his extensive transactional experience and unparalleled expertise in public securities and corporate governance. Additionally, he will be involved in the training and mentoring of new attorneys, sharing his experience of having been both on the operating side of a law firm as well as the CEO of a $250-million computer systems company.\n\"I see the addition of Tom as a significant piece of the puzzle in the growth of services provided by Trusted Counsel,\" said Evelyn Ashley, managing partner at Trusted Counsel (Ashley), LLC. \"In early 2017, Trusted Counsel combined with Siavage Law Group, founded by Mike Siavage who has an exceptional start-up practice. Now, Tom is bringing his public securities and corporate governance practice, as well as his transactional and operating experience.

I expect to add my skills and experience, especially from the operating side, to help make that happen. Additionally, I enjoy working with and mentoring young lawyers so I look forward to sharing my 'battle scars' with the team.\"\nAbout Trusted Counsel (Ashley), LLC\nTrusted Counsel (Ashley), LLC provides seasoned, practical and confidential legal services for businesses.
