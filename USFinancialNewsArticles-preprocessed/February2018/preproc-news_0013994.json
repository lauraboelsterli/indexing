    "text": "LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Statoil ( STL.OL ) will raise its dividend, investments and exploration spending in 2018, it said on Wednesday, after beating fourth-quarter earnings forecasts helped by higher oil prices.\nLike other oil companies, Statoil is also benefiting from efficiencies it pushed through during the sector’s downturn, when firms were forced to slash jobs, projects and investment.\n“We expect long-term underlying earnings growth, and in line with our dividend policy the board proposes to increase the dividend by 4.5 percent to $0.23 per share,” Chief Executive Eldar Saetre said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday BP ( BP.L ) chose to resume share buybacks on the back of rising profits.\nStatoil said it would increase its capital expenditure this year to $11 billion from $9.4 billion last year and lift exploration spending to $1.5 billion from the $1.3 billion it had planned to spend in 2017.\nThe company now expects to generate a positive free cash flow even at oil prices below $50 per barrel, and said current price projections could help it generate as much as $12 billion in cash between 2018 and 2020.\nStatoil’s Saetre said there was scope for share buybacks but that the near-term priority is to strengthen the company’s financial position.\nStatoil’s adjusted operating profit for the October-December quarter more than doubled to $3.96 billion and beat the $3.81 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.\nIts flagship project, the development of the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea with up to 3.1 billion barrels of recoverable oil, has a break-even price below $15 per barrel for the first phase, and $20 for the whole project, it said.\nThat is down a first phase break-even price of below $20 per barrel and $25 for the whole project seen last year by Statoil and partners Lundin Petroleum ( LUPE.ST ), Aker BP ( AKERBP.OL ) and Maersk Oil, recently acquired by Total ( TOTF.PA ).\nTalking about all projects, Saetre said Statoil “would continue to pursue further reduction in project development costs”.\nStill, the company did not set an efficiency cost target like it did last year and Saetre warned the oil industry needed to avoid repeating past mistakes by keeping a lid on costs as crude prices rise.\nStatoil shares were up 2.8 percent at 0939 GMT, making them the third-best performers on a European Oil and Gas Index .SXEP up 1.2 percent.\nRelated Coverage Statoil CEO sees 2018 oil price below $70 per barrel Statoil to keep quarterly dividend at $0.23 per share for first three quarters of 2018: CFO Editing by Jason Neely\n ",
