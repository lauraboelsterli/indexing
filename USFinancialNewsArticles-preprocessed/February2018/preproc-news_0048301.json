    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLS), a leading diversified global manufacturer of highly engineered equipment for the industrial gas, energy and biomedical industries, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Highlights include:\nFull year 2017 revenue of $988.8 million, an increase of 15% from the prior year, and 5% organic growth Full year reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.89 and adjusted EPS of $0.96 reflecting improved cost structure and impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Full year order activity increased 18% (14% excluding Hudson) over 2016, with sequential order growth in the fourth quarter of 10%, and an increase in backlog to $461.3 million, up 35% from the prior year (15% excluding Hudson) Completed Skaff Cryogenics acquisition in January 2018, which strategically builds our Distribution & Storage repair and refurbishment platform 2018 guidance of 5-7% organic revenue growth and EPS range of $1.65 to $1.90 inclusive of the beneficial impacts of our recently completed restructuring actions and of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $26.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings would have been $0.46 per diluted share excluding $4.3 million of restructuring and acquisition-related costs, $4.9 million related to debt extinguishment, $3.5 million related to China litigation expense, and $22.5 million of benefit in the quarter from the impact of U.S. tax reform. This compares with a net loss of $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, or ($0.11) per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted earnings were breakeven, excluding $4.7 million, or $0.11 of restructuring related costs.\nNet income for the year 2017 was $28.0 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to full year 2016 net income of $28.2 million, or $0.91 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2017 earnings per share was $0.96, which excludes $0.57 from restructuring and acquisition-related costs, $0.11 related to China litigation expense, $0.10 of costs related to the refinancing of our debt, and $0.71 of favorability from the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThe U.S. tax reform benefit was primarily driven by a one-time revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to the reduced 21% federal tax rate in the United States, primarily from Hudson Products, and partially offset by $4.5 million of transition tax charges for the repatriation of foreign earnings. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures, as well as additional information on the impact of tax reform and 2016 adjusted EPS is included as an exhibit herein.\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $306.0 million, a 43% increase compared to the fourth quarter 2016, and 27% sequentially compared to the third quarter 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 was the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential organic growth for our Energy & Chemicals (“E&C”) segment, and the third consecutive quarter for our D&S segment. Strong order activity within all segments drove our organic sales increase sequentially and for the full year.\nThe Hudson acquisition, which closed on September 20, 2017, contributed $58.0 million in sales, $15.4 million of gross profit, and $6.4 million of operating income to Chart for our period of ownership in 2017. On a full year basis, which included the financial results prior to our completion of the acquisition, Hudson performed as expected, with revenues of $199.2 million.\nChart order activity in 2017 increased 18% over 2016, or 14% excluding Hudson. Each of the three segments had order growth over 2016, with E&C 2017 orders totaling $243.6 million, or $212.3 million excluding orders from Hudson. This compares to E&C’s 2016 orders of $110.2 million. Increases in United States shale and associated gas drove natural gas processing plant activity throughout 2017, resulting in the best order year for E&C’s Air Cooled Heat Exchanger product line since 2014.\nAdditionally, Chart’s order trends continued to increase sequentially each quarter of 2017, including 10% growth (1% organic) in the fourth quarter over the third quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter orders in the Distribution & Storage (“D&S”) segment were $153.2 million, 14% higher than the third quarter of 2017, and the highest order quarter since the second quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter order strength in D&S was driven primarily by mobile equipment, industrial gas rail cars, and demand for beverage applications and packaged gas.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $82.9 million, or 27.1% of sales and included $13.2 million from Hudson. Gross profit for the full year of 2017 was $272.1 million, or 27.5% of sales, inclusive of $5.2 million of restructuring costs. This compares to a full year gross margin as a percent of sales in 2016 of 31.0%, which included an unfavorable impact of $3.4 million from restructuring and other charges, and included favorable impacts of $15.2 million from the AirSep insurance settlement, and $38.7 million from several short-lead time projects and contract expiration fees in our E&C segment. With the restructuring actions complete as of December 31, 2017, gross margin as a percent of sales is expected to increase in 2018, with each of the three segments’ gross margins as a percent of sales expected to expand over 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $55.8 million, inclusive of $1.1 million of acquisition-related costs, $3.2 million of restructuring costs, $3.4 million of China litigation expense, and $5.1 million of SG&A for Hudson. The charges related to the Chinese litigation were the result of a Chinese court ruling over disputed commissions to a former external sales representative.\nSG&A for the full year 2017 was $215.1 million, inclusive of $10.1 million of acquisition-related costs, $10.4 million of restructuring expenses, $3.4 million of China litigation expense, and $5.7 million of Hudson SG&A. SG&A for the full year of 2016 was $195.9 million, inclusive of $6.9 million of restructuring and acquisition-related costs. With the completion of these recent restructuring activities, we expect full year 2018 SG&A dollars to decline as compared to 2017 on incremental volume.\n“We are pleased with the 2017 results in the business, in particular the completion of previously announced restructuring activities that we expect to generate $15 million of savings in 2018, the completion of three strategic acquisitions, a successful refinance of our debt, and the order strength across all three segments both on a full year and fourth quarter basis,” stated Bill Johnson, Chart’s Chief Executive Officer and President. “In addition, the acquisition of Skaff Cryogenics, which closed on January 2, 2018, continues to build upon our strong D&S installed base to build out a full solution for our industrial gas customers. This acquisition contributes to our global footprint of repair capabilities, which was enhanced in August of 2017 by the acquisition of VCT Vogel in Germany.”\nSEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nOrder activity for E&C in 2017 increased over 2016 by 121% in total, and 93% excluding Hudson. The main drivers of the increase in order activity in the E&C segment were the growth in LifeCycle and natural gas and petrochemical market strength. There were no significant orders for LNG liquefaction plants in 2017, although in the fourth quarter of 2017, Tellurian announced an agreement with Bechtel and Chart to proceed with utilizing Chart’s IPSMR® process technology and equipment on the Driftwood project. In the fourth quarter, E&C sales were $99.2 million, or $47.3 million excluding Hudson. The sequential increase from the third quarter of 2017 in E&C revenue was 17% (excluding Hudson), making the fourth quarter the highest sales quarter since the second quarter of 2016 which included several short lead-time projects and contract expiration fees. E&C gross margin as a percent of sales continues to improve sequentially, with the fourth quarter 2017 at 22.9%, bringing the full year E&C gross margin as a percent of sales to 20.0%.\nD&S sales increased $43.2 million to $540.3 million for the full year 2017 compared to 2016. Sequentially compared to the third quarter 2017, sales increased $10.9 million to $150.2 million in the fourth quarter 2017, making it the highest sales quarter for D&S since the fourth quarter of 2014. Strength in demand for mobile units for water, industrial gas, nitrogen and oxygen, combined with packaged gas increases in the Americas contributed to this quarter’s sales levels. D&S China sales were $95 million for the year, compared to $83 million in 2016, reflecting modest recovery in the region, albeit below peak levels of $152.9 million in 2014. D&S gross margin as a percent of sales for the full year 2017 was 27.1%, compared to 26.2% in 2016, inclusive of $0.5 million and $2.3 million of restructuring charges, respectively.\nFourth quarter 2017 BioMedical sales of $56.6 million increased 3.5% from the third quarter 2017 sales of $54.7 million, driven primarily by the strength in Cryobiological stainless steel tanks, and on-site gas generation growth. Full year 2017 BioMedical sales grew 7.3% over 2016, with all product categories (Respiratory, Cryobiological and On-site gas generation) growing 5% or more year over year. BioMedical gross margin as a percent of sales for 2017 was 36.2%, inclusive of $2.6 million of restructuring charges primarily related to the Buffalo, NY respiratory facility consolidation. Full year 2016 gross margin as a percent of sales was 43.9%, inclusive of $15.2 million of favorability from the AirSep insurance settlement, offset partially by $1.4 million of restructuring charges. SG&A for the full year 2017 for BioMedical was $42.1 million, inclusive of $2.5 million of restructuring charges. This compares to $45.7 million of SG&A in 2016, including $0.6 million of restructuring costs. The reduction in year-over-year normalized SG&A was driven by the facility consolidation completed in the first quarter of 2017 and the reduction in force completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nOUTLOOK\nThe following guidance includes the acquisition of Skaff Cryogenics, which was completed on January 2, 2018, as well as the anticipated impact from tax reform and the execution of our tax planning strategy. Additionally, guidance includes the anticipated impact from the revenue recognition accounting standard change, effective January 1, 2018. Sales guidance is expected to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion for the full year of 2018. We expect full year adjusted earnings per diluted share (non-GAAP) to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.90 per share, on approximately 31.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This excludes any restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs, and as such is a non-GAAP measure. This includes approximately $0.15 of anticipated benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, moving our normalized effective tax rate from approximately 34% to 27%-29%. We expect our capital expenditures for 2018 will be in the range of $35 million to $45 million, inclusive of all recently completed acquisitions’ capital requirements.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements made in this news release are the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
