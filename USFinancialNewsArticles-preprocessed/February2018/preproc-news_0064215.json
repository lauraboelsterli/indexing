    "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Iran's \"destabilizing activities\" and other security and economic issues in separate telephone calls with senior Saudi and Emirati leaders on Tuesday, the White House said. \nIn calls with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates , Trump thanked them for highlighting ways that Gulf Arab states \"can better counter Iranian destabilizing activities and defeat terrorists and extremists,\" the White House said. \nSaudi Arabia and the UAE, along with Bahrain and Egypt , cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-rival Iran. The United States is trying to resolve the dispute. \nQatar denies the charges and says the four Arab countries aim to curtail its sovereignty. \nThe two crown princes, as well as Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, are planning to visit Trump for bilateral meetings in March and April, a senior U.S. official said on Friday.\nThe agenda for the meetings will include setting up a summit of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, the official said, which Washington hopes will be held later this year, as well as Middle East peace and Iran. \nTrump also discussed enhancing bilateral partnerships on security and economic issues with the Saudi and Abu Dhabi crown princes, the White House said.",
