    "text": "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced today that for the quarter ended January 27, 2018 the Company expects revenue of approximately $655.0 million, below the midpoint of its previous guidance. Additionally, the Company expects Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share ranging from $0.09 - $0.12 for the quarter ended January 27, 2018, which is below previous guidance. On a GAAP basis, the Company expects Diluted Earnings per Common Share ranging from $1.20 - $1.23, including tax benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") and tax benefits from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures\" included below.\nWidespread adverse weather reduced the number of available workdays and negatively impacted productivity and margins during the quarter ended January 27, 2018. Margins were also impacted by costs incurred in conjunction with the initiation of large customer programs.\nThe Company plans to report full financial results for the second quarter period ended January 27, 2018 on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, before the open of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nOutlook\nAs previously announced, the Company changed its fiscal year end from the last Saturday in July to the last Saturday in January. As a result, fiscal 2019 commenced on January 28, 2018.\nThe Company is providing financial guidance for the 2019 fiscal year ending January 26, 2019, as well as updating its outlook for the quarter ending April 28, 2018 (first quarter of fiscal 2019). This guidance reflects the anticipated timing of activity on large customer programs and the related impacts on margins as well as consideration of near-term weather conditions. The Company currently expects the following:\nFiscal 2019\nQuarter Ending\nApril 28, 2018\n(Q1-19)\nContract revenues\n$3.30 - $3.50 billion\n$720 - $750 million\nDiluted Earnings per Common Share - GAAP (1)\n$4.78 - $5.70\n$0.52 - $0.67\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share (1)\n$5.22 - $6.14\n$0.63 - $0.78\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA % of revenue\n13.6% - 14.1%\n10.7% - 11.1%\n(1) Earnings per Common Share calculations based on effective tax rate of 27.3%. See Tax Reform below for further information.\nSee reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures included below.\nTax Reform\nThe Company estimates that Tax Reform will result in a benefit to the Company's income taxes of approximately $31.0 million, or $0.98 per diluted common share, in the quarter ended January 27, 2018 (second quarter of fiscal 2018). It will not impact Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share. This benefit primarily resulted from the re-measurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities at a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and represents a preliminary assessment of the effect of Tax Reform. The impact of Tax Reform may change from this preliminary estimate as the Company completes its assessment for purposes of finalizing its year-end provision for income taxes.\nBased on a preliminary analysis of the impact of Tax Reform, the Company currently expects that the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be within a range of 27.0% to 27.5%.\nOther Information\nAs of January 27, 2018, the Company reported cash and equivalents of approximately $84.0 million, no outstanding borrowings on its revolving line of credit and $358.1 million of term loans outstanding.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In quarterly results releases, trend schedules, conference calls, slide presentations, and webcasts, the Company may use or discuss Non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures directly following the press release tables.\nAbout Dycom Industries, Inc.\nDycom is a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the United States and in Canada.

This benefit primarily resulted from the re-measurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities at a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and represents a preliminary assessment of the effect of Tax Reform. The impact of Tax Reform may change from this preliminary estimate as the Company completes its assessment for purposes of finalizing its year-end provision for income taxes.\n(c) The Company expects to recognize an income tax benefit of approximately $7.0 million for the tax effects of certain share-based award activities in accordance with ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2016-09\"). See Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information related to income tax benefits as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\n(d) Diluted shares used in computing expected GAAP Diluted Earnings per Common Share includes approximately 0.4 million common shares from the dilutive effect of the Notes based on the average share price during the quarter ended January 27, 2018. The Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of the Notes up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43 per share. Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares excludes the GAAP dilutive effect of the Notes based on the expected effect of the note hedge. See the Company's Form 8-K previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2015 for further information regarding the Notes and note hedge.\nDYCOM INDUSTRIES, INC.

The Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of the Notes up to an average quarterly price of $130.43 per share.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In the Company's quarterly results releases, trend schedules, conference calls, slide presentations, and webcasts, it may use or discuss Non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that the presentation of certain Non-GAAP financial measures in these materials provides information that is useful to investors because it allows for a more direct comparison of the Company's performance for the period reported with the performance in prior periods. The Company cautions that Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results. Management defines the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this release as follows:\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA - net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of fixed assets, stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-recurring items. Management believes Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is a helpful measure for comparing the Company's operating performance with prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies with different capital structures or tax rates.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income - GAAP net income before non-cash amortization of the debt discount and the related tax impact, certain tax impacts resulting from vesting and exercise of share-based awards, certain tax impacts of Tax Reform, and certain non-recurring items.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share and Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares - Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income divided by Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding. The Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of its Notes up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43. The measure of Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares used in computing Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share excludes dilution from the Notes. Management believes that the calculation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares to reflect the note hedge is useful to investors because it provides insight into the offsetting economic effect of the hedge against potential conversion of the Notes.\nManagement excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share:\nNon-cash amortization of the debt discount - The Company's Notes were allocated between debt and equity components. The difference between the principal amount and the carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes represents a debt discount. The debt discount is being amortized over the term of the Notes but does not result in periodic cash interest payments. The Company has excluded the non-cash amortization of the debt discount from its Non-GAAP financial measures because it believes it is useful to analyze the component of interest expense for the Notes that will be paid in cash and provides management with a consistent measure for assessing financial results.\nTax impact from Tax Reform - During the quarter ended January 27, 2018, the Company expects to recognize an income tax benefit of approximately $31.0 million resulting from Tax Reform, primarily due to a reduction of net deferred tax liabilities. The Company has excluded this impact because it is a significant change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and because the Company believes it is not indicative of the Company's underlying results or ongoing operations. The impact of Tax Reform may change from this preliminary estimate as the Company completes its assessment for purposes of finalizing its year-end provision for income taxes.\nTax impact of excess tax benefits as a result of ASU 2016-09 - ASU 2016-09 became effective for the Company during the first quarter period ended October 28, 2017 and changed the treatment of excess tax benefits (or shortfalls) arising from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards. Prior to ASU 2016-09, these amounts were recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these amounts are now captured in the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company excluded the impact of approximately $7.0 million of excess tax benefits during the quarter ended January 27, 2018 from its provision for income taxes in its Non-GAAP measures as this amount may vary significantly from period to period and excluding this amount from the Company's Non-GAAP financial measures provides management with a more consistent measure for assessing financial results.\nTax impact of adjusted results - The tax impact of the adjusted results reflects the Company's effective tax rate used for financial planning during the applicable period.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dycom-industries-inc-lowers-expectations-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2018-results-and-the-first-quarter-of-fiscal-2019-and-provides-guidance-for-fiscal-2019-300597000.html\nSOURCE Dycom Industries, Inc.",
