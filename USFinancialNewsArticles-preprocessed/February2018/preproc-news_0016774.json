    "text": "CLAYTON, Mo., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Olin Corporation (NYSE: OLN) announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe fourth quarter 2017 reported net income was $489.3 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, which included a tax benefit of $437.9 million from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act). The fourth quarter 2016 reported net income was $17.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. The full year 2017 reported net income was $549.5 million, or $3.26 per diluted share, which included a tax benefit of $437.9 million from the 2017 Tax Act. The full year 2016 reported net loss was $3.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share.\nFourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $277.9 million reflects depreciation and amortization expense of $147.5 million, restructuring charges of $11.7 million, acquisition-related integration and other costs of $2.7 million, and a gain on the sale of a former manufacturing facility of $3.3 million. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $12.0 million associated with Hurricane Harvey. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $221.7 million. Sales in the fourth quarter 2017 were $1,619.9 million compared to $1,385.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nFull year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $944.1 million reflects depreciation and amortization expense of $558.9 million, restructuring charges of $37.6 million, acquisition-related integration and other costs of $18.1 million, and a gain on the sale of a former manufacturing facility of $3.3 million. Full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $54.7 million associated with Hurricane Harvey. Full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $838.5 million. Sales in 2017 were $6,268.4 million compared to $5,550.6 million in 2016.\nJohn E. Fischer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Our fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $278 million was the highest level of quarterly EBITDA since the acquisition of Dow's Chlorine Products business. This was achieved in spite of the lingering effects of Hurricane Harvey and continued weakness in Winchester resulting from reduced commercial ammunition demand.\n\"In 2017, we generated $944 million of adjusted EBITDA, while absorbing approximately $55 million of Hurricane Harvey related costs, unplanned maintenance turnaround costs of approximately $50 million and the weakest year in Winchester since 2012. Our caustic soda pricing benefited from improved market dynamics and increased approximately 32% year over year. Chlorine, chlorine-derivatives and ethylene dichloride pricing in 2017 improved by approximately 6% from 2016 levels. Our Epoxy business experienced increases in raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene, which were partially offset by improved pricing and increased volumes. Winchester 2017 segment earnings declined by $48.5 million from 2016 levels due to lower commercial ammunition demand and a less favorable sales product mix. Commercial ammunition sales in 2017 declined approximately 17% compared to 2016.\n\"We enter 2018 optimistic and encouraged by the supply and demand dynamics in both the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy businesses. Both segments experienced improved pricing in 2017, which we expect to benefit 2018 results and pricing momentum remains positive. In 2018, we expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.25 billion with upside opportunities and downside risks of approximately 5%. We expect our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment results to improve significantly in 2018 compared with 2017 reflecting higher caustic soda, chlorine, and chlorine-derivatives pricing. The Epoxy business is expected to produce a sizable year-over-year increase in segment earnings as the outlook for epoxy resin demand strengthens and pricing continues to improve. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by lower ethylene dichloride pricing and higher ethane, benzene and propylene costs. We anticipate Winchester segment results will improve in 2018 from 2017 reflecting higher levels of the commercial and military demand offset by increased commodity and other material costs.\n\"Due to a heavy maintenance turnaround schedule, we expect the first quarter of 2018 to be the lowest adjusted EBITDA quarter of the year. First quarter 2018 planned maintenance turnaround expenses are forecast to be approximately $90 million, which are approximately $45 million higher than first quarter 2017. Epoxy first and second quarter 2018 segment results will reflect an approximately two-month planned maintenance turnaround at its production facility in Freeport, Texas. This maintenance turnaround was last performed six years ago. Based on our 2018 planned maintenance turnaround schedule, we expect full year 2018 planned maintenance turnaround expense to be approximately $30 million lower than 2017 levels.\"\nThe full year 2018 forecast reflects the following:\nHigher domestic and export caustic soda pricing compared to 2017; Higher chlorine and chlorine-derivatives pricing compared to 2017; Lower ethylene dichloride pricing compared to 2017; Incremental cost synergy realizations of approximately $75 million to $100 million; Lower planned maintenance turnaround costs of approximately $30 million; Lower ethylene costs associated with the acquisition of additional cost-based ethylene from DowDupont in late September 2017, partially offset by anticipated higher ethane costs; Higher Epoxy volumes and pricing, which are expected to more than offset higher raw material costs and maintenance turnaround expense; Higher corporate and other costs of approximately $30 million, reflecting lower pension income and higher legacy environmental costs compared to 2017; Pre-tax acquisition related integration, including the information technology project, and restructuring costs of approximately $70 million; Capital spending in the $375 million to $425 million range, including the investment associated with the information technology project of approximately $100 million; Depreciation and amortization costs comparable with 2017; and Effective income tax rate of approximately 25%, with a cash tax rate of 10% to 15%.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nOlin defines segment earnings as income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense) and income taxes and includes the earnings of non-consolidated affiliates in segment results consistent with management's monitoring of the operating segments.\nCHLOR ALKALI PRODUCTS AND VINYLS\nChlor Alkali Products and Vinyls sales for the fourth quarter 2017 were $917.6 million compared to $782.6 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in the fourth quarter sales compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased caustic soda, chlorine and most chlorine-derivatives prices, partially offset by lower ethylene dichloride pricing. Fourth quarter 2017 segment earnings of $135.8 million improved compared to $72.4 million in the fourth quarter 2016, primarily due to higher pricing for caustic soda, chlorine and most chlorine-derivatives, and lower ethylene costs. These items were partially offset by lower ethylene dichloride pricing, $12.2 million of additional maintenance turnaround costs, and $3.0 million of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls fourth quarter 2017 results included depreciation and amortization expense of $114.2 million compared to $106.5 million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nEPOXY\nEpoxy sales for the fourth quarter 2017 were $536.9 million compared to $441.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in Epoxy sales was primarily due to higher product prices, partially offset by lower volumes associated with Hurricane Harvey. The fourth quarter 2017 segment loss was $0.8 million compared to a segment loss of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The Epoxy improvement in segment earnings was principally due to higher product prices, which were partially offset by higher raw material costs, primarily benzene and propylene. The fourth quarter 2017 Epoxy segment earnings reflected $15.9 million of additional maintenance costs, unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs, and reduced profit from lost sales associated with the turnarounds and outages, which were primarily related to a 35-day planned maintenance turnaround at our production facility in Stade, Germany. In addition, the fourth quarter included $9.0 million of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs and reduced profit from lost sales associated with Hurricane Harvey. Epoxy fourth quarter 2017 results included depreciation and amortization expense of $24.7 million compared to $22.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nWINCHESTER\nWinchester sales for the fourth quarter 2017 were $165.4 million compared to $161.4 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher military sales, partially offset by lower sales to commercial customers reflecting lower demand for pistol, rifle, and shotshell ammunition. Fourth quarter 2017 segment earnings were $11.1 million compared to $25.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The decrease in segment earnings was primarily due to a less favorable product mix, lower selling prices and higher commodity and other material costs. Winchester fourth quarter 2017 results included depreciation and amortization expense of $5.3 million compared to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nCORPORATE AND OTHER COSTS\nPension income included in the fourth quarter 2017 Corporate and Other segment was $10.6 million compared to $13.4 million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were $2.3 million compared to $3.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016. These charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations of the legacy Olin businesses.\nOther corporate and unallocated costs in the fourth quarter 2017 increased by $8.0 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016, primarily due to higher legal and litigation costs and costs associated with the implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing, and engineering systems, and related infrastructure costs.\nINCOME TAXES\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, modifies policies, credits, and deductions and has international tax consequences. The rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018. As a result, Olin was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. During the fourth quarter 2017, Olin recorded an income tax benefit of $437.9 million related to the 2017 Tax Act. The fourth quarter 2017 income tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments in 2018 due to anticipated additional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in Olin's assumptions, completion of 2017 tax returns, and further information and interpretations that become available.\nDEBT REFINANCING\nOn January 16, 2018, Olin issued $550 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due February 1, 2030. The proceeds of the 2030 Notes and cash on hand were used to prepay $550 million of the Term Loan A outstanding under our senior credit facility. This refinancing reduces and de-risks the debt tower maturing in 2022 and extends maturities to 2030, while taking advantage of attractive financing markets for unsecured debt. The cash balance at December 31, 2017 was $218.4 million.\nDIVIDEND\nOn January 26, 2018, Olin's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 on each share of Olin common stock. The dividend is payable on March 9, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 9, 2018. This will be the 365 th consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by the Company.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nOlin management will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 earnings at 10:00 A.M.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as a supplemental financial measure to assess the financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structures, taxes or historical cost basis. The use of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to replace any measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are omitted from this release because Olin is unable to provide such reconciliations without the use of unreasonable efforts. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in forecasting generally and quantifying certain projected amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliations, including interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), other expense (income), restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs. Because of our inability to calculate such adjustments, forward-looking net income guidance is also omitted from this release. We expect these adjustments to have a potentially significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nThree Months\nYears Ended\nEnded December 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet Income (Loss)\n$ 489.3\n$ 17.5\n$ 549.5\n$ (3.9)\nAdd Back:\nInterest Expense\n59.4\n48.3\n217.4\n191.9\nInterest Income\n(0.8)\n(2.1)\n(1.8)\n(3.4)\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Provision (b)\n(428.6)\n6.0\n(432.3)\n(30.3)\nDepreciation and Amortization\n147.5\n136.1\n558.9\n533.5\nEBITDA\n266.8\n205.8\n891.7\n687.8\nAdd Back:\nRestructuring Charges (c)\n11.7\n6.7\n37.6\n112.9\nAcquisition-related Costs (d)\n0.3\n9.2\n12.8\n48.8\nInformation Technology Integration Project (e)\n2.4\n-\n5.3\n-\nCertain Non-recurring Items (f)\n(3.3)\n-\n(3.3)\n(11.0)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 277.9\n$ 221.7\n$ 944.1\n$ 838.5\n(a)\nUnaudited.\n(b)\nIncome tax (benefit) provision for both the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the tax benefit of $437.9 million from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.\n(c)\nRestructuring charges for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were primarily associated with the closure of 433,000 tons of chlor alkali capacity across three separate Olin locations.
