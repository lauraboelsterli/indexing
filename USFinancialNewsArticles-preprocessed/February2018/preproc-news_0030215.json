    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder rights law firm Johnson Fistel, LLP has launched an investigation into whether the board members of Layne Christensen Company (NASDAQ: LAYN) (\"Layne Christensen\") breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the proposed sale of the Company to Granite Construction Incorporated (NYSE: GVA) (\"Granite Construction\").\nOn February 14, 2018, Layne Christensen announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with Granite Construction. Under the terms of the agreement, Layne Christensen shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.270 Granite Construction shares for each share of Layne Christensen common stock they own. This represents $17.00 per Layne Christensen share, based on the volume-weighted average prices for Granite Construction and Layne Christensen shares over the past 90 trading days. However, shareholders will be subject to the future price fluctuation of Granite Construction's stock price.\nThe investigation concerns whether the Layne Christensen board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for Layne Christensen shares of common stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of Layne Christensen and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
