    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Iran urged Turkey on Monday to stop its military offensive in Syria, saying the operation in the northern Afrin region breached Syrian sovereignty and would increase tension in the war-damaged country.\nTurkey last month launched an air and ground campaign, dubbed Operation Olive Branch, against the Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin.\n“Turkey should stop its operation and respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was Quote: d as saying by state news agency IRNA.\n“Turkey’s actions can bring back insecurity, instability and terrorism to Syria,” he added.\nQasemi said any solution to the Syrian crisis should be discussed in talks in the Kazakh capital Astana that are sponsored by Russia, Iran, and Turkey.\nHe said Iran was in continuous talks with both Turkey and Russia about the latest developments in Syria.\nRussia and Iran back Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey supports Assad’s opponents.\nAnkara considers the U.S.-backed YPG, which controls Afrin, to be a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has fought an insurgency in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast since 1984.\nThe Syrian government last week called the Turkish offensive in Afrin an illegal “aggression” and said it would deal with it accordingly.\nReporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Editing by William Maclean\n ",
