The team, spearheaded by Senior Vice President of Exhibitor Relations Bernadette McCabe, adds Joe Whyte as Director of Exhibitor Relations, Dean Moore as Exhibitor Relations Financial Analyst, and Kevin Brown as Exhibitor Relations Associate.\nJoe Whyte, Dean Moore, and Kevin Brown Join MoviePass to Boost Exhibitor Partnership Activity\nWhyte, an experienced film industry veteran, joins MoviePass from Twentieth Century Fox, where he previously served as Director of Sales. Prior to Twentieth Century Fox, Whyte served as a Sales Representative at The Walt Disney Studios, and also held positions at Focus Features and FilmDistrict. In his newly appointed role as Director of Exhibitor Relations for MoviePass, Whyte will oversee relationships throughout the country, working with a variety of movie theater exhibitors to drive strategic initiatives and encourage collaboration with MoviePass.\n“Joe comes to us having spent his entire career on the studio side, where he developed great relationships with exhibitors all over the country,” said McCabe. “Those relationships and his experience are incredibly valuable additions to MoviePass as we work to grow our influence and engagement within the exhibition community and entertainment industry as a whole. Together with Dean and Kevin, this expansion of MoviePass’ Exhibitor Relations team will be key in helping us find new ways to transform and redefine the movie theater experience.”\nMoore, formerly a Financial Analyst at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, will aid the Exhibitor Relations team in forecasting exhibitor payments, analyzing payment trends, and creating reporting materials.
