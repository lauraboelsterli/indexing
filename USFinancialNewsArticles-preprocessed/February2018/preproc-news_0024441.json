    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces killed 10 militants in an exchange of fire and arrested 400 suspects, including foreigners, in a continuing crackdown in Sinai, the army said in a statement carried by state TV on Tuesday.\nBased on army statements, around 38 militants have been killed since the latest offensive to crush insurgents blamed for a string of attacks began.\nEgypt launched a major security operation on Friday involving the army and police against “terrorist and criminal elements and organisations” across the country, according to the army spokesman.\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is seeking re-election in March, ordered the armed forces in November to defeat militants within three months after an attack on a mosque killed more than 300 people, the deadliest such violence in the Arab world’s most populous country.\nThe insurgency poses the greatest challenge to the government in a country that is both the most populous in the Arab World and a main regional ally of the United States.\nSisi was elected for his first term in 2014 after the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following mass protests against his rule.\nReporting and Writing by Nayera Abdallah; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
