    "text": " 48 p.m. ET Share \nConglomerate’s CFO says the company doesn’t intend to sell its majority stake in the oil services firm Getty Images \nBy Thomas Gryta \nGeneral Electric Co. has no intention of selling down its majority stake in oil services firm Baker Hughes before 2019, the company’s finance chief said Wednesday, in a shift from its previous exploration of exiting the business. \nGE GE, -1.53% combined its struggling oil and gas business with Baker Hughes BHGE, +5.14% last year to form a new public company. As part of a major restructuring of the industrial giant, new Chief Executive John Flannery said in November that he would explore selling the stake before restrictions lift in 2019. \n“Given today’s valuation levels, we see a lot of upside there,” said Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller at a Barclays conference Wednesday. “At this point in time, we have no intent to change anything or execute prior to the expiration of any of the lockup periods.” \nShares of Baker Hughes jumped on the news, recently trading up 4.5% to $27.61. The company has a market value of about $30 billion. GE owns about two-thirds of the company. \nSince taking the reins as CEO in August, Flannery has cut the dividend and financial projections while pledging to shed at least $20 billion in assets. Flannery says he wants to simplify the company and is also considering bigger moves including separating the core divisions -- health care, aviation and power -- in what would amount to a breakup of the industrial giant.",
