Under the agreement, (i) base management fees are 1.50% of the Company’s “average adjusted gross assets”, (ii) the income-based incentive fee is 17.5% of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income (subject to a 7.00% annualized “hurdle rate” and 100% “catch-up” with a ceiling of 8.4848%) and (iii) the capital gains incentive fee is 17.5% of the Company’s cumulative net realized capital gains.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, $21.2 million of our equity investments have been monetized.\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, our portfolio totaled $1,100.6 million and consisted of $444.9 million of first lien secured debt, $375.6 million of second lien secured debt, $107.2 million of subordinated debt and $172.9 million of preferred and common equity. Our debt portfolio consisted of 82% variable-rate investments (including 12% where London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, was below the floor) and 18% fixed-rate investments. As of December 31, 2017, we had no companies on non-accrual. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $63.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Our overall portfolio consisted of 57 companies with an average investment size of $19.3 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 11.8% and was invested 40% in first lien secured debt, 34% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt and 16% in preferred and common equity.\nAs of September 30, 2017, our portfolio totaled $1,153.6 million and consisted of $466.1 million of first lien secured debt, $399.5 million of second lien secured debt, $120.7 million of subordinated debt and $167.3 million of preferred and common equity. Our debt portfolio consisted of 82% variable-rate investments (including 13% where LIBOR was below the floor) and 18% fixed-rate investments. As of September 30, 2017, we had no companies on non-accrual. Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized depreciation of $56.4 million as of September 30, 2017. Our overall portfolio consisted of 55 companies with an average investment size of $21.0 million, had a weighted average yield on interest bearing debt investments of 11.5% and was invested 40% in first lien secured debt, 35% in second lien secured debt, 10% in subordinated debt and 15% in preferred and common equity.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we invested $138.4 million in five new and seven existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.8%. Sales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $192.3 million.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016, we invested $229.2 million in nine new and seven existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 11.2%. Sales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $64.2 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSet forth below are the results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $28.7 million and was attributable to $12.7 million from first lien secured debt, $12.9 million from second lien secured debt and $3.1 million from subordinated debt, respectively. Investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $31.9 million and was attributable to $13.2 million from first lien secured debt, $12.7 million from second lien secured debt, $4.9 million from subordinated debt and $1.1 million from preferred and common equity. The decrease in investment income compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of our portfolio at cost.\nExpenses\nNet expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $14.5 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $4.8 million (after a base management fee waiver of $0.9 million), incentive fee totaled $2.7 million (after an incentive fee waiver of $0.5 million), debt related interest and expenses totaled $5.9 million and general and administrative expenses totaled $1.1 million. Net expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $16.8 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $5.3 million (after a base management fee waiver of $1.0 million), incentive fee totaled $2.9 million (after an incentive fee waiver of $0.5 million), debt related interest and expenses totaled $6.7 million, general and administrative expenses totaled $1.5 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.4 million. The decrease in expenses compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in debt related interest and expenses and base management fees.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income totaled $14.2 million, or $0.20 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $15.0 million, or $0.21 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net investment income per share compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to a reduction of our portfolio at cost.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nSales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $192.3 million and net realized gains totaled $3.8 million. Sales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $64.2 million and net realized losses totaled $22.2 million. The change in realized gains (losses) was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments, Credit Facility and Notes\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reported net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments of $(6.8) million and $25.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled $63.2 million and $56.4 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on our investments was driven primarily by changes in the capital market conditions, the financial performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments that were realized.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, our multi-currency, senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended and restated, or the Credit Facility, and our 4.50% notes due 2019, or 2019 Notes, had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $1.1 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Credit Facility, our 2019 Notes, and our 6.25% notes due 2025 had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, net unrealized appreciation on the Credit Facility and the 2019 Notes totaled $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The change in net unrealized depreciation compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets.\nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $12.3 million, or $0.18 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This compares to a net change in net assets resulting from operations of $24.0 million, or $0.34 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net change in net assets from operations compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the reduction of our portfolio and depreciation of our investments.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment and amendment costs on the Credit Facility, amortized upfront fees on Small Business Administration, or SBA, debentures and debt issuance costs, was 4.32% and 4.51%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, there was $79.4 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 2.47% and 2.42%, respectively, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments of 0.375%, as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had $365.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, subject to regulatory restrictions.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes outstanding, with a fixed interest rate of 4.50% per year. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had $300.0 million in SBA debt commitments, respectively, of which $184.0 million and $199.0 million was drawn, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $72.8 million and $38.2 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur operating activities provided cash of $62.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and our financing activities used cash of $27.8 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash from sales and repayments on our investments and our financing activities used cash primarily to pay distributions to stockholders and repay the SBA debentures.\nOur operating activities used cash of $108.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and our financing activities provided cash of $77.9 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily for net borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we declared distributions of $0.18 and $0.28 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $12.8 million and $19.9 million, respectively. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a return of capital for taxation purposes may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, common stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company makes available on its website its report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and stockholders may find the report on our website at www.pennantpark.com .\nPENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 (unaudited) Assets Investments at fair value Non-controlled, non-affiliated investments (cost—$774,071,408 and $824,106,322, respectively) $ 801,023,017 $ 849,351,548 Non-controlled, affiliated investments (cost—$186,604,156 and $185,799,943, respectively) 192,144,595 189,674,977 Controlled, affiliated investments (cost—$203,199,235 and $200,120,407, respectively) 107,453,444 114,550,983 Total of investments (cost—$1,163,874,799 and $1,210,026,672, respectively) 1,100,621,056 1,153,577,508 Cash and cash equivalents (cost—$72,781,092 and $38,182,373, respectively) 72,832,675 38,202,068 Interest receivable 7,759,810 5,906,976 Prepaid expenses and other assets 2,979,549 4,509,289 Total assets 1,184,193,090 1,202,195,841 Liabilities Distributions payable 12,790,950 12,790,950 Payable for investments purchased — 1,014,000 Credit Facility payable (cost—$79,392,900 and $79,392,900, respectively) 76,578,075 76,037,341 2019 Notes payable (par—$250,000,000) 253,997,500 255,665,000 SBA debentures payable, net (par—$184,000,000 and $199,000,000, respectively) 179,739,718 194,364,653 Base management fee payable, net 4,817,516 4,845,237 Performance-based incentive fee payable, net 2,675,573 2,270,008 Interest payable on debt 5,507,033 6,876,756 Accrued other expenses 1,773,807 1,523,425 Total liabilities 537,880,172 555,387,370 Commitments and contingencies — — Net assets Common stock, 71,060,836 shares issued and outstanding\nPar value $0.001 per share and 100,000,000 shares authorized 71,061 71,061 Paid-in capital in excess of par value 818,737,784 818,737,784 Undistributed net investment income 4,710,289 3,333,195 Accumulated net realized loss on investments (112,824,872 ) (116,598,355 ) Net unrealized depreciation on investments (63,198,669 ) (56,425,773 ) Net unrealized appreciation on debt (1,182,675 ) (2,309,441 ) Total net assets $ 646,312,918 $ 646,808,471 Total liabilities and net assets $ 1,184,193,090 $ 1,202,195,841 Net asset value per share $ 9.10 $ 9.10 PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Investment income: From non-controlled, non-affiliated investments: Interest $ 21,383,219 $ 21,651,426 Payment in kind 1,284,909 220,704 Other income 1,586,642 2,102,536 From non-controlled, affiliated investments: Interest 1,215,834 2,790,932 Payment in kind 1,573,306 1,434,749 Other income — 22,500 From controlled, affiliated investments: Interest 480,430 179,735 Payment in kind 1,144,085 3,466,329 Total investment income 28,668,425 31,868,911 Expenses: Base management fee 5,735,137 6,274,782 Performance-based incentive fee 3,185,204 3,374,210 Interest and expenses on debt 5,857,378 6,735,574 Administrative services expenses 521,625 894,000 Other general and administrative expenses 628,290 668,507 Expenses before Management Fees waiver and provision for taxes 15,927,634 17,947,073 Management Fees waiver (1,427,253 ) (1,543,839 ) Provision for taxes — 425,000 Net expenses 14,500,381 16,828,234 Net investment income 14,168,044 15,040,677 Realized and unrealized (loss) gain on investments and debt: Net realized gain (loss) on investments on: Non-controlled, non-affiliated investments 1,793,043 (22,195,334 ) Non-controlled and controlled, affiliated investments 1,980,440 — Net realized gain (loss) on investments 3,773,483 (22,195,334 ) Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on: Non-controlled, non-affiliated investments 1,738,065 19,636,201 Non-controlled and controlled, affiliated investments (8,510,961 ) 5,736,899 Debt depreciation 1,126,766 5,830,684 Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments and debt (5,646,130 ) 31,203,784 Net realized and unrealized (loss) gain from investments and debt (1,872,647 ) 9,008,450 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations $ 12,295,397 $ 24,049,127 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share $ 0.18 $ 0.34 Net investment income per common share $ 0.20 $ 0.21\nABOUT PENNANTPARK INVESTMENT CORPORATION\nPennantPark Investment Corporation is a business development company which invests primarily in U.S. middle-market companies in the form of first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt, subordinated debt and equity investments.
