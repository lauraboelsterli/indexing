    "text": "BEIJING, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shineco, Inc. (\"Shineco\" or the \"Company\"; NASDAQ: TYHT), a producer and distributor of Chinese herbal medicines, organic agricultural produce, specialized textiles, and other health and well-being focused plant-based products in China, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nMr. Yuying Zhang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Shineco, commented, \"We are proud of all that we have accomplished in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and are pleased to report the second quarter of 2018 financial results with a 26.3% increase in net income as compared to the second quarter of 2017. We believe that our investment in our Apocynum Industrial Park and Institute of Chinese Apocynum Industrial Technology Research continues to strengthen the long-term outlook of Shineco as a positive long-term investment. In the short term we have seen tremendous growth in our Luobuma product line and are pleased that we have grown to become a high margin business, with revenues grown 327% compared to the second quarter ended December 31, 2016, and have achieved impressive results following our expansion over this past year. The past six months have been immensely positive for Shineco and we are excited to tackle the challenges and opportunities that the next six months will bring, as we anticipate continued future growth in our revenues and net income.\"\nSecond Quarter of 2018 Financial Highlights\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenue\n14.13\n11.22\n25.9%\nLuobuma products\n3.89\n0.91\n327.0%\nChinese medicinal herbal products\n3.66\n3.50\n4.8%\nOther agricultural products\n6.58\n6.82\n-3.4%\nGross profit\n4.82\n3.95\n21.9%\nGross margin\n34.1%\n35.2%\n-1.1%\nOperating income\n3.24\n2.53\n28.2%\nOperating margin\n22.9%\n22.5%\n0.4%\nNet income attributable to Shineco\n3.60\n2.85\n26.3%\nEPS\n0.17\n0.14\n26.3%\nRevenues increased by 25.9% to $14.13 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $11.22 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to increases in sales from Luobuma products and Chinese medicinal herbal products and partially offset by decreased sales from other agricultural products. Gross profit increased by 21.9% to $4.82 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.95 million for the same period of last year. Gross margin decreased by 1.1 percentage points to 34.1% from 35.2% for the same period of last year. Net income attributable to Shineco increased by 26.3% to $3.60 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $2.85 million, or $0.14 per basic and diluted share, for the same period of last year. The increases in net income earnings per share were primarily a result of the increase in gross profit, partially offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased by $0.10 million, or 11.2%, to $1.03 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $0.92 million for the same period of last year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to the incorporation of new subsidiaries, Tiankunrunze, Xinjiang Taihe and Tajite in 2017.
