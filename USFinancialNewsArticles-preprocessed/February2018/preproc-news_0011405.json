Slideshow (2 Images) \nIn May 2010, South Korea banned all North Korean ships from entering its ports and cut off most inter-Korean exchanges, including tourism, trade and aid, in response to a torpedo attack by the North on a navy ship that killed 46 sailors. \n“We’re seeking to apply an exemption for the May (2010) measures to support a successful hosting of the Olympics,” Baik said.
