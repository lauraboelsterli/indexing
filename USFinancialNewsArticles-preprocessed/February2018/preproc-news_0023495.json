    "text": "0 COMMENTS I wore a jumpsuit in public exactly once. It was a vintage army mechanic’s uniform that I’d purchased late one night from eBay , inspired or perhaps led astray by a 1972 photo of Paul Newman hanging out with Clint Eastwood. Mr. Newman grins at the camera, clad in a trim navy jumpsuit with batik-patterned cuffs. To me, he seemed the very definition of confidence.\nIn my jumpsuit, I seemed the very definition of a schmuck. \nWalking to the grocery store, I caught sight of my reflection in a window and realized I looked like I’d flown the Cuckoo’s Nest, the one immortalized in the 1975 Jack Nicholson film. Passersby must have thought so too. They stared in my direction just a few seconds too long, a seering New York judgment. What’s more, my jumpsuit didn’t fit correctly: too tight in the crotch, too saggy at the hems. I went home, defeated, and immediately changed into jeans and a sweatshirt.\nA man and his jumpsuit during Paris Fashion Week last year. Photo: Getty Images This cringe-inducing memory resurfaced last year, when the male jumpsuit started having an unlikely moment. On “The Jimmy Kimmel Show” in May , the host pranced about in a short-sleeved one-piece from Romphim, a brand marketing a male version of the female romper (Get it? Romp him!). Mr. Kimmel royally mocked the company—dismissing the garment as “adult-sized baby clothes” —but Romphim has succeeded, raising over $350,000 on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter and now selling its clothes worldwide. The male jumpsuit crossed over into high fashion, too: Brad Pitt got into the game , wearing an Issey Miyake onesie in the pages of GQ Style’s Summer 2017 issue, and other brands, such as Marni and Lanvin, showed their own versions for the fall 2018 collections. In real life, I see the occasional guy walking around my neighborhood in a smudged-up vintage jumpsuit. Hey, I live in Brooklyn. It happens. \nThough my own field test left me scarred, lately, I’ve begun to second-guess myself: Have I cheated myself by relegating my jumpsuit to the back of my closet? I asked a few members of the small but mighty club of adult male jumpsuit wearers to find out what I might be missing.\nSimone Monguzzi wearing a bomber jacket over a blue jumpsuit during Paris Fashion Week last June. Photo: Getty Images I started with Daiki Suzuki, the designer behind Engineered Garments , a New York label that has produced a guy’s jumpsuit for about five years now. A jumpsuit, he explained, is a single piece that slips on in seconds and makes for an all-in-one outfit, the closest a man can come to the ease of women’s fashion: “It’s just like a girl wearing a dress.” Still, he acknowledges that the two styles of jumpsuit that Engineered Garments produces each year are a hard sell. “I know that it’s not for everyone,” said Mr. Suzuki of the look. “It’s for certain crazy people who love it.” His jumpsuits were inspired by old workwear uniforms, the kind that soot-stained coal-shovelers and house painters wear. Today, his versions attract artists, designers, brewers and other make-their-own-hours types: guys who don’t risk getting called down to H.R. for an outfit transgression.\nJames Hartley counts himself among that artistic class. A few years ago, a friend gave the 32-year-old photographer a Marc Jacobs jumpsuit he had tired of. Mr. Hartley described putting it on as “pretty miraculous.” At 6’4’’, Mr. Hartley could fill out the sail-like jumpsuit, but beyond that, he found the jumpsuit “fun.” He went on to expand his jumpsuit wardrobe and now has seven in rotation. His Instagram feed includes a shot of himself, happily posing in a playfully palm-leaf patterned jumpsuit that he had custom made in Indonesia. The hashtag: #onesizefitsme . Strangers are not particularly supportive: Mr. Hartley regularly gets asked, “What the f**k are you wearing?” but he brushes those comments aside. “I don’t like being told I can’t wear certain things,” he said. Instead, he’s used the scarcity of committed jumpsuit wearers to his advantage, making the look part of his signature style. “Any time an article about jumpsuits or something comes up, I’m always getting linked and friends are always keeping an eye out and texting me about them,” said Mr. Hartley. \n\nMario Abad, 24, a freelance writer in Dallas, has similarly made his black Zara jumpsuit an arrow in his style quiver. “I definitely wear it when I want to stand out,” he said. He prefers to break it out when meeting someone new or for special occasions because people will take notice of it right away. “It’s not a silhouette that people are normally accustomed to and I like that attention” said Mr. Abad confidently. “It’s definitely a conversation starter.”\nPerhaps jumpsuit success has less to do with fit or context than it does with confidence. Maybe those jumpsuit devotees were just blessed with more bravado than the rest of us. Paul Newman, the man who put the onesie bug in my brain, could have made a trash bag look cool with his patented brand of insouciance. And who has more confidence than People Magazine’s two-time “Sexiest Man Alive” winner, Mr. Brad Pitt? The artists and designers I occasionally see in paint-splattered jumpsuits around my neighborhood use theirs to achieve maximum eccentricity. There’s just a certain swagger that comes from assertively sporting a garment that others wouldn’t dare to wear. That is, if you can get past all the raised eyebrows that will follow in your wake. If you can, you’re a better man than I. \nWrite to Jacob Gallagher at Jacob.Gallagher@wsj.com \nMore in Style & Fashion \nBill Belichick’s Sleeveless Sweatshirts: The Key to Patriots Victory?
