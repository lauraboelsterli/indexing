Pawar will lead Navigant Healthcare’s corporate services solutions, while Skea will join the firm’s strategic practice.\n“For any healthcare organization, success today requires re-evaluating and right-sizing strategic investments that have been made in growth, technology, and population health,” said David Burik , managing director and leader of Navigant’s payer/provider consulting division. “Both Milind and Warren have proven change management and performance improvement track records, based on decades of experience working directly with executives on multifunctional initiatives that achieve quantifiable strategic and operational outcomes.”\nRecognized for leading transformative engagements that optimize performance, Pawar brings deep knowledge of the strategic and operational challenges faced by providers, payers, and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) leadership. He most recently served as a managing director for Accenture, where he led cross-functional programs that realized more than $500 million in annual savings. He also has experience helping providers develop new operating models and enhance the customer and employee experience, establishing post-merger plans for integration of specialty PBMs, and architecting growth strategies for Medicaid managed care plans. Pawar was also a senior project manager at global design and strategy firm frog , where he successfully brought more than a dozen consumer products to market.\nSkea comes to Navigant from PwC, where he was a partner. In that role, Skea led business development teams and large strategic engagements for provider, payer, pharmaceutical, and medical device clients. Prior to that, he rose to prominence as national director of quality improvement initiatives for the American Heart Association (AHA), where he helped develop and implement processes, policies, and procedures for the AHA’s hospital-based quality improvement program, Get with the Guidelines. Skea’s work has been published in major publications, and presented at national and international conferences, covering such topics as value-based care, health policy, organizational culture, and strategic transformation.\nNavigant’s Healthcare segment is composed of consultants, former provider administrators, clinicians, and other experts with decades of strategy, operational/clinical consulting, managed services, revenue cycle management, and outsourcing experience.
