(Nasdaq: RMR) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nAdam Portnoy, President and Chief Executive Officer, made the following statement regarding the first quarter fiscal 2018 results:\n\"We are pleased with our first quarter results, with net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc., Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin all increasing as compared to the previous quarter and the same period last year. In addition to growth in our recurring management services revenues, this quarter we recognized $155.9 million in incentive business management fees that we earned for calendar year 2017 from three of our managed equity REITs. Finally, the quarter includes the transitional impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our operations, with a one time net gain of $4.9 million from the remeasurement of our tax assets and liabilities at lower corporate tax rates.\nOur first quarter results build on the positive momentum we realized in growing and diversifying our business since becoming a publicly traded company about two years ago. Recently, the IPO of our fifth managed equity REIT, Industrial Logistics Properties Trust, was successfully completed on January 17, 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights:\nTotal revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $218.5 million, including $155.9 million of incentive business management fees, compared to total revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $105.3 million, including $52.4 million of incentive business management fees. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $159.3 million and net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. was $71.1 million, or $4.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of $60.2 million and net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. of $23.5 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The RMR Group Inc. earned management services revenues and incentive business management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 from the following sources (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Managed Equity REITs (1) $ 40,965 20.1 % $ 35,759 37.6 % Managed Operators (2) 6,741 3.3 % 6,452 6.8 % Other 864 0.4 % 516 0.5 % Total Management Services Revenues 48,570 23.8 % 42,727 44.9 % Incentive Business Management Fees (3) 155,881 76.2 % 52,407 55.1 % Total Management Services Revenues and Incentive Business Management Fees $ 204,451 100.0 % $ 95,134 100.0 % (1) Managed Equity REITs collectively refers to: Government Properties Income Trust (GOV), Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT), Select Income REIT (SIR) and Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH). Industrial Logistics Properties Trust (ILPT) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of SIR until ILPT's initial public offering was completed on January 17, 2018.\n(2) Managed Operators collectively refers to: Five Star Senior Living Inc. (FVE), Sonesta International Hotels Corporation and TravelCenters of America LLC (TA).\n(3) Incentive Business Management Fees for the three months ended December 31, 2017, includes fees earned from HPT, SIR and SNH of $74,572, $25,569 and $55,740, respectively, and for the three months ended December 31, 2016 includes fees only earned from HPT.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $30.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 58.4%, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $26.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 56.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA Margin equals Adjusted EBITDA divided by the contractual management and advisory fees earned from The RMR Group LLC’s client companies. These contractual management and advisory fees are calculated pursuant to The RMR Group LLC’s contracts with its client companies and do not deduct non-cash asset amortization recognized in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, as a reduction to management services revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are calculated on recurring revenues and do not include incentive business management fees earned. On December 22, 2017, the U.S government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates. Since we have a September 30 fiscal year end, we currently expect the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a federal statutory tax rate of approximately 24.5% for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 and 21.0% for subsequent fiscal years. This reduction in the federal statutory rate caused us to adjust our deferred tax asset and our income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, The RMR Group Inc. had approximately $30.0 billion of total assets under management, compared to total assets under management of $28.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 and $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2016.\nReconciliations to GAAP:\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of net income determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as well as calculations of Adjusted EBITDA Margin appear later in this press release. Also, comparisons of The RMR Group Inc.'s revenues, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, net income and net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to the three months ended December 31, 2016 are presented later in this press release.\nImpact of Significant Items on Results:\nTo help investors better understand the impacts on our results for the quarter ending December 31, 2017 of certain individually significant items, we are presenting later in this press release detail quantifying the impact of those items on our results.\nTotal Assets Under Management:\nThe calculation of total assets under management includes: (i) the gross book value of real estate and related assets, excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or other non-cash reserves, of the Managed Equity REITs and ABP Trust, plus (ii) the gross book value of real estate assets, property and equipment of the Managed Operators, excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or other non-cash reserves, plus (iii) the fair value of investments of Affiliates Insurance Company, the managed assets of RMR Real Estate Income Fund and the equity of Tremont Mortgage Trust (TRMT), plus (iv) the contributed capital of and outstanding principal of loans serviced for certain private clients. This calculation of total assets under management may include amounts in respect of the Managed Equity REITs that are higher than the calculations of assets under management used for purposes of calculating fees under the terms of the business management agreements, which are based, in part, upon the lesser of the historical cost of real estate assets or total market capitalization. For information on the calculation of assets under management of the Managed Equity REITs for purposes of the fee provisions of the business management agreements, see The RMR Group Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.

Income tax expense is recognized and payable at The RMR Group Inc. holding company level and is not allocated to the noncontrolling interest as the holder of the noncontrolling interest is separately responsible for its taxes.\n(2) The tax receivable agreement and deferred tax asset are recorded at The RMR Group Inc. holding company level and are not allocated to the noncontrolling interest.\n(3) The adjustment related to the remeasurement of the amounts due pursuant to the tax receivable agreement is not taxable.\n(4) Included in income tax expense.\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nReconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin (1)\n(dollars in thousands)\n(unaudited\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 159,324 $ 60,200 Plus: income tax expense 48,343 15,673 Plus: depreciation and amortization 380 555 EBITDA 208,047 76,428 Plus: other asset amortization 2,354 2,354 Plus: operating expenses paid in The RMR Group Inc.'s common shares 566 138 Plus: transaction costs related to the initial public offering of TRMT 142 — Plus: business email compromise fraud costs 225 — Plus: equity in losses of investees 222 — Less: certain other adjustments (425 ) (408 ) Less: tax receivable agreement remeasurement due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (24,710 ) — Less: incentive business management fees earned (155,881 ) (52,407 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 30,540 $ 26,105 Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin: Contractual management and advisory fees (excluding any incentive business management fees) (2) $ 52,306 $ 46,091 Adjusted EBITDA $ 30,540 $ 26,105 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 58.4 % 56.6 % (1) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures calculated as presented in the tables above. The RMR Group Inc. considers EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to be appropriate supplemental measures of its operating performance, along with net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and operating income. The RMR Group Inc. believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain amounts, such as income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, incentive business management fees earned, other asset amortization, operating expenses paid in The RMR Group Inc.'s common shares, transaction costs related to the initial public offering of TRMT, business email compromise fraud costs, equity in losses of investees, tax receivable agreement remeasurement due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and certain other adjustments, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may facilitate a comparison of current operating performance with The RMR Group Inc.’s historical operating performance and with the performance of other asset management businesses. In addition, The RMR Group Inc. believes that providing Adjusted EBITDA Margin may help investors assess The RMR Group Inc.’s performance of its business by providing the margin that Adjusted EBITDA represents to its contractual management and advisory fees (excluding any incentive business management fees). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. or operating income as an indicator of The RMR Group Inc.’s financial performance or as a measure of The RMR Group Inc.’s liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to The RMR Group Inc. and operating income as presented in The RMR Group Inc.'s condensed consolidated statements of income. Also, other asset management businesses may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than The RMR Group Inc. does.\n(2) These contractual management fees are the base business management fees, property management fees and advisory fees The RMR Group Inc. earns pursuant to its management and investment advisory agreements with its client companies. These amounts are calculated pursuant to the contractual formulas and do not deduct other asset amortization of $2,354 for each of the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, required to be recognized as a reduction to management services revenues in accordance with GAAP and do not include the incentive business management fees of $155,881 and $52,407 that The RMR Group Inc. recognized under GAAP during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were earned for the calendar years 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nDecember 31, September 30, 2017 2017 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 125,966 $ 108,640 Due from related parties 180,591 25,161 Prepaid and other current assets 3,370 7,092 Total current assets 309,927 140,893 Furniture and equipment 4,865 4,800 Leasehold improvements 1,075 1,094 Capitalized software costs 1,892 1,876 Total property and equipment 7,832 7,770 Accumulated depreciation (4,833 ) (4,494 ) 2,999 3,276 Due from related parties, net of current portion 7,660 7,551 Equity method investments 11,890 12,162 Goodwill 1,859 1,859 Intangible assets, net of amortization 440 462 Deferred tax asset 25,391 45,541 Other assets, net of amortization 169,621 171,975 Total assets $ 529,787 $ 383,719 Liabilities and Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 60,215 $ 26,414 Total current liabilities 60,215 26,414 Long term portion of deferred rent payable, net of current portion 1,080 1,028 Amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreement, net of current portion 34,353 59,063 Employer compensation liability, net of current portion 7,660 7,551 Total liabilities 103,308 94,056 Commitments and contingencies Equity: Class A common stock, $0.001 par value; 31,600,000 shares authorized; 15,164,066 shares issued and outstanding 15 15 Class B-1 common stock, $0.001 par value; 1,000,000 shares authorized, issued and outstanding 1 1 Class B-2 common stock, $0.001 par value; 15,000,000 shares authorized, issued and outstanding 15 15 Additional paid in capital 96,444 95,878 Retained earnings 157,956 86,836 Cumulative other comprehensive income 84 84 Cumulative common distributions (37,339 ) (33,298 ) Total shareholders’ equity 217,176 149,531 Noncontrolling interest 209,303 140,132 Total equity 426,479 289,663 Total liabilities and equity $ 529,787 $ 383,719\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005205/en/\nThe RMR Group Inc.\nTimothy A.
