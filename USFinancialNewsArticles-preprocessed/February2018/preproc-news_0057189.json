    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National General Holdings Corp. (Nasdaq:NGHC) today reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $9.9 million or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $39.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 operating earnings (1) was $30.0 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $32.8 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter net income included a one-time non-cash tax charge of $25.8 million from the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax asset related to the recently implemented reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights Versus Fourth Quarter 2016*\nGross written premium grew $246.9 million or 30.1% to $1,067.2 million, driven by added premiums from organic growth and the acquisition of Direct General and within our P&C business of 30.9% and continued growth of our A&H segment of 26.3%. The overall combined ratio (10,14) was 96.9% compared to 96.4% in the prior year’s quarter, excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill. The P&C segment reported an increase in combined ratio to 98.2% from 97.9% in the prior year’s quarter, due to $52.9 million of losses, or 7.5 P&C loss ratio points, from California fires in the fourth quarter 2017. Excluding the aforementioned fire-related losses, the P&C segment combined ratio (16) was 90.7% and NGHC overall combined ratio (16) was 90.6%. The A&H segment reported a combined ratio of 89.9% compared to 86.7% in the prior year’s quarter. Total revenue grew by $50.2 million or 5.1% to $1.0 billion, primarily driven by the aforementioned premium growth, service and fee income growth of $37.5 million or 34.6%, and an increase in ceding commission income of $14.2 million, primarily related to the new quota share agreements announced in the third quarter. Shareholders’ equity was $1.93 billion and fully diluted book value per share was $13.86 at December 31, 2017, growth of 2.3% and 3.0%, respectively, from December 31, 2016. Our trailing twelve month operating return on average equity (ROE) (15) was 7.9% as of December 31, 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 operating earnings exclude the following material items, net of tax: $1.8 million or $0.02 per share of net gain on investments, $6.1 million or $0.06 per share of non-cash amortization of intangible assets, $4.9 million or $0.05 per share of impairment of goodwill related to our Luxembourg subsidiary, and losses of $4.9 million or $0.05 per share from earnings of equity method investments. Operating earnings also excluded a charge of $25.8 million or $0.24 per share from the deferred tax asset impairment. Prior period results referred to in this release are reported on an “as adjusted” basis. For details on the adjustments, please refer to page 3 of this release and Note 3 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBarry Karfunkel, National General’s President and CEO, stated: “This quarter concluded one of the most active domestic catastrophe years in recent memory. While National General’s results did not escape their impact, we continue to report profitable underwriting results and our losses were less than our market share in the impacted areas, demonstrating the disciplined underwriting standards that we operate with. In addition, I’m proud of how our claims team responded and it’s in times like this that we feel fortunate to be able to stand behind our promise and commitment to customers that we’ll take care of them in their greatest time of need. Alternative asset classes continued to be deemphasized in our investment portfolio through the sale of a portion of our life settlement holdings in the quarter.\nI am excited about what’s in store for 2018 and beyond. We have built one of the most sophisticated and dynamic personal lines platforms in the industry, which we believe will drive National General’s success for years to come.”\n*NOTE: Unless specified otherwise, discussion of our fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 results do not include financial results from the Reciprocal Exchanges, which are presented within our consolidated financial results within this release but are not included in net income available to NGHC common stockholders.\nOverview of Fourth Quarter 2017 as Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nGross written premium grew 30.1% to $1,067.2 million, net written premium increased by 7.8% to $799.8 million and net earned premium grew 3.0% to $843.0 million. Premium growth was driven by several key factors: underlying organic growth within our P&C segment, continued growth of our A&H segment, and additional premiums from the acquisition of Direct General.\nService and fee income grew 34.6% to $146.1 million, driven by organic growth and added service and fee income from our recent completed transactions.\nExcluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, the combined ratio (10,14,15) was 96.9% with a loss ratio of 74.2% and an expense ratio (10,13,15) of 22.7%, compared to a prior year combined ratio of 96.4% with a loss ratio of 71.7% and an expense ratio of 24.7%. The expense ratio benefited from the ceding commission related to the new quota shares.\nUnderwriting results detailed by each of our business segments are as follows:\nProperty & Casualty - Gross written premium grew by 30.7% to $930.0 million, net written premium increased by 4.5% to $674.1 million and net earned premium decreased by 0.4% to $709.3 million. P&C gross written premium growth was driven by several key factors: organic growth of 30.9%, and $37.3 million from the Direct General acquisition. Service and fee income grew 20.9% to $99.3 million, driven by increased premium volume in the quarter and the addition of service and fee income from Direct General. Excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets, the combined ratio (10,14) was 98.2% with a loss ratio of 76.9% and an expense ratio (10,13) of 21.3%, versus a prior year combined ratio of 97.9% with a loss ratio of 72.8% and an expense ratio of 25.1%. The loss ratio was impacted by pre-tax catastrophe losses of approximately $52.9 million related to California fires in the fourth quarter 2017. Excluding the aforementioned losses, the P&C segment combined ratio (16) was 90.7% in the quarter. The expense ratio also benefited from the ceding commission related to the new quota shares.\nAccident & Health - Gross written premium grew to $137.2 million, net written premium grew to $125.7 million, and net earned premium grew to $133.8 million, from $108.6 million, $97.1 million, and $106.6 million, respectively, in the prior year’s quarter. The A&H gross written premium increase was driven by the continued growth across the entire book. Service and fee income was $46.8 million compared to $26.5 million in the prior year’s quarter. The increase in service and fee income primarily relates to the mix of business sold in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets, the combined ratio (10,14) was 89.9% with a loss ratio of 59.9% and an expense ratio (10,13,15) of 30.0%, versus a prior year combined ratio of 86.7% with a loss ratio of 64.5% and an expense ratio of 22.2%.\nReciprocal Exchanges - Results for the Reciprocal Exchanges are not included in net income available to NGHC common stockholders. Gross written premium was $98.0 million, net written premium was $39.2 million, and net earned premium was $46.6 million. Reciprocal Exchanges combined ratio (10,14,15) excluding non-cash amortization of intangible assets was 105.6% with a loss ratio of 66.7% and an expense ratio (10,13) of 38.9%.\nInvestment income grew 28.1% to $28.2 million, reflecting an increase in the size of our investment portfolio as compared to the prior year’s quarter. Fourth quarter 2017 results included $2.8 million of net investment gains compared to a gain of $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total investments and cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2017. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased to a $8.1 million loss at December 31, 2017 from $11.5 million income at December 31, 2016.\nInterest expense was $12.5 million, up from $11.6 million in the prior year’s quarter. Debt was $713.7 million at December 31, 2017, down from $752.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nEarnings of equity investments (predominantly our investment in Life Settlement Entities and alternative investments) was a $7.5 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a $6.0 million gain in the prior year’s quarter. In the quarter, substantially all of the remaining life settlement contracts held by entities in which we held a 50% interest were sold to a vehicle owned and managed by an independent third party, in which we will now hold a 15% ownership interest.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 provision for income taxes was $24.8 million and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 81.9% compared with income taxes of $4.4 million and an effective tax rate of 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The revaluation of our deferred tax asset increased income taxes by $25.8 million in the quarter.\nShareholders’ equity was $1,928.6 million at December 31, 2017, growth of 2.3% from $1,885.7 million at December 31, 2016. Fully diluted book value per share was $13.86 at December 31, 2017, growth of 3.0% from $13.45 at December 31, 2016. Our trailing twelve month operating return on average equity (ROE) (15) was 7.9% as of December 31, 2017.\nAs further explained in Note 3 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, management identified certain errors in the previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, as well as the first three quarters of fiscal year 2017. The primary driver of the correction relates to the retrospective reclassification of costs associated with claims handling from General and Administrative Expense to Loss Adjustment Expense and the timing of recording losses relating to the company’s limited partnership interests in certain real estate joint ventures which was initially recorded in the second quarter of 2017. National General has concluded that the errors were not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as presented in the Company’s previously filed quarterly and annual financial statements. As a result, amendment of such reports is not required. Please refer to Note 3 in our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further detail on the adjustments.\nYear-to-Date P&C Segment Notable Large Losses 2017 Quarter P&C Notable\nLarge Losses and\nLAE ($ millions) P&C Loss Ratio Points* EPS Impact After Tax Q4 California Fires - December $10.4 1.5 % $0.06 Q4 California Fires - October $42.5 6.0 % $0.25 Q3 Hurricane Maria $5.0 0.7 % $0.03 Q3 Hurricane Irma $25.1 3.7 % $0.15 Q3 Hurricane Harvey $22.3 3.2 % $0.13 Q2 Hail event $7.0 0.9 % $0.04 Q2 Increased Loss Estimate from Q1 West Coast Storms $9.1 1.1 % $0.05 Q1 West Coast Storms $8.9 1.2 % $0.05 * Loss ratio points related to P&C net earned premium in quarter the loss event was recorded.\nConference Call\nOn Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 9:00 AM ET, President and Chief Executive Officer Barry Karfunkel and Chief Financial Officer Mike Weiner will review results and discuss business conditions via a conference call that may be accessed as follows:\nToll-Free U.S. Dial-in: 800-346-7359\nInternational Dial-in: 973-528-0008\nConference Entry Code: 234458\nWebcast Registration: http://ir.nationalgeneral.com/events-and-presentations\nA replay of the conference call will be accessible from 2:00 PM ET on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 to 11:59 PM ET on Tuesday, March 13, 2018 by dialing either 800-332-6854 (toll-free) within the U.S. or 973-528-0005 outside the U.S. and entering passcode 234458.

consolidation under GAAP for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016.\n(B) Consolidated Total includes eliminations between National General and the Reciprocal Exchanges of $(1,120) in Personal Auto and $(2,082) in Homeowners Gross Written Premium in 2017, respectively, and $(726) in Personal Auto and $(1,586) in Homeowners Gross Written Premium in 2016, respectively.\nAdditional Disclosures\n(1) References to operating earnings and basic and diluted operating earnings per share (“EPS”) are non-GAAP financial measures defined by the Company as net income/loss and basic and diluted earnings per share excluding after-tax net gain or loss on investments (including foreign exchange gain or loss), other-than-temporary impairment losses, bargain purchase gains, earnings or losses of equity method investments (related parties), deferred tax asset impairment, non-cash impairment of goodwill and non-cash amortization of intangible assets. The Company believes operating earnings and basic and diluted operating EPS are relevant measures of the Company’s profitability because operating earnings and basic and diluted operating EPS contain the components of net income upon which the Company’s management has the most influence and excludes factors outside management’s direct control and non-recurring items. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(2) Total investments includes $347,548 and $373,688 in related parties at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(3) Reinsurance recoverable includes $17,240 and $37,046 from related parties at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(4) Other includes $2,334 and $1,298 from related parties at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(5) Reinsurance payable includes $543 and $33,419 due to related parties at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(6) Accounts payable and accrued expenses includes $140,098 and $29,271 to related parties at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(7) Common stock: $0.01 par value - authorized 150,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 106,697,648 shares - December 31, 2017; authorized 150,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 106,428,092 shares - December 31, 2016.\n(8) Preferred stock: $0.01 par value - authorized 10,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 2,565,000 shares - December 31, 2017; authorized 10,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 2,565,000 shares - December 31, 2016.\n(9) Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expense by net earned premium.\n(10) Operating expense ratio and combined ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because a component of those ratios, operating expense, is calculated by offsetting acquisition and other underwriting costs and general and administrative expenses by ceding commission income and service and fee income. Management uses operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) and combined ratio (non-GAAP) to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. The Company believes this presentation enhances the understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events and presenting the ratios with what we believe are the underlying run rates of the business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(11) Operating expense ratio is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by dividing operating expense by net earned premium. Operating expense consists of the sum of acquisition and other underwriting costs and general and administrative expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(12) Combined ratio is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by adding the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) together. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business, and overall underwriting profit. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit, while over 100% an underwriting loss. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General.\n(13) Operating expense ratio before amortization and impairment is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by dividing the operating expense before amortization and impairment by net earned premium. Operating expense before amortization and impairment consists of the sum of acquisition and other underwriting costs and general and administrative expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income less non-cash amortization of intangible assets and non-cash impairment of goodwill. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(14) Combined ratio before amortization and impairment is a non-GAAP measure defined by the Company, that is commonly used in the insurance industry. The Company calculates the ratio by adding the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the operating expense ratio before amortization and impairment (non-GAAP) together. The ratio is used as an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business, and overall underwriting profit. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit, while over 100% an underwriting loss. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(15) Trailing twelve month operating return on average equity is the ratio of the previous twelve months operating earnings to average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. Average shareholders’ equity is the sum of the shareholders’ equity excluding preferred stock at the beginning and end of the period presented divided by two. In the opinion of the Company’s management this ratio is an important indicator of how well management creates value for its shareholders through its operating activities and capital management. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by National General. Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table within this release for the reconciliation of net income to operating earnings, which is the Non-GAAP component of the operating return on average equity.\n(16) Combined ratio excluding losses from the California fires, and is calculated by taking the combined ratio as defined in Note 14, and adjusting it to exclude the total net losses of $52.9 million from these events. The company believes this measure enhances investors’ understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events.\nQ4’17 Combined\nRatio Impact of Fire\nLosses Q4’17 Combined\nRatio Excluding\nFire Losses P&C Segment 98.2% 7.5% 90.7% Overall NGHC 96.9% 6.3% 90.6% Investor Contact\nChristine Worley\nDirector of Investor Relations\nPhone: 212-380-9462\nEmail: Christine.Worley@NGIC.com\nSource:National General Holdings Corp",
