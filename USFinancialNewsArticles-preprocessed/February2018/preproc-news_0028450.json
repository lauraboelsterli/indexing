Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE THE BELL IN EUROPE (0751 GMT) Stock index futures are pointing to a strong rebound in Europe this morning after the region's equity market lost 5 percent, or around $1 trillion in market cap, during last week's sell-off. DAX futures were leading the bounce, up 2 percent. Shares in Akzo Nobel are expected to rise 1-2 percent after a source-based Financial Times report said that US private equity giant Apollo had teamed up with the biggest Dutch pension fund to buy Akzo's 10 billion-euro speciality chemicals unit. Eyes also on raft of earning updates, although price moves could be distorted by last week's broad-based sell off. Heineken will be in the spotlight after the brewer lowered its margin growth target, blaming a volatile market environment and an acquisition in Brazil. Bayer however posted a 2017 underlying operating profit that was in line with a Reuters poll forecast.

(0727 GMT) That's the question on everyone's lips after a weekend of mulling over the most serious sell-off to hit markets in years. UniCredit global chief economist Erik Nielsen says while most market commentators have labelled this correction as mainly \"technical\", it's worth digging into the reasons why more fundamental drivers could be at play, especially in the US. \"My fear of more fundamental weakness relates only to the US, which really is at the centre of the present markets chaos,\" writes Nielsen, arguing the US economy may be in more trouble than widely thought. \"If US balance sheet issues are causing trouble, then we may be in for a more complicated - and volatile - ride during 2018 that'll see US equities slide through must of the year, as US yields climb higher.\" Nielsen sees non-US equities as likely to de-couple therefore, as Europe and Asia benefit from more moderate valuations, better relative growth and 'much stronger' balance sheets. \"In contrast to European firms, US companies are much more exposed to rising financing costs because of recent years' strong increase in net debt,\" he notes, adding most of this money was used to inflate shareholder payouts rather than for investment. Nielsen adds a word of warning on thinking it's all over too soon: \"Corrections are rarely done within 10 working days. On average these types of disruptions normally rumble on for 30-40 days.\" Fasten your seatbelts...

Last Tuesday was the strongest day of ETF trading activity ever on the LSE, a spokeswoman said, with some 1.3 billion pounds traded in ETFs. Dark pool Turquoise saw a record amount processed in its large block platform Plato Block Discovery, with 2.46 billion euros in trading over the week as investors sought to put through big trades without moving the market. Turquoise overall beat its previous weekly record by 18 percent, with 7.43 billion euros worth of trades executed in the dark. (Helen Reid)",
