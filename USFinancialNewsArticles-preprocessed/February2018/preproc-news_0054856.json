    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices rose across the board on Friday, lifted by the Bank of Japan’s regular debt-purchasing operation and a bounce in U.S. Treasuries.\nThe two-year yield dipped 0.5 basis point to minus 0.160 percent, the 10-year yield declined 0.5 basis point to 0.045 percent and the 40-year yield fell 1.5 basis points to 0.885 percent.\nThe BOJ on Friday bought 850 billion yen ($7.96 billion) of one- to 40-year JGBs as part of its regular bond-purchasing scheme.\nJGB gains were limited as Tokyo stocks gained, with the Nikkei climbing 0.3 percent.\nThe JGB market reacted little to Friday’s data which showed Japan’s annual core consumer inflation rate was unchanged in January from the previous month, suggesting the BOJ remains distant from exiting its super loose monetary policy.\nU.S. Treasury prices gained the previous day following a week of steady declines. The 10-year Treasury note yield pulled back to 2.933 percent after rising to a four-year high of 2.957 percent earlier in the week.
