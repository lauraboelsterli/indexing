    "text": "WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Fuel Gas Company (“National Fuel” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NFG) today announced consolidated results for the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year.\nFISCAL 2018 FIRST QUARTER SUMMARY\nConsolidated net income of $198.7 million, or $2.30 per share, compared to $88.9 million, or $1.04 per share, in the prior year first quarter Excluding the $111.0 million, or $1.29 per share, reduction in tax expense due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes, Adjusted Operating Results for the quarter were $87.7 million, or $1.02 per share (see non-GAAP reconciliation on page 21 and discussion of federal tax reform on page 2) Realized net earnings benefit for the quarter of $9.5 million, or $0.11 per share, due to the reduction in the fiscal 2018 federal statutory rate from 2017 Tax Reform Act (see discussion on page 2) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $197.8 million (non-GAAP reconciliation on page 21) Net natural gas and oil production of 40.1 Bcfe Price-related natural gas production curtailments of 1.2 Bcf in Appalachia Average natural gas prices, after the impact of hedging, of $2.72 per Mcf, down $0.25 per Mcf from the prior year Average oil prices, after the impact of hedging, of $59.79 per Bbl, up $5.08 per Bbl from the prior year Weather in Utility segment's Pennsylvania utility service territory 15.9% colder than last year\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTS\nRonald J. Tanski, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel Gas Company, stated: “Our 2018 fiscal year is off to a strong start. Operationally, our Utility and Pipeline and Storage subsidiaries entered the winter heating season prepared to provide our customers and service territories with safe and reliable natural gas services. As expected, operating income in our Exploration and Production segment dipped as older natural gas sales and hedge contracts with more favorable prices continued to expire and production in Seneca’s Eastern Development Area followed its normal production curve. After adding a second rig in 2017 and, in January, connecting the first new Marcellus pad in our Eastern Development Area since 2016, we expect production to increase in the second quarter as we resume our targeted path of measured production growth.\n“Perhaps the biggest development in the quarter was the passing of federal tax reform, which we believe will positively impact our business, our shareholders, and our customers. The reduction in the federal tax rate should increase the Company’s earnings and cash flows over the long-term, freeing up shareholder capital to be reinvested into growing our business. We also expect the reduction in the federal tax rate will ultimately benefit our utility and pipeline and storage customers, as well as thousands of Western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania residents and businesses. We look forward to working with our regulators to evaluate the impact of these positive changes.”\nDISCUSSION OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX REFORM\nOn December 22, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the 2017 Tax Reform Act) was enacted, which made significant changes to the taxation of business entities and included provisions that materially impacted the Company’s financial statements. The most significant change was the reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. As a fiscal year tax payer, the Company is required to use a blended statutory federal tax rate of 24.5 percent for fiscal 2018, including the first quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s income will be taxed at the new 21 percent statutory federal tax rate in fiscal 2019 and beyond.\nExcluding the impact on deferred income taxes (discussed below), the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate from 35 percent to 24.5 percent resulted in a benefit of $13.9 million, or $0.16 per share, on the Company’s consolidated first quarter earnings. Consistent with utility rate treatment implemented after previous federal tax reforms, the Company recorded a $6.0 million regulatory refund provision ($4.4 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share) that reduced the Utility segment’s operating revenues and deferred the net effect of the reduction in tax rates by increasing the segment’s regulatory liability. The following summarizes the impact of the federal tax rate reduction, excluding the impact on deferred income taxes, on first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings by segment:\n(in millions) Benefit of\nTax Rate\nReduction Regulatory\nRefund\nProvision Net Benefit on\nQ1 FY18\nEarnings Exploration and Production $ 4.1 $ — $ 4.1 Pipeline and Storage 3.5 — 3.5 Gathering 1.6 — 1.6 Utility 4.4 (4.4 ) — Energy Marketing 0.2 — 0.2 Corporate and All Other 0.1 — 0.1 Total Company $ 13.9 $ (4.4 ) $ 9.5 Additionally, the Company’s deferred income taxes were remeasured as of September 30, 2017, based on the new statutory federal tax rate. For non-rate regulated activities, the net decrease in the Company’s deferred income tax liability was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense, benefiting first quarter earnings by $111.0 million, or $1.29 per share. For the rate regulated activities of the Utility and Pipeline and Storage segments, the change in deferred income taxes was recorded as a $65.7 million decrease in recoverable future taxes and a $271.0 million increase in taxes refundable to customers. The 2017 Tax Reform Act includes provisions that stipulate how excess deferred income taxes related to certain accelerated depreciation benefits, which make up substantially all of the regulatory liability, are to be passed back to customers. Potential refunds of other deferred income taxes will be determined by the federal and state regulatory agencies. The following summarizes the impact and regulatory accounting treatment of the remeasurement of deferred income taxes by segment:\n(in millions) Decrease /\n(Increase) in\nIncome Tax Decrease in\nRecoverable\nFuture Taxes Increase in\nTaxes\nRefundable to\nCustomers Net Reduction\nof Deferred\nIncome Taxes Exploration and Production $ 77.3 $ — $ — $ 77.3 Pipeline and Storage 14.1 4.4 141.0 159.5 Gathering 34.9 — — 34.9 Utility — 61.3 130.0 191.3 Energy Marketing (0.2 ) — — (0.2 ) Corporate and All Other (15.1 ) — — (15.1 ) Total Company $ 111.0 $ 65.7 $ 271.0 $ 447.7 The 2017 Tax Reform Act also repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and provides that the Company’s existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in fiscal 2019. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $92 million of AMT credit carryovers that are expected to be utilized by or refunded to the Company between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2022.\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS BY SEGMENT\nThe following discussion of the earnings of each segment is summarized in a tabular form on pages 8 and 9 of this report. It may be helpful to refer to those tables while reviewing this discussion. Note that management defines Adjusted EBITDA as reported GAAP earnings before the following items: interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, interest and other income, impairments, and other items reflected in operating income that impact comparability.\nUpstream Business\nExploration and Production Segment\nThe Exploration and Production segment operations are carried out by Seneca Resources Corporation (\"Seneca\"). Seneca explores for, develops and produces natural gas and oil reserves, primarily in Pennsylvania and California.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (in thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 Variance Net Income $ 106,698 $ 35,080 $ 71,618 Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $ 1.24 $ 0.41 $ 0.83 Adjusted EBITDA $ 79,495 $ 102,476 $ (22,981 ) Excluding the impact of federal tax reform as discussed on page 2, earnings for the Exploration and Production segment declined $9.8 million, as the positive impact of higher realized crude oil prices was more than offset by lower natural gas and crude oil production and a decline in realized natural gas prices.\nSeneca’s first quarter net production was 40.1 billion cubic feet equivalent (“Bcfe”), a decrease of 4.8 Bcfe, or 11 percent, from the prior year, and a decrease of 0.2 Bcfe, or 1 percent, versus the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter. Net natural gas production decreased 4.5 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) versus the prior year due mainly to natural declines from Marcellus wells in the Eastern Development Area (“EDA”) where the Company last brought on a new development pad in fiscal 2016, offset partially by higher net production in the Western Development Area (“WDA”) from new Marcellus and Utica wells completed and connected to sales during the past year. As a result of depressed local daily spot prices in Pennsylvania, Seneca voluntarily curtailed an estimated 1.2 Bcf of net natural gas production during the first quarter.\nSeneca’s oil production decreased 48 thousand barrels (\"Mbbl\"), or 7 percent, versus the prior year and was relatively flat when compared to the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter. The year over year decrease in production was largely due to the lagging impact of a significant reduction in well workover activity in California over the last few years in response to low crude oil prices, as well as modifications made to steam operations at the Midway Sunset fields. Over the past two quarters, Seneca has seen a steady improvement in production levels at North and South Midway Sunset as the Company has recently increased workover activity and the fields continue to respond favorably to steaming operations. Seneca also temporarily shut-in production at its Sespe field in Ventura County, California for a short period due to the wildfires that affected the region during the quarter.\nSeneca's average realized natural gas price, after the impact of hedging and all marketing and transportation costs, was $2.72 per thousand cubic feet (\"Mcf\"), a decrease of $0.25 per Mcf from the prior year. The decline in Seneca’s realized natural gas price is primarily attributable to the expiration of physical firm sales and financial hedge contracts over the past 12 months that had favorable pricing relative to current market prices and hedge book. Seneca's average realized oil price, after the impact of hedging, was $59.79 per barrel (\"Bbl\"), an increase of $5.08 per Bbl. The improvement in oil price realizations was due primarily to higher market prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil during the quarter and stronger price differentials relative to WTI at local sales points in California.\nLease operating and transportation expense (“LOE”) was relatively flat when compared to the prior year as the impact of lower natural gas production in Appalachia, which resulted in lower gathering and other variable operating costs, was offset by an increase in well workover activities as well as higher steam volumes at South Midway Sunset in California. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense decreased $1.6 million as the impact of lower production was slightly offset by a higher per unit DD&A rate, which increased by $0.03 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (“Mcfe”) to $0.68 per Mcfe due mainly to a higher depletable fixed asset balance at December 31, 2017.\nMidstream Businesses\nPipeline and Storage Segment\nThe Pipeline and Storage segment’s operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (“Supply Corporation”) and Empire Pipeline, Inc. (“Empire”). The Pipeline and Storage segment provides natural gas transportation and storage services to affiliated and non-affiliated companies through an integrated system of pipelines and underground natural gas storage fields in western New York and Pennsylvania.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (in thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 Variance Net Income $ 38,462 $ 19,368 $ 19,094 Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $ 0.45 $ 0.23 $ 0.22 Adjusted EBITDA $ 50,773 $ 48,014 $ 2,759 Excluding the impacts of federal tax reform as discussed on page 2, the Pipeline and Storage segment’s earnings increased $1.5 million due to lower Operation and Maintenance (“O&M”) expense, which was partially offset by an increase in DD&A expense. O&M expense decreased $2.9 million compared to the prior year first quarter due mostly to lower pension and post-retirement benefit expenses and a decrease in the reserve for preliminary engineering costs on projects in development.\nGathering Segment\nThe Gathering segment’s operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Midstream Corporation’s subsidiary limited liability companies. The Gathering segment constructs, owns and operates natural gas gathering pipelines and compression facilities in the Appalachian region which currently delivers Seneca’s gross Appalachian production to the interstate pipeline system.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (in thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 Variance Net Income $ 45,400 $ 10,981 $ 34,419 Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $ 0.53 $ 0.13 $ 0.40 Adjusted EBITDA $ 20,731 $ 25,101 $ (4,370 ) Excluding the impacts of federal tax reform as discussed on page 2, the Gathering segment’s earnings decreased $2.0 million versus the prior year first quarter due mainly to lower operating revenues. Operating revenues declined $4.0 million due primarily to lower throughput from Seneca, which decreased by 7.4 Bcf versus the prior year. Most of the decrease in throughput occurred on Midstream Corporation’s Covington (Tioga Co., Pa.) and Trout Run (Lycoming Co., Pa.) gathering systems, which serve producing areas where Seneca did not add any new wells over the last year and have been subject to price-related production curtailments. In 2017, Seneca resumed development activities on its Lycoming Co., Pa. acreage. Production from new wells is expected to help increase Trout Run system throughput starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nDownstream Businesses\nUtility Segment\nThe Utility segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (“Distribution”), which sells or transports natural gas to customers located in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (in thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 Variance Net Income $ 20,993 $ 21,175 $ (182 ) Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $ 0.24 $ 0.25 $ (0.01 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 46,985 $ 52,331 $ (5,346 ) Excluding the impact of federal tax reform as discussed on page 2, the Utility segment’s earnings were relatively flat versus the prior year as the impact of colder weather and new customer rates in Distribution’s New York service territory (effective in April 2017) was offset by an increase in O&M expense. Weather in Distribution’s Pennsylvania service territory was 15.9 percent colder on average than last year, resulting in higher residential and transportation customer throughput and revenues. In New York, the impact of weather variations on earnings is largely mitigated by that jurisdiction’s weather normalization clause. O&M expense increased nearly $1.0 million due mainly to higher amortization of environmental remediation costs that resulted from the April 2017 rate case order in New York.\nEnergy Marketing Segment\nThe Energy Marketing segment's operations are carried out by National Fuel Resources, Inc. (“NFR”). NFR markets natural gas to industrial, wholesale, commercial, public authority, and residential customers primarily in western and central New York and northwestern Pennsylvania, offering competitively priced natural gas to its customers.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (in thousands except per share amounts) 2017 2016 Variance Net Income $ 1,046 $ 1,782 $ (736 ) Net Income Per Share (Diluted) $ 0.01 $ 0.02 $ (0.01 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,680 $ 2,846 $ (1,166 ) The $0.7 million decrease in the Energy Marketing segment’s first quarter earnings was primarily attributable to lower customer margins. NFR’s customer margins were negatively impacted by stronger natural gas prices at local purchase points relative to NYMEX-based customer sales contracts.\nCorporate and All Other\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Corporate and All Other category had a net loss of $13.9 million compared to net income of $0.5 million in the prior year first quarter. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to the non-cash $15.1 million loss recorded to remeasure certain deferred tax assets resulting from federal tax reform.\nGUIDANCE\nNational Fuel is revising its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance to $3.20 to $3.40 per share, or $3.30 per share at the midpoint of the range. The revised earnings guidance does not include the impact of the remeasurement of deferred income taxes resulting from the 2017 Tax Reform Act, which reduced the Company’s consolidated income tax expense and benefited earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 by $111.0 million, or $1.29 per share. While the Company expects to record additional adjustments to its deferred income taxes as a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act during the remaining nine months of fiscal 2018, the amounts of these and other potential adjustments are not reasonably determinable at this time. The final determination of the impact of the income tax effects of certain items will require additional analysis and further interpretation of the 2017 Tax Reform Act from yet to be issued U.S. Treasury regulations, state income tax guidance, federal and state regulatory guidance, and technical corrections. Some or all of these factors may be significant. Because the amounts of final adjustments are not reasonably determinable at this time, the Company is unable to provide earnings guidance other than on a non-GAAP basis that excludes the impact of the remeasurement of deferred income taxes and other potential adjustments.\nThe revised earnings guidance range reflects the impact of actual results for the three months ended December 31, 2017, the impact of lower federal income tax rates on fiscal 2018 income, and other updates to key forecast assumptions, including revisions to the Exploration and Production segment’s forecasted production, natural gas and oil pricing, and operating expense assumptions, as outlined in the table below.\nThe Exploration and Production segment’s fiscal 2018 forecasted production was reduced by 5 Bcfe at the midpoint of the range to reflect first quarter actual production, which was negatively impacted by 1.2 Bcf of voluntary price-related natural gas curtailments and approximately 2 Bcf of unforecasted operational natural gas curtailments, and adjustments made to Seneca’s operations schedule in Appalachia that pushed a portion of fiscal 2018 production to fiscal 2019.\nExcluding the impact of the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, the Company expects that the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate from 35 percent to 24.5 percent will lower the Company’s effective income tax rate for fiscal 2018 to approximately 27 percent. Furthermore, consistent with utility rate treatment implemented after previous tax reforms, the Company expects to record a regulatory refund provision of approximately $16.0 million in fiscal 2018 to reduce the Utility segment’s operating revenues and defer the net effect of the reduction in tax rates by increasing the segment’s regulatory liability. The Company recorded a $6.0 million ($4.4 million after-tax) regulatory refund provision in the first quarter. The Company’s earnings guidance, including the impact from the Utility segment’s projected regulatory refund provision, assumes normal weather.\nAdditional details on the Company's forecast assumptions and business segment guidance for fiscal 2018 are outlined in the table below.\nUpdated FY 2018 Guidance Previous FY 2018 Guidance Consolidated Earnings per Share (1) $3.20 to $3.40 $2.75 to $3.05 Consolidated Effective Tax Rate (1) ~27% ~38% Capital Expenditures (Millions) Exploration and Production (2) $300 - $330 $275 - $325 Pipeline and Storage $110 - $140 $110 - $140 Gathering $60 - $80 $60 - $80 Utility $90 - $100 $90 - $100 Consolidated Capital Expenditures $560 - $650 $535 - $645 Exploration & Production Segment Guidance Commodity Price Assumptions NYMEX natural gas price $3.00 /MMBtu $3.00 /MMBtu Appalachian basin spot price (winter/summer) $2.40/$2.00 /MMBtu $2.40 /MMBtu NYMEX (WTI) crude oil price $60.00 /Bbl $50.00 /Bbl California oil price (% of WTI) 98% 95% Production (Bcfe) East Division - Appalachia (3) 160 to 175 165 to 180 West Division - California ~ 20 ~ 20 Total Production 180 to 195 185 to 200 E&P Operating Costs ($/Mcfe) LOE $0.90 - $1.00 $0.90 - $1.00 G&A $0.30 - $0.35 $0.30 - $0.35 DD&A ~ $0.70 $0.65 - $0.70 Other Business Segment Guidance (Millions) Gathering Segment Revenues $110 - $120 $115 - $125 Pipeline and Storage Segment Revenues ~$295 ~$295 Utility Segment Regulatory Refund Provision ~$16 $0\n(1) Excludes earnings impact of the remeasurement of deferred income taxes resulting from the 2017 Tax Reform Act.\n(2) Net of conveyance proceeds received from joint development partner for working interest in joint development wells.\n(3) Seneca East Division - Appalachia production guidance assumes approximately 17.5 Bcf of spot sales in FY18.\nEARNINGS TELECONFERENCE\nThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, February 2, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss this announcement.
