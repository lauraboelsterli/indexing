    "text": "EditorsNote: rewords sixth and eighth grafs\nNazem Kadri recorded his fourth career hat trick and a career-high five points as the Toronto Maple Leafs finished their five-game homestand sweep with a 6-3 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday.\nPatrick Marleau had a goal and two assists, and Dominic Moore and Mitch Marner also scored for Toronto (35-19-5).\nNick Foligno tallied twice and had three points for the Blue Jackets (29-24-4), and Jack Johnson scored a goal. Alexander Wennberg had two assists.\nToronto goaltender Frederik Andersen recorded 54 saves. Joonas Korpisalo had 22 saves for Columbus.\nThe victory was the fifth straight for the Maple Leafs and sixth straight at home. They have won nine of their last 10 overall.\nThe Blue Jackets, playing the second of back-to-back games, had at least 50 shots on goal for the third straight game, the first time an NHL team accomplished the feat since the 1967-68 season.\nMoore took a banked pass off the side boards from Roman Polak, skated through the right circle and flipped a backhander over Korpisalo for his fifth goal of the season at 4:38 of the first period.\nKadri had a loose puck bounce his way three minutes later, and he sent a shot past Korpisalo on the glove side for his 19th goal and a 2-0 Toronto lead at 7:36.\nFoligno skated through the slot and slipped a backhander over Andersenâ€™s glove at 18:21 of the first period for his 12th goal, trimming the deficit to 2-1. He then scored his second at 2:25 of the second on a pass from Wennberg to tie it 2-2.\nKadri answered by scoring his second after finishing a nifty passing play. He one-timed a slick pass from Morgan Rielly at 8:03 to give Toronto a 3-2 edge.\nKadri fed Marner on a two-on-one for his 13th goal and a 4-2 lead at 10:17 of the second period, then Johnson rang a slap shot in off the post for his third goal at 14:35.\nMarner skidded a fine pass to Kadri for his 21st goal at 11:21 of the third to complete the hat trick. Marleau added an empty-netter.\nToronto defenseman Jake Gardiner left after the first period with a lower-body injury and did not return.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
