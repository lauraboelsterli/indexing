    "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate flew to Norway on the final leg of a Nordic trip on Thursday, and stepped out onto a red carpet laid out over a blanket of snow.\nThey were greeted by the country’s Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit at Oslo’s Gardermoen Airport and went on to meet well-wishers waving Union Jacks in the winter cold.\nWilliam and Kate - expecting their third child in April - toured a children’s sculpture park at the start of their two-day trip and were due to visit the Ski Museum, dedicated to Norway’s national sport.\nSlideshow (8 Images) They were also expected to meet students to discuss mental health - an issue that William and his brother Harry have campaigned on in the past.\nPrince William, second-in-line to the throne, is also a relative of Norway’s King Harald, as both descend from Britain’s Queen Victoria.\nBritain is Norway’s largest export market through its purchases of natural gas.\nReporting by Oslo newsroom; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ",
