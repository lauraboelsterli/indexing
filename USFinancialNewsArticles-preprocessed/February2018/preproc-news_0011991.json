    "text": "February 5, 2018 / 12:50 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Garcia denies racially abusing Barca's Umtiti Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBARCELONA (Reuters) - Espanyol striker Sergio Garcia has denied Spanish media reports that he racially abused Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti during the Catalan derby on Sunday. \nGarcia became embroiled in a heated argument with the French centre back on the pitch in the 1-1 draw at the RCDE Stadium in Cornella. \n“First of all to clarify, I already spoke with Samuel yesterday,” Garcia said on Instagram below a picture of the two players. \n”In no way was it my intention to be racist. You all know my wife is from gypsy roots and I grew up in a neighbourhood with every race in the world. \n“My brother-in-law, who I have a firm friendship with, is African-American too. In the tension of the game a lot of things are said that should stay on the pitch.” \nSpanish media said Barca defender Gerard Pique had to separate a furious Umtiti from Garcia, who later came to the Barcelona dressing-room to make peace with his opponent. \nPique’s 82nd-minute goal earned Barcelona a point after Gerard Moreno headed home Garcia’s cross to give Espanyol the lead in a feisty derby played on a waterlogged pitch.
