    "text": "One clear principle runs through President Donald Trump 's emerging economic policy: Debt is good.\nWhen defending a tax plan or laying out his budget, the man who once called himself \"the king of debt\" is trying to persuade Americans there's no price to pay for running trillion dollar budget deficits over the next few years. Stronger economic growth will permanently follow the borrowing spree, officials argue, even as many economists and investors already warn about what could happen when the debt becomes due.\nThe White House budget plan released Monday is the latest example of the Trump principle. The budget proposal not only envisions soaring deficits through 2020, but it also outlines an infrastructure plan that would encourage state and local government to borrow heavily. The result, the plan suggests, would be exceptional growth that would then cause deficits to fall. The proposal assumes economic growth will climb above 3 percent and eventually settle into a solid 2.8 percent groove.\nshow chapters ",
