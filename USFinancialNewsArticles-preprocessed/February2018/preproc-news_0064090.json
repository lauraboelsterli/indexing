    "text": "LAREDO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International Bancshares Corporation (NASDAQ:IBOC), one of the largest independent bank holding companies in Texas, today reported annual net income for 2017 of $157.4 million or $2.36 diluted earnings per common share ( $2.38 per share basic) compared to $133.9 million or $2.02 diluted earnings per common share ( $2.03 per share basic), which represents a 17.6 percent increase in net income and a 16.8 percent increase in diluted earnings per share over the corresponding period in 2016. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $45.2 million or $.68 diluted earnings per common share ( $.69 per share basic) for the same period in 2016, compared to $35.5 million or $.53 diluted earnings per common share ( $.54 per share basic), representing an increase of 27.3 percent in net income and a 28.3 percent increase in diluted earnings per share.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted by a decrease in the provision for probable loan losses compared to 2016 and a tax refund received in the second quarter of 2017. The provision for probable loan losses decreased as a result of a decrease in the historical loss experience in the commercial category of the allowance for probable loan loss calculation. Net income was also positively impacted by a tax refund of $4.9 million received in the second quarter as a result of an amended tax return for the 2012 tax year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a charge of $5.8 million, $3.7 million after tax, taken by the lead bank subsidiary in connection with the termination of its long-term repurchase agreements outstanding in order to help manage its long-term funding costs, recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\nInternational Bancshares Corporation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Summary Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nInterest income $ 415,136 $ 387,914 Interest expense (38,931 ) (43,129 ) Net interest income 376,205 344,785 Provision for probable loan losses (11,221 ) (19,859 ) Non-interest income 150,406 161,702 Non-interest expense (293,748 ) (289,625 ) Income before income taxes 221,642 197,003 Income taxes (64,206 ) (63,071 ) Net income $ 157,436 $ 133,932 Net income per common share Basic $ 2.38 $ 2.03 Diluted $ 2.36 $ 2.02 “I’m pleased with the Company’s exceptional earnings success for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.
