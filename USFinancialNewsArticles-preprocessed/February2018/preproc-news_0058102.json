    "text": "COVENTRY, England (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Monday that Britain must be able to influence the European Union’s trade deals if the country signs up to a new customs union with the bloc after Brexit.\nAnswering questions after giving a speech setting out Labour’s stance on Brexit, Corbyn also said Britain needed a customs union deal with the EU to ensure there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nReporting by Andrew MacAskill and Alistair Smout, writing by Andy Bruce, editing by William Schomberg\n ",
