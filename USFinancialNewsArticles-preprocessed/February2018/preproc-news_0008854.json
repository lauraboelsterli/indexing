    "text": "Weight Watchers will offer teens aged 13 to 17 free memberships this summer as part of its plan to help 10 million people adopt healthy habits and grow its revenue to more than $2 billion. \nThe company \"intends to be a powerful partner for families in establishing healthy habits\" so it will offer free memberships to help \"the development of healthy habits at a critical life stage,\" it said in a press release ahead of its global employee event on Wednesday.\nTrying to lure 13-year-olds into a diet program is sure to spark backlash. Advocates have pushed to improve body image among teens, especially teenaged girls. \n\"Our goal is to help those who need healthy habits to develop them at this critical life-stage,\" a spokeswoman said. \"For a six-week period this summer, teens will be able to join Weight Watchers for free. They will be required to go to one of our meeting locations for their parent/guardian to provide consent, as we know that a family-based approach is critical for kids.\"\n\"We'll share more specific criteria and guidelines when we launch the program,\" the spokeswoman added. \"We think there's a real opportunity to make an impact on a problem that is not currently being addressed effectively.\"\nWeight Watchers is rebranding itself as a company whose purpose is \"inspiring healthy habits for real life,\" CEO Mindy Grossman said Wednesday. The move mirrors a trend in the health and wellness industry toward overall wellness as people shun diets.\nWeight Watchers recently unveiled WWFreeStyle with spokeswoman Oprah Winfrey. The new plan is more flexible than previous programs. Carb-cutting plan Atkins announced a similar approach last month.\nWeight Watchers also announced Wednesday it would remove artificial ingredients from its branded food products. \nShares of Weight Watchers soared 15 percent on Wednesday. They've surged about 490 percent over the last year.",
