    "text": "CNBC.com Bloomberg | Getty Images Antonio Neri, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprises speaks at the HP Discover 2017 Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise shares skyrocketed as much as 19 percent on Thursday after the company reported first quarter financial results that blasted past analysts' expectations on top and bottom lines. \nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: 34 cents vs. 22 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $7.7 billion vs. $7.07 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters \nThe company also saw growth in revenue from servers and networking — two areas analysts thought might drag on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's top line. \nHPE reported storage revenue increased by 24 percent year-over-year, while DC networking revenue grew by 27 percent since last year. \nThe company's financial services sector, which has excelled in the past year, also saw revenue increase by about eight percent. \nIn the year-ago quarter, HPE reported earnings of 28 cents per share, adjusted, on revenues of $6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. \nUnder new CEO Antonio Neri, Hewlett Packard Enterprises announced its intention to join the growing list of companies offering tax reform-based incentives to employees. \n\"Given the recent tax reform in the U.S., which will provide easier access to off-shore cash, we are increasing our shareholder return commitment and our investment in employees,\" Neri said in a statement. \nNeri said the company will increase the matching contribution to qualifying employees' 401(k) programs, and invest in degree assistance programs for employees worldwide. \nShareholders will benefit, too. \nThe company plans to offer $7 billion in share repurchases and dividends to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2019 \nHPE issued strong earnings guidance for the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2018. \nFor the second quarter, HPE expects EPS of 29 to 33 cents versus 26 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise's outlook for full year earnings proved stronger than Wall Street's, as well. HPE forecast a range of $1.35 to $1.45 EPS for fiscal 2018, whereas analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of $1.18. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise's report comes at a key moment for the company. \nCEO Meg Whitman stepped down February 1, handing over the reins to the president and veteran executive Antonio Neri, making the company's first quarter her last. When Whitman announced her impending departure in November, shares tanked 6 percent, despite an earnings beat. \nWhitman, who served as CEO since 2011, oversaw the company's split into two brands. She remained CEO at the newly streamlined Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where she prioritized cloud services and spun off product and consumer hardware to HP. Her tenure at HPE saw a ramping up of acquisitions — eight in the last two years. Chloe Aiello News Associate for CNBC.com Related Securities ",
