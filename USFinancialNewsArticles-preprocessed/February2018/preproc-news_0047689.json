    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HALO), a biotechnology company developing novel oncology and drug-delivery therapies, today reported financial results and recent highlights for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"Building on a truly transformative year in 2017, we begin 2018 executing against a strong portfolio of new ENHANZE collaborations,\" said Dr. Helen Torley, president and chief executive officer. \"With Janssen now studying Darzalex ® SC in four Phase 3 trials, Roche recently initiating a Phase 1 study with ENHANZE and multiple targets projected to enter the clinic in the coming quarters, we have good line of sight to our goal of having six targets in clinical development by year-end, doubling the number of targets in the clinic from 2017.\n\"In our oncology pillar, we continue to project achieving the target number of progression-free survival events in HALO-301 late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, we are making good progress in our exploration of the pan-tumor potential of PEGPH20 and look forward to sharing response-rate data from our combination studies with Halaven ® and potentially with Keytruda ® in the second half of the year. We begin 2018 in a strong position with multiple value-generating opportunities ahead for patients, the company and for shareholders.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Recent Highlights include:\nJanssen expanding its development program for the subcutaneous formulation of DARZALEX (daratumumab) with six planned and ongoing clinical studies. Halozyme's ENHANZE technology has the potential to enable a 15-ml injection to be delivered in five minutes or less. The ongoing or planned trials in patients with Amyloidosis, Smoldering Myeloma and Multiple Myeloma include four Phase 3 studies, one Phase 2 study and one Phase 1 study.\nRoche initiating a Phase 1 study of an undisclosed target with Halozyme's ENHANZE drug-delivery technology.\nAlexion announcing plans to initiate a Phase 1 trial in 2018 to study a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 (ALXN1210 SC) with ENHANZE.\nBaxalta and Roche achieving commercial milestones for products using ENHANZE triggering $5 million and $7 million in respective milestone payments.\nContinued progress screening and enrolling patients in the HALO-301 study of PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE ® (nab-paclitaxel) and gemcitabine in first-line metastatic pancreas cancer patients with high levels of tumor hyaluronan (HA-High). An interim analysis will be conducted for the first primary endpoint of progression-free survival when the target number of events has been reached, which the company continues to project will be in late Q4.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the fourth quarter was $189.6 million compared to $39 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was driven by $101.4 million recognized upon the effective date of the BMS collaboration, a $15 million milestone payment from Janssen, a $40 million upfront payment from Alexion and growth in royalties from partner sales of Herceptin ® (trastuzumab) SC, MabThera ® (rituximab) SC and HYQVIA ® (Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase), offset by a decrease in research and development reimbursements. Revenue for the fourth quarter included $17.7 million in royalties, an increase of 24 percent from the prior-year period, $8.4 million in sales of bulk rHuPH20 primarily for use in manufacturing collaboration products and $4.2 million in HYLENEX ® recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection) product sales.\nRevenue for the full year was $316.6 million, compared to $146.7 million in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter were $41.4 million, compared to $41.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the full year were $150.6 million, compared to $150.8 million in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $14.8 million, compared to $12.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to personnel expenses, including stock compensation, for the period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $53.8 million, compared to $45.9 million in 2016.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $123.9 million, or $0.85 per share, compared to net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $27.4 million, or $0.21 per share.\nNet income for the full year was $63 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to a net loss of $103 million in 2016, or $0.81 per share.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $469.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $316.9 million at September 30, 2017.\nFinancial Outlook for 2018\nHalozyme reiterated its financial guidance of:\nNet revenue of $115 million to $125 million, including 25% to 30% royalty growth;\nOperating expenses of $230 million to $240 million;\nOperating cash burn of $75 million to $85 million; and\nYear-end cash balance of $305 million to $315 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nHalozyme will webcast its Quarterly Update Conference Call for the fourth quarter of 2017 today, Tuesday, February 20 at 4:30 p.m. ET/1:30 p.m. PT.
