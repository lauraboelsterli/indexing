    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coeur Mining, Inc. (“Coeur” or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CDE) today reported full-year 2017 net income of $10.9 million, or $0.06 per share, and cash flow from operating activities of $197.2 million, an increase of over 100% compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA 1 rose 4% year-over-year to $203.3 million, and free cash flow 1 increased $85.5 million to $60.4 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company generated net income of $14.3 million, or $0.08 per share, and cash flow from operating activities more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, increasing $54.5 million to $91.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA 1 and free cash flow 1 of $77.0 million and $44.8 million, respectively, increased approximately fivefold compared to the prior quarter.\nStrong fourth quarter and full-year financial results were driven by record silver equivalent 1 production of 10.8 million ounces (11.7 million ounces including discontinued operations) and 35.1 million ounces (39.4 million ounces including discontinued operations), respectively, lower costs from the Company's continuing operations, and decreases in working capital. Lower average debt levels and interest rates led to a 56% reduction in full-year interest expense, which also contributed to improved full-year financial results.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its wholly-owned Bolivian subsidiary, which owns and operates the San Bartolomé mine. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter. As a result, the mine is presented as a discontinued operation and excluded from consolidated operating statistics and financial results for all periods presented unless otherwise noted. In 2017, San Bartolomé produced 4.3 million ounces of silver at adjusted costs applicable to sales (\"CAS\") per silver ounce 1 of $17.17.\n\"Coeur's robust operating performance during the fourth quarter led to strong financial results for the quarter and full year. Our multi-year strategic initiatives are generating higher-quality ounces and strong cash flow from our well-balanced portfolio of North American-based assets,\" said Mitchell J. Krebs, Coeur's President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\"During 2017, we successfully repositioned and strengthened the Company on multiple fronts. We upgraded our portfolio and pipeline of assets to reflect a North American focus with the acquisition of the high-grade Silvertip mine in Canada, our announced divestiture of our highest cost mine in Bolivia and the sales of nine non-core assets. We repositioned our balance sheet to provide greater financial flexibility and materially reduce annual interest expense. By allocating additional capital to near-mine exploration, we expanded our reserve and resource base by double digit percentage increases, which we anticipate will lead to high-return, long-term value for our stockholders.\"\nHighlights\nRecord fourth quarter and full-year silver equivalent 1 production - Fourth quarter and full-year production from continuing operations increased 26% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year, respectively, to 10.8 million and 35.1 million silver equivalent ounces (\"AgEqOz\") 1 . Higher fourth quarter production was driven by 45% and 26% increases in silver equivalent 1 production at the Rochester and Palmarejo mines, respectively, and a 27% increase in gold production at the Kensington mine. Record full-year production was driven primarily by the Palmarejo mine, where 2017 silver equivalent 1 production rose 64% compared to 2016 Improved cost performance from continuing operations - Companywide adjusted all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") per average spot AgEqOz 1 for the fourth quarter decreased 17% quarter-over-quarter to $12.26 and were relatively flat for the full year at $13.82, despite higher diesel and consumables costs during both periods. Palmarejo's fourth quarter and full-year adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 were $6.64 and $8.38, respectively, with fourth quarter unit costs decreasing 24% quarter-over-quarter and 34% year-over-year and full-year unit costs declining 12% compared to 2016 Solid execution of key capital projects - In 2017, Coeur completed or achieved major milestones on key capital projects at Palmarejo, Rochester and Kensington. At Palmarejo, the Company reached its target mining rate of 4,500 tons per day one quarter ahead of schedule following a multi-year development and ramp-up period. Rochester's Stage IV leach pad expansion was commissioned on schedule in the third quarter after three years of permitting and ten months of construction. During the third quarter, the Company began mining the high-grade Jualin deposit at Kensington following two years of underground development Continued portfolio enhancements - During the fourth quarter, Coeur completed its acquisition of the Silvertip mine, which is expected to provide Coeur with high-margin, low-cost production, near-term cash flow, and long-term exploration potential in a low-risk, mining-friendly jurisdiction. In December 2017, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to divest the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia. The Company's prior acquisition of Wharf in early 2015 has already generated a return on investment of approximately 20% 3 . Coeur also completed the sale of nine non-core assets during the year for total consideration of approximately $40 million Expanded exploration program generating strong returns - Coeur's total exploration investment increased 66% in 2017 to $41.9 million, including $30.3 million of expensed exploration and $11.6 million of capitalized exploration, and contributed to a 10% increase to silver equivalent 1 reserves, net of depletion, from continuing operations compared to year-end 2016. The largest net increases of 36%, 17% and 5% were achieved at Wharf, Palmarejo and Kensington, respectively, with reserves in the United States now accounting for 73% of total reserves. Measured and indicated silver equivalent 1 resources increased 42% compared to the prior year, while inferred silver equivalent 1 resources increased 45% Meaningful balance sheet improvements achieved - The Company accomplished key balance sheet initiatives during 2017 beginning with the successful refinancing of its 7.875% senior notes due 2021 with 5.875% senior notes due 2024. During the third quarter, Coeur also established a four-year $200 million revolving credit facility, under which the Company drew $100 million to partially fund the Silvertip mine acquisition. Full-year interest expense decreased 56% to $16.4 million from $36.9 million in 2016\n\"As we enter our 90 th year of business, we have strong momentum in positioning Coeur as a leading U.S.-based, North America-focused precious metals mining company,\" continued Mitchell J. Krebs, Coeur's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"2018 should be another pivotal year as we look to commence production at Silvertip by the end of the first quarter, achieve commercial production at Jualin later in the year and sustain our focus on near-mine exploration. We also expect to publish updated technical reports for Rochester and Kensington in the coming weeks and for Silvertip in the second half of the year. Our team continues to do an outstanding job advancing Coeur's strategic priorities, and we look forward to delivering strong results in the coming quarters.\"\nFinancial and Operating Highlights (Unaudited)\nOn December 22, 2017, Coeur announced it had entered into an agreement to divest the San Bartolomé mine through the sale of its 100%-owned Bolivian subsidiary. As a result, San Bartolomé is presented as a discontinued operation and excluded from consolidated operating statistics and financial results for all periods presented unless otherwise noted.\n(Amounts in millions, except per share amounts, gold ounces produced & sold, and per-ounce metrics) 2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Revenue $ 709.6 $ 214.6 $ 159.9 $ 149.5 $ 185.6 $ 571.9 $ 139.2 Costs Applicable to Sales $ 440.3 $ 122.0 $ 101.6 $ 102.2 $ 114.5 $ 335.4 $ 84.9 General and Administrative Expenses $ 33.6 $ 9.2 $ 7.3 $ 7.0 $ 10.1 $ 29.3 $ 6.6 Net Income (Loss) $ 10.9 $ 14.3 $ (11.7 ) $ (10.0 ) $ 18.3 $ 22.4 $ (10.3 ) Net Income (Loss) Per Share $ 0.06 $ 0.08 $ (0.06 ) $ (0.05 ) $ 0.10 $ 0.14 $ (0.06 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 1 $ 4.2 $ 14.1 $ (15.3 ) $ (1.3 ) $ 6.8 $ 15.6 $ 0.9 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 1 Per Share $ 0.02 $ 0.08 $ (0.09 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 0.04 $ 0.10 $ 0.01 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 184.1 187.0 179.3 179.2 183.1 163.5 174.0 EBITDA 1 $ 202.9 $ 69.6 $ 38.6 $ 23.4 $ 71.4 $ 142.6 $ 24.7 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 203.3 $ 77.0 $ 40.2 $ 31.9 $ 54.5 $ 194.9 $ 41.0 Cash Flow from Operating Activities $ 197.2 $ 91.8\n$ 37.3 $ 24.1 $ 43.9 $ 96.5 $ 21.4 Capital Expenditures $ 136.7 $ 47.1\n$ 29.0 $ 37.1 $ 23.6 $ 94.4 $ 28.1 Free Cash Flow 1 $ 60.4 $ 44.8 $ 8.3 $ (13.0 ) $ 20.3 $ (25.1 ) $ (6.7 ) Cash, Equivalents & Short-Term Investments $ 192.0 $ 192.0 $ 195.7 $ 201.0 $ 160.6 $ 118.3 $ 118.3 Total Debt 2 $ 411.3 $ 411.3 $ 288.7 $ 284.6 $ 218.8 $ 210.6 $ 210.6 Average Realized Price Per Ounce – Silver $ 16.96 $ 16.57 $ 16.86 $ 16.95 $ 17.49 $ 17.08 $ 16.72 Average Realized Price Per Ounce – Gold $ 1,204 $ 1,224 $ 1,240 $ 1,206 $ 1,149 $ 1,230 $ 1,170 Silver Ounces Produced 12.1 3.7 3.0 2.7 2.7 9.4 2.6 Gold Ounces Produced 383,086 118,756 93,293 82,819 88,218 358,170 102,500 Silver Equivalent Ounces Produced 1 35.1 10.8 8.6 7.7 8.0 30.8 8.7 Silver Ounces Sold 12.7 3.8 2.9 2.7 3.3 8.9 2.2 Gold Ounces Sold 410,604 123,564 89,972 86,194 110,874 338,131 87,108 Silver Equivalent Ounces Sold 1 37.3 11.1 8.3 7.9 10.0 29.2 7.4 Silver Equivalent Ounces Sold (Average Spot) 1 43.0 13.2 9.7 9.0 11.1 33.6 8.4 Adjusted CAS per AgEqOz 1 $ 10.62 $ 9.43 $ 11.05 $ 12.02 $ 10.60 $ 11.12 $ 11.45 Adjusted CAS per Average Spot AgEqOz 1 $ 9.59 $ 8.35 $ 9.90 $ 10.96 $ 9.79 $ 10.19 $ 10.59 Adjusted CAS per AuEqOz 1 $ 822 $ 800 $ 843 $ 860 $ 791 $ 688 $ 676 Adjusted AISC per AgEqOz 1 $ 15.90 $ 14.45 $ 17.35 $ 17.81 $ 14.78 $ 15.97 $ 16.13 Adjusted AISC per Average Spot AgEqOz 1 $ 13.82 $ 12.26 $ 14.79 $ 15.58 $ 13.30 $ 13.88 $ 14.29 Financial Results\nFourth quarter revenue of $214.6 million increased 34% compared to the prior quarter. Silver sales contributed 30% of revenue during the period and gold sales contributed 70% based on average realized prices of $16.57 and $1,224 per ounce, respectively. For the full year, the Company generated revenue of $709.6 million, 24% higher than in 2016 with silver sales contributing 30% and gold 70%. Averaged realized silver and gold prices for the full year were $16.96 and $1,204 per ounce, respectively, marginally declining compared to 2016. The Company's U.S. operations accounted for approximately 60% of both fourth quarter and full-year revenue.\nAverage realized gold prices during the fourth quarter and full year reflect the sale of 13,740 and 52,124 gold ounces, respectively, pursuant to Palmarejo's gold stream agreement at a price of $800 per ounce.\nCosts applicable to sales were $122.0 million and $440.3 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, representing period-over-period increases of 20% and 31%. These increases were primarily the result of increased ounces sold as well as higher diesel and consumables costs. General and administrative expenses of $9.2 million in the fourth quarter and $33.6 million for the full year were 26% higher quarter-over-quarter and 15% higher year-over-year, respectively, due to higher employee-related expenses and professional service costs.\nFourth quarter interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased 53% from the third quarter to $5.5 million as a result of incremental interest related to the Company's $200 million revolving credit facility (the \"Facility\"), under which $100 million was drawn to partially fund the Silvertip acquisition in October 2017. For the full year, interest expense, net of capitalized interest, decreased 56% to $16.4 million, due primarily to lower average debt levels compared to 2016 and a lower interest rate on the Company's senior notes, which were refinanced in the second quarter of 2017.\nExpensed exploration was $7.5 million for the fourth quarter, bringing full-year expensed exploration to $30.3 million, an increase of $17.4 million, or 135%, year-over-year.\nFourth quarter and full-year capital expenditures increased 62% quarter-over-quarter and 45% year-over-year, respectively, to $47.1 million and $136.7 million, primarily due to $17.7 million of investments made at Silvertip on underground development drilling, mill and infrastructure upgrades and the purchase of new equipment. Full-year capital expenditures were also higher than 2016 levels due to final construction and commissioning of the Stage IV leach pad expansion at Rochester.\nThe acquisition of Silvertip also drove higher fourth quarter and full-year pre-development, reclamation, and other expenses of $6.0 million and $18.9 million, respectively.\nFourth quarter free cash flow 1 was $44.8 million, bringing full-year 2017 free cash flow 1 to $60.4 million. This increase of $85.5 million compared to 2016 was driven by record production and sales, improved companywide unit costs, a significant decrease in working capital, and lower interest expense.\nOperations\nFourth quarter and full-year 2017 results for each of the Company's operations are provided below.\nPalmarejo, Mexico\n(Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Tons milled 1,498,421 389,524 413,086 335,428 360,383 1,078,888 287,569 Average silver grade (oz/t) 5.62 6.92 5.53 4.98 4.91 4.66 4.95 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.09 0.10 0.08 0.08 0.09 0.08 0.09 Average recovery rate – Ag 86.0% 87.0% 83.6% 87.3% 86.5% 88.4% 89.1% Average recovery rate – Au 90.0% 92.0% 83.1% 91.1% 93.7% 86.5% 90.4% Silver ounces produced (000's) 7,242 2,346 1,908 1,457 1,531 4,442 1,269 Gold ounces produced 121,569 37,537 28,948 24,292 30,792 73,913 23,906 Silver equivalent ounces produced 1 (000's) 14,536 4,600 3,644 2,914 3,378 8,877 2,703 Silver ounces sold (000's) 7,586 2,343 1,794 1,484 1,965 3,993 937 Gold ounces sold 131,743 38,953 26,554 25,191 41,045 59,081 15,558 Silver equivalent ounces sold 1 (000's) 15,491 4,681 3,387 2,996 4,427 7,538 1,872 Silver equivalent ounces sold 1 (average spot) (000's) 17,301 5,331 3,809 3,324 4,837 8,305 2,042 Metal sales $274.8 $83.2 $60.7 $53.2 $77.7 $141.3 $32.5 Costs applicable to sales $146.2 $36.0 $33.3 $33.9 $43.0 $80.8 $20.9 Adjusted CAS per AgEqOz 1 $9.36 $7.54 $9.76 $11.21 $9.68 $10.55 $11.01 Adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 $8.38 $6.64 $8.68 $10.11 $8.87 $9.57 $10.11 Exploration expense $11.9 $2.7 $4.5 $3.1 $1.6 $5.1 $2.4 Cash flow from operating activities $139.9 $52.1 $18.5 $18.8 $50.5 $26.7 $(1.7) Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $22.5 $4.9 $6.5 $6.1 $5.0 $22.7 $3.9 Development capital expenditures $7.4 $2.1 $(1.0) $5.1 $1.2 $13.1 $4.2 Total capital expenditures $29.9 $7.0 $5.5 $11.2 $6.2 $35.8 $8.1 Free cash flow (before royalties) $110.0 $45.1 $13.0 $7.6 $44.3 $(9.1) $(9.8) Gold production royalty payments $— $— $— $— $— $27.2 $— Free cash flow 1 $110.0 $45.1 $13.0 $7.6 $44.3 $(36.3) $(9.8) Fourth quarter silver equivalent 1 production increased 26% quarter-over-quarter and 70% year-over-year to 4.6 million ounces. Full-year 2017 silver equivalent 1 production of 14.5 million ounces was above the high-end of the Company's guidance range and represented an increase of 64% over 2016 Increased silver and gold grades during the fourth quarter and full-year resulted from the mining of higher-grade zones at Independencia. Grades are expected to decrease gradually during 2018 Fourth quarter sales of 4.7 million silver equivalent 1 ounces were in-line with production and up 38% quarter-over-quarter, while full-year sales of 15.5 million silver equivalent 1 ounces more than doubled year-over-year due to a reduction in inventory carried over from the fourth quarter of 2016 Fourth quarter adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 of $6.64 were 24% and 34% lower quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, respectively, bringing full-year adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 to $8.38, below the Company's guidance range of $9.00-$9.50 per average spot AgEqOz 1 Full year free cash flow 1 of $110.0 million represented a year-over-year increase of $146.3 million and was driven by higher production, lower unit costs, a reduction in inventory carried over from 2016 and lower development capital expenditures Throughout the year, Palmarejo's exploration program was expanded following positive drill results and the discovery of several new veins. As a consequence, exploration expense of $11.9 million in 2017 more than doubled compared to 2016 Full-year 2018 production is expected to be 6.5 - 7.1 million ounces of silver and 110,000 - 115,000 ounces of gold, or 13.1 - 14.0 million silver equivalent 1 ounces. CAS per AgEqOz 1 is expected to be $10.50 - $11.00 on a 60:1 silver equivalent basis and $9.25 - $9.75 on an average spot equivalent basis With mining rates now at steady-state levels of approximately 4,500 tons per day, 2018 capital expenditures, including capitalized exploration, are expected to be approximately $30 - $35 million\nRochester, Nevada\n(Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Ore tons placed 16,440,270 4,171,451 4,262,011 4,493,100 3,513,708 19,555,998 3,878,487 Average silver grade (oz/t) 0.53 0.50 0.53 0.53 0.58 0.57 0.57 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.003 0.003 0.004 0.003 0.002 0.003 0.002 Silver ounces produced (000's) 4,714 1,361 1,070 1,156 1,127 4,564 1,277 Gold ounces produced 51,051 18,995 10,955 10,745 10,356 50,751 14,231 Silver equivalent ounces produced 1 (000's) 7,777 2,500 1,727 1,801 1,749 7,609 2,131 Silver ounces sold (000's) 4,931 1,457 1,050 1,135 1,289 4,584 1,205 Gold ounces sold 54,642 20,002 10,390 10,658 13,592 49,320 12,988 Silver equivalent ounces sold 1 (000's) 8,210 2,658 1,674 1,774 2,104 7,543 1,984 Silver equivalent ounces sold 1 (average spot) (000's) 8,961 2,969 1,839 1,913 2,240 8,183 2,128 Metal sales $152.7 $49.7 $31.2 $32.8 $39.0 $139.9 $36.2 Costs applicable to sales $107.9 $34.0 $23.3 $24.2 $26.4 $89.7 $23.7 Adjusted CAS per AgEqOz 1 $13.08 $12.77 $13.69 $13.54 $12.57 $11.86 $11.99 Adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 $11.97 $11.37 $12.46 $12.56 $11.81 $10.93 $11.16 Exploration expense $1.4\n$0.5 $0.5 $0.3 $0.1 $0.8 $0.4 Cash flow from operating activities $32.3 $26.1 $1.6 $(1.1) $5.7 $28.4 $7.6 Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $2.7 $0.9 $0.5 $1.1 $0.2 $7.8 $1.5 Development capital expenditures $38.2 $5.9 $9.2 $12.7 $10.4 $8.6 $4.3 Total capital expenditures $40.9 $6.8 $9.7 $13.8 $10.6 $16.4 $5.8 Free cash flow 1 $(8.6) $19.3 $(8.1) $(14.9) $(4.9) $12.0 $1.8 Fourth quarter silver equivalent 1 production increased 45% quarter-over-quarter to 2.5 million ounces, driven by concurrent leaching of the Stage III and Stage IV pads, timing of recoveries from the newly-expanded Stage IV leach pad, and placement of higher gold grade ore during the third and early fourth quarters. Full-year silver equivalent 1 production of 7.8 million ounces was relatively unchanged year-over-year and was near the high-end of the Company's guidance range Adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 for the fourth quarter was $11.37, 9% lower quarter-over-quarter, while adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 for the full-year increased 10% to $11.97. Unit costs were higher compared to 2016 primarily due to pre-stripping activity conducted to access higher-grade ore during the second and third quarters and higher diesel prices compared to 2016 Fourth quarter free cash flow 1 of $19.3 million reflected higher production and lower development capital expenditures. For the full year, the mine generated negative free cash flow 1 of $8.6 million, which reflected higher capital expenditures in 2017 of $40.9 million related to the Stage IV leach pad expansion project Full-year 2018 production is expected to be 4.2 - 4.7 million ounces of silver and 45,000 - 50,000 ounces of gold, or 6.9 - 7.7 million silver equivalent 1 ounces, at CAS per AgEqOz 1 of $13.25 - $13.75 on a 60:1 silver equivalent basis and $12.00 - $12.50 on an average spot equivalent basis Development capital expenditures in 2017 totaled $38.2 million and were predominantly related to the Stage IV leach pad expansion, which was completed and commissioned during the third quarter. As a result, Rochester is expected to generate strong free cash flow 1 in 2018, with capital expenditures of approximately $7 - $15 million\nWharf, South Dakota\n(Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Ore tons placed 4,560,441 1,124,785 1,150,308 993,167 1,292,181 4,268,105 1,178,803 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.027 0.029 0.029 0.024 0.027 0.032 0.027 Gold ounces produced 95,372 27,292 25,849 21,358 20,873 109,175 30,675 Silver ounces produced (000's) 64 16 15 13 20 105 32 Gold equivalent ounces produced 1 96,431 27,560 26,096 21,568 21,207 110,927 31,202 Silver ounces sold (000's) 74 16 14 11 33 95 30 Gold ounces sold 98,237 28,975 23,855 21,314 24,093 108,042 29,698 Gold equivalent ounces sold 1 99,472 29,256 24,085 21,495 24,636 109,620 30,204 Metal sales $125.9 $37.3 $31.3 $27.0 $30.3 $136.7 $35.5 Costs applicable to sales $69.3 $19.9 $17.3 $15.8 $16.3 $66.4 $16.9 Adjusted CAS per AuEqOz 1 $700 $682 $719 $737 $670 $575 $556 Exploration expense $0.3 $0.1 $0.2 $— $— $— $— Cash flow from operating activities $49.6 $17.2 $15.0 $8.8 $8.6 $62.4 $15.4 Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $5.8 $1.6 $1.8 $1.5 $0.9 $4.8 $1.3 Development capital expenditures $3.0 $1.7 $1.3 $— $— $— $— Total capital expenditures $8.8 $3.3 $3.1 $1.5 $0.9 $4.8 $1.3 Free cash flow 1 $40.8 $13.9 $11.9 $7.3 $7.7 $57.6 $14.1 Gold production in the fourth quarter increased 6% quarter-over-quarter to 27,292 ounces, attributable primarily to higher sustained crushing rates and gold grades Full-year gold production of 95,372 ounces was slightly higher than the Company's guidance range. The 13% year-over-year decline resulted from lower grades following completion of mining at the higher-grade Golden Reward deposit during the third quarter, which was mined for an abbreviated season relative to prior years Tons placed in 2017 reached 4.6 million, up from 4.3 million in 2016 and 3.6 million in 2015 Adjusted CAS per AuEqOz 1 declined 5% quarter-over-quarter while full-year adjusted CAS per AuEqOz 1 were $700, at the low end of the Company's guidance range Wharf generated $13.9 million of free cash flow 1 during the quarter, bringing full-year free cash flow 1 to $40.8 million. Since acquiring the operation in February 2015 for $99 million, Wharf has generated $127.2 million of free cash flow 1 In 2018, Coeur expects gold production to be 85,000 - 90,000 ounces at CAS per AuEqOz 1 of $850 - $900 Capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately $4 - $7 million\nKensington, Alaska\n(Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 2017 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 2016 4Q 2016 Tons milled 668,727 167,631 172,038 163,163 165,895 620,209 163,410 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.18 0.22 0.17 0.17 0.17 0.21 0.22 Average recovery rate 93.5% 92.8% 94.1% 93.2% 94.0% 94.7% 94.4% Gold ounces produced 115,094 34,932 27,541 26,424 26,197 124,331 33,688 Gold ounces sold 125,982 35,634 29,173 29,031 32,144 121,688 28,864 Metal sales $154.5 $44.3 $36.6 $35.6 $38.0 $146.6 $34.2 Costs applicable to sales $116.1 $32.0 $27.7 $28.0 $28.4 $96.7 $23.0 Adjusted CAS per AuOz 1 $920 $896 $946 $952 $884 $790 $801 Exploration expense $8.6 $2.8 $3.0 $2.0 $0.8 $3.5 $1.3 Cash flow from operating activities $37.6 $16.8 $9.3 $7.0 $4.5 $50.8 $11.4 Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $20.7 $8.0 $6.5 $3.7 $2.5 $22.8 $8.9 Development capital expenditures $15.5 $4.0 $3.6 $4.9 $3.0 $14.0 $3.7 Total capital expenditures $36.2 $12.0 $10.1 $8.6 $5.5 $36.8 $12.6 Free cash flow 1 $1.4 $4.8 $(0.8) $(1.6) $(1.0) $14.0 $(1.2) Fourth quarter gold production increased 27% quarter-over-quarter to 34,932 ounces, Kensington's highest quarterly production since the fourth quarter of 2013. This resulted primarily from mining the higher-grade Raven zone, which drove average grades 29% higher to 0.22 oz/ton Full-year production of 115,094 ounces was below the Company guidance range due to lower-than-expected grades throughout the first nine months of the year. Full-year gold sales exceeded production due to reductions in inventory throughout the year, particularly during the first quarter Adjusted CAS per AuOz 1 declined 5% quarter-over-quarter to $896 per ounce. Adjusted CAS per AuOz 1 for the full year increased 16% compared to the prior year to $920 due to lower grades and production levels. Higher diesel and consumables costs also contributed to the year-over-year increase Exploration expense was $8.6 million for the full year, a $5.1 million increase compared to 2016. During the year, Kensington's exploration program focused on resource conversion and expansion of the Jualin deposit as well as the expansion of higher-grade areas, such as Raven, which is expected to remain a supplemental source of higher-grade material throughout 2018 Mining of development ore continued at Jualin during the fourth quarter, where production is expected to accelerate throughout 2018 as the Company dewaters the mine area to facilitate more efficient drilling, development, and mining activities Free cash flow 1 during the quarter was $4.8 million due to higher production. For the full year, free cash flow 1 was $1.4 million, down $12.6 million compared to 2016 Production for the full-year 2018 is expected to total 115,000 - 120,000 ounces of gold at CAS per AuOz 1 of $900 - $950 Kensington's capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to total $35 - $40 million\nExploration\nDuring the fourth quarter, Coeur focused on refining its geologic models and establishing early priorities for its 2018 exploration program. Exploration at Wharf and Rochester ceased during the quarter due to weather conditions, while drilling at Kensington, Palmarejo, and Silvertip continued at reduced pace with three drill rigs active at Palmarejo, three at Kensington, and one at Silvertip. As of early February 2018, there were three rigs active at Silvertip, with a fourth expected later during the month.\nCompanywide exploration expense and capitalized exploration for the quarter were $7.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, declining 23% and 62% quarter-over-quarter. Exploration expense for the full year totaled $30.3 million, $17.4 million higher compared to 2016, while capitalized exploration totaled $11.6 million, compared to $12.4 million the prior year.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Company provided an update of its Palmarejo and Kensington exploration programs, which were expanded throughout the year following encouraging drill results. At Palmarejo, expansion of the Nación-Dana, La Bavisa, and Zapata veins remain a priority with two drill rigs active at Nación-Dana as of year-end. Underground drifting was also underway in anticipation of drilling the newly-discovered Portales and Jacobo veins, east of Guadalupe, as well as the Zapata and Madero veins, west of Guadalupe. The Company's year-end 2017 reserves and resources include initial reserve estimates at Nación and new inferred resources at Zapata and La Bavisa.\nExploration at Kensington continued to target expansion of the Raven vein, lower Kensington Main Block L, and lower Jualin Vein #4 during the quarter. An initial reserve estimate at Jualin is expected to be included in Kensington's updated technical report anticipated late in the first quarter of 2018.\nAt Silvertip, underground development drilling began early during the fourth quarter and targeted resource conversion, while underground access was undergoing preparation for multiple drill rigs in 2018. Results of the planned infill and expansion drill programs are expected to be included in an updated technical report anticipated in the second half of 2018.\n2018 Production Outlook\nAs published on January 8, 2018, the Company's full-year 2018 production guidance reflects the anticipated commencement of production at Silvertip by the end of the first quarter.\nSilver Gold Zinc Lead Silver Equivalent 1 (K oz) (oz) (K lbs) (K lbs) (K oz) Palmarejo 6,500 - 7,100 110,000 - 115,000 — — 13,100 - 14,000 Rochester 4,200 - 4,700 45,000 - 50,000 — — 6,900 - 7,700 Kensington — 115,000 - 120,000 — — 6,900 - 7,200 Wharf — 85,000 - 90,000 — — 5,100 - 5,400 Silvertip 1,500 - 2,000 — 23,000 - 28,000 23,000 - 28,000 4,030 - 5,080 Total 12,200 - 13,800 355,000 - 375,000 23,000 - 28,000 23,000 - 28,000 36,030 - 39,380 Total (including discontinued operations) 12,800 - 14,400 355,000 - 375,000 23,000 - 28,000 23,000 - 28,000 36,630 - 39,980 2017 Cost Performance and 2018 Outlook\nThe Company's spot guidance is based on recent observed equivalences and assumes silver-to-gold, -zinc and -lead ratios of 75:1, 0.09:1 and 0.07:1, respectively.\n2018 Guidance 2017 Results (dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 60:1 Spot 60:1 Average Spot CAS per AgEqOz 1 – Palmarejo $10.50 - $11.00 $9.25 -$9.75 $9.36 $8.38 CAS per AgEqOz 1 – Rochester $13.25 - $13.75 $12.00 - $12.50 $13.08 $11.97 CAS per AuOz 1 – Kensington $900 - $950 $920 CAS per AuEqOz 1 – Wharf $850 - $900 $700 CAS per AgEqOz 1 – Silvertip $15.00 - $15.50 $12.00 - $12.50 — — Capital Expenditures $120 - $140 $136.7 General and Administrative Expenses $32 - $34 $33.6 Exploration Expense $20 - $25 $30.3 AISC per AgEqOz 1 from continuing operations $17.50 - $18.00 $15.00 - $15.50 $15.90 $13.82 Financial Results and Conference Call\nCoeur will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results on February 8, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nDial-In Numbers: (855) 560-2581 (U.S.) (855) 669-9657 (Canada) (412) 542-4166 (International) Conference ID: Coeur Mining Hosting the call will be Mitchell J.
