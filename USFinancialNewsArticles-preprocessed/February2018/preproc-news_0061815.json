    "text": "Tyler Seguin and Alexander Radulov scored in the final nine minutes, and Kari Lehtonen stopped 18 shots for his first shutout of the season as the visiting Dallas Stars defeated the Los Angeles Kings 2-0 on Thursday at Staples Center.\nThe Stars had lost their previous two contests by a combined score of 7-2, but they salvaged a lone victory on their three-game California road trip.\nDallas showed surprisingly fresh legs throughout the match despite the fact it was playing the second game of a back-to-back after a 2-0 loss to the Ducks at Anaheim on Wednesday.\nLehtonen earned his sixth straight win in games he has started and recorded the 38th shutout of his 14-year NHL career.\nSeguin gave the Stars their first lead of their road trip when he redirected Greg Pateryn’s slap shot from outside the right faceoff circle with 8:27 to play. The shot found the smallest of openings above the left shoulder of Los Angeles goaltender Jonathan Quick.\nWith exactly one minute remaining and the Kings’ goal empty, Radulov worked hard on the boards just inside the Dallas zone against two Los Angeles players before shooting for the clinching goal.\nDallas outshot the Kings 28-18, won 63 percent of the game’s faceoffs and forged a 41-29 advantage in hits over Los Angeles.\nThe Kings had a three-game winning streak snapped.\nThe game was scoreless after two periods and virtually even statistically, with Dallas holding a 15-13 edge in shots on goal despite recording just two in the first period.\nQuick finished with 26 saves.\nThe Kings continue their three-game homestand when the Edmonton Oilers visit on Saturday. Dallas heads home to host the Winnipeg Jets on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
