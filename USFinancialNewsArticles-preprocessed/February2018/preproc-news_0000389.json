(NASDAQ:CTHR) (the “Company”), the original and leading worldwide source of created moissanite, provided preliminary fourth quarter 2017 results, highlighted strategic objectives and announced recent actions by its Board of Directors related to fiscal year timing and executive compensation.\nThe Company estimates net sales for the fourth quarter 2017 to be in the range of $8.2 million to $8.5 million, as compared to $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and positive net income and earnings per share in the fourth quarter 2017.\nSuzanne Miglucci, President and CEO of the Company, said, “Over the past year, we have made significant progress on our key initiatives, including building a direct-to-consumer business by amplifying our marketing outreach and targeting millennials; intensifying our omni-channel sales effort and applying our e-commerce initiatives to new channels; expanding our jewelry line and Forever One TM gemstone products; and evolving our customer experience.”\n“Our Q4 2017 performance is indicative of the level of momentum we’re seeing since the re-launch of our brand and validates several factors – that we’ve engaged our target audience, they’re comfortable shopping online for moissanite products, and we’ve successfully established the consumer brand we promised when we embarked on this journey. We look forward to providing further detail on our recent performance and upcoming plans during our fourth quarter and full year 2017 investor conference call scheduled on March 8, 2018,” Ms. Miglucci commented.\n“As we springboard from the great momentum created in 2017, we are focusing our efforts to grow the business as a premier, global jewelry brand through the following four strategic objectives,” Ms. Miglucci concluded.\n2018 Strategic Objectives\nDrive organic revenue growth in the U.S. and maintain attractive margins. We plan to continue engaging our target customers through creative and progressive marketing campaigns, and we will leverage technology to ensure efficiencies in our marketing, sales and customer service functions. Expand our gemstone and jewelry offerings to serve a broad range of customers. We plan to continue innovating our moissanite gemstone offerings and further enhance our jewelry offerings to include unique, curated collections and new styles at multiple price points that will appeal to a broad audience. Target the global market opportunity through continued brand building, focused channel expansion and world-class customer service. We plan to diversify and expand our global customer base in a low-risk manner by introducing our brand in select markets via cross-border trade initiatives and through established marketplaces. Balance growth-oriented investments to generate sustainable earnings improvement. We plan to maintain financial flexibility and use data-driven business decisions to balance investments in future growth with consistent near-term financial performance.\nChange in Fiscal Year\nThe Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year from a fiscal year beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year to a fiscal year beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 of each year. This change enables the management team to shift its annual planning and budgeting process away from the holiday season, so the focus during that time is on revenue-generating opportunities with customers. The Company plans to file a transition report on Form 10-KT with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the six-month transition period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.\nIn connection with the change in the Company’s fiscal year, the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) will be held in November 2018 instead of May 2018. Upon setting the date of the Annual Meeting, the Company will disclose the new advance notice and shareholder proposal deadlines in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-5(f).\nExecutive Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed 2017 corporate performance, determined achievement levels of 2017 performance goals and modified executive stock awards accordingly. The Compensation Committee also approved the 2018 senior management equity incentive program. These actions were reported on Form 4s filed with the SEC, which show the modification of 2017 equity awards as “Disposed” shares (cancelled, not sold) and the award of potential 2018 equity incentive awards as “Acquired” shares (granted, not vested).\nCautionary Statement Regarding Preliminary Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nThe estimated fourth quarter 2017 results are derived from preliminary internal financial reports and are preliminary, unaudited, and subject to revision based on the Company’s financial closing procedures and controls associated with the completion of its year-end financial reporting, including all customary reviews and approvals, and completion by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm of its audit of such financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Accordingly, actual final results for 2017 may differ from these preliminary results, whether due to adjustments and other developments that may arise between the issuance of this press release and the issuance of the final audited results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 or otherwise, and such differences may be material. These preliminary results should not be viewed as a substitute for full financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for any future period. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent registered public accounting firm has audited, reviewed or compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the preliminary results, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on the preliminary results.\nAbout Charles & Colvard, Ltd.\nCharles & Colvard, Ltd., based in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina, is the original creator and leading source of Forever One™, Forever Brilliant® and Forever Classic™ moissanite gemstones for fine jewelry.
