    "text": "(Reuters) - China’s aviation-to-financial services conglomerate HNA Group Co [HNAIRC.UL] is putting up for sale commercial properties worth $4 billion in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Minneapolis, in efforts to avert a liquidity crunch, Bloomberg reported. \nThe properties for sale include 245 Park Ave., Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing a marketing document. \nHNA was not immediately available for comment. \nThe company has made a big number of mergers amid a slowing Chinese economy that has impacted its access to new financing, and led to liquidity problems, Chairman Chen Feng told Reuters last month. \nHNA’s financing troubles have been exacerbated by regulatory investigations in multiple countries after the group announced changes to its shareholding structure last year. \nChief Executive Officer Adam Tan said in November that the company was selling some real estate and other assets to improve liquidity and comply with national policy. \nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
