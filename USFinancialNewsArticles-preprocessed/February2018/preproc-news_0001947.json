    "text": "18 COMMENTS Koch Industries is launching a new series of ads during the Olympics and Super Bowl to boost the reputation of its corporate brand, as well as quash “misperceptions” by people who only associate the company with its owners’ political views. \n“Among some people, there’s a misperception about Charles and David Koch, and while this [ad campaign] won’t directly address those misperceptions, it will fill in the blanks a little bit about Koch and about what kind of company our shareholders lead,” said Steve Lombardo, chief communications and marketing officer at Koch Industries. \nKoch Industries, one of the world’s largest private companies, is a sprawling industrial conglomerate with holdings in paper manufacturing, glass, Lycra production, energy, agriculture and dry-bulk commodities. But its vast business interests are often overshadowed by the political activities of executives Charles and David Koch, power players in Republican politics who have donated and raised millions of dollars to support conservative candidates and causes.\nAt a time when the company is investing in new technology products and expanding globally, Koch is looking to raise awareness and hone its message, said Mr. Lombardo. Though the company has advertised its principles before, this campaign is designed to reach a bigger audience. \n“We’re trying to get our message out to all consumers, in particular those who are paying closer attention to media and news events, and those who are going to be watching the Olympics, for example, who are probably a little more engaged,” he said.\nThe new ads, which are part of the company’s ongoing “Challenge Accepted” campaign, feature different kinds of people facing obstacles, such as a small child learning to climb stairs, a student solving a math problem and an ice skater tackling tough moves. \nMore on Super Bowl Ads \nNo Fumbles Allowed as Madison Avenue Prepares for Super Bowl Budweiser Benches Famous Clydesdales for Super Bowl LII A Brief History of Super Bowl Ads The ads include a voice-over with a variation of the message: “In every challenge, there are two rivals: belief and doubt. Belief is outnumbered. But not outsmarted. And when the score is settled, belief rises to the top. Of that, we at Koch Industries have no doubt.” \nThe company is hoping its latest marketing message will resonate with people who are influential in their communities, and can spread the word about Koch’s principles, including integrity and entrepreneurship, he said. \nThe ad campaign, which will appear in national Olympic ads and regional Super Bowl spots, will cost Koch between $8 million and $12 million, according to a person close to the effort. \nCMO Today Newsletter Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ’s CMO Today newsletter.

In 2017, the company launched another campaign called “Challenge Accepted” to talk more about what Koch does and stands for. \nThis latest effort takes that campaign one step further, to communicate “why” the company does what it does, said Mr. Lombardo. \nKoch Industries’s latest series of ads feature individuals facing challenges in everyday life. Conservative groups such as Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, backed by the company’s billionaire owners, have invested millions in advancing their political causes, from tax overhaul to their effort to kill the Affordable Care Act. \nMost recently, Charles and David Koch, who didn’t support Donald Trump in the 2016 election, have focused their efforts on keeping Republican majorities in Congress, with plans to spend as much as $400 million on the effort in 2017 and 2018, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported. \nIn some business dealings, Koch Industries has dealt with questions over whether its involvement is motivated by politics rather than returns. The company’s private-equity arm, Koch Equity Development, invested $650 million to support Meredith Corp.’s purchase of magazine publisher Time Inc. Meredith executives went out of their way to make clear that the deal didn’t include a board seat for KED.\nWhile Koch Industries may be looking to steer clear of political statements in its latest ad campaign, the company’s executives aren’t shying away from taking on hot-button political issues. For example, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Charles Koch co-authored an op-ed in December in the Washington Post pushing for Congress to work to keep “dreamers”—people whose parents brought them to the U.S. illegally as children—in the country. \nIn another campaign, called “ End the Divide ,” the company outlines its political agenda to maintain a “free and open society.” \n“To millions of Americans, the words ‘Koch brothers’ and ‘political activism’ go hand-in-hand,” the company says on its website. “And for good reason. At Koch Industries, we are unapologetic advocates for the principles of a free and open society.” \nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com",
