    "text": "Guess said Tuesday that co-founder Paul Marciano has relinquished his day-to-day responsibilities pending the completion of the apparel company's investigation of sexual harassment claims by actress and model Kate Upton.\n\"I have pledged my full cooperation to the Company, and I have the utmost confidence in our CEO, Victor Herrero, to continue leading the Company during this time,\" Marciano said in a statement.\nMarciano has denied the allegations by Upton. The company has since formed a special committee to investigate her claims. She has said Marciano's actions \"took a huge toll on my confidence and self-worth.\"\n\"The Company takes very seriously any allegations of sexual misconduct, is committed to maintaining a safe work environment, and looks forward to the completion of a thorough investigation of all the facts,\" Guess said Tuesday in a statement.\nMarciano's future with Guess will be determined when the investigation is completed, the company said.\nGuess shares were down 4 percent on Tuesday. As of Friday, they had tumbled more than 15 percent this month. Upton voiced her allegations on Jan. 31.\nCorrection: Earlier headlines misstated the action against Paul Marciano. He has relinquished his day-to-day responsibilities at Guess pending completion of the investigation.\nWATCH: Guess responds to Kate Upton allegations show chapters Guess responds to Kate Upton allegations 7:18 PM ET Fri, 9 Feb 2018 | 00:36",
