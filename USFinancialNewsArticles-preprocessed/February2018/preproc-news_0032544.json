    "text": "BARCELONA, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Barcelona announced on Thursday a three-year extension to their existing sponsorship agreement with electronics brand Beko, which will see the Turkish firm sponsor the team’s training kit.\nThe club did not give financial information about the deal, which was unveiled by president Josep Maria Bartomeu at a news conference on Thursday, attended by Barca defender Gerard Pique.\nLocal media reported the deal was worth 57 million euros ($71 million).\nBeko currently sponsors the sleeves of Barca’s first team kit and the back of their training kit as part of a deal first signed in 2014.\nThe firm’s name will now be front and centre of the team’s training kit. ($1 = 0.8011 euros) (Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis)\n ",
