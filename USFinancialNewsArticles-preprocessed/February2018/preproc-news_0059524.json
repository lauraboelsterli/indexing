    "text": "JAKARTA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday that she expects the nominee to be the country’s next central bank governor to continue the bank’s focus on stability and taming inflation, while adopting a “pragmatic” approach to boosting growth.\nPresident Joko Widodo’s selection of Perry Warjiyo, a longtime deputy governor of Bank Indonesia, to succeed Agus Martowardojo, was confirmed on Saturday.\nIn her first comments on the nomination, Indrawati told Reuters in an interview that she hoped Warjiyo would maintain the bank’s strong reputation for policy credibility built up under his boss and predecessor.\n“We, of course, expect because Bank Indonesia is the central bank, they are going to continue maintaining stability but at the same time, they are going to be pragmatic enough to see the opportunity for them to continue support what the government is actually addressing: poverty, inequality, and growth,” Indrawati said.\n“I think the most important is job creation and growth.”\nShe added that Warjiyo’s experience in the bank and previously at the International Monetary Fund would prepare him well for the role. She added that she has a good relationship with Warjiyo and described him as a “likeable person” who tells “a lot of jokes.”\nAs a deputy governor, Warjiyo’s role includes monetary policy mix formulation, financial market deepening and Islamic financial market development.\nIndrawati also told Reuters that it was important for Indonesia to boost consumption growth back towards the 6 percent level seen before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. It has been stuck around 5 percent in recent years.\nReporting by David Lawder and Tabita Diela; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
