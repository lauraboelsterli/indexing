    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes on Wednesday called objections from the FBI and Justice Department to the public release of a Republican memo alleging anti-Trump bias in the Russia probe “spurious.”\n“Having stonewalled Congress’ demands for information for nearly a year, it’s no surprise to see the FBI and DOJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies,” Nunes, a Republican, said in a statement.\nReporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh\n ",
