    "text": "ATLANTA, DataPath, Inc., a leading provider of remote communications and information technology solutions to the aerospace, broadcast, government and critical infrastructure markets, announced today that its Chairman of the Board, Chris Melton, will step in as interim CEO, after its current President & CEO, David Myers, announced his plans to step down in February. The announcement follows the successful completion of a three-year transformation from a public-company spin-out to an independent, private equity owned business, and on the heels of a record year for DataPath, which grew over 70 percent in 2017.\nDataPath had previously operated as a division of public company Rockwell Collins until its acquisition by a private investment group led by The White Oak Group in July of 2014. Over the past three and half years, DataPath has reinvented itself, launching several new products, including class-defining satellite ground systems for the military and un-manned aerial vehicle (UAV) markets, as well as a new managed cybersecurity service for both commercial and government clients. The company has also significantly expanded its international presence, providing services in nearly 20 countries.\nIn addition to serving as Chairman of the Board and interim CEO for DataPath, Inc., Chris Melton is the Chairman and CEO of The White Oak Group, an Atlanta-based private investment firm. Melton also previously led the growth of DataPath as Co-Chairman from 2004 until its public offering in 2006.\n\"I want to thank David Myers for his leadership driving a very successful period of transformation and growth for the company,\" Melton said. \"Now DataPath is entering a new chapter in its evolution, where we will focus on improving our quality and the scalability and efficiency of our operations, to provide even better value for our customers.\"\nDataPath also recently announced the appointment of its first Chief Operating Officer, Brad Majeres, as well as a new Chief Financial Official, Carter Johnson, both of whom started at the beginning of January. DataPath's board is in the process of selecting the new permanent CEO and plans to announce an appointment in the near future.\nAbout DataPathÂ® Inc.\nIn remote and high-risk operating environments, dependable real-time communications are critical to situational awareness and mission success.
