(Nasdaq: RNWK), a leader in digital media software and services, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n\"2017 was a transformative year for RealNetworks. We advanced four key growth initiatives that are expected to contribute high margin revenue in 2018, while simultaneously improving our cost structure,\" said Rob Glaser, Chairman and CEO of RealNetworks. \"We also exited from our low margin Korean music on demand business, increasing our gross margin to over 70%.\"\nGlaser added, \"We have set the stage for meaningful revenue growth in 2018, led by the anticipated contribution from new high margin products. We also expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability during 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights from Continuing Operations\nRevenue was $18.9 million, up from $18.6 million in the prior quarter and down from $20.4 million in the prior year period. Operating expenses increased $1.0 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter and decreased $1.8 million, or 9%, from the prior year period. Net income was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $(4.5) million or $(0.12) per share in the prior quarter and $(10.2) million, or $(0.28) per share in the prior year period. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net income included a one-time $4.5 million gain on the final receipt of cash from the 2015 sale of the Slingo and social casino business. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $(3.6) million, compared to a loss of $(2.6) million in the prior quarter and $(4.5) million in the prior year period.
