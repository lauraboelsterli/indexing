    "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Diosdado Cabello, vice president of Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party, on Tuesday proposed holding an early congressional election alongside the April 22 presidential vote, potentially shortening the tenure of the currently opposition-run legislature.\nVenezuela’s opposition won control of the National Assembly in a 2015 landslide vote that was their biggest electoral victory in nearly two decades of socialist government.\nBut President Nicolas Maduro and the pro-government judiciary rendered the congress toothless by striking down all its measures, and holding a controversial vote to set up instead a new all-powerful superbody called the Constituent Assembly.\nCabello, cited in state TV tweets, said a new National Assembly vote was needed “in the national interest” because the opposition-run body was idle.\nVenezuelan opposition presidential pre-candidate Henri Falcon speaks during a meeting with representatives of international media in Caracas, Venezuela February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello In the past, his proposals have quickly gone to the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly - which a raft of foreign nations have refused to recognize - and been rubber-stamped.\nCritics will see Cabello’s proposal to bring forward the next congressional vote, which had been due in 2020, as a further attempt to crush opposition in a nation they say the socialists have turned into a dictatorship.\nOpposition leaders are already expected to boycott the April presidential poll, because they believe it is rigged to ensure Maduro’s re-election despite his unpopularity and a crushing national economic crisis.\nMaduro and Cabello say they are fighting a U.S.-led international right-wing conspiracy to topple their socialist government and win control of Venezuela’s oil wealth.\nHenri Falcon, a former socialist supporter who crossed to the opposition and is mulling running in the April 22 election, chided Cabello for the legislative vote proposal. “This hardly contributes to the climate of calm and security the nation is demanding faced with an upcoming election,” he told reporters.\nReporting by Vivian Sequera and Andrew Cawthorne; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Girish Gupta and Jonathan Oatis\n ",
