Those announced to date include a major investment in digital technology, shifting some routes to low-cost subsidiary Scoot and adding more seats to its Airbus SE A380 superjumbos.\nSingapore Airlines’ flagship full-service airline unit contributed S$155 million to operating profit in the third quarter, up from S$151 million a year earlier.\nThe SilkAir regional airline unit reported a 37 percent fall in operating profit to S$19 million, due in part to a 12.3 percent decline in yield, or average fares. Scoot posted a 48 percent rise in operating profit to S$43 million as yield rose and it filled a higher percentage of seats.\nThe cargo division’s operating earnings jumped 66 percent to S$88 million amid a global rebound in the air freight market.
