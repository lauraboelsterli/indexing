    "text": "Experienced Financial Executive to Help Cyber Resilience Company Accelerate Growth\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Axio , a cyber resilience company that helps clients optimize their portfolio of security controls and insurance to make cyber risk manageable, today announced the appointment of Christopher Amery as Vice President, Professional and Financial Services.\n“We’re thrilled to welcome Chris to the Axio family,” said Scott Kannry, CEO of Axio. “Chris’s leadership roles in the financial sector have helped him appreciate how critical it is to have senior management actively engaged in cyber security strategy and execution. His deep knowledge of that sector will prove invaluable to us as we accelerate our growth beyond our already successful energy and industrial ventures.”\nAmery joins Axio from the investment bank Jefferies LLC, a subsidiary of Leucadia, where he was a Managing Director and Head of Equity Derivatives Trading. In that role he led new business initiatives, trading strategy and risk for the firm across the equity derivatives platform. Prior to Jefferies, he ran index and correlation trading at Credit Suisse. Amery earned his AB in Economics and History from Dartmouth College.\n“I’ve seen firsthand how critical it is for management to take an active role in cyber security management, especially in financial services. Further, I’ve seen how challenging that is and how managers struggle with understanding how cyber security can impact the business,” said Amery. “Axio is clearly fulfilling an unmet need of its clients to utilize a risk-centric and integrated approach to cyber that is shared by security leaders, risk managers, senior executives, and Boards of Directors. I am excited to help deliver Axio’s technology solutions to the financial and professional services space.”\nAbout Axio\nAxio knows impenetrability is impossible – but cyber resilience is within reach. Our technology and services help clients ensure that they understand their exposure, manage it effectively, and are equipped to financially recover.
