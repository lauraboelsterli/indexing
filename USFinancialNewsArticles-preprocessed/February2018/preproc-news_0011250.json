    "text": "If Monday's sell off was frightening, Tuesday's volatility was stomach churning, but investors were likely breathing a little easier at market close.\nThe Dow swung more than 1,000 points points on Tuesday to recover 48 percent of Monday's losses.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial average opened with a drop lower, then rallied all the way up. The index closed 567.02 points higher at 24,912.77, but not before hitting a session low of 23,778.74, down 567.01 points, and then surging more than 600 points.\nThe Dow has traveled more than 1,000 points points in a day before — in 2008, 2010, 2015 and yesterday, to be precise — but never before has the Dow been both up and down more than 500 points in one session.\nCNBC In fact, the Dow's wild swings meant the index traveled close to an incredible 5,500 points on Tuesday. That's on top of the 5,100 points traveled on Monday.\nAll three major indexes regained value after Monday's losses, but they still have a ways to go before they fully recover.\nThe Dow regained roughly 48 percent of Monday's 1,175 point loss. The S&P 500 closed 1.7 percent higher at 2,695.14, regaining 41 percent of its 113 point loss. The Nasdaq composite regained 54 percent of its 273-point loss, closing up 2.1 percent at 7,115.88.",
