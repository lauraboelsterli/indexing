    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE | Nasdaq: CBOE) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nConsolidated results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 include Bats Global Markets, Inc. (Bats), which was acquired by the company on February 28, 2017.\n\"2017 was a transformational year for Cboe Global Markets. We made great strides in our integration with Bats Global Markets, while continuing to deliver value to our customers as well as our shareholders,\" said Edward T. Tilly, Cboe Global Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We delivered on our key strategic initiatives and achieved record trading in our highest-margin proprietary products, including VIX futures and options and SPX options, while continuing to launch new innovative products such as Cboe Bitcoin Futures. Looking ahead, I believe our strong financial position, proprietary products, diversified revenue mix and expanded global base will allow us to continue to grow our business and create shareholder value.\"\n\"The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to 2017 on several financial measures, including 8 percent organic growth, EBITDA margin expansion and year-one acquisition-related synergies that exceeded our target,\" said Brian Schell, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"In 2017, our strong cash flow generation allowed us to pay down $400 million of our term loan while continuing to invest in our business and increase our dividend to shareholders. We expect the new tax law changes to favorably impact our future cash flows and plan to maintain a balanced approach to capital deployment, with a focus on increasing long-term shareholder value.\"\n(1) A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\n(2) Organic net revenue excludes the net revenue contribution resulting from the acquisition of Bats to arrive at net revenue for legacy Cboe. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter Results -Table 1\nTable 1 below presents summary selected unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the company as reported, on an adjusted basis and on an adjusted combined basis for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The adjusted combined results reflect the Bats acquisition and related financing transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2016.\nTable 1\n4Q16\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter Results\n4Q17\nAdjusted\n($ in millions except per share)\n4Q17\n4Q16\nChange\nAdjusted 1\nCombined 1\nChange\nTotal Revenues Less Cost of Revenues\n$\n265.6\n$\n143.0\n86\n%\n$\n265.6\n$\n248.6\n7\n%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n$\n156.9\n$\n68.1\n130\n%\n$\n105.0\n$\n104.6\n0\n%\nOperating Income\n$\n108.7\n$\n74.9\n45\n%\n$\n160.6\n$\n144.0\n12\n%\nOperating Margin %\n40.9\n%\n52.4\n%\n(1,150)\nbps\n60.5\n%\n57.9\n%\n260\nbps\nNet Income Allocated to Common Stockholders\n$\n254.6\n$\n44.7\n470\n%\n$\n97.7\n$\n86.5\n13\n%\nDiluted EPS\n$\n2.26\n$\n0.55\n311\n%\n$\n0.87\n$\n0.78\n12\n%\nEBITDA\n$\n167.9\n$\n90.0\n87\n%\n$\n176.8\n$\n163.4\n8\n%\nEBITDA Margin %\n63.2\n%\n62.9\n%\n30\nbps\n66.6\n%\n65.7\n%\n90\nbps\nTotal revenues less cost of revenues (referred to as \"net revenue\"), were $265.6 million, up 86 percent from $143.0 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by a $111.5 million net revenue contribution from legacy Bats for the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in net transaction fees. Net revenue of $265.6 million was up $17.0 million, or 7 percent, compared with adjusted combined net revenue 1 of $248.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase primarily reflects higher revenue from net transaction fees 1 , market data fees and exchange services and other fees. For the fourth quarter of 2017, transaction fees were $431.3 million. Net transaction fees of $178.0 1 million increased $17.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to higher net transaction fees in futures and index options, offset somewhat by lower net transaction fees from U.S. Equities. Excluding legacy Bats' net revenue contribution, the company's organic net revenue 2 was $154.1 million, up $11.1 million or 8 percent, compared to fourth quarter 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to stronger trading volume and higher revenue contributed from VIX ® futures and proprietary index options. Operating expenses were $156.9 million versus $68.1 million in the prior year quarter. The increase primarily resulted from $43.0 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets and incremental operating expenses of $44.6 million related to Bats for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating expenses 1 for the fourth quarter were $105.0 million compared with adjusted combined operating expenses of $104.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The slight increase was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense. The operating margin for the fourth quarter was 40.9 percent. The adjusted combined operating margin 1 increased to 60.5 percent from 57.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting increased leverage gained from a higher revenue base. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was a tax benefit of 147 percent, which includes the impact of a one-time benefit of $191.5 million from the re-measurement of the company's deferred tax positions using the lower corporate tax rate resulting from the U.S. corporate tax reform legislation passed during the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP adjustments, the adjusted tax rate¹ was 37.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.26. Adjusted combined diluted EPS 1 was $0.87, up 12 percent compared to $0.78 for 2016's fourth quarter.\n(1) A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP and adjusted combined results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables.

Net transaction fees for options increased $10.2 million or 11 percent, primarily driven by higher net transaction fees from index options. Total options average daily volume (ADV) increased 9 percent and the average revenue per contract (RPC) increased 2 percent for the fourth quarter, primarily due to a shift in the mix of trading volume towards higher RPC index options. Net transaction fees generated by Cboe's proprietary index options accounted for 83 percent of options net transaction fees and were up $10.3 million or 13 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016 combined. The increase resulted from an 18 percent increase in index options ADV, driven by increases of 24 percent and 18 percent in VIX and SPX options, respectively, offset somewhat by a 4 percent decrease in the RPC for index options to $0.682 from $0.712 in last year's fourth quarter. The company's total options market share was 40.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with combined market share of 40.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n(1) A full reconciliation of our non-GAAP and combined results to our GAAP results is included in the attached tables. See \"Non-GAAP Information\" in the accompanying financial tables.\nU.S. Equities:\nU.S. Equities net revenue of $69.0 million was up $0.6 million or 1 percent, reflecting lower net transaction fees offset by an increase in non-transaction fees. Net transaction fees for U.S. Equities of $17.4 million decreased by $2.3 million or 12 percent, reflecting weaker market conditions and tougher comparisons against last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in net transaction fees resulted from a 10 percent decline in market volumes and a 1.5 percentage point decline in market share, with net capture up 5 percent to $0.022 per 100 touched shares. Cboe's U.S. Equities business maintained its position as the second-largest market operator during the fourth quarter of 2017, with market share of 18.5 percent. Cboe's U.S. Equities business, the second-largest U.S. market operator for ETF trading, executed 21.7 percent of all ETF volume during the fourth quarter of 2017 and won 23.6 percent of all new ETF listings during the quarter.\nFutures:\nFutures net revenue of $35.6 million increased $8.5 million or 31 percent, primarily due to higher transaction fees resulting from a 21 percent increase in VIX futures ADV and a 7 percent increase in RPC. The RPC rose to $1.799 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $1.683 in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to pricing changes implemented in January 2017. In 2017, trading volume in VIX futures set a new record for the 13 th consecutive year with ADV of 294,000 contracts, up 23 percent compared with 2016.\nEuropean Equities:\nNet revenue for European Equities increased 17 percent, reflecting growth in both net transaction fees and non-transaction revenue. In local currency, net revenue grew 10 percent. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Cboe Europe Equities retained its position as the largest Pan-European stock exchange with 20.3 percent market share. In 2017, Cboe Europe delivered solutions for a post-MiFID II landscape, including Cboe LIS, a block trading platform, periodic auctions book and buy-side trade reporting.\nGlobal FX:\nGlobal FX net revenue of $12.0 million rose 18 percent from $10.2 million, primarily due to higher net transaction fees compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Average daily notional value (ADNV) traded on the Cboe FX platform was $32.4 billion for the quarter, up 21 percent from last year's fourth quarter, driven by record quarterly volume on its London matching engine. Cboe FX market share increased to 14.9 percent for the fourth quarter and 13.4 percent for the year, setting new all-time highs.\n2018 Fiscal Year Financial Guidance\nThe company provided the following guidance for the 2018 fiscal year:\nAdjusted operating expenses are expected to be in a range of $420 million to $428 million, representing a projected increase of 1 to 3 percent compared to combined adjusted operating expenses of $415.3 million for 2017. The guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million, which the company plans to include in its non-GAAP reconciliation.¹ Depreciation and amortization expense, which is included in adjusted operating expenses above, is expected to be in the range of $53 million to $58 million, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million. The effective tax rate¹ on adjusted earnings for the year is expected to be in the range of 26.5 percent to 28.5 percent. The tax rate guidance incorporates the impact of the U.S. corporate tax reform enacted in December of 2017. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, federal, state and local tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, which include the company's ongoing investments in technology, including Cboe's migration to Bats technology.\n(1) Specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the company's adjusted operating expenses guidance and adjusted effective tax rate guidance are not available. The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures, primarily related to acquisition-related expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's adjusted operating expenses and adjusted effective tax rate would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.\nCapital Management\nThe company paid cash dividends of $30.6 million, or $0.27 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the company had net cash and financial investments of $120.2 million, which excludes $70.5 million of cash collected for Section 31 fees. Long-term debt as of December 31, 2017 was $1.2 billion and reflects a payment of $75 million made during the fourth quarter towards the company's term loan.\nEarnings Conference Call\nExecutives of Cboe Global Markets will host a conference call to review its fourth-quarter financial results today, February 9, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. CT.

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction fees, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, organic net revenue, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted tax rate, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release also include combined company financial measures that are discussed in further detail below under the sub-section \"Combined Reconciliations.\"\nManagement believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release, including adjusted net revenue, organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses, provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.\nOrganic net revenue: Is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of Bats. Management believes the organic net revenue growth measure provides users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing revenue performance and trends by presenting revenue growth excluding the impact of the Bats acquisition.\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.\nAcquisition-related expenses: From time to time, we have pursued small bolt-on acquisitions and in 2017 completed a larger transformative acquisition, which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.\nOther significant items: We have excluded certain other charges that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. For 2017, other significant items primarily included interest and other borrowing costs incurred prior to the close of the Bats transaction and accelerated stock-based compensation that was incurred due to a change in the vesting schedule for equity award grants.\nOrganic Net Revenue Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nTable 3\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of Revenue Less Cost of Revenue to Organic Net Revenue\nRevenue less cost of revenue (net revenue)\n$\n265.6\n$\n143.0\n$\n995.6\n$\n566.4\nRecent acquisitions:\nBats revenue less cost of revenue\n(111.5)\n—\n(378.2)\n—\nOrganic net revenue\n$\n154.1\n$\n143.0\n$\n617.4\n$\n566.4\nReconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Information\nThe information below shows the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP.

EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income, as an indicator of the company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by net revenue.\nTable 5\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nReconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Per Table 1)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income allocated to common stockholders\n$\n254.6\n$\n44.7\n$\n396.7\n$\n184.9\nInterest\n10.4\n5.5\n41.3\n5.7\nIncome tax provision\n(153.0)\n29.8\n(66.2)\n120.9\nDepreciation and amortization\n55.9\n10.0\n192.2\n44.4\nEBITDA\n$\n167.9\n$\n90.0\n$\n564.0\n$\n355.9\nEBITDA Margin ¹\n63.2\n%\n62.9\n%\n56.6\n%\n62.8\n%\nNon-GAAP adjustments not included in above line items\nCompensation and benefits (accelerated stock-based compensation)\n—\n0.2\n9.1\n1.5\nAcquisition-related expenses\n9.0\n4.2\n84.4\n13.5\nProvision for uncollectable convertible notes receivable\n—\n—\n3.8\n—\nLess: Legal settlement\n—\n—\n—\n(5.5)\nLess: Gain on settlement of contingent consideration\n—\n—\n—\n(1.4)\nOther\n(0.1)\n—\n1.0\n0.3\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n176.8\n$\n94.4\n$\n662.3\n$\n364.3\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin ¹\n66.6\n%\n66.0\n%\n66.5\n%\n64.3\n%\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\n(in millions)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nReconciliation of Combined Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Per Table 1)\n2017 2\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCombined revenues less cost of revenues\n$\n248.6\n$\n1,067.5\n$\n1,002.8\nCombined net income allocated to common stockholders\n$\n60.3\n$\n267.2\n$\n230.8\nInterest\n12.1\n45.4\n44.1\nIncome tax provision\n35.3\n159.2\n147.3\nDepreciation and amortization\n55.7\n222.4\n226.8\nCombined EBITDA\n$\n163.4\n$\n694.2\n$\n649.0\nCombined EBITDA Margin ¹\n65.7\n%\n65.0\n%\n64.7\n%\nNon-GAAP adjustments not included in above line items\nCompensation and benefits (accelerated stock-based compensation)\n0.2\n9.1\n0.9\nAcquisition-related expenses\n—\n—\n—\nProvision for uncollectable convertible notes receivable\n—\n3.8\n—\nLess: Legal settlement\n—\n—\n(5.5)\nLess: Gain on settlement of contingent consideration\n—\n—\n(1.4)\nOther\n(0.2)\n1.4\n7.2\nAdjusted Combined EBITDA\n$\n163.4\n$\n708.5\n$\n650.2\nAdjusted Combined EBITDA Margin ¹\n65.7\n%\n66.4\n%\n64.8\n%\n¹EBITDA margin represents the respective EBITDA divided by the respective net revenue as shown in the non-GAAP reconciliations provided.\n2 Combined results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 are the same as the financial results reported as the company was operating as a combined entity for the entire quarter.\nCombined Reconciliations\nThe non-GAAP unaudited combined financial measures have been prepared by recording combined adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of Cboe Global Markets.
