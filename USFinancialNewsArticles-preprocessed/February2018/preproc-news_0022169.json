    "text": "STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) announced today that Transocean Ltd. along with Transocean Inc. (‟Transocean”) have initiated a compulsory acquisition of all remaining shares in Songa Offshore SE (‟Songa Offshore”) that are not already owned by Transocean. Transocean expects to complete the compulsory acquisition by the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nPursuant to Cyprus law, Transocean applied on February 6, 2018, to the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (‟CySEC”) to carry out the compulsory acquisition. As of January 30, 2018, through its voluntary offer, Transocean owned 187,390,391 Songa Offshore shares, representing approximately 97.67% of Songa Offshore’s total shares on a fully diluted basis, and closed its acquisition of Songa Offshore.\nSubject to the CySEC granting its application, Transocean will send a notification to all former Songa Offshore shareholders whose addresses are known and whose shares will be acquired by way of the compulsory acquisition. The consideration for the compulsory acquisition is expected to consist of a choice between:\nA combination of (i) 0.35724 newly issued Consideration Shares and (ii) USD 2.99726 principal amount of new exchangeable bonds per Songa Offshore share, with up to NOK 125,000 being payable in cash based upon NOK 47.50 per Songa Offshore share; or NOK 47.50 per Songa Offshore share in cash.\nTransocean will pursue a delisting of the shares in Songa Offshore from Oslo Stock Exchange as soon as possible after the compulsory acquisition is complete.\nAbout Transocean\nTransocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells. The company specializes in technically demanding sectors of the global offshore drilling business with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh environment drilling services, and believes that it operates one of the most versatile offshore drilling fleets in the world.\nTransocean owns or has partial ownership interests in, and operates a fleet of 46 mobile offshore drilling units consisting of 26 ultra-deepwater floaters, 12 harsh environment floaters, two deepwater floaters and six midwater floaters. In addition, Transocean has three ultra-deepwater drillships under construction or under contract to be constructed. The company also operates two high-specification jackups that were under drilling contracts when the rigs were sold, and the company continues to operate these jackups until completion or novation of the drilling contracts.\nFor more information about Transocean, please visit: www.deepwater.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nAny statements in this release that are not historical facts may be that involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
