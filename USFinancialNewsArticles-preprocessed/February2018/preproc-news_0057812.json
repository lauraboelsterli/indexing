We grew our portfolio by adding 65 wholly-owned self storage properties and an additional five properties through our joint venture. We leveraged our revenue management platform to increase rental rates across many of our markets, driving strong revenue growth over last year. During the fourth quarter, we completed both preferred share and common share offerings, followed by an expansion of our credit facility during January 2018. These transactions provide us with the financial flexibility to continue to execute our growth strategy as we begin 2018, which we kicked off by acquiring an additional 18 properties during January and February.\"\nFinancial Results\n($ in thousands, except per share and unit data) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Growth 2017 2016 Growth Net income $ 12,015 $ 6,075 97.8 % $ 45,998 $ 24,866 85.0 % Funds From Operations (\"FFO\") (1) $ 23,482 $ 17,198 36.5 % $ 90,584 $ 57,776 56.8 % Add back acquisition costs, NSA's share of unconsolidated real estate venture acquisition costs and loss on early extinguishment of debt\n143 2,819 (94.9 )% 615 7,688 (92.0 )% Core FFO (1) $ 23,625 $ 20,017 18.0 % $ 91,199 $ 65,464 39.3 % Earnings (loss) per share - basic $ (0.08 ) $ 0.22 (136.4 )% $ 0.01 $ 0.60 (98.3 )% Earnings (loss) per share - diluted $ (0.08 ) $ 0.07 (214.3 )% $ 0.01 $ 0.31 (96.8 )% FFO per share and unit (1) $ 0.31 $ 0.26 19.2 % $ 1.23 $ 0.99 24.2 % Core FFO per share and unit (1) $ 0.32 $ 0.30 6.7 % $ 1.24 $ 1.12 10.7 % (1) Non-GAAP financial measures, including FFO, Core FFO and NOI, are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure and defined (together with other words and phrases used herein) in the Schedules to this press release and in the supplemental financial information.

The increases in FFO and Core FFO were primarily the result of $35.4 million of incremental NOI from non-same store properties acquired in 2017 and 2016, same store NOI growth of $8.2 million and a $6.3 million increase in management fees and other revenue partially offset by increases of $10.0 million of interest expense, $8.5 million of general and administrative expenses and $5.5 million of distributions to subordinated performance unitholders.\nTotal Consolidated Portfolio Operating Results\n($ in thousands, except per square foot data) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Growth 2017 2016 Growth Total rental and other property-related revenue $ 71,285 $ 57,355 24.3 % $ 260,069 $ 197,237 31.9 % Property operating expenses 23,285 18,734 24.3 % 84,455 64,798 30.3 % Net Operating Income (NOI) $ 48,000 $ 38,621 24.3 % $ 175,614 $ 132,439 32.6 % Average Occupancy 88.2 % 89.1 % (0.9 )% 88.9 % 89.7 % (0.8 )% Average Annualized Rental Revenue Per Occupied Square Foot $ 11.64 $ 11.28 3.2 % $ 11.52 $ 11.00 4.7 % Fourth Quarter 2017\nFourth quarter 2017 total rental and other property-related revenue increased 24.3%, driven by $9.4 million of incremental revenues from 65 self storage properties acquired during 2017 and a $2.1 million increase in same store total revenues.\nFourth quarter 2017 total property operating expenses increased 24.3% resulting from $3.6 million of incremental property operating expenses generated by 65 self storage properties acquired during 2017, and an increase of $0.4 million in same store property operating expenses.\nTotal consolidated portfolio NOI was $48.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 24.3% compared to NOI of $38.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017\nTotal rental and other property-related revenue was $260.1 million for full year 2017, an increase of 31.9% compared to $197.2 million for full year 2016.

(2)\nNSA combines OP units and DownREIT OP units with common shares because, after the applicable lock-out periods, OP units in the Company's operating partnership are redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for common shares on a one-for-one basis and DownREIT OP units are also redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for OP units in the Company's operating partnership on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments in each case. Subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (or other units that are convertible into or exchangeable for common shares). See footnote (3) for additional discussion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units in the calculation of FFO and Core FFO per share and unit.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method for the company's restricted common shares, the treasury stock method for certain unvested LTIP units, and includes the assumption of a hypothetical conversion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units and LTIP units into OP units, even though such units may only be convertible into OP units (i) after a lock-out period and (ii) upon certain events or conditions. For additional information about the conversion of subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units into OP units, see Note 10 to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The computation of weighted average shares and units for FFO and Core FFO per share and unit includes all restricted common shares and LTIP units that participate in distributions and excludes all subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units because their effect has been accounted for through the allocation of FFO to the related unitholders based on distributions declared. (4)\nRepresents the effect of adjusting the numerator to consolidated net income (loss) prior to GAAP allocations for noncontrolling interests, after deducting preferred share distributions, and before the application of the two-class method and treasury stock method, as described in footnote (3) .
