    "text": "John Humphrey, retired CFO of Roper Technologies, joins Gardner Denver Board\nMILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: GDI) today announced that John Humphrey joined its Board of Directors on February 7, 2018. Mr. Humphrey was also appointed to the Audit Committee of the Board.\nMr. Humphrey recently retired from Roper Technologies, a company that designs and develops software and engineered products and solutions for healthcare, transportation, food, energy, water, education and other niche markets worldwide. At Roper, he served from 2011 to 2017 as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and from 2006 to 2011 as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining Roper, Mr. Humphrey spent 12 years with Honeywell International, Inc. and its predecessor company, AlliedSignal, in a variety of financial leadership positions.\n“We are very excited to have John join our Board,” said Vicente Reynal, CEO of Gardner Denver. “We are extremely focused on effective capital allocation. John’s merger and acquisition experience at Roper, especially with respect to purchasing and growing asset light, low working capital businesses, will provide us with insightful guidance as we execute on our capital deployment strategies.” Reynal added, “When we talk about talent deployment as one of our key strategies, we mean it at every level, including our Board. John brings to us decades of experience from serving in senior positions at world class industrial companies, and his background uniquely positions him to support our key strategies.”\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
