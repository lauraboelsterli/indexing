All statements other than statements of historical fact are \"forward-looking statements\" for purposes of federal and state securities laws and include, but are not limited to, statements of management's expectations regarding the company's performance, sales force and customer base, growth, strategies, initiatives and areas of focus, acquisitions and new product introductions; projections regarding revenue, earnings per share, foreign currency fluctuations, tax rates and other financial items; statements of belief; and statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"targets,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" the negative of these words and other similar words.\nThe forward-looking statements and related assumptions involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any forward-looking statements or views expressed herein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nadverse publicity related to the company's business, products, industry or any legal actions or complaints by the company's sales force or others; risk that direct selling laws and regulations in any of our markets, including the United States and Mainland China, may be modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to our business model or negatively impacts our revenue, sales force or business, including through the interruption of sales activities, loss of licenses, imposition of fines, or any other adverse actions or events; any failure of current or planned initiatives or products to generate interest among the company's sales force and customers and generate sponsoring and selling activities on a sustained basis; risk of foreign currency fluctuations and the currency translation impact on the company's business associated with these fluctuations; uncertainties regarding the future financial performance of the company's recent acquisitions; risks related to accurately predicting, delivering or maintaining sufficient quantities of products to support our planned initiatives or launch strategies, and increased risk of inventory write-offs if the company over-forecasts demand for a product or changes its planned initiatives or launch strategies; regulatory risks associated with the company's products, which could require the company to modify its claims or inhibit the company's ability to import or continue selling a product in a market if it is determined to be a medical device or if it is unable to register the product in a timely manner under applicable regulatory requirements; unpredictable economic conditions and events globally; uncertainties related to interpretation of, and forthcoming regulations under, the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation; the company's future tax-planning initiatives; any prospective or retrospective increases in duties on the company's products imported into the company's markets outside of the United States; and any adverse results of tax audits or unfavorable changes to tax laws in the company's various markets; and continued competitive pressures in the company's markets.\nThe company's financial performance and the forward-looking statements contained herein are further qualified by a detailed discussion of associated risks set forth in the documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements set forth the company's beliefs as of the date that such information was first provided and the company assumes no duty to update the forward-looking statements contained in this release to reflect any change except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures : Constant-currency revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's performance. It is calculated by translating the current period's revenue at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing this amount to the prior-year period's revenue.\nEarnings per share and income tax rate, each excluding the impact of tax reform, also are non-GAAP financial measures. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017 and had a material impact on the company's earnings per share and tax rate. Removing its impact facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company's performance. Please see the reconciliations of these items to our earnings per share and income tax rate calculated under GAAP, below.\nThe Company's revenue results by segment for the three-month periods ended
