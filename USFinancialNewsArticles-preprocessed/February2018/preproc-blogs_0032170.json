    "text": "Chloe Kim, the 17-year-old snowboarding gold medalist, told CNBC on Tuesday she has to agree with a sponsor's message in order to work with them.\n\"I love working with sponsors,\" said the Korean-American phenom, who counts Nike , Toyota and Mondelez among the companies on her roster.\n\"It's so much more than just a contract. I genuinely only want to work with people that I agree with on certain things,\" she continued. \"There were many sponsors I didn't want to work with because I didn't agree with their messages that they wanted to use me to convey.\"\nTim Clayton | Corbis | Getty Images Gold medalist Chloe Kim of the United States celebrates her gold medal win during the Snowboard - Ladies' Halfpipe competition at Phoenix Snow Park on February 13, 2018 in PyeongChang, South Korea.

And I definitely got that [from her]. My dad is like, 'It's the worst when you and your mom are hangry, cause it's scary.'\"\nKim also reflected on the values she learned from her parents. \"Watching my family work so hard has been so inspirational, and I think I really got their work ethic.\" \nCNBC's Carl Quintanilla , who conducted the interview with Kim, wrapped things up asking her to play speed round of this-or-that.\nQuintanilla: \" Under Armour or Nike?\"\nKim: \"Nike.\"\nQuintanilla: \"Instagram or Twitter?\"\nKim: \"'Instawitter.'\"\nQuintanilla: \"Ice cream or churros?\" Kim also tweeted about ice cream and churros this week.\nCould be down for some ice cream rn \nOh and I also had 2 churros today and they were pretty bomb so if you ever get nervous go eat a churro \nKim responded to the ice cream or churros question by saying, \"Ice cream.\"\nQuintanilla: \"'Star Wars' or 'Star Trek'?\"\nKim: \"'Star Wars.'\"\nQuintanilla: \" Netflix or Hulu?\"\nKim: \"Hulu.\"\nQuintanilla: \"Alexa or Siri?\"\nQuintanilla: \"Pass?\"\nKim: \"Pass.\"\nQuintanilla: \"Dogs or cats?\"\nKim: \"Dogs.\"\nQuintanilla: \"Olympics or X Games?\"\nKim: \"Oh, pass.\"\nQuintanilla: \"In-N-Out [Burger] or Shake Shack ?\"\nKim: \"In-N-Out.\"\nQuintanilla: \"And Spotify and Pandora .\"\nKim: \"Spotify.\"\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics.
