Our continuing operations generated more than $1.2 billion in combined revenue, representing organic growth of 12%, and more than doubled operating income to $75 million, on a Non-GAAP basis. Industrial had a record year with almost $800 million in revenue, an increase of 11% on a constant currency average daily sales basis. Industrial also made significant margin improvement as we delivered operating leverage across the business, which resulted in a 101% increase in operating income for the full year. Within the quarter, IPG also grew its revenue nearly 11% while improving operating margin 200 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. In France, 2017 revenue increased 12% on a constant currency average daily sales basis, marking the fourth consecutive year of double digit organic top line improvement, and we continued to show strong profitability. In the fourth quarter, France grew its revenue 6% on a constant currency average daily sales basis, and delivered its highest gross and operating margin performance of the year at 17% and nearly 6% respectively.\"\n\"As we enter the new year our Industrial and France businesses remain well positioned for top and bottom line growth. Our efforts to broaden customer relationships, enhance the value we provide, and improve productivity are ongoing. With a solid balance sheet and growing cash flow generation we continue to return capital to shareholders through dividend distributions, while maintaining a healthy cash position to explore strategic acquisitions that can enhance our organic growth.\"\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had total working capital of $178.3 million, cash and cash equivalents of $184.5 million and excess availability under its credit facility of approximately $70.0 million. The cash balance at year end does not reflect the payment of the $1.50 Special Dividend, declared in December 2017, but paid in January 2018. The Company has significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders, execute on its business plans, invest in strategic M&A, and continue investing in growth opportunities. The Company recorded tax benefits from continuing operations in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 of $13.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The net tax benefit from continuing operations for the full year includes tax expense on pretax income of approximately $30.5 million, provisional repatriation tax under U.S. tax reform of $5.2 million and tax expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets resulting from the rate change under U.S. tax reform of $10.3 million. These expenses were offset primarily by the utilization of net operating losses and the reversal in the U.S. of valuation allowances against the Company's federal and certain state deferred tax assets. These offsets totaled approximately $51.3 million.\nThe Company's board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.11 per share to common stock shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2018, payable on March 16, 2018. The Company anticipates continuing a regular quarterly dividend in the future.\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nSystemax Inc. will provide pre-recorded remarks on its fourth quarter 2017 results today, February 27, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

For clarity of presentation, fiscal years and quarters are described as if they ended on the last day of the respective calendar month. The actual fiscal quarters ended on December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 included 13 weeks and the twelve months of 2017 and 2016 included 52 weeks.\n** On December 1, 2015 the Company closed on the sale of certain assets of its North American Technology Group (\"NATG\"). Pursuant to this transaction, the Company continues to wind down the remaining operations of NATG during 2017. In the GAAP presentation, the retail operations which were discontinued by the Company prior to the transaction, along with allocations of common distribution and back office costs, are presented as part of the Company's continuing operations for all periods; other NATG operations that were sold (as well as the remaining retail operations that existed at the time of the transaction (and were subsequently discontinued by the Company) are presented as discontinued operations for all periods. The non-GAAP results reflect the entire NATG segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented as well as adjustments for non-recurring items, intangible amortization, equity compensation and a normalized effective tax rate in recurring operations. On September 2, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of certain assets of its Misco Germany operation which has been reported as part of its European Technology Products Group. Prior and current year results of Germany have been eliminated in the non-GAAP presentation. On December 31, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of its Afligo rebate processing business. Prior and current year results of the rebate processing business have been eliminated in the non-GAAP presentation. On March 24, 2017, the Company closed on the sale of its European Technology Group businesses, other than its operations in France. The Company recorded tax benefits from continuing operations in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 of $13.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The net tax benefit from continuing operations for the full year includes tax expense on pretax income of approximately $30.5 million, provisional repatriation tax under U.S. tax reform of $5.2 million and tax expense related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets resulting from the rate change under U.S. tax reform of $10.3 million. These expenses were offset primarily by the utilization of net operating losses and the reversal in the U.S. of valuation allowances against the Company's federal and certain state deferred tax assets. These offsets totaled approximately $51.3 million. Prior and current year results of these divested businesses, along with the associated loss on the sale, have been classified as discontinued operations in both the GAAP and non-GAAP presentation. The Company believes that the non-GAAP presentation conveys additional more meaningful information to investors. See accompanying GAAP reconciliation tables.\n*** During Q2 2017, the Company decided to amend its presentation of certain costs associated with operating our Distribution Centers as well as costs associated with our Purchasing and Product Development Teams. Historically these costs have been included as a component of costs of goods sold. We are now including those costs as a component of Selling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses. This change is reflected in current and prior year periods and is not a restatement of any amounts, rather, an amendment to the presentation of these costs to better align with the Company's MRO-oriented peer group in North America.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations - Unaudited\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet sales\n$\n330.6\n$\n295.6\n$\n1,265.4\n$\n1,170.3\nCost of sales\n242.1\n217.3\n914.0\n862.4\nGross profit\n88.5\n78.3\n351.4\n307.9\nGross margin\n26.8\n%\n26.5\n%\n27.8\n%\n26.3\n%\nSelling, distribution and administrative expenses\n69.3\n61.9\n279.8\n276.3\nSpecial charges\n—\n0.3\n0.3\n3.9\nOperating income from continuing operations\n19.2\n16.1\n71.3\n27.7\nOperating margin\n5.8\n%\n5.4\n%\n5.6\n%\n2.4\n%\nInterest and other (income) expense, net\n0.5\n0.3\n0.5\n1.6\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes\n18.7\n15.8\n70.8\n26.1\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n(13.7)\n4.3\n(5.3)\n9.2\nNet income from continuing operations\n32.4\n11.5\n76.1\n16.9\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations\n1.4\n(13.6)\n(35.7)\n(49.5)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n33.8\n$\n(2.1)\n$\n40.4\n$\n(32.6)\nNet income per common share from continuing operations:\nBasic\n$\n0.87\n$\n0.31\n$\n2.06\n$\n0.45\nDiluted\n$\n0.85\n$\n0.31\n$\n2.02\n$\n0.45\nNet income (loss) per common share from discontinued\noperations:\nBasic and diluted\n$\n0.04\n$\n(0.37)\n$\n(0.96)\n$\n(1.33)\nWeighted average common and common equivalent shares:\nBasic\n37.1\n37.2\n37.0\n37.2\nDiluted\n37.9\n37.2\n37.6\n37.2\nSYSTEMAX INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets - Unaudited\n(In millions)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017*\n2016*\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n184.5\n$\n149.7\nAccounts receivable, net\n174.3\n148.6\nInventories\n131.5\n116.7\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n3.8\n3.9\nCurrent assets of discontinued operations\n—\n92.3\nTotal current assets\n494.1\n511.2\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n15.1\n16.4\nGoodwill, intangibles and other assets\n42.2\n21.4\nLong term assets of discontinued operations\n—\n17.1\nTotal assets\n$\n551.4\n$\n566.1\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n260.1\n230.5\nDividend payable\n55.7\n—\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations\n—\n94.5\nTotal current liabilities\n315.8\n325.0\nDeferred tax liability\n0.1\n0.3\nOther liabilities\n23.7\n24.3\nLong term liabilities of discontinued operations\n—\n2.1\nShareholders' equity\n211.8\n214.4\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n551.4\n$\n566.1\n* Systemax manages its business and reports using a 52-53 week fiscal year that ends at midnight on the\nSaturday closest to December 31.
