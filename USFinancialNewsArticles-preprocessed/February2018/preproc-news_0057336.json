    "text": "COLUMBIA, Miss., Jones Lumber Company, the founding organization owned by the Jones Companies in Columbia, MS recently purchased Rives and Reynolds Lumber out of Natchez, MS. This acquisition will allow Jones Lumber Company to expand its offerings by adding grade lumber to its production capabilities and open up sales to the international market.\nJones Lumber has multiple locations throughout Mississippi that are focused on building hardwood mats. The addition of this mill in Natchez will allow Jones to expand its geographic footprint and diversify into the grade lumber business. \"We are thrilled to add the Natchez, MS operation and its team of workers to the Jones Lumber Company family. Wherever we go, it is our mission to enhance the lives of our employees and the communities they live in and we are excited to continue that charge in Natchez,\" said Erik Toth, CEO of Jones Lumber Company.\nA ribbon cutting was held on February 23rd at the Natchez mill signifying the transition. Several city officials were on site including Natchez Mayor Darryl Grennell and various representatives from Natchez, Inc. Economic Development.\nJonathan Jones, CEO of the Jones Companies led the introduction by stating, \"The mill is not what we are buying, we are investing in the people, the talent and the culture of this mill.\"\nAbout Jones Companies\nJones Companies was founded in 1949 as a small lumber business in south Mississippi. During several logging expeditions, a need emerged for temporary access ways to transport heavy equipment through wetlands. This prompted the design of construction mats, which led to the discovery and development of products and services in the energy industry. Today, Jones consists of 10 privately owned entities including construction mat leasing, pipeline pipe logistics, pipe traceability software, portable refrigerated storage equipment, paper and plastics recycling, mobile fuel management, as well as other products and services that support power line and pipeline companies.\nMedia Contact:\nKathy Hopper\n936.203.7980\nKathy.Hopper@JonesCompanies.com\nView original content with multimedia: releases/jones-lumber-acquires-lumber-mill-in-natchez-ms-300604379.html\nSOURCE Jones Lumber Company",
