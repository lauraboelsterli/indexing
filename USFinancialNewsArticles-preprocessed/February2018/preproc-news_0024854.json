(NASDAQ: AMKR), a leading provider of semiconductor packaging and test services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Fourth quarter results were above the high end of our guidance, with sales up 12% year-over-year and 1% sequentially,\" said Steve Kelley, Amkor’s president and chief executive officer. “For full year 2017, we delivered record sales of $4.2 billion, an increase of nearly $300 million, or 8%, over 2016. Strong demand across all of our end markets, particularly mobile communications, combined with solid execution on our strategic initiatives in automotive, Greater China and advanced System-in-Package (SiP), produced another good year of profitable growth for Amkor.”\n“Record fourth quarter sales drove gross margin well above the high end of guidance,” said Megan Faust, Amkor’s corporate vice president and chief financial officer. “Our results also benefitted from the completion of our Japan factory consolidation in the quarter. Our CapEx discipline and prudent asset management generated 209 million dollars of free cash flow in 2017, our third consecutive year of free cash flow growth.\"\nResults Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Net sales $ 1,148 $ 1,135 $ 1,022 $ 4,186 $ 3,894 Gross margin 19.6 % 19.1 % 22.2 % 18.1 % 17.9 % Net income attributable to Amkor 1 $ 101 $ 54 $ 100 $ 261 $ 164 Earnings per diluted share 1 $ 0.42 $ 0.23 $ 0.42 $ 1.09 $ 0.69 EBITDA 1,2 $ 256 $ 243 $ 281 $ 971 $ 855 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 204 $ 214 $ 238 $ 618 $ 729 Free cash flow 1,2 $ 76 $ 74 $ 117 $ 209 $ 140 1) Q4 2017 net income includes an estimated one-time net tax benefit of $42 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on certain U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of U.S. tax reform. In Q4 2016, we received approximately $26 million of insurance proceeds related to the second quarter 2016 Japan earthquakes which contributed 250 basis points to gross margin and $0.08 to earnings per diluted share. Full year 2017 net income also includes an after-tax gain of $82 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, from the sale of our K1 factory in Korea.\n2) EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included below under \"Selected Operating Data.\"\nCash and cash equivalents were $600 million, and total debt was $1.4 billion, at December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\n“We expect first quarter 2018 revenues to be around $1.02 billion, up 12% year-on-year,\" said Kelley.\nFirst quarter 2018 outlook:\nNet sales of $0.98 billion to $1.06 billion, up 7% to 16% from the first quarter 2017 Gross margin of 14% to 16% Net loss of $5 million to net income of $25 million, or ($0.02) to $0.11 per diluted share Full year 2018 capital expenditures of around $600 million\nConference Call Information\nAmkor will conduct a conference call on Monday, February 12, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides additional information in assessing our financial operating results. Our management uses EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance, our ability to service debt and our ability to fund capital expenditures. However, EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not reflect the impact of certain expenses on our consolidated statements of income, including interest expense, which is a necessary element of our costs because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, income tax expense, which is a necessary element of our costs because taxes are imposed by law, and depreciation and amortization, which is a necessary element of our costs because we use capital assets to generate income. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income, net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Below is our reconciliation of EBITDA to U.S. GAAP net income.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation: Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 (in millions) EBITDA Data: Net income $ 102 $ 56 $ 101 $ 265 $ 167 Plus: Interest expense 20 20 22 85 85 Plus: Income tax expense (benefit) (13 ) 19 19 39 48 Plus: Depreciation & amortization 147 148 139 582 555 EBITDA $ 256 $ 243 $ 281 $ 971 $ 855 In the press release above we refer to free cash flow, which is not defined by U.S. GAAP. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment, plus proceeds from the sale of and insurance recovery for property, plant and equipment, if applicable. We believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides them with additional information in assessing our liquidity, capital resources and financial operating results. Our management uses free cash flow in evaluating our liquidity, our ability to service debt and our ability to fund capital expenditures. However, free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other, non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service, are not deducted from the measure. The amount of mandatory versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods. This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of liquidity or financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Furthermore, our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Below is our reconciliation of free cash flow to U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation: Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 (in millions) Free
