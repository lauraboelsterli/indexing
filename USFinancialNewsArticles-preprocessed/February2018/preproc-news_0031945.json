The cuts are scheduled to last through 2018.\nSeasonality may also be affecting prices, analysts said.\n\"A driving force behind the next few weeks of pricing vulnerability stems from the current peak in U.S. refinery maintenance season,\" Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.\nThe private American Petroleum Institute is due to publish crude inventory estimates on Tuesday, while the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration releases weekly inventory data on Wednesday.\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jane Merriman)",
