    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA), the global advisor on staffing and workforce solutions, has unveiled its seventh annual list of North American staffing leaders, celebrating those individuals whose passion and contributions have made a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of workers and job seekers across the economy. The 2018 Staffing 100 list, comprised of 100 notable influencers features Sherri Hammons, Beeline's chief technical officer. Doug Leeby, Beeline's chief executive officer, a 5-year Staffing 100 honoree, was named to the Staffing 100 Hall of Fame.\nSIA cited Leeby for \"envisioning and marketing solutions that changed the way companies acquire contingent talent. Regarded as an innovator and an industry pioneer, Leeby successfully merged Beeline with long-term VMS provider IQNavigator, creating an independent provider of VMS solutions with more than $40 billion of spend under management for customers in more than 100 countries.\"\nIn naming Hammons to its 2018 North America Influencers list within the Staffing 100, SIA called her \"a leading disrupter in VMS technology, developing technology solutions for government and industry to support and enhance a broad range of initiatives, both nationally and internationally.\"\n\"It's very flattering to be included in SIA's Hall of Fame with people for whom I have such high respect,\" said Leeby. \"We are privileged to be in a noble industry—connecting people and work. It's an honor to work with those who dedicate themselves to empowering people through employment. I'm grateful to my wonderful teammates at Beeline, our outstanding clients, and our superb partners for making this such a rewarding and fulfilling journey.\"\nAdded Hammons, \"We're also fully exploiting the synergies we've created to develop some exciting, customer-driven innovations that will change the world of work. We are using data science, microservices, and artificial intelligence to future-proof our systems and keep our customers on the leading edge of workforce management technology.\"\nThe Staffing 100 list is not a ranking but a way to recognize those championing the Workforce Solutions Ecosystem and driving its growth. It includes CEOs, entrepreneurs, technologists, workforce specialists, legal advisors, data scientists and more, from a range of different kinds of companies and niches–from traditional staffing to human cloud platforms to MSP/VMS to RPO.\n\"The 2018 Staffing 100 honorees touch all sectors of the workforce solutions ecosystem, elevating it through their commitment, innovation and expertise,\" said Subadhra Sriram, Publisher and Editor, Media Products, SIA. \"I am once again excited to acknowledge an important group whose work is leading our industry into the future.\"\nThe Staffing 100 website for the North American, Latin American and Hall of Fame 2018 lists debuted on February 14. Those named to the lists are being honored at a private reception at SIA's Executive Forum North America: Future Forward in Miami later this month. The list, along with the full profiles of those recognized, is also featured in the January/February 2018 issue of Staffing Industry Review magazine.\nAbout Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA)\nFounded in 1989, SIA is the global advisor on staffing and workforce solutions.
