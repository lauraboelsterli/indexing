GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday in a rocky session after the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting pushed yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to a four-year high. • Most Asian share markets followed S&P 500 futures lower as speculation of faster hikes in U.S interest rates soured risk appetite globally. • The dollar traded near a one-week high against a basket of major currencies, rising after minutes of the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed policymakers were more confident of the need to keep raising interest rates. • Oil prices fell, pulled down as a firmer dollar outweighed a report of a decrease in U.S. crude inventories. • Gold prices were flat, weighed down as minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed policymakers confident in the need to keep raising interest rates.
