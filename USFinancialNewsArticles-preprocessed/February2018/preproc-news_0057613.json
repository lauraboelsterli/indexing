    "text": "NEW YORK and CHICAGO, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Imagineer Technology Group , a leading provider of investor relations and fund marketing software to the asset management industry, and Synap Software Labs , maker of cloud-based investment research, due diligence, and account management applications, announced the definitive merger of their companies. Combining the businesses, which will operate under the Imagineer name, will enable them to capitalize on their shared vision of providing the best portfolio of cloud-based software and services to the asset management industry.\n\"Since our founding in 1998, Imagineer has been committed to transforming the way fund marketing and relationship management professionals engage with and service their clients,\" said Erol Dusi, founder of Imagineer, who will continue to serve as President of the company. \"We are excited to join forces with the Synap team whose rich experience building Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products for the investment management and CRM software industries complements our own.\"\nJeremie Bacon, who will serve as CEO of Imagineer, and the rest of the Synap team, including cofounders, Michael Boeke and Matt Mitchell, are co-founders or early veterans of Backstop Solutions Group, another software company catering to the alternative asset management industry.\nWhen asked about the case for the merger, Bacon remarked, \"Over more than a decade, Erol and I built a strong friendship that evolved out of mutual respect, shared values, and healthy competition. Bringing our teams together enables us to leverage our passion for serving clients and our never-ending commitment to engineering the best cloud-based products in the market.\"\nAs a result of the merger, Imagineer clients will be able to take advantage of an expanded product suite and benefit from the exhaustive industry knowledge and experience of the integrated teams.

Its other products, Synap and Fundinsight, enable investment professionals at endowments, foundations, and other asset allocators to obtain a holistic view of their manager research, operational due diligence, performance analytics, and portfolio management functions. The expansion of its product suite means the combined company can pursue new business opportunities and service more clients, from young startups to the largest asset managers in the world.\nIn conjunction with the merger, Imagineer also secured a significant follow-on investment from its primary backer, the Kemmons Wilson family office. \"We believe in Imagineer's leadership team and their vision,\" said Cecil Carney, Chairman of the Board and President of Private Investments at Kemmons Wilson Companies. \"We are confident this merger will significantly benefit our hundreds of clients, employees, and stakeholders.\"\nAbout Imagineer Technology Group\nFounded in 1998, Imagineer focuses on providing software and services to help investor relations, fund marketing, investment research, and account management teams to manage their client and fund manager relationships and operate more efficiently.
