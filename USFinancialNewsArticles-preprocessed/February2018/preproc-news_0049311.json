    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Medicines Company (NASDAQ:MDCO) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We have successfully executed our strategic action plan for 2017 by divesting our non-core assets, restructuring our business to focus on inclisiran, and initiating the inclisiran Phase 3 ORION program – recently completing target enrollment ahead of schedule in both ORION 11 and ORION 9 trials,” said Clive Meanwell, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company.\nDr. Meanwell continued, “We expect momentum to continue throughout 2018, including rapid accrual of clinical safety information on inclisiran and manufacturing development.

In contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, inclisiran is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by turning off PCSK9 synthesis in the liver.\nThe Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in the advancement of inclisiran pursuant to their 2013 agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase I clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase II forward, as well as potential commercialization.\nAbout The Medicines Company\nThe Medicines Company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose - to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare. The Company’s mission is to create transformational solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs facing patients, physicians and providers in cardiovascular care. The Company is headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this press release about The Medicines Company that are not purely historical, and all other statements that are not purely historical, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Without limiting the foregoing, the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects\" and \"potential' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include the ability of the Company to effectively develop inclisiran; whether inclisiran will advance in the clinical trials process on a timely basis or at all, or succeed in achieving its specified endpoints; whether the Company will make regulatory submissions for inclisiran on a timely basis; whether its regulatory submissions will receive approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all; and such other factors as are set forth in the risk factors detailed from time to time in the Company's periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the risk factors detailed in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 9, 2017, which are incorporated herein by reference. The Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release also contains adjusted loss from continuing operations and adjusted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to The Medicines Company. The Company believes these measures provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information.\nAdjusted loss from continuing operations excludes share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, asset impairment charges, inventory adjustments, restructuring charges, charges associated with product discontinuance, milestone payments, changes in contingent purchase price, expenses incurred for certain transactions, non-cash interest expense, gain on sale of assets, loss on repurchase of debt and net loss tax adjustments. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the Company’s business and are important in comparing current results with prior period results and understanding projected operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures provide the Company and its investors with an indication of the Company’s baseline performance before items that are considered by the Company not to be reflective of the Company’s ongoing results. See the attached Reconciliations of GAAP to Adjusted Loss From Continuing Operations and Adjusted Loss per Share for explanations of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per share amounts for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThese adjusted measures are non-GAAP and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company strongly encourages investors to review its consolidated financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nTHE MEDICINES COMPANY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED (In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net product revenues $ 4,480 $ 8,319 $ 18,980 $ 71,956 Royalty revenues 4,115 9,110 25,809 71,205 Total net revenues 8,595 17,429 44,789 143,161 Operating expenses: Cost of product revenues 20,438 14,337 47,193 60,653 Asset impairment charges 63,000 — 392,097 — Research and development 55,600 24,425 138,370 92,107 Selling, general and administrative 29,644 49,534 132,225 212,482 Total operating expenses 168,682 88,296 709,885 365,242 Loss from operations (160,087 ) (70,867 ) (665,096 ) (222,081 ) Co-promotion and license income 5,266 781 7,549 3,854 Gain on sale of assets — — — 288,301 Loss on extinguishment of debt — — — (5,380 ) Interest expense (11,811 ) (12,265 ) (48,564 ) (44,463 ) Other income (loss) 248 (542 ) 1,840 346 (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes (166,384 ) (82,893 ) (704,271 ) 20,577 Benefit (provision) for income taxes 6,968 110 96,576 (67 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations (159,416 ) (82,783 ) (607,695 ) 20,510 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (18,846 ) (40,073 ) (100,678 ) (139,682 ) Net loss (178,262 ) (122,856 ) (708,373 ) (119,172 ) Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest — 4 — 54 Net loss attributable to The Medicines Company $ (178,262 ) $ (122,852 ) $ (708,373 ) $ (119,118 ) Amounts attributable to The Medicines Company: (Loss) income from continuing operations $ (159,416 ) $ (82,779 ) $ (607,695 ) $ 20,564 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (18,846 ) (40,073 ) (100,678 ) (139,682 ) Net loss attributable to The Medicines Company $ (178,262 ) $ (122,852 ) $ (708,373 ) $ (119,118 ) Basic (loss) earnings per common share attributable to The Medicines Company: (Loss) earnings from continuing operations $ (2.19 ) $ (1.17 ) $ (8.40 ) $ 0.29 Loss from discontinued operations (0.26 ) (0.57 ) (1.39 ) (1.91 ) Basic loss per share $ (2.45 ) $ (1.74 ) $ (9.79 ) $ (1.62 ) Diluted (loss) earnings per common share attributable to The Medicines Company: (Loss) earnings from continuing operations $ (2.19 ) $ (1.17 ) $ (8.40 ) $ 0.28 Loss from discontinued operations (0.26 ) (0.57 ) (1.39 ) (1.91 ) Diluted loss per share $ (2.45 ) $ (1.74 ) $ (9.79 ) $ (1.63 ) Weighted average number of common shares outstanding: Basic 72,950 70,492 72,356 69,909 Diluted 72,950 70,492 72,356 73,022 THE MEDICINES COMPANY BALANCE SHEET ITEMS UNAUDITED (In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 151,359 $ 541,835 Total assets $ 872,983 $ 1,705,211 Convertible senior notes (due 2017, 2022 and 2023) $ 649,198 $ 677,333 The Medicines Company stockholders' equity $ 24,914 $ 652,501 THE MEDICINES COMPANY RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO ADJUSTED LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND ADJUSTED LOSS PER SHARE UNAUDITED (In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Loss) income from continuing operations attributable to The Medicines Company -
