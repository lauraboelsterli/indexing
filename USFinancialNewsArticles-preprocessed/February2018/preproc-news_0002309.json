    "text": "(Reuters) - There have been at least three dozen heists of cryptocurrency exchanges since 2011. Here are some of the major and other noteworthy hacks:\nCOINCHECK: Tokyo-based cryptocurrency trading exchange Coincheck suspended withdrawals on Friday after losing about 58 billion yen ($534 million) worth of virtual coins known as NEM to hackers.\nBITFINEX: The Hong Kong-based cryptocrruency exchange, reported the theft of 119,756 bitcoins worth about $72 million in August, 2016. Bitfinex’s theft was the second-biggest security breach ever of a digital currency exchange at the time.\nMT. GOX: The now defunct Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing some 850,00 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its bank accounts to hackers. Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 percent of the world’s bitcoin trades, later said it had found 200,000 of the bitcoins.\nCRYPTSY:A U.S. federal judge in Florida in July ordered Paul Vernon, the operator of the collapsed U.S. exchange to pay $8.2 million to customers after he failed to respond to a class-action lawsuit. The judge ruled that 11,325 bitcoins had been stolen in 2014 but did not identify the thief.\nOther notable heists include Bter, which lost 7,170 bitcoins in 2015; BitMarket.eu, (18,788 bitcoins lost in 2012); Bitfloor, (24,000 bitcoins lost in 2012) and Bitcoinica, which lost a total of 102,101 bitcoins in three hacks during 2012.\nSources: Reuters, Professor Tyler Moore at the University of Tulsa, CryptoCompare and other digital currency information providers.\nReporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Tomasz Janowski\n ",
