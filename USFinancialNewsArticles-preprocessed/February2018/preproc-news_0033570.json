(0746 GMT) On a busy day of earnings, especially for the banking sector, here's a round-up of the key headlines on the company and macro front so far this morning: Credit Agricole says its French retail bank has reached turning point French bank Natixis posts surprise rise in quarterly profit Credit Suisse posts third straight annual loss on US tax writedown Steel unit boosts Thyssenkrupp profit ahead of Tata Steel tie-up Salmon farmer Marine Harvest to cut costs as earnings, dividend drop H&M sees profit rise in 2018 as online sales grow Haldex Q4 core profit rises, says heavy investment to dent 2018 margins Clariant 2017 profit misses estimates after turbulent year Dutch chemical firm DSM's Q4 profit beats expectations Bilfinger sees further organic growth in orders in 2018 Food group Danone to sell 14 percent stake in Japan's Yakult Moncler launches 'Genius' creative hub in new product strategy BUZZ-EDP: Possible takeover target for Gas Natural - CS BUZZ-Ferrari: SUV and EV strategy adds risk - MS German exports drive solid growth in fourth quarter 2017 Coca Cola HBC AG Posts 4.9 Pct Rise In ‍Reported FY Net Sales Revenue Sky wins bulk of Premier League rights as value slips British construction group Galliford Try looks to raise 150 mln stg Spreadbetter Plus500 sees 2018 revenue ahead of market expectations (Kit Rees) WHAT'S ON THE RADAR AHEAD OF THE OPEN (0730 GMT) European markets are expected to open in positive territory but all eyes are really on the U.S. inflation data, which will come in early afternoon and will determine the fate of this session. In the meantime, a steady flow of corporate results and M&A will give traders enough to gnaw on while waiting for the big numbers. In the banking sector, Credit Suisse posted a third straight annual loss but it was smaller than expected. Credit Agricole saw a 33 percent jump in quarterly profit while French investment bank Natixis last evening reported an unexpected rise in quarterly net profit. For cyclicals, Thyssenkrupp Q1 operating profit is up 35, Dutch chemical firm DSM's Q4 profit beat expectations and Clariant 2017 profit missed estimates after a turbulent year. Swedish brake systems maker Haldex reported a rise in fourth-quarter core earnings but said investments in development and expansion in North America and China would hold back profitability in 2018. M&A: Danone to sell 14 percent stake in Japan's Yakult. In the UK, Sky won the bulk of Premier League rights. (Julien Ponthus) EUROPE TO OPEN IN POSITIVE TERRITORY, FUTURES INDICATE (0705 GMT) Looks like European bourses are set to open on a positive note, but of course, the rest of the session is largely expected to depend on the U.S. inflation data, which is to be published at 1330 GMT. (Julien Ponthus) A \"POWELL PUT\"? (0657 GMT) The incoming U.S. inflation data is sure keeping markets on their toes and it's interesting to note that the new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's first words at a ceremonial swearing-in was that the central bank would keep watching for financial stability risks. \"We will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability\", Powell said on the heels of a market rout that shaved 10 percent from the value of major U.S. stock indexes. A lot of analysts are still trying to figure out how Powell would react to a melt-down and wondering whether there would be such as thing as a \"Powell Put\", in the same way that the so-called \"Greenspan Put\" came to the rescue in 1987. On Monday, Stéphane Déo, strategist for LBPAM, asked himself whether the \"Greenspan Put\" had disappeared and what to make of the old saying recently used by Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts: \"Markets stop panicking when central banks start panicking\". In the meantime and as far as we are concerned today, as said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader: \"Even a slightly higher number could set the cat among the pigeons given the late cycle stimulus the Trump Administration is pumping into the U.S. economy\".
