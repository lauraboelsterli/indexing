The memorandum was signed on the sidelines of its Western Balkans Investment Summit in London with the transport ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Republika Srpska, the autonomous Bosnian Serb half of the country. The investments cover some seven projects across the country. Since the beginning of its operations, the EBRD has invested more than 1.2 billion euros in over 146 projects in the country.
