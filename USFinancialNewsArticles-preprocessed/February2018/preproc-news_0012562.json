    "text": "PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - The biting cold in Pyeongchang may be bothering some in the build-up to the Winter Games, but for Canadian mogul skiing favorite Mikael Kingsbury the weather is a blessing in his bid to clinch his first Olympic gold.\nTemperatures are currently below freezing during the day, dropping to as low as minus 21 degrees Celsius (70 Fahrenheit) at night.\nThe cold weather leads to more consistent peaks on the moguls course, something that Kingsbury believes could give him the edge over the rest of the field.\n“It is tricky but I think it fits it me well. I think it is hard and cold. I like it like that. Then it is consistent,” Kingsbury told Reuters after his second day of training in South Korea on Tuesday.\n“When it is warmer it is easier but the snow is less consistent. This is what I want. It is not easy and so you need to work to get a good run. Slowly I am feeling the course, the little details on it.”\nA silver medalist four years ago in Sochi, the Canadian has dominated the sport in recent years.\nLast year, Kingsbury claimed his sixth consecutive overall World Cup gold medal. He has also won two World Championship golds and holds the all-time record for the number of World Cup wins and podium finishes.\nDespite being widely expected to add Olympic gold to his wealth of achievements, Kingsbury is remaining grounded in the build-up to qualifying on Friday.\n“Usually we have two days and now we have four so we can take our time and manage our body,” said Kingsbury.\n“You will not win the race today. It is all the days together that you build you confidence. I am very happy with the job I am doing right now. I had the fastest time on the course today I think. I am where I want to be.”\nThe final of the men’s moguls is on Feb. 12.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ",
