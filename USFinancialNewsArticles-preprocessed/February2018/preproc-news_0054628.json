    "text": "2 COMMENTS Investors have been feverishly pushing up Wayfair Inc.’s stock despite the company’s growing losses, worsening free cash flow and surging marketing spending. That run may finally be coming to an end.\nOn Thursday, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that sent the stock tumbling more than 20%. Though revenue came in at $1.44 billion, beating estimates of $1.36 billion, Wayfair posted an adjusted loss of 58 cents a share, falling short of the expected 52-cent-a-share loss, and worse than last year’s 34-cent loss.\nMore troubling was the decline in free cash flow for the fiscal year from negative $65.3 million in 2016 to negative $113.3 million in 2017. Wayfair is burning that cash to buy user growth. New customers for the quarter were up 18% year-over-year, but ad spending was up even more, 43% year-over-year.\nThat puts the customer acquisition cost at about $71 per customer—even higher than the $69 projected in a study by marketing professors Daniel McCarthy of Emory University and Peter Fader of the Wharton School.\n“This continues to seem like more of the same to me,” says Professor McCarthy. “Growing revenues and growing adjusted Ebitda losses in tandem is a tell that lifetime value per customer is negative.”\nThe company has repeatedly raised cash to offset its losses, selling stock twice in the last two years followed by a convertible-bond offering. Early investors got out quickly, suggesting they perceived serious flaws. T. Rowe Price , for example, sold two million shares after the company’s IPO in October 2014. Insider selling has been considerable, too. As outsiders wise up to the company’s underlying problems, raising more cash may be a struggle.\nUnless Wayfair is snapped up by a larger retailer—say Target—investors who bet on it becoming the Amazon of furniture will be disappointed. Without a deal, bad news will beget more bad news for Wayfair, giving short sellers something to celebrate.\nWrite to Elizabeth Winkler at Elizabeth.Winkler@wsj.com",
