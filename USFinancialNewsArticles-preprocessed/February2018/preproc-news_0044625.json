Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate unit of Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, wants to grow its investments in logistics and residential, Fournier said in an interview, although he could not specify an exact timeframe. “If it takes a year, it takes a year,” he said. “The second we have the opportunity.” $1 = 1.2672 Canadian dollars Reporting By Allison Lampert Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
