    "text": "CNBC.com CNBC \nWith another volatile plunge on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average has traveled about 20,000 points this week. \nThe stock index is also tracking for a weekly loss of about 6 percent, its worst since October 2008, during the financial crisis. \nCNBC tracked the volatile moves of the Dow this week to calculate the number of points the index has moved. In the past five trading days, including Friday, the Dow has traded about 20,000 points back and forth in a roughly 2,000-point trading range. \nDow Jones industrial average 5-day performance \nSource: FactSet \nStocks have plunged in the last week as traders worried about rising interest rates and inflation, bringing an end to more than a year of historically low volatility. On Monday, the S&P 500 broke its longest ever streak without a 5 percent drop from a recent high, according to Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. \nThe Dow suffered its worst daily point-drop on record Monday, and briefly fell nearly 1,600 points intraday. The index recovered about half of Monday's losses in a volatile Tuesday session, but has closed lower in each of the two days since. \nOn Friday, the Dow jumped 349 points in morning trading, fell 500 points later in the session, before attempting gains. \nThe CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) jumped Tuesday above 50 for the first time since the market turmoil of August 2015. It traded near 40 Friday afternoon.",
