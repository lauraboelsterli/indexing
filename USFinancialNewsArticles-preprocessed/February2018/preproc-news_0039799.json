    "text": "LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Taxi service Uber, battling to retain its licence to operate in the British capital, said on Friday it would introduce new safety features, including 24-hour telephone support for riders and drivers.\nThe app said it would review all previous serious complaints and, from next month, give riders across Britain the licence number of the driver on their booking confirmation and electronic receipt.\nIt will also report any serious incidents to police itself rather than leave it to the individuals involved.\nUber is appealing against Transport for Londonâ€™s decision to strip it of its operating licence in September last year.
