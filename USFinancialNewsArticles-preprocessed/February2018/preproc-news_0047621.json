    "text": "FORT WASHINGTON, Pa., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ditech Holding Corporation (\"Ditech Holding\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: DHCP) today announced that Jeffrey Baker has been appointed interim Chief Executive Officer and President of Ditech Holding, effective immediately. Mr. Baker succeeds Anthony N. Renzi, who has left the Company. Mr. Baker will also continue to serve as President of Reverse Mortgage Solutions, Inc., but will no longer have the title of Chief Operations Officer of the Company.\nThe Company is continuing its previously announced process to identify and evaluate internal and external candidates to serve as permanent CEO, and has engaged Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm, to assist the Company with the process.\nThomas F. Marano, Chairman of Ditech Holding's Board of Directors, said, \"Jeff is a seasoned turnaround professional and an outstanding business leader and operator and we are pleased to appoint him interim CEO during this exciting and important time for Ditech Holding. Jeff played an important role in leading the turnaround of the Company's reverse mortgage business and has taken on increasing responsibilities serving as Chief Operations Officer since December 2017. We are confident in his abilities to lead Ditech Holding and ensure a smooth leadership transition as we complete our search for a permanent CEO.\"\nMr. Baker said, \"I am honored to lead the Company as we begin the next level of our transformation. Although this company has been through a lot of change, our mission, to enable the dream of homeownership for our customers and care for them throughout their homeownership lifecycle, remains the same. Under Tony's leadership, we executed a financial restructuring plan and successfully emerged from Chapter 11 as a stronger, more flexible organization. Now, as Ditech Holding, we will continue into our next phase of growth and success. Ditech Holding has a premier leadership team and in my new role, I will work closely with them in an effort to create value for our stockholders by optimizing our business and continuously improving our customer experience.\"\nAbout Jeffrey Baker\nJeffrey P.
