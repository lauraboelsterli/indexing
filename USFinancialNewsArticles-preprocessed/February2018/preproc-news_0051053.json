We use adjusted results, including adjusted OIBDA, adjusted OIBDAR, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted capital expenditures as key measures of the operational performance of our business. Our management, including the chief operating decision-maker, consistently uses these measures for internal reporting and the evaluation of business objectives, opportunities and performance.\n(A) Represents EarthLink revenues and sales prior to the merger date of February 27, 2017.
