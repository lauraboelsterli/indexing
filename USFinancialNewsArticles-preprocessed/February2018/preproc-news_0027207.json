    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tropical Smoothie Cafe, the leading fast casual cafe concept known for its better-for-you food and smoothies with a tropical twist, announced today that industry veteran Kristi Kingery has been promoted to senior vice president of supply chain and quality assurance. In her new role, Kingery will oversee quality assurance, supply chain and culinary for Tropical Smoothie Cafe's more than 635 locations nationwide. She'll also be responsible for spearheading food safety and supply chain risk initiatives by implementing new processes for auditing supplier facilities and evaluating product needs for both suppliers and distributors.\n\"Kristi is an integral part of our team and greatly contributed to the brand's success last year by optimizing our supply chain efforts,\" said Mike Rotondo, CEO of Tropical Smoothie Cafe. \"Tropical Smoothie Cafe is one of the strongest fast casual concepts today and as we continue to grow across the country, Kristi's leadership and expertise will aid in simplifying operations without sacrificing quality. Her extensive industry experience and innovative approach brings tremendous value to the company and we look forward to seeing the positive strides she'll continue to make this year and beyond.\"\nKingery joined Tropical Smoothie Cafe in 2017 and in less than a year, made a significant impact on the brand's supply chain by successfully developing and implementing a strategy to improve profitability for franchisees.
