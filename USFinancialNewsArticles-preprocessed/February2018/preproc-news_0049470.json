    "text": "GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., (NASDAQ:RRGB), a full-service restaurant chain serving an innovative selection of high-quality gourmet burgers in a family-friendly atmosphere, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights for the 13 Weeks Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the 12 Weeks Ended December 25, 2016\nTotal revenues were $342.4 million, an increase of 17.5%; Net income was $8.8 million compared to net loss of $8.8 million; Comparable restaurant revenue increased 2.7% (using constant currency rates); Comparable restaurant guest counts increased 1.9%; Off-premise increased to 8.3% of total food and beverage sales compared to 5.7%; Adjusted EBITDA was $35.8 million compared to $29.2 million (see Schedule III); GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.68 compared to GAAP loss per diluted share of $0.68; and Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.78 compared to $0.35 (see Schedule I).\nFinancial Highlights for the 53 Weeks Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the 52 Weeks Ended December 25, 2016\nTotal revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 6.5%; Net income was $30.0 million compared to $11.7 million; Comparable restaurant revenue increased 0.6% (using constant currency rates); Comparable restaurant guest counts increased 0.4%; Adjusted EBITDA was $139.4 million compared to $138.3 million (see Schedule III); GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.31 compared to $0.87; and Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.49 compared to $2.78 (see Schedule I).\n“We outperformed the casual dining industry on Guest traffic for the sixth consecutive quarter and ended 2017 with positive same store sales, while making considerable progress on the critical changes that will make Red Robin successful in 2018 and beyond,” said Denny Marie Post, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. chief executive officer. “While positive trends in Guest counts, restaurant revenues, controllable labor, value perception and off-premise demand are all encouraging, we know we also need to continue to evolve our service model, make smart investments in technology and maximize growth of new channels. We will continue to innovate and move urgently in the areas of the business that matter most to our Guests, benefit our Team Members and drive growth.”\nOperating Results\nTotal revenues, which primarily include Company-owned restaurant revenue and franchise royalties, increased 17.5% to $342.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $291.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Restaurant revenue increased $50.2 million, with the thirteenth week in the fourth quarter of 2017 contributing $29.8 million in restaurant revenue. The remaining increase was due to a $14.2 million increase in revenue from new restaurant openings and a $8.2 million, or 2.7%, increase in comparable restaurant revenue, partially offset by $1.5 million from closed restaurants and a $0.5 million unfavorable foreign currency impact.\nSystem-wide restaurant revenue (which includes franchised units) for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $404.1 million, compared to $347.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nComparable restaurant revenue (1) increased 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a 1.9% increase in guest counts and a 0.8% increase in average guest check. The increase in average guest check comprised a 2.6% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease in menu mix. The Company’s comparable revenue growth is calculated by comparing the same calendar weeks which, for 2016, include the first week of 2017.\nRestaurant-level operating profit margin (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased to 20.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 19.8% in the same period a year ago. The 70 basis point margin increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted from a 100 basis point decrease in labor costs, a 50 basis point decrease in other restaurant operating expenses, and a 20 basis point decrease in occupancy costs, offset by a 90 basis point increase in cost of sales. Schedule II of this earnings release defines restaurant-level operating profit, discusses why it is a useful metric for investors, and reconciles this metric to income from operations and net income, in each case under GAAP.\n(1) Comparable restaurants are those Company-owned restaurants that have operated five full quarters during the period presented, and such restaurants are only included in the comparable metrics if they are comparable for the entirety of both periods presented. Restaurant Revenue Performance\nQ4 2017\n(13 Weeks)\nQ4 2016\n(12 Weeks)\nAverage weekly sales per unit (1) : Company-owned – Total (2) $ 54,235 $ 51,863 Company-owned – Comparable (2) $ 54,598 $ 51,787 Franchised units – Comparable $ 59,059 $ 57,313 Total operating weeks: Company-owned units 6,235 5,560 Franchised units 1,118 1,032 (1) Calculated using constant currency rates. Using historical currency rates, the average weekly sales per unit in the fourth quarter of 2016 for Company-owned – Total and Company-owned – Comparable was $51,785 and $51,706. The Company calculates non-GAAP constant currency average weekly sales per unit by translating prior year local currency average weekly sales per unit to U.S. dollars based on current quarter average exchange rates. The Company considers non-GAAP constant currency average weekly sales per unit to be a useful metric to investors and management as they facilitate a more useful comparison of current performance to historical performance. (2) Average weekly sales per unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the benefit of the thirteenth week. The average weekly sales per unit in the thirteenth week of the fourth quarter of 2017 for Company-owned – Total and Company-owned – Comparable was $61,991 and $63,691. Other Results\nDepreciation and amortization costs were $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was flat with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and administrative costs were $21.9 million, or 6.4% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $19.0 million, or 6.5% of total revenues in the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs.\nSelling expenses, which now include the expenses associated with both national and local restaurant marketing activities, were $15.2 million, or 4.5% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $11.4 million, or 3.9%, of total revenues during the same period in the prior year.\nPre-opening and acquisition costs were $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.0 million in the same period a year ago.\nThe Company’s fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate benefit was 3.5%, compared to a tax benefit of 144.9% in 2016. The change in our 2017 effective tax rate compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to the increase in earnings before income tax, partially offset by an increase in the FICA tip tax credit. In addition, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Job Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company recorded a decrease related to the Company’s deferred tax liabilities due to the Tax Act which provided a one-time tax benefit of $2.8 million. Excluding the $2.8 million one-time tax benefit and the $5.1 million asset impairment, net of tax, the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 was 10.0%. Excluding the $2.8 million one-time tax benefit and the $4.2 million asset impairment, net of tax, the Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7.2%.\nNet income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $8.8 million compared to net loss of $8.8 million for the same period a year ago. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.68 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.68 in fourth quarter 2016. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $30.0 million compared to $11.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2016. The fifty-third week in 2017 contributed approximately $4.1 million to net income. Earnings per diluted share for fiscal year 2017 were $2.31 compared to $0.87 a year ago. The fifty-third week in 2017 contributed approximately $0.39 to earnings per diluted share.\nExcluding charges of $0.32 per diluted share for restaurant impairment, offset by a benefit of $0.22 per diluted share for deferred tax liability remeasurement due to the Tax Act, adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $0.78. Excluding charges of $0.96 per diluted share for restaurant impairment and closure and $0.06 per diluted share for reorganization costs, adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended December 25, 2016 were $0.35. See Schedule I for a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share (each, a non-GAAP financial measure) to net income and earnings per share.\nRestaurant Development\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company opened two Red Robin restaurants, bringing the total restaurant openings for the year to 18.\nThe following table details restaurant unit data for Company-owned and franchised locations for the periods indicated:\nThirteen\nWeeks Ended\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded\nFifty-three\nWeeks Ended\nFifty-two\nWeeks Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 25,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 25,\n2016\nCompany-owned: Beginning of period 479 462 465 439 Opened during the period 2 5 18 26 Acquired from franchisees — — — 13 Closed during the period (1 ) (2 ) (3 ) (13 ) End of period 480 465 480 465 Franchised: Beginning of period 86 86 86 99 Opened during the period — — 1 — Sold or closed during the period — — (1 ) (13 ) End of period 86 86 86 86 Total number of restaurants 566 551 566 551 Balance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $17.7 million and total debt of $266.4 million, excluding $10.9 million of capital lease liabilities. The Company funded construction of new restaurants and other capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and made net repayments of $10.4 million on its credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $265.5 million, in addition to amounts issued under letters of credit of $7.6 million, which reduce the amount available under its credit facility but are not recorded as debt.\nThe Company’s lease adjusted leverage ratio was 4.04x as of December 31, 2017. The lease adjusted leverage ratio is defined in Section 1.1 of the Company’s credit facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.32 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2017.\nOutlook for 2018\nThe Company expects comparable restaurant sales growth of 50 to 150 basis points, and operating weeks to decline 1%, as a result of having only 52 weeks in 2018 compared to 53 weeks in 2017, offset by the impact of new unit growth in 2017 and 2018. As a result, 2018 total revenue is projected between a decline of 50 basis points and an increase of 50 basis points. Cost of sales, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, is projected to be higher by 50 to 100 basis points versus 2017 due to the onset of a moderately inflationary commodity environment. Restaurant labor costs, as a percentage of restaurant revenue, are projected between an increase of 25 basis points and a decrease of 25 basis points, driven by minimum wage increases in more highly penetrated markets and restaurant manager bonuses planned at target levels, offset by the effect of improvements in labor productivity. Other operating expenses are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points, due primarily to lower repair and maintenance costs. Depreciation and amortization is projected to be approximately $95 million. General and administrative expense is projected to be $85 to $90 million. Selling expense, which includes the consolidation of all national and local marketing activities, is expected to be up slightly as a percentage of restaurant revenue. Pre-opening costs are estimated to be approximately $3 million due to the reduced number of new restaurant openings. The Company’s income tax rate is expected between 0% and 5%. Earnings per diluted share is projected to range from $2.40 to $2.80. The Company expects Q1 earnings per diluted share between $0.60 and $0.80. Overall capital expenditures are projected between $65 million and $75 million. The Company plans to add approximately three to five net Red Robin locations in 2018.\nThe sensitivity of the Company’s earnings per diluted share to a 1% change in guest counts for fiscal year 2018 is estimated to be approximately $0.45 on an annualized basis. Additionally, a 10 basis point change in restaurant-level operating profit margin is expected to impact earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.10, and a change of approximately $135,000 in pre-tax income or expense is equivalent to approximately $0.01 per diluted share.\nGuidance Policy\nThe Company provides only annual guidance as it relates to selected information related to the Company's financial and operating performance, and such measures may differ from year to year.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nRed Robin will host an investor conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results today at 5:00 p.m. ET.

The Company believes the presentation of net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share exclusive of the identified item gives the reader additional insight into the ongoing operational results of the Company. This supplemental information will assist with comparisons of past and future financial results against the present financial results presented herein.

The calculation for Restaurant impairment and closure includes $0.01 related to the effect of the diluted shares on net loss per share as reported. For diluted shares reported on the condensed consolidated statement of operations, the impact of dilutive shares is excluded due to the reported net loss for the quarter.\nSchedule II\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Restaurant-Level Operating Profit to Income (Loss)\nfrom Operations and Net Income (Loss)\n(In thousands)\nThe Company believes that restaurant-level operating profit is an important measure for management and investors because it is widely regarded in the restaurant industry as a useful metric by which to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance. The Company defines restaurant-level operating profit to be restaurant revenue minus restaurant-level operating costs, excluding restaurant impairment and closure costs. The measure includes restaurant-level occupancy costs, which include fixed rents, percentage rents, common area maintenance charges, real estate and personal property taxes, general liability insurance, and other property costs, but excludes depreciation related to restaurant buildings and leasehold improvements. The measure excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlay for the restaurants. The measure also excludes selling, general, and administrative costs, and therefore excludes occupancy costs associated with selling, general, and administrative functions, and pre-opening costs. The Company excludes restaurant closure costs as they do not represent a component of the efficiency of continuing operations. Restaurant impairment costs are excluded, because, similar to depreciation and amortization, they represent a non-cash charge for the Company’s investment in its restaurants and not a component of the efficiency of restaurant operations. Restaurant-level operating profit is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income (loss) from operations or net income (loss) as indicators of financial performance. Restaurant-level operating profit as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry. The table below sets forth certain unaudited information for the 13 and 53 weeks ended December 31, 2017 and the 12 and 52 weeks ended December 25, 2016, expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except for the components of restaurant-level operating profit, which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenue.\nThirteen Weeks\nEnded\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded\nFifty-three Weeks\nEnded\nFifty-two Weeks\nEnded\nDecember 31, 2017 December 25, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 25, 2016 Restaurant revenue $ 338,158 99.8 % $ 287,924 98.8 % $ 1,365,060 98.9 % $ 1,280,669 98.8 % Restaurant operating costs (1) : Cost of sales 80,203 23.7 % 65,646 22.8 % 320,355 23.5 % 298,249 23.3 % Labor 115,286 34.1 % 101,107 35.1 % 475,432 34.8 % 439,232 34.3 % Other operating 44,734 13.2 % 39,319 13.7 % 178,309 13.1 % 167,727 13.1 % Occupancy 28,626 8.5 % 24,884 8.7 % 112,753 8.3 % 107,408 8.4 % Restaurant-level operating profit 69,309 20.5 % 56,968 19.8 % 278,211 20.4 % 268,053 20.9 % Add – Franchise royalties, fees and other revenue 4,195 1.2 % 3,535 1.2 % 15,869 1.1 % 15,772 1.2 % Deduct – other operating: Depreciation and amortization 22,070 6.4 % 22,117 7.6 % 92,545 6.7 % 86,695 6.7 % General and administrative expenses 21,874 6.4 % 19,015 6.5 % 93,277 6.8 % 91,296 7.0 % Selling 15,243 4.5 % 11,381 3.9 % 56,742 4.1 % 46,591 3.6 % Pre-opening & acquisition costs 835 0.2 % 1,033 0.4 % 5,570 0.4 % 8,025 0.6 % Other charges 5,330 1.6 % 21,742 7.5 % 6,914 0.5 % 39,648 3.1 % Total other operating 65,352 19.1 % 75,288 25.9 % 255,048 18.5 % 272,255 21.0 % Income (loss) from operations 8,152 2.4 % (14,785 ) (5.1 )% 39,032 2.8 % 11,570 0.9 % Interest expense, net and other 2,543 0.7 % 2,046 0.7 % 10,012 0.7 % 6,782 0.5 % Income tax benefit (3,198 ) (0.9 )% (8,079 ) (2.8 )% (999 ) (0.1 )% (6,937 ) (0.5 )% Total other (655 ) (0.2 )% (6,033 ) (2.1 )% 9,013 0.6 % (155 ) 0.0 % Net income (loss) $ 8,807 2.6 % $ (8,752 ) (3.0 )% $ 30,019 2.2 % $ 11,725 0.9 % (1) Excluding depreciation and amortization, which is shown separately.\nCertain percentage amounts in the table above do not total due to rounding as well as the fact that components of restaurant-level operating profit are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenue and not total revenues.\nSchedule III\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are presented because the Company believes investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for evaluating our ongoing results of operations without the effect of non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expenses, asset disposals, and asset impairment and restaurant closure charges. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies in our industry or otherwise. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to reflect the additions and eliminations shown in the table below. The use of adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies, and our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by excluded or unusual items. We have not provided a reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA outlook to the most comparable GAAP measure of net income. Providing net income guidance is potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event driven transactional and other non-core operating items that are included in net income, including asset impairments and income tax valuation adjustments. The reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income for the historical periods presented below are indicative of the reconciliations that will be prepared upon completion of the periods covered by the non-GAAP guidance.\nThirteen Weeks\nEnded\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded\nFifty-three\nWeeks Ended\nFifty-two Weeks\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 25,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 25,\n2016\nNet income (loss) as reported $ 8,807 $ (8,752 ) $ 30,019 $ 11,725 Interest expense, net 2,821 2,161 10,918 7,193 Benefit from income taxes (3,198 ) (8,079 ) (999 ) (6,937 ) Depreciation and amortization 22,070 22,117 92,545 86,695 EBITDA (1) 30,500 7,447 132,483 98,676 Restaurant impairment and closure 5,330 20,420 6,914 34,426 Litigation contingencies — — — 3,900 Reorganization costs — 1,322 — 1,322 Adjusted EBITDA $ 35,830 $ 29,189 $ 139,397 $ 138,324 (1) EBITDA for the twelve and fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2016 was previously reported as $8.4 million and $103.2 million.
