    "text": "(Reuters) - New York’s state banking regulator asked Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) and two other lenders for information on their relationships with U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and his family’s real estate company, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) made the requests to Deutsche Bank, Signature Bank and New York Community Bank for information on loans and other financial arrangements including lines of credit and loan guarantees a week ago, the person said.\nThe regulator also asked for information related to other family members, the person said.\nRepresentatives for Jared Kushner and Kushner Cos, the real estate company he once headed, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAccording to government financial disclosures from last year, Kushner has lines of credit at the three banks, among others.\nThe regulator, Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank all declined to comment. New York Community Bank had no immediate comment.\nLast year Kushner resigned from Kushner Cos and sold his stake to a family trust as part of an effort to avoid conflicts of interests in his White House role. The private real estate company owns or partially owns buildings in New York and New Jersey.\nKushner, who had a broad portfolio in the White House, including leading Middle East peace negotiations and an effort to modernize and reduce the size of some government programs, lost his interim top-secret security clearance, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\nKushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, has not received his full security clearance because of his extensive financial links, which have taken a long time to examine, officials said.\nHis lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement on Tuesday that Kushner “has done more than what is expected of him in this process.”\nReporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Bill Rigby and Grant McCool\n ",
