    "text": "Sales increased 4% to $90.2 million in the quarter, driven by growth in Asia & Europe; Sales for the year were $317.9 million, up 9% over 2016 Quarterly net income was $3.2 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.24; Full year net income was $5.8 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.45 Generated cash from operations of $25.1 million in 2017 compared with $5.3 million in 2016\nELMIRA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hardinge Inc. (NASDAQ: HDNG), a leading international provider of advanced metal-cutting solutions and accessories, reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nSales, Orders and Backlog for the Quarter and Full Year\n(Please refer to the Sales and Orders tables included in this release)\nNorth America: Sales of $28.7 million in the quarter were down 4% from the prior-year quarter. Orders for the region were $23.6 million, a decrease of 7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the reorganization of our North America go-to-market approach.\nFor the full year, stronger economic conditions led sales in North America to increase 8% to $99.9 million. Orders decreased 4% to $97.4 million.\nEurope: Sales in Europe increased 7%, or $1.9 million, over the prior-year quarter to $29.0 million. Orders of $26.7 million were down 5% from the prior-year quarter. Excluding favorable foreign currency exchange of $1.5 million and $1.2 million on sales and orders, respectively, sales were up 2% and orders declined 10% compared with the prior-year quarter.\nFor the full year, sales to Europe were unchanged. Excluding favorable foreign currency exchange of $0.8 million, sales to Europe decreased 1%. Orders increased 10% over the prior-year. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $0.1 million, orders increased 9%.\nAsia: Asia sales increased $2.5 million, or 8%, to $32.5 million, over the prior-year’s fourth quarter. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $1.0 million, sales increased 5% over the prior-year period. Orders of $33.5 million decreased $3.3 million, or 9%, compared with the same period in the prior-year, mostly due to a large order in the prior-year quarter which was not repeated in the current year. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $0.9 million, orders were down 11% year over year.\nImproving economic conditions helped sales in Asia for the full year to grow $18.7 million, or 17%, from the prior- year to $126.6 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.7 million, sales increased 18%. Orders grew $7.9 million, or 7%, over the prior-year to $124.5 million as we have continued to focus on high precision products and custom solutions. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $0.9 million orders increased 8%.\nConsolidated Backlog: Order backlog at December 31, 2017 was $130.6 million a 12% increase over backlog at December 31, 2016.\nFourth Quarter Operating Results\nGross profit for the quarter was $30.9 million, or 34.3% of sales, up 1.9 points from the prior-year period on improved volume and lower levels of obsolescence inventory reserves. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased $1.7 million mostly as a result of $1.6 million in higher compensation and $0.2 million of costs related to the Company's strategic review. We recorded a non-cash gain on the dissolution of our Canadian subsidiary related to the realization of a currency translation adjustment of $0.8 million. Income from operations was $5.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 12% from the prior-year period. On a non-GAAP (1) adjusted basis, income from operations increased 27% to $6.8 million compared with $5.3 million last year. As a percent of sales, adjusted income from operations was 7.5%, a 1.4 point improvement over the prior-year period. Income tax expense in the quarter was impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act). Tax expense includes $1.2 million for the estimated transition tax resulting from the Act. Net income was $3.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, down from $3.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Adjusted non-GAAP (1) net income was $4.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase over the prior period adjusted net income of $4.1 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.\n(1) Management believes that the use of non-GAAP financial measures help in the understanding of the Company's operating performance. See pages 9 and 10 of this release for the reconciliation tables between reported amounts and non-GAAP measures discussed in this document.\n2017 Full Year Review\nGross profit of $107.6 million was up $10.0 million over the prior-year due to higher volume. Gross margin of 33.8% was up 0.4 points from the prior year on improved volume and lower levels of obsolescence inventory reserves partially offset by unfavorable mix. Excluding unusual costs in both periods, SG&A increased $1.1 million due to higher incentive compensation costs, which was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs. Income from operations was $8.9 million, up $5.5 million or 163% from prior-year. Non-GAAP (1) adjusted income from operations more than doubled to $14.3 million, or 5% of sales, compared with $6.6 million, or 2% of sales in 2016. Net income was $5.8 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, improved from $1.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in the prior-year. Adjusted non-GAAP (1) net income was $11.0 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, up significantly from $4.3 million, or $0.33 per diluted share in the prior-year.\nRecent Acquisition Announcement\nOn February 12, 2018, Hardinge announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of Privet Fund Management LLC (“Privet”) under which Privet has agreed to acquire Hardinge for $18.50 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million, subject to approval of Hardinge shareholders and other customary closing conditions.\nIn light of the announcement, Hardinge will not hold a conference call to discuss these financial results.\nAbout Hardinge\nHardinge is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high precision, computer-controlled machine tool solutions developed for critical, hard-to-machine metal parts and of technologically advanced workholding accessories.
