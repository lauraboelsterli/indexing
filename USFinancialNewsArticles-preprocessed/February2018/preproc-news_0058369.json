    "text": "Continued Focus on Value Creation Plan Initiatives\nTORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SunOpta Inc. (“SunOpta” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:STKL) (TSX:SOY), a leading global company focused on organic, non-genetically modified and specialty foods, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017.\n“In 2017, we continued to make significant progress transforming our business under our Value Creation Plan. These efforts have yielded an improved business mix and a more efficient, reliable and higher-quality production network, which will benefit our long-term growth and margin profile,” said David Colo, Chief Executive Officer. “The evidence of our actions is increasingly apparent in our enhanced product quality, food safety and customer service, as well as a growing pipeline of sales opportunities encompassing our diverse portfolio, covering multiple sales channels, with some early wins in 2018.”\n“Unfortunately, the positive financial benefits of these efforts have been masked by ongoing challenges in our frozen fruit platform, which did not turn around as quickly as expected in 2017. We continue to aggressively reduce our inventories and improve our cost position in a category that we believe has significant unrealized potential.”\n“We are confident that our efforts under the Value Creation Plan have strengthened the foundation of our business, and we will build upon these efforts in 2018.”\nAll amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars and results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except where specifically noted.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nRevenues of $292.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $297.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 1.7%.

The Company is targeting implementation of $30 million of productivity-driven annualized enhancements to EBITDA in the first phase of the plan, to be implemented over 2017 and 2018. For 2017, these EBITDA benefits were offset by expenses associated with the Value Creation Plan, including structural investments made in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources, as well as non-structural third-party consulting support, severance and recruiting costs. The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies. Over time, these investments are expected to yield additional improvement in EBITDA beyond the $30 million of initial productivity-driven savings. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company continued to make progress against each of the four pillars of its Value Creation Plan and believes it is on track to achieve targeted productivity enhancements, while continuing to make the necessary structural investments it believes will accelerate growth and drive long-term value. Recent progress on each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan is highlighted below.\nPortfolio Optimization\nThe focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where the Company is not effectively positioned. Recent highlights include:\nNear completion of the expansion project to add incremental freezing capacity, storage, and retail bagging capabilities to the Company’s Mexican frozen fruit facility. This project should enable diversification of the fruit varieties sourced from Mexico, and is expected to drive incremental cost savings, in addition to enhanced profitability from retail bagging capabilities. Began commissioning of the second roasting and processing line at the Company’s organic cocoa facility in Holland. This expansion is expected to approximately double processing capacity in addition to adding new capabilities, all in support of increased demand and future growth opportunities in cocoa. Began commissioning a new oil processing line at the Company’s Bulgarian sunflower facility, which is expected to drive incremental margins through growth and production efficiency. In December, the Company announced a significant investment into its roasted snacks capabilities at its Crookston, MN facility, which also involves a facility closure. The new equipment is expected to come on line in the third quarter of 2018 and will support further growth of a variety of roasted grains and seeds. The discontinuation of flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar operations is substantially complete, production has ceased, and the Company plans to address final closure matters including the sell through of remaining inventory that was pre-built in support of transitioning customers to new suppliers in the first quarter of 2018.\nSince the initiation of the Value Creation Plan, the Company has implemented portfolio changes that are expected to yield approximately $7.9 million of annualized EBITDA benefits.\nOperational Excellence\nThe focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food quality and safety, coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency. The Company expects these efforts to generate productivity improvements and cost savings in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. Recent highlights include:\nContinued to advance food safety and quality efforts across the entire manufacturing footprint including a new partnership with a third party sanitation firm. The SunOpta 360 continuous improvement initiative is well underway, and has been deployed across the Company’s aseptic platform, which is helping to drive an expected 20% improvement in output from existing aseptic lines in 2018, in addition to enhanced production capabilities that will support new value-added non-dairy alternatives. Together with the roll-out of new sales and operations planning tools, within the Consumer Products segment the frozen fruit operations have taken steps to right-size its incoming 2018 crop, which is expected to reduce storage costs, lower working capital, and operationally better prepare the business for the start of the upcoming fruit season. The Mexican fruit processing expansion is enabling incremental counter-seasonal harvest opportunities allowing procurement to leverage lower cost sourcing alternatives. During the quarter, the Company also continued to upgrade talent in plant leadership across the network of manufacturing operations, with approximately 40% of locations now employing new leaders. Continued identification and implementation of productivity initiatives focusing on manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing synergies and effective supply chain management.\nSince the initiation of the Value Creation Plan, the Company has implemented process improvements and cost savings that are expected to yield approximately $6.9 million of annualized EBITDA benefits.\nGo-To-Market Effectiveness\nThe focus of the go-to-market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels, and identify and penetrate new high-potential sales channels. The Company expects efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time. Recent highlights include:\nContinued growth of the pipeline of commercial opportunities across the beverage, fruit and fruit snack categories, with a growing diversity of opportunities across categories and channels where the Company is currently under represented. New sales wins in private label non-dairy beverage into the natural and mass channels, as well as continued growth through innovation into the broadline foodservice channel leveraging a non-dairy control label. Expanded distribution of private label organic and conventional juice. New sales wins in frozen fruit serving mainly the foodservice and industrial channels, as well as commercialization of new custom fruit ingredient formulations, and in contract manufactured fruit snacks. Continued strong re-orders of innovative private label broth, both organic and conventional, into the club and mass channels.\nIn 2017, as part of the Value Creation Plan, the Company has implemented go-to-market improvements through strategic pricing actions expected to yield approximately $1.2 million of annualized EBITDA benefits. In 2018, efforts under the go-to-market pillar are focused on driving incremental sales volume.\nProcess Sustainability\nThe focus of the process sustainability pillar is to ensure the Company has the infrastructure, systems and skills to sustain the business improvements and value captured from the Value Creation Plan. Broadening the skillset and experience of SunOpta’s leadership team is a critical component to the process sustainability pillar of the Value Creation Plan. Recent highlights include:\nContinued to make progress on the ERP implementation project at the Mexican frozen fruit facility and expect the new system to be operational during the second quarter. Revamped the process and tools used for sales and operations planning in the fruit platform, which is expected to drive greater discipline and accuracy into the fruit pack plan, ensuring grower commitments are aligned with commercial demand Upgraded plant and Quality Assurance managers in several facilities across the Company. Continued focus on customer service and working capital levels as S&OP processes and support systems are refined. Hired a new Internal Audit leader, shifting the focus of the audit function towards value-added business process improvements that are designed to support and ensure the Company sustains improvements made as part of the Value Creation Plan.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $292.4 million, a decrease of 1.7% compared to $297.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact on revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 of changes in commodity-related pricing, foreign exchange rates and sales of flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar products, revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 0.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Global Ingredients segment generated revenues from external customers of $130.3 million, a decrease of 1.8% compared to $132.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue reflected lower volumes of domestically sourced specialty soy and corn products, partially offset by higher volumes of organic cocoa, nuts and dried fruit as well as roasted grains and seeds. Excluding the impact on revenues of changes in commodity-related pricing and foreign exchange rates, Global Ingredients revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 3.5%.\nThe Consumer Products segment generated revenues of $162.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1.7% compared to $164.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of commodity-related pricing and sales of resealable pouch and nutrition bar products, Consumer Products revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 3.4% reflecting increased sales of refrigerated and aseptic beverage products, as well as fruit snack products.\nGross profit was $28.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $17.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 9.7% compared to 5.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been approximately 10.1%, excluding the impact of $1.3 million in costs associated with inventories in the flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar operations as a result of the decision to exit these product lines, as compared to a normalized gross margin percentage of 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016. All operating platforms, with the exception of frozen fruit, reported increased gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe improvement in gross profit reflects investments made as part of the Value Creation Plan, especially inside the Company’s beverage and snack product platforms due primarily to lower cost of manufacturing driven by production efficiencies, improved yield, and operational savings from the closure of a juice manufacturing facility as well as the wind down of the bars and pouch operations. These improvements were partially offset by gross profit declines in the frozen fruit platform, which reflected lower volumes, and approximately $2.5 million in incremental costs associated with inventory write-downs and elevated storage and other operational costs due largely to excess inventory levels.\nOperating loss¹ was $3.9 million, or 1.3% of revenues, compared to $10.0 million, or 3.3% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating loss year-over-year is primarily attributable to increased gross profit, offset by increased structural SG&A costs mainly in the areas of sales, marketing, quality, and engineering that have been incurred in support of the Value Creation Plan, as well as a $3.1 million increase in foreign exchange losses, driven mainly by the impact of a stronger euro. Operating loss would have been $1.1 million, or 0.4% of revenues excluding $2.1 million of non-structural costs in SG&A and costs related to plant closures, all incurred in relation to the Value Creation Plan, as well as a $0.5 million gain from the reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense, as compared to a normalized operating income of $0.5 million or 0.2% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ was $9.4 million or 3.2% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $9.4 million or 3.2% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar operations, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 was $10.1 million, compared with $11.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $115.0 million related to the healthy fruit platform, as a result of lower than expected sales and operating performance in frozen fruit since the acquisition of Sunrise Growers in the fourth quarter of 2015, and uncertainty of future sales due to decreased volumes with retail customers and an extended decline in consumer consumption trends.\nThe Company reported a loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $117.5 million, or $1.38 per common share, compared to $33.5 million, or $0.41 per common share during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted loss¹ from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.8 million or a loss of $0.10 per common share, compared to $7.3 million or $0.08 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Please refer to the discussion and table below under “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Earnings/Loss”.\nFiscal 2017 Results\nRevenues for fiscal 2017 were $1,279.6 million, a decrease of 5.0% compared to $1,346.7 million in fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact on revenues for fiscal 2017 of changes in commodity-related pricing, foreign exchange rates, sales of flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar products, and the estimated impact of the recall of certain sunflower kernel products based on shortfall against prior year volumes, revenues in fiscal 2017 decreased by 3.3% compared with fiscal 2016.\nThe Global Ingredients segment generated revenues from external customers of $550.5 million, a decrease of 4.1% compared to $574.3 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in revenue reflected lower roasted volumes due to reduced customer demand following the sunflower recall, decreased commodity pricing for lower volumes of domestically and internationally sourced specialty and organic ingredients, partially offset by increased volumes of nuts, dried fruit, animal feed and cocoa, as well as a favorable foreign exchange rate on euro-dominated sales and increased volumes of domestically-sourced specialty soy and organic feed. Excluding the impact on revenues of changes in commodity-related pricing, foreign exchange rates, and the recall of certain sunflower kernel products, Global Ingredients revenue decreased 1.9% in fiscal 2017, compared with fiscal 2016.\nThe Consumer Products segment generated revenues of $729.1 million during fiscal 2017, a decrease of 5.6% compared to $772.4 million in fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of commodity-related pricing and sales of resealable pouch and nutrition bar products, revenues in fiscal 2017 decreased by 4.5% primarily reflecting lower sales of frozen fruit products and to a lesser extent lower volumes of aseptic beverages, partially offset by increased sales of refrigerated beverages and fruit snacks.\nGross profit was $145.1 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $126.0 million for fiscal 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit for fiscal 2017 was 11.3% compared to 9.4% in fiscal 2016. The gross margin percentage for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately 11.6%, excluding the impact of $2.6 million in costs associated with inventories in the flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar operations as a result of the decision to exit these product lines, $0.7 million in lost margin caused by the sunflower recall, and $0.6 million in facility closure costs under the Value Creation Plan, as compared to a normalized gross margin percentage of 10.9% in fiscal 2016.\nOperating income¹ was $0.8 million, or 0.1% of revenues, compared to $14.7 million, or 1.1% of revenues in fiscal 2016. The decrease in operating on income year-over-year is primarily attributable to increased SG&A costs mainly in support of the Value Creation Plan, as well as a $4.4 million increase in foreign exchange losses. Operating income would have been $27.0 million, or 2.1% of revenues excluding $22.5 million of non-structural costs in SG&A and costs related to plant closures, all incurred in relation to the Value Creation Plan, as well as $0.7 million from the sunflower recall and $0.5 million in benefit from the reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense, as compared to a normalized operating income of $43.6 million or 3.2% of revenues in fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ was $66.8 million or 5.2% of revenues in fiscal 2017, compared to $81.7 million or 6.1% of revenues in fiscal 2016. Excluding flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar operations, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2017 was $72.6 million, compared with $82.9 million for fiscal 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $115.0 million related to the healthy fruit platform, and in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a $17.5 million goodwill impairment charge associated with its sunflower operations.\nThe Company reported a loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 of $135.3 million, or $1.66 per common share, compared to $50.6 million, or $0.61 per common share during fiscal 2016. Adjusted loss¹ from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 was $12.3 million or a loss of $0.14 per common share, compared to adjusted earnings of $5.8 million or $0.07 per common share in fiscal 2016. Please refer to the discussion and table below under “Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Earnings/Loss”.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt December 30, 2017, SunOpta’s balance sheet reflected total assets of $982.2 million and total debt of $462.1 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017 cash provided by operating activities was $48.9 million, compared to $36.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The $12.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities reflects improved operational performance, as well as lower non-structural cash costs incurred in support of the Value Creation Plan. Cash used in investing activities during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $16.8 million, compared to $7.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in cash used reflected a higher level of capital expenditures, due mainly to growth initiatives and portfolio optimization activities.\nConference Call\nSunOpta plans to host a conference call at 9:00 A.M. Eastern time on Tuesday, February 27, 2018, to discuss the fourth quarter financial results. After opening remarks, there will be a question and answer period.

We believe that segment operating income, Adjusted earnings and Adjusted EBITDA assist investors in comparing performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of the Company’s operating performance. The non-GAAP measures of segment operating income, Adjusted earnings and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nIn order to evaluate the Company’s results of operations, we use certain other non-GAAP measures that we believe enhance an investor’s ability to derive meaningful year-over-year comparisons and trends from the results of operations. In particular, we evaluate the Company’s revenues on a basis that excludes the effects of fluctuations in commodity pricing and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we exclude specific items from the Company’s reported results that, due to their nature or size, we do not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. These items are identified in the tables below. These non-GAAP measures are presented solely to allow investors to more fully assess the Company’s results of operations and should not considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for an analysis of the Company’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted Earnings/Loss\nWhen assessing our financial performance, we use an internal measure that excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as other charges and gains that we believe are not reflective of normal operations. This information is provided to allow investors to make meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance between periods and to view the Company’s business from the same perspective as Company management. Adjusted earnings/loss and Adjusted earnings/loss per diluted share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following is a tabular presentation of Adjusted earnings/loss and Adjusted earnings/loss per diluted share, including a reconciliation from loss from continuing operations, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. In addition, due to the exit from flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations, we have prepared these tables in a columnar format to present the effect of these operations on our consolidated results for the current and comparative periods. We believe this presentation assists investors in assessing the results of the operations we have exited and the effect of those operations on our financial performance.\nExcluding flexible Flexible resealable pouch resealable pouch and nutrition bar and nutrition bar Consolidated Per Diluted Per Diluted Per Diluted Share Share Share For the quarters ended $ $ $ $ $ $ December 30, 2017 Loss from continuing operations (110,403 ) (6,996 ) (117,399 ) Less: earnings attributable to non-controlling interests (88 ) - (88 ) Less: dividends and accretion of Series A Preferred Stock (1,961 ) - (1,961 ) Loss from continuing operations available to common shareholders\n(112,452 ) (1.30 ) (6,996 ) (0.08 ) (119,448 ) (1.38 ) Adjusted for: Goodwill impairment (a) 115,000 - 115,000 Costs related to the Value Creation Plan (b) 4,139 10,546 14,685 Reversal of stock-based compensation (c) (546 ) - (546 ) Other (d) 276 - 276 Net income tax effect (e) (5,772\n) (4,113 ) (9,885\n) Change in unrecognized tax benefits (f) (452 ) - (452 ) Impact of change in enacted U.S. corporate tax rates (g) (8,437\n) - (8,437\n) Adjusted loss (8,244 ) (0.10 ) (563 ) (0.01 ) (8,807 ) (0.10 ) December 31, 2016 Loss from continuing operations (32,187 ) (1,239 ) (33,426 ) Add: loss attributable to non-controlling interests (50 ) - (50 ) Less: dividends and accretion of Series A Preferred Stock (1,812 ) - (1,812 ) Loss from continuing operations available to common shareholders\n(34,049 ) (0.40 ) (1,239 ) (0.01 ) (35,288 ) (0.41 ) Adjusted for: Goodwill impairment (h) 17,540 - 17,540 Costs related to Value Creation Plan (i) 7,543 - 7,543 Inventory reserves and liquidation sales to de-risk positions (j) 3,428 - 3,428 Product withdrawal and recall costs (k) 3,013 - 3,013 Costs related to business acquisitions (l) 1,871 - 1,871 Other (m) 443 - 443 Net income tax effect on adjusted earnings (e) (5,840 ) - (5,840 ) Adjusted loss (6,051 ) (0.07 ) (1,239 ) (0.01 ) (7,290 ) (0.08 ) (a) Reflects the impairment of goodwill associated with the Healthy Fruit reporting unit of the Consumer Products operating segment.
