    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Donatos Pizza announced two hires, naming Kevin Myers as Chief Marketing and Information Officer (CMIO) and Amos Durbin as Vice President of Franchise Operations. Both new hires have a February 13, 2018 start date.\n\"We have a mission to make a difference in the communities we serve, and with added franchise growth and sales, we'll be able to make an even greater impact,\" said Tom Krouse, president and CEO of Donatos. \"The additions of Kevin and Amos, leaders of their respective industries, empower us to better serve our franchise partners, our customers and our communities.\"\nMyers joins Donatos following an impressive career in both the marketing and technology industries, including tenure as executive vice president of marketing and sales at global retail food leader Cold Stone Creamery. In this role, he was responsible for the marketing strategy that led Cold Stone Creamery to grow from a few hundred stores to over 1,400 across 10 countries, resulting in a $500 million business. As CMIO, Myers will lead marketing, IT and technology for Donatos focusing on converting data to both influence and elevate Donatos' customer experience.\n\"Companies must focus on connecting the whole brand with the data their customers provide in order to better serve its audience and attract new consumers,\" said Myers. \"I'm thrilled to be able to use my past experience to integrate Donatos marketing and technology for a more robust customer experience as restaurant technology continues to evolve.\"\nOver the past few years, the pizza company has refined its market entry strategy and simplified operations, opening eight new stores across seven new markets. Driving increased market entry and saturation through highly successful stores is a key tactic that allows Donatos to compete and innovate with greater speed and efficiency.\nAs vice president of franchise operations, Durbin will lead franchise growth and streamline operations. Prior to joining Donatos, he was vice president of franchise operations at dineEquity where he represented IHOP in the family dining segment, supporting 16 district managers and two directors of operations across 68 restaurants. Before dineEquity, he worked more than 12 years at Red Robin where he led five district managers supporting 32 restaurants with $106 million in revenue and opened 108 new restaurants.\n\"With 159 stores across nine states, Donatos has already demonstrated significant success, all without sacrificing the consistency and high quality its known for,\" said Durbin. \"Franchise growth is the important piece that will take Donatos to the next level in terms of sales and market presence, and the whole company is rallying behind not only meeting but exceeding growth goals. The excitement is infectious and I look forward to working with the company to make its presence and operations even stronger throughout new and existing markets.\"\nTo support the eight to 10 store openings throughout the Midwest and Southeast territories in the next year, Donatos veteran Tim Young will be promoted to director, new store opening success, a newly-created role that is dedicated to fostering the success of new stores and attracting new franchise partners. Additionally, Karen Kuntz, will be promoted from Franchise Business Consultant to Senior Franchise Business Consultant.\nAbout Donatos Pizza\nDonatos Pizza, founded in 1963 by Jim Grote, is family-owned and operated and headquartered in Columbus Ohio.
