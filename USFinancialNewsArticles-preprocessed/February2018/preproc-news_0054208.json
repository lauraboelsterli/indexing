    "text": "If you want to cut back on food costs but still eat well, there's a simple solution: Go homemade.\nThat's what I did for a series of Cash Diet challenges , which tested my ability to stretch my dollar at the grocery store .\nWhile each challenge was different, all in all, I fed myself on about $50 a week, or $7 a day, and still managed to eat good, balanced meals. Not bad considering $7 in New York City will get you half a meal at any standard restaurant or one drink during happy hour.\nIf you're looking to trim your grocery bill — to $50 a week or just less than what you're spending now — here are my best tips for making it happen.\nshow chapters Simple money habits that will help you build wealth in 2017 7:24 PM ET Tue, 28 March 2017 | 01:02 1. Start by figuring out how much you spend Do you know exactly how much you spent on groceries last month? If not, look at your credit card statements or sort through your receipts. Use the data to form an estimate and then aim to cut that number.\nThe average four-person family loses about $1,500 a year on wasted food, so chances are, you're over-purchasing in some way. But you can't lower your bills if you don't know how much you're spending in the first place, so crunch the numbers and then set a goal like cutting your total by 25 percent.\n2. Plan your meals and make a list Before heading to the store, think about all the meals you want to prepare for the week and make a list of the ingredients you'll need for them. Then, when you're actually shopping , stick to the list. If you do, you won't spend unnecessarily on any impulse buys.\nOnce you have all the ingredients you need for the week, prepare as many meals in advance as you can. I've found that I'm much less inclined to order in or go out when I have my dinner prepped and waiting for me in the fridge.\nshow chapters Here's how to make your own boozy brunch for less than $5 a person 8:05 AM ET Wed, 3 Jan 2018 | 03:08 3. Go cash-only This will forever be my favorite money-saving tip . Here's how it works: If you want to keep your grocery bill at $50 a week, bring $50 in cash, and no more, to the store. Leave your credit cards at home if you think you'll be tempted to use them.\nIf you have the discipline to spend just the cash you've allowed yourself, going cash-only is a foolproof way to stick to any budget.\nLike this story?
