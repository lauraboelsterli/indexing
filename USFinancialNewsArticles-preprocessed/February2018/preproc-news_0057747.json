    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 3:41 PM / Updated 42 minutes ago Greek PM to proceed with mini cabinet reshuffle in coming hours - govt sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read ATHENS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Greeceâ€™s government was poised to announce a cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, a government official said, in a move expected to keep key ministers of finance and foreign affairs in their posts. A mini cabinet reshuffle was expected after Dimitri Papadimitriou, who held the national economy and development portfolio, stepped down on Tuesday. He followed the exit after his wife, a junior labour minister, quit in the midst of controversy over claiming a rent allowance, angering Greeks hit by years of austerity.
