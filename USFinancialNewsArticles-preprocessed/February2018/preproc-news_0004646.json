We have been investing in the future by enlarging and renewing our drybulk fleet; during the past 12 months, Navios Partners expanded its drybulk fleet by 37% and reduced the average age of this fleet by 12%. In a recovering market, we are positioned to generate significant free cash flow.”\nFleet Renewal Program\nAcquisition of Two Panamax Vessels in 2018\nIn January 2018, Navios Partners agreed to acquire two 2006-built Panamax vessels of approximately 74,500 dwt each, for a total purchase price of $22.0 million. The vessels are expected to be delivered to Navios Partners' owned fleet within the first quarter of 2018. One of the vessels is chartered out for $9,375 net per day until May/November 2018 and the other vessel is chartered out for $9,844 net per day until March/August 2018.\nAgreement to Charter – in a Vessel\nIn November 2017, Navios Partners entered into a 10-year bareboat charter-in agreement for a Kamsarmax vessel of approximately 81,000 dwt.

The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which a vessel is capable of generating revenues. (2\n)\nOperating days is the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues.\n(3 ) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Partners’ vessels were available for revenue generating available days, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure efficiency in finding employment for vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs, drydockings or special surveys. (4 ) TCE rate: Time Charter Equivalent rate per day is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during the period. The TCE rate per day is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to present the actual daily earnings generated by vessels on various types of charter contracts for the number of available days of the fleet.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income/(loss) attributable to Navios Partners’ unitholders before interest and finance costs, before depreciation and amortization (including intangible accelerated amortization) and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before equity compensation expense, loss on sale of vessel, impairment losses and allowance for doubtful accounts, reactivation costs, write-off of deferred finance charges and gain on change in control. Navios Partners uses Adjusted EBITDA as a liquidity measure and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA in this document is calculated as follows: net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets, (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities, (iii) net interest cost, (iv) amortization and write-off of deferred finance charges and other related expenses, (v) allowance for doubtful accounts, (vi) equity in net earnings of affiliated companies, (vii) payments for drydock and special survey costs, (viii) gain/(loss) on sale of assets/subsidiaries, (ix) impairment charges, (x) non-cash accrued interest income and amortization of deferred revenue, (xi) gain/(loss) on debt repayments, (xii) equity compensation expense, (xiii) gain on change in control and (xiv) noncontrolling interest. Navios Partners believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are each the basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and presents useful information to investors regarding Navios Partners’ ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and make cash distributions. Navios Partners also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used: (i) by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding certain items, as described under “Earnings Highlights.”\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Partners’ results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Partners’ performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\n2. Operating Surplus\nOperating Surplus represents net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash interest expense, estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures and one-off items. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain over the long term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, Navios Partners’ capital assets.\nOperating Surplus is a quantitative measure used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Operating Surplus is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered a substitute for net income, cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\n3. Available Cash\nAvailable Cash generally means for each fiscal quarter, all cash on hand at the end of the quarter:\n• less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors to:\n• provide for the proper conduct of Navios Partners’ business (including reserve for maintenance and replacement capital expenditures);\n• comply with applicable law, any of Navios Partners’ debt instruments, or other agreements; or\n• provide funds for distributions to the unitholders and to the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters;\n• plus all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. Working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under any revolving credit or similar agreement used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners. Available Cash is a quantitative measure used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Available cash is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered a substitute for net income, cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\n4.
