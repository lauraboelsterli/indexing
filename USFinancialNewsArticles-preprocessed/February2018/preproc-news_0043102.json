Net income attributable to MGP Class A shareholders for the quarter was $8.7 million, or $0.12 per dilutive share and the year ended December 31, 2017 was $41.8 million, or $0.67 per dilutive share.\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2017:\nRental revenue was $185.6 million; Net income was $31.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Funds From Operations (1) (\"FFO\") was $116.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Adjusted Funds From Operations (2) (\"AFFO\") was $139.1 million, or $0.52 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Adjusted EBITDA (3) was $184.4 million; expenses were $4.0 million; and Acquisition-related costs were $16.2 million, related to the acquisition of the long-term leasehold interest and real property improvements associated with MGM National Harbor casino resort, primarily related to real estate transfer tax and title fees.\nFinancial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nRental revenue was $675.1 million; Net income was $166.0 million for the year, or $0.66 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; FFO was $460.5 million for the year, or $1.84 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; AFFO was $501.3 million for the year, or $2.01 per diluted Operating Partnership unit; Adjusted EBITDA was $669.8 million for the year; and expenses were $12.2 million.\nOn October 5, 2017, MGP completed the purchase of the long-term leasehold interest and real property improvements associated with MGM National Harbor casino resort for consideration consisting of the assumption of $425 million of debt, $462.5 million of cash and the issuance of 9.8 million Operating Partnership units to a subsidiary of MGM Resorts International (\"MGM Resorts\"). The assumed debt was repaid in connection with the transaction. Following the transaction, MGM Resorts' indirect ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership is 73.4%.\n\"2017 was a very successful second year for MGP. We completed the acquisition of the real property of MGM National Harbor which further diversifies our portfolio and is another step in executing on our strategy,\" said James Stewart, CEO of MGM Growth Properties. \"In the coming year, we will continue to pursue opportunities to selectively add leisure assets that are financially attractive to our portfolio. Sustainably growing our dividend and creating value for our shareholders over the long term remain our top priority.\"\nMGM National Harbor was added to the existing Master Lease between MGM Resorts and MGP. As a result, the annual rent under the Master Lease increased by $95 million from $661.7 million to $756.7 million, pro rated for the remainder of the 2017 lease year.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of MGP's net income to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(In thousands, except unit and per unit amounts)\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet income\n$\n31,723\n$\n165,990\nDepreciation\n69,882\n260,455\nProperty transactions, net\n14,918\n34,022\nFunds From Operations\n116,523\n460,467\nAmortization and write-off of financing costs and cash flow hedge amortization\n3,049\n12,511\nNon-cash compensation expense\n393\n1,336\nNet effect of straight-line rent and amortization of deferred revenue\n1,753\n4,063\nAcquisition-related expenses\n16,245\n17,304\nAmortization of above market lease, net\n171\n686\nProvision for income taxes\n1,003\n4,906\nAdjusted Funds From Operations\n139,137\n501,273\nInterest income\n(868)\n(3,907)\nInterest expense\n49,177\n184,175\nAmortization of financing costs and cash flow hedges\n(3,049)\n(11,713)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n184,397\n$\n669,828\nWeighted average Operating Partnership units outstanding\nBasic\n265,684,823\n249,451,258\nDiluted\n265,833,366\n249,634,668\nNet income per Operating Partnership units outstanding\nBasic\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.67\nDiluted\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.66\nFFO per Operating Partnership unit\nDiluted\n$\n0.44\n$\n1.84\nAFFO per Operating Partnership unit\nDiluted\n$\n0.52\n$\n2.01\nFinancial Position\nThe Company had $259.7 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017.

Management believes that this is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation and amortization expense and management believes that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of the Company's operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to further supplement AFFO and FFO and to provide investors a performance metric which excludes interest expense. In addition to non-cash items, the Company adjusts AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA for acquisition-related expenses. While we do not label these expenses as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, management believes that it is helpful to adjust for these expenses when they do occur to allow for comparability of results between periods because each acquisition is (and will be) of varying size and complexity and may involve different types of expenses depending on the type of property being acquired and from whom.\nFFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per unit, AFFO, AFFO per unit and Adjusted EBITDA as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.\nReconciliations of net income to FFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this release.\nAbout MGM Growth Properties\nMGM Growth Properties LLC (NYSE:MGP) is one of the leading publicly traded real estate investment trusts engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts, whose diverse amenities include casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail offerings.
