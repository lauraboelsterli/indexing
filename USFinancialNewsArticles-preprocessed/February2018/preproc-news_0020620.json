    "text": "WOONSOCKET, R.I., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFourth Quarter Year-over-year Highlights:\nNet revenues increased 5.3% to $48.4 billion GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.22 Adjusted EPS of $1.92, excluding $1.5 billion income tax benefit resulting from tax reform\nFull Year Highlights:\nNet revenues increased 4.1% to $184.8 billion GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations of $6.45 Adjusted EPS of $5.90, excluding $1.5 billion income tax benefit resulting from tax reform Generated cash flow from operations of $8.0 billion; free cash flow of $6.4 billion\n2018 Guidance:\nAt least $275 million of benefit from tax reform allocated to strategic investments in growth of our business, reducing adjusted operating profit growth by 250 basis points Updated full-year adjusted operating profit growth to down 1.5% to up 1.5% Provided first quarter adjusted operating profit growth of 0.5% to 4.5%\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo stated, \"In 2017, we delivered on the four-point plan we set in place to return to more robust levels of growth. Our position in the evolving health care landscape is stronger than ever before, and we remain confident in our model and in our ability to make health care more affordable, more accessible and more effective.\"\nRevenues\nNet revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 5.3%, or $2.4 billion, to approximately $48.4 billion, up from $46.0 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased 4.1%, or $7.3 billion, to approximately $184.8 billion, up from $177.5 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 9.3% to approximately $34.2 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by growth in pharmacy network and specialty pharmacy volume as well as brand inflation, partially offset by continued price compression and increased generic dispensing. Pharmacy network claims processed during the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 8.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, to 389.7 million, compared to 360.2 million in the prior year period. The increase in pharmacy network claim volume was primarily due to an increase in net new business. On a 30-day equivalent basis, mail choice claims processed during the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 5.9% to 69.0 million, compared to 65.2 million in the prior year. The increase in mail choice claim volume was driven by continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice ® offerings and an increase in specialty pharmacy claims. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 8.9% to approximately $130.6 billion, compared to approximately $120.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues in the Retail/LTC Segment increased 0.3% to approximately $20.9 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily driven by an increase in same store prescriptions of 2.5%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, and brand inflation, partially offset by an increase in the generic dispensing rate and continued reimbursement pressure. The previously-announced restricted networks that exclude CVS Pharmacy had a negative impact of approximately 320 basis points on same store prescription volumes for the three months ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenues in the Retail/LTC Segment decreased 2.1% to $79.4 billion, compared to $81.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, and same store prescription volumes increased 0.4%, on a 30-day equivalent basis. The previously-announced restricted networks that exclude CVS Pharmacy had a negative impact of approximately 420 basis points on same store prescription volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSame store sales increased 0.1% and pharmacy same store sales increased 0.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, both same store sales and pharmacy same store sales decreased 2.6%. Pharmacy same stores sales were negatively impacted by approximately 340 and 390 basis points due to recent generic introductions in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nFront store same store sales declined 0.7% in the three months ended December 31, 2017, and were positively impacted 80 basis points by seasonal cough and cold. Front store same store sales were negatively impacted by softer customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, partially offset by an increase in basket size. For the year ended December 31, 2017, front store same store sales declined 2.6%.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the generic dispensing rate increased approximately 80 basis points to 86.9% in our Pharmacy Services Segment and increased approximately 160 basis points to 86.8% in our Retail/LTC Segment, compared to the same quarter in the prior year.\nOperating Profit\nConsolidated operating profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased $108 million, or 3.6%, to $3.1 billion. The increase was partially due to improvement in gross profit in the Pharmacy Services Segment as result of a favorable shift in the timing of Medicare Part D profits between the third and fourth quarters of 2017, when compared to 2016, as well as growth in network and specialty volume, and favorable purchasing economics. In addition, the Retail/LTC Segment gross profit increased, largely driven by improvements in front store margin. The improvements in operating profit were also due to a $50 million decrease in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs as well as a $30 million decrease in store rationalization costs. These improvements were offset by increases in operating expenses associated with new store openings, and by a $46 million goodwill impairment of our RxCrossroads reporting unit. This impairment was triggered by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\"), enacted in December 2017, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of this change in rates, RxCrossroads' deferred income tax liabilities decreased and its net assets increased. RxCrossroads was subsequently sold on January 2, 2018 below its net asset value.\nConsolidated operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased $849 million, or 8.2%, to $9.5 billion. The decline was primarily driven by the previously-announced restricted networks that exclude CVS Pharmacy and continued pricing and reimbursement pressure in the Pharmacy Services Segment and Retail/LTC Segment. The decrease in operating profit was also due to an increase in operating expenses as a result of charges of $215 million associated with the closure of 71 retail stores in connection with our enterprise streamlining initiative, goodwill impairment charges of $181 million related to the RxCrossroads reporting unit within the Retail/LTC Segment, $57 million of hurricane related expenses which were predominately in the Retail/LTC Segment, and new store openings. The increase in operating expenses also reflects the absence of a 2016 reversal of an accrual of $85 million, in the Pharmacy Services Segment, in connection with legal settlements. These increases in operating expenses in 2017 were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $226 million, since the bulk of the integration costs associated with the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. (\"Omnicare\") were incurred in 2016.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nNet income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased $1.6 billion or 92.6%, to $3.3 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income increased $1.3 billion or 24.5%, to $6.6 billion. The increase in both periods is primarily due to the income tax benefit of $1.5 billion associated with the TCJA. Among other changes to existing tax laws, the TCJA reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which reduced the Company's net deferred income tax liabilities. This was partially offset by the operating profit changes discussed above. Additionally, net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, includes $56 million of bridge financing costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Aetna Inc. (\"Aetna\") which is included in interest expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, includes $187 million in losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans which are included in other expense. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $643 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (\"GAAP diluted EPS\") for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $3.22, compared to $1.59 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share (\"Adjusted EPS\") for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $1.92 and $1.71, respectively. Further detail is shown in the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation later in this release.\nGAAP diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $6.45 compared to $4.91 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, was $5.90 and $5.84, respectively. Further detail is shown in the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation later in this release.\nGuidance\nMr. Merlo stated, \"We enter 2018 with the foundation to propel us to win across all of our businesses. I'm very pleased with the strong PBM selling season we had, with gross client wins of $6.2 billion, and our retail collaborations are expected to drive solid performance in our pharmacies. I'm also pleased with the progress we've made in providing superior value for patients, payors, and providers, and we look forward to the opportunities ahead to improve upon our progress.\"\nThe Company revised its 2018 guidance to reflect the effects of the tax reform achieved through the TCJA. In addition to debt reduction, the Company is dedicating a portion of the benefits to additional investments in employees, data analytics, care management solutions, and service offering enhancements, a portion of which will be capitalized. The impact to the Company's 2018 consolidated operating profit is expected to be at least $275 million.\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Denton stated, \"With $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be able to make strategic investments in our business in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term, and our updated guidance reflects this. These investments will accelerate our ability to continue to improve health outcomes and lower costs for patients. Additionally, we will spend at least half of the benefits on debt reduction as we look to lower our leverage ratio.\"\nAs a result of these investments, the Company's previous adjusted consolidated operating profit growth guidance of 1.0% to 4.0% for the full-year 2018 has been updated to down 1.5% to up 1.5%.\nThe Company expects to deliver adjusted consolidated operating profit growth of 0.5% to 4.5% for the first quarter of 2018.\nCVS Health is providing non-GAAP information on a prospective basis that excludes certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing this information enhances investors' understanding of the Company's performance. This information should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. CVS Health's definitions of these non-GAAP items may not be comparable to similarly-titled measurements reported by other companies.\nAdjusted operating profit is operating profit excluding the impact of acquisition-related integration costs, charges in connection with store rationalization, goodwill impairments, and adjustments to legal reserves in connection with certain legal settlements. Adjusted operating profit guidance, in addition to excluding the foregoing items, also excludes transaction costs related to the proposed acquisition of Aetna, as well as transaction costs for the divestiture of RxCrossroads. The Company believes that this measure enhances investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance with its current and expected performance. The most comparable GAAP measure is operating profit.\nAs there is uncertainty in connection with calculating the adjustments necessary to prepare reconciliations of adjusted operating profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, to the comparable GAAP financial measure, the Company is unable to provide these reconciliations without unreasonable efforts. The items, including, in particular, the additional excluded items identified above, could result in significant adjustments from the most comparable GAAP measure. Therefore, no reconciliations are being provided at this time.\nReal Estate Program\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company opened 65, closed 13 and relocated five retail locations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company opened 175, closed 81 and relocated 30 retail stores. As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 9,803 retail locations, including pharmacies in Target Corporation (\"Target\") stores, in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.\nTeleconference and Webcast\nThe Company will be holding a conference call today for the investment community at 8:30 am (ET) to discuss its quarterly results.

The Company uses the non-GAAP measures \"Adjusted EPS\" and \"Free Cash Flow\" to assess and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP measures enhances investors' understanding of the Company's performance.\nThe Company defines Adjusted Earnings per Share, or Adjusted EPS, as income from continuing operations excluding the impact of certain adjustments such as the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, acquisition-related bridge financing costs, transaction costs in connection with divestures of subsidiaries, goodwill impairments, charges in connection with store rationalization, losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans, adjustments to legal reserves in connection with certain legal settlements, and losses on early extinguishments of debt and any other items specifically identified herein, divided by the Company's weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company believes that this measure enhances investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance with its current performance.\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to property and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal comparisons and finds it useful in assessing year-over-year cash flow performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income before income tax provision as a measure of our performance. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Company's definitions of Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share\n(Unaudited)\nThe following is a reconciliation of income before income tax provision to Adjusted EPS:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIncome before income tax provision\n$\n2,809\n$\n2,753\n$\n8,268\n$\n8,637\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nAmortization of intangible assets\n209\n202\n817\n795\nAcquisition-related transaction and integration costs (1)\n34\n84\n65\n291\nAcquisition-related bridge financing costs (2)\n56\n—\n56\n—\nTransaction costs in connection with divestiture of subsidiary (3)\n9\n—\n9\n—\nGoodwill impairments (4)\n46\n—\n181\n—\nCharges in connection with store rationalization (5)\n4\n34\n215\n34\nLosses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans\n—\n—\n187\n—\nAdjustments to legal reserves in connection with certain legal\nsettlements (6)\n—\n(88)\n—\n(85)\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n—\n643\nAdjusted income before income tax provision\n3,167\n2,985\n9,798\n10,315\nAdjusted income tax provision (7)\n1,213\n1,149\n3,733\n3,982\nAdjusted income from continuing operations\n1,954\n1,836\n6,065\n6,333\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n—\n—\n(1)\n(2)\nAdjusted income allocable to participating securities\n(5)\n(9)\n(22)\n(31)\nAdjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS\nHealth\n$\n1,949\n$\n1,827\n$\n6,042\n$\n6,300\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n1,018\n1,069\n1,024\n1,079\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n1.92\n$\n1.71\n$\n5.90\n$\n5.84\n(1) In 2017, transaction costs relate to the proposed acquisition of Aetna and integration costs relate to the acquisition of Omnicare.
