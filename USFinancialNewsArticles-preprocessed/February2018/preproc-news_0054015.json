    "text": "* NSE index up 0.71 pct, BSE index 0.64 pct higher\n* Both indexes set to end week slightly lower\n* Federal Bank gains after stake buy approval\nBy Tanvi Mehta\nFeb 23 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Friday, tracking broader Asia after comments from a Federal Reserve official eased worries about faster rate hikes in the United States and sparked a rebound in recently hit sectors such as drug makers.\nIndian stock markets have been under pressure recently amid continued worries about the fallout from a $1.77 billion fraud that hit Punjab National Bank, and concerns that the central bank could soon move to raise interest rates to contain accelerating inflation.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1 percent. U.S. benchmark 10-year note yields were last yielding 2.929 percent, after rising to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday.\n“U.S. bond yields have fallen and so sentiment is higher,” said Anita Gandhi, whole time director, Arihant Capital Markets.\n“Price correction has happened to a large extent in pharma, so market is looking at some value buying.”\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.71 percent at 10,456.65 as of 0614 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.64 percent higher at 34,035.57.\nBoth indexes were poised to end the week marginally lower.\nThe Nifty Pharma index rose as much as 2.8 percent in its biggest intraday percentage gain since Feb. 8. It had declined about 8 percent since the start of the year, as of Thursday’s close.\nFinancials also gained, with HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank among the biggest contributors to the rise.\nFederal Bank climbed as much as 5.2 percent after the bank on Thursday approved buying a stake in financial services company Equirus Capital.
