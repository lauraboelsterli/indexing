    "text": "Kezie Okpala hit a lead-lengthening jumper with 1:09 to go and Josh Sharma recorded a key block down the stretch as Stanford held on to beat California 77-73 in Pacific-12 Conference action Sunday night in Berkeley, Calif.\nThe win allowed Stanford (14-13, 8-6) to avenge a 77-74 home loss to its San Francisco Bay Area rival in the conference opener in December.\nCal (8-19, 2-12) has lost 12 of 13 since that win.\nAfter the Cardinal extended a 37-36 halftime lead to 63-55 by holding the Bears to just four field goals over a nearly 10-minute stretch of the second half, Cal scratched back within 73-72 on a Justice Sueing jumper with 1:38 to play.\nOkpala then connected for the Cardinal to re-establish a three-point lead, and Cal never got another field goal, thanks in part to Sharma blocking Don Coleman’s layup attempt with 12 seconds left.\nDorian Pickens gave Stanford its final four-point margin of victory with two free throws with eight seconds remaining, and the Cardinal held on to snap a two-game losing streak.\nDaejon Davis had a game-high 22 points to lead Stanford, which had lost its previous four road games. The freshman guard also collected seven rebounds and a game-high five assists.\nReid Travis recorded a double-double for the Cardinal with 13 points and a game-high 10 rebounds, while Pickens finished with 17 points and Michael Humphrey finished with 11.\nStanford won despite committing 16 turnovers.\nColeman led Cal with 17 points, while Marcus Lee grabbed a team-high nine rebounds to complement 15 points for the Bears, who had won their most recent home game 74-70 over Oregon State.\nSueing had 15 points and Juhwan Harris-Dyson 13 for Cal, which shot just 37.1 percent from the field and connected on just three of its 18 3-point attempts.\nThe Bears entered the game as the Pac-12’s worst team in field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and scoring.\nStanford built its one-point halftime lead on the strength of Davis’ 3-pointer and two free throws in the final minute of the first period.\nThe Cardinal led by as many as eight in the half, coming initially when Humphrey and Pickens hit 3-pointers in an 8-0, game-opening run.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
