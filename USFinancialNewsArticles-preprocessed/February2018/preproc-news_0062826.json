The decline was primarily driven by the impact of divestitures, and lower volumes in the U.S. Diversified Products segment, attributed to the previously reported loss of exclusivity for a basket of products, and the Ortho Dermatologics business. Revenues were also negatively affected by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The decline was partially offset by higher volumes in our Bausch + Lomb/International segment, primarily the U.S. Consumer Products business, and increased international pricing in our Bausch + Lomb/International segment.\nRevenues by segment were as follows:\nFourth-Quarter 2017\n(in millions)\n4Q 2017\n4Q 2016\nReported\nChange\nReported\nChange\nChange at\nConstant\nCurrency 4\nOrganic 2\nChange\nSegment\nBausch + Lomb/International\n$1,226\n$1,261\n($35)\n(3%)\n(5%)\n4%\nBranded Rx\n$602\n$744\n($142)\n(19%)\n(19%)\n(8%)\nU.S. Diversified Products\n$335\n$398\n($63)\n(16%)\n(16%)\n(12%)\nTotal Revenues\n$2,163\n$2,403\n($240)\n(10%)\n(11%)\n(2%)\nFull-Year 2017\n(in millions)\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nReported\nChange\nReported\nChange\nChange at\nConstant\nCurrency 4\nOrganic 2\nChange\nSegment\nBausch + Lomb/International\n$4,871\n$4,927\n($56)\n(1%)\n0%\n6%\nBranded Rx\n$2,475\n$2,828\n($353)\n(12%)\n(12%)\n(6%)\nU.S. Diversified Products\n$1,378\n$1,919\n($541)\n(28%)\n(28%)\n(27%)\nTotal Revenues\n$8,724\n$9,674\n($950)\n(10%)\n(9%)\n(4%)\nBausch + Lomb/International Segment\nBausch + Lomb/International segment revenues were $1.226 billion 2017, as compared to $1.261 billion 2016, a decrease of $35 million, or 3%. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, the Bausch + Lomb/International segment grew organically 2 by approximately 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBausch + Lomb/International segment revenues were $4.871 billion for the full year of 2017, as compared to $4.927 billion for the full year of 2016, a decrease of $56 million, or 1%. Excluding the impact of divestitures of $240 million, primarily the skin care divestiture 5 , and foreign exchange, the Bausch + Lomb/International segment grew organically 2 by approximately 6% compared to the full year of 2016, driven primarily by our International Rx, Global Consumer and Global Vision Care businesses.\nBranded Rx Segment\nBranded Rx segment revenues were $602 million 2017, as compared to $744 million 2016, a decrease of $142 million, or 19%. The Salix business grew revenue by 3% and generated organic growth 2 of 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBranded Rx segment revenues were $2.475 billion for the full year of 2017, as compared to $2.828 billion for the full year of 2016, a decrease of $353 million, or 12%. The decrease primarily reflects lower volumes in the Ortho Dermatologics business, and the impact of divestitures of $194 million, particularly from the divestiture of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals. Compared to the full year of 2016, the Salix business grew revenue by 2% and generated organic growth 2 of 5%.\nU.S. Diversified Products Segment\nU.S. Diversified Products segment revenues were $335 million 2017, as compared to $398 million 2016, a decrease of $63 million, or 16%.\nU.S. Diversified Products segment revenues were $1.378 billion for the full year of 2017, as compared to $1.919 billion for the full year of 2016, a decrease of $541 million, or 28%. The decline was primarily driven by decreases attributed to the previously reported loss of exclusivity for a basket of products.\nOperating Income/Loss\nOperating loss was $322 million 2017, as compared to an operating income of $150 million 2016, a decrease of $472 million.\nOperating income was $102 million for the full year of 2017, as compared to an operating loss of $566 million for the full year of 2016, an improvement of $668 million. The improvement in our operating results for the full year of 2017 reflects gains from divestitures, lower operating expenses, the net decrease in non-cash charges for impairments and net favorable adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration. The improvement was partially offset by lower revenues coming from divestitures, the U.S. Diversified Products segment due to the loss of exclusivity for a basket of products, and the Ortho Dermatologics business.\nIncome Tax\nIn 2017 the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $4.145 billion, which was primarily attributed to an internal tax reorganization effort, which began in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was completed in the third quarter of 2017, and provisional benefits related to changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nNet Income\nNet income 2017 was $513 million, as compared to a net loss of $515 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $1.028 billion.\nNet income for the full year of 2017 was $2.404 billion, as compared to a net loss of $2.409 billion for the full year of 2016, an improvement of $4.813 billion. The change in net income for the full year of 2017 is mainly attributed to an increase in the benefit from income taxes, as described above.\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) the fourth quarter of 2017 was $347 million, as compared to $443 million 2016, a decrease of $96 million. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the full year of 2017 was $1.349 billion, as compared to $1.916 billion for the full year of 2016, a decrease of $567 million.\nOperating Cash\nCash provided by operating activities was $578 million 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.290 billion for the full year of 2017, as compared to $2.087 billion for the full year of 2016, an increase of $203 million, or 10%. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to improvements in operating expenses and working capital.\nEPS\nGAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) Diluted 2017 was $1.45, as compared to ($1.47) 2016. GAAP EPS Diluted for the full year of 2017 was $6.83, as compared to ($6.94) for the full year of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $875 million 2017, as compared to $1.047 billion 2016, a decrease of $172 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $3.638 billion for the full year of 2017, as compared to $4.305 billion for the full year of 2016, a decrease of $667 million. The decline for the full year of 2017 was primarily driven by lower revenues coming from divestitures, the U.S. Diversified Products segment due to the loss of exclusivity for a basket of products, and the Ortho Dermatologics business. The decline was partially offset by organic growth 2 in the Bausch + Lomb/International segment and the Salix business, and improved management of operating expenses.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nValeant has provided guidance for the full year of 2018, as follows:\nFull-Year Revenues in the range of $8.10 – $8.30 billion Full-Year Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in the range of $3.05 – $3.20 billion\nOther than with respect to GAAP Revenues, the Company only provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. In periods where significant acquisitions or divestitures are not expected, the Company believes it might have a basis for forecasting the GAAP equivalent for certain costs, such as amortization, which would otherwise be treated as non-GAAP to calculate projected GAAP net income (loss). However, because other deductions (such as restructuring, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt and litigation and other matters) used to calculate projected net income (loss) vary dramatically based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income (loss) at this time. The amount of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected GAAP net income (loss) being materially less than projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP).\nAdditional Highlights\nValeant's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (including non-current) were $797 million at Dec. 31, 2017 The Company's availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2017 During the fourth quarter of 2017, Valeant's corporate credit ratings were revised to stable by Moody's Investors Service and remained unchanged by other ratings services\nConference Call Details\nDate:\nWednesday, Feb. 28, 2018\nTime:\n8:00 a.m. EST\nWeb cast:\nhttp://ir.valeant.com/events-and-presentations\nParticipant Event Dial-in:\n(844) 428-3520 (North America)\n(409) 767-8386 (International)\nParticipant Passcode:\n5287247\nReplay Dial-in:\n(855) 859-2056 (North America)\n(404) 537-3406 (International)\nReplay Passcode:\n5287247 (replay available until April 28, 2018)\nAbout Valeant\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

As a result of that evaluation, new management identified the following primary financial performance measures for the Company: GAAP Revenues (measure for both guidance and actual results), GAAP Net Income (measure for actual results), Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (measure for both guidance and actual results) and GAAP Cash Flow from Operations (measure for actual results). These measures were selected as the Company believes that these measures most appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and incentives.\nUse of Non-GAAP Generally\nTo supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures including (i) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), (ii) organic growth and (iii) constant currency. As discussed below, we also provide certain information about Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) to provide supplemental information to readers. Management uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics in the evaluation of company performance and the consolidated financial results and, in part, in the determination of cash bonuses for its executive officers. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our Company. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors and, in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data, the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors.\nHowever, these measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP nor do they have any standardized meaning under GAAP. In addition, other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation. They should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe reconciliations of these historic non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in the tables below. However, as indicated above, for guidance purposes, the Company does not provide reconciliations of projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to projected GAAP net income (loss), due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.\nSpecific Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is GAAP net income (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) adjusted for certain items, as further described below. Management of the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), along with the GAAP measures used by management, most appropriately reflect how the Company measures the business internally and sets operational goals and incentives, especially in light of the Company's new strategies. In particular, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) focuses management on the Company's underlying operational results and business performance. As a result, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) both to assess the actual financial performance of the Company and to forecast future results as part of its guidance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is a useful measure to evaluate current performance. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is intended to show our unleveraged, pre-tax operating results and therefore reflects our financial performance based on operational factors. In addition, commencing in 2017, cash bonuses for the Company's executive officers and other key employees are based, in part, on the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) targets.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nRestructuring and integration costs: Since 2016 and for the foreseeable future, while the Company has undertaken fewer acquisitions, the Company has incurred additional restructuring costs as it implements its new strategies, which will involve, among other things, improvements to our infrastructure and other operational improvements, internal reorganizations and impacts from the divestiture of assets and businesses. With regard to infrastructure and operational improvements which the Company has taken to improve efficiencies in the businesses and facilities, these tend to be costs intended to right size the business or organization that fluctuate significantly between periods in amount, size and timing, depending on the improvement project, reorganization or transaction. As a result, the Company does not believe that such costs (and their impact) are truly representative of the underlying business. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items provide supplemental information with regard to the sustainability of the Company's operating performance, allow for a comparison of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance and, as a result, provide useful supplemental information to investors. Acquired in-process research and development costs: The Company has excluded expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development, as these amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing, size and nature of acquisitions. Furthermore, as these amounts are associated with research and development acquired, they are not a representation of the Company's research and development efforts during the period. Asset Impairments: The Company has excluded the impact of impairments of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangibles, as well as impairments of assets held for sale, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions and divestitures. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the Company's operating performance. Although the Company excludes intangible impairments from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Share-based Compensation: The Company excludes the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense assists investors in the comparisons of operating results to peer companies. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. Acquisition- related adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expense: The Company has excluded the impact of acquisition-related contingent consideration non-cash adjustments due to the inherent uncertainty and volatility associated with such amounts based on changes in assumptions with respect to fair value estimates, and the amount and frequency of such adjustments is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of the Company's acquisitions, as well as the nature of the agreed-upon consideration. In addition, the Company has excluded the impact of fair value inventory step-up resulting from acquisitions as the amount and frequency of such adjustments are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of its acquisitions. Loss on extinguishment of debt: The Company has excluded loss on extinguishment of debt as this represents a cost of refinancing our existing debt and is not a reflection of our operations for the period. Further, the amount and frequency of such charges are not consistent and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions and other factors in the debt market out of management's control. Other Non-GAAP Charges: The Company has excluded certain other amounts, including integration related inventory and technology transfer costs, CEO termination costs, legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with recent legal and governmental proceedings, investigations and information requests respecting certain of our distribution, marketing, pricing, disclosure and accounting practices, litigation and other matters, net (gain)/loss on sale of assets, acquisition-related transaction costs and certain costs associated with the wind-down of the arrangements with Philidor Rx Services, LLC (\"Philidor\"). In addition, the Company has excluded certain other expenses that are the result of other, non-comparable events to measure operating performance. These events arise outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Given the unique nature of the matters relating to these costs, the Company believes these items are not normal operating expenses. For example, legal settlements and judgments vary significantly, in their nature, size and frequency, and, due to this volatility, the Company believes the costs associated with legal settlements and judgments are not normal operating expenses. In addition, as opposed to more ordinary course matters, the Company considers that each of the recent proceedings, investigations and information requests, given their nature and frequency, are outside of the ordinary course and relate to unique circumstances. The Company believes that the exclusion of such out-of-the-ordinary-course amounts provides supplemental information to assist in the comparison of the financial results of the Company from period to period and, therefore, provides useful supplemental information to investors. However, investors should understand that many of these costs could recur and that companies in our industry often face litigation.\nFinally, to the extent not already adjusted for above, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) reflects adjustments for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).\nCommencing in 2017, the Company assessed the methodology with which it was calculating these non-GAAP measures and made updates where it deemed appropriate to better reflect the underlying business. As a result, commencing with the first-quarter actual results of 2017, there are certain differences in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) between the current presentation and the historic presentation. In particular, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) no longer includes adjustments for foreign exchange gain/loss arising from intercompany transactions. For the purposes of the Company's actual results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2016, the Company has calculated and presented Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) using the historic methodologies in place as of the applicable historic dates; however, the Company has also provided a reconciliation that calculates Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) using the new methodology, to allow investors and readers to evaluate Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) on the same basis for the periods presented.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) (non-GAAP)\nHistorically, management has used adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for which is GAAP net income (loss)) for strategic decision making, forecasting future results and evaluating current performance. This non-GAAP measure excludes the impact of certain items (as further described below) that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. By disclosing this non-GAAP measure, it was management's intention to provide investors with a meaningful, supplemental comparison of the Company's operating results and trends for the periods presented. It was management's belief that this measure was also useful to investors as such measure allowed investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same tools that management had used to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. Accordingly, it was the Company's belief that adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) was useful to investors in their assessment of the Company's operating performance and the valuation of the Company. It is also noted that, in recent periods, our GAAP net income was significantly lower than our adjusted net income (non-GAAP). Commencing in 2017, new management of the Company identified and began using certain new primary financial performance measures to assess Company financial performance. As a result, the Company no longer uses or relies on adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) in assessing the financial performance of the Company. However, a reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) is presented in the tables below for the information of readers to provide readers comparable information for prior periods.\nIn addition to certain of the adjustments described above (namely restructuring and integration costs, acquired in-process research and development costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, acquisition-related adjustments, excluding amortization, and other non-GAAP charges), adjusted net income (non-GAAP) also reflects adjustments based on the following additional items:\nAmortization of intangible assets: The Company has excluded the impact of amortization of intangible assets, as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. The Company believes that the adjustments of these items correlate with the sustainability of the Company's operating performance. Although the Company excludes amortization of intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Tax: The Company has included the tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments using an annualized effective tax rate of 13.2%.\nAs indicated above, commencing in 2017, the Company assessed the methodology with which it was calculating these non-GAAP measures and made updates where it deemed appropriate to better reflect the underlying business. As a result, commencing with the first-quarter results of 2017, there are certain differences in the calculation of adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) between the current presentation and the historic presentation. In particular, adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) no longer includes foreign exchange gain/loss arising from intercompany transactions and amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts. In addition, as of the third quarter of 2016, adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) no longer includes adjustments for the following items: Depreciation resulting from a PP&E step-up resulting from acquisitions and previously accelerated vesting of certain share-based equity adjustments. For the purposes of the Company's actual results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2016, the Company has calculated and presented adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) using the historic methodologies in place as of the applicable historic dates; however, the Company has also provided a reconciliation that calculates adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) using the new methodology, to allow investors and readers to evaluate as adjusted net income (loss) on the same basis for the periods presented.\nOrganic Growth\nOrganic Growth, a non-GAAP metric, is defined as an increase on a period-over-period basis in revenues on a constant currency basis (if applicable) excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations.\nOrganic Growth is growth in GAAP Revenue (its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) adjusted for certain items, as further described below, of businesses that have been owned for one or more years. The Company uses organic revenue and organic growth to assess performance of its business units and operating and reportable segments, and the Company in total, without the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations and recent acquisitions, divestitures and product discontinuations. The Company believes that such measures are useful to investors as it provides a supplemental period-to-period comparison.\nOrganic revenue growth reflects adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and (ii) the revenues associated with acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations of businesses divested and/ or discontinued. These adjustments are determined as follows:\nForeign currency exchange rates: Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates are part of our business, they are not within management's control. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business. The impact for changes in foreign currency exchange rates is determined as the difference in the current period reported revenues at their current period currency exchange rates and the current period reported revenues revalued using the monthly average currency exchange rates during the comparable prior period. Acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations: In order to present period-over-period organic revenues (non-GAAP) on a comparable basis, revenues associated with acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations are adjusted to include only revenues from those businesses and assets owned during both periods. Accordingly, organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth excludes from the current period, revenues attributable to each acquisition for twelve months subsequent to the day of acquisition, as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable prior period. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth excludes from the prior period (but not the current period), all revenues attributable to each divestiture and discontinuance during the twelve months prior to the day of divestiture or discontinuance, as there are no revenues from those businesses and assets included in the comparable current period.\nConstant Currency\nChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar may affect the Company's financial results and financial position. To assist investors in evaluating the Company's performance, we have adjusted for foreign currency effects. Constant currency impact is determined by comparing 2017 reported amounts adjusted to exclude currency impact, calculated using 2016 monthly average exchange rates, to the actual 2016 reported amounts.\nPlease also see the reconciliation tables below for further information as to how these non-GAAP measures are calculated for the periods presented.\n1\nPlease see the tables at the end of this news release for a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure.\n2\nOrganic growth, a non-GAAP metric, is defined as an increase on a period-over-period basis in revenues on a constant currency basis (if applicable) excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, divestitures and discontinuations.\n3\nProvisional name\n4\nTo assist investors in evaluating the Company's performance, we have adjusted for changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Change at constant currency, a non-GAAP metric, is determined by comparing 2017 reported amounts adjusted to exclude currency impact, calculated using 2016 monthly average exchange rates, to the actual 2016 reported amounts.\n5\nIn March 2017, Valeant sold the CeraVe®, AcneFree® and AMBI® brands, which had been reported within the Bausch + Lomb/International segment, as part of the skin care divestiture to L'Oréal.\nFINANCIAL TABLES FOLLOW\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.\nTable 1\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nProduct sales\n$\n2,133\n$\n2,368\n$\n8,595\n$\n9,536\nOther revenues\n30\n35\n129\n138\nTotal revenues\n2,163\n2,403\n8,724\n9,674\nCost of goods sold (exclusive of amortization and impairments of\nintangible assets)\n637\n655\n2,506\n2,572\nCost of other revenues\n10\n10\n42\n39\nSelling, general and administrative\n639\n665\n2,582\n2,810\nResearch and development\n90\n93\n361\n421\nAmortization of intangible assets\n775\n658\n2,690\n2,673\nGoodwill impairments\n—\n28\n312\n1,077\nAsset impairments\n85\n28\n714\n422\nRestructuring and integration costs\n10\n54\n52\n132\nAcquired in-process research and development costs\n—\n—\n5\n34\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration\n8\n(31)\n(289)\n(13)\nOther expense (income), net\n231\n93\n(353)\n73\n2,485\n2,253\n8,622\n10,240\nOperating (loss) income\n(322)\n150\n102\n(566)\nInterest income\n3\n2\n12\n8\nInterest expense\n(448)\n(467)\n(1,840)\n(1,836)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(57)\n—\n(122)\n—\nForeign exchange and other\n20\n(45)\n107\n(41)\nLoss before (benefit from) provision for income taxes\n(804)\n(360)\n(1,741)\n(2,435)\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n(1,316)\n152\n(4,145)\n(27)\nNet income (loss)\n512\n(512)\n2,404\n(2,408)\nLess: Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(1)\n3\n—\n1\nNet income (loss) attributable to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.\n$\n513\n$\n(515)\n$\n2,404\n$\n(2,409)\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.\nTable 2\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP)\nFor the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to Valeant Pharmaceuticals\nInternational, Inc.\n$\n513\n$\n(515)\n$\n2,404\n$\n(2,409)\nNon-GAAP adjustments: (a)\nAcquisition-related adjustments excluding amortization of intangible assets (b)(d)\n8\n(31)\n(289)\n33\nAmortization of intangible assets\n775\n658\n2,690\n2,673\nRestructuring and integration costs\n10\n54\n52\n132\nAcquired in-process research and development costs\n—\n—\n5\n34\nGoodwill impairments\n—\n28\n312\n1,077\nAsset impairments\n85\n28\n714\n422\nOther non-GAAP adjustments (c)(d)\n237\n100\n(310)\n208\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts (d)\n—\n29\n—\n118\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n57\n—\n122\n—\nForeign exchange and other (d)\n—\n28\n—\n14\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments\n(1,338)\n64\n(4,351)\n(386)\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments\n(166)\n958\n(1,055)\n4,325\nAdjusted net income attributable to Valeant Pharmaceuticals\nInternational, Inc.
