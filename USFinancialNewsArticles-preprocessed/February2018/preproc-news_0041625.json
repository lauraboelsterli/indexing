There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which occurred along the southern frontier of the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory. In response, an Israeli tank struck an observation post in Gaza, causing no injuries. Israeli media said it was the highest number of Israelis wounded in a single attack since the 2014 Gaza war.
