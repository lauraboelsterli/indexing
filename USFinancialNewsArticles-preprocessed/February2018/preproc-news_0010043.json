    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adtalem Global Education (NYSE: ATGE), a leading global education provider, today reported academic, operating and financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017, including enrollment results at Carrington College, Chamberlain University, its medical and veterinary schools and DeVry University/Keller Graduate School of Management.\n“Our revenue profile and growth outlook continue to improve as we execute on our strategic plan,” said Lisa Wardell, president and CEO of Adtalem Global Education. “We are expanding our presence across our core sectors and directing our resources toward the most promising revenue opportunities within our verticals. Everything we do is centered on increasing the value proposition we provide to our students and their employers, while positioning our portfolio to grow in a profitable and sustainable manner. Our strong cash flow generation, healthy financial position and increasing operating leverage support our ongoing commitment to balanced capital allocation that includes returning capital to our fellow owners.”\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\nSelected financial data for the three months ended December 31, 2017:\nRevenue of $337.2 million increased 1.0 percent compared to the prior year Net loss of $81.2 million compared to net income of $14.4 million in the prior year; net income from continuing operations excluding special items was $47.3 million, compared to $41.1 million in the prior year Diluted loss per share was $1.33, compared to earnings per share of $0.23 in the prior year; diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items was $0.76, compared to $0.64 in the prior year Operating cash flow for the first six months of fiscal year 2018 was $49.6 million, compared to $41.5 million in the prior year Cash and cash equivalents were $212.2 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $197.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Outstanding bank borrowings were $165.0 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $225.0 million as of December 31, 2016 Approximately 1.14 million shares of common stock were repurchased during the second quarter of fiscal 2018\nDuring the second quarter, Adtalem signed an agreement to transfer ownership of DeVry University to Cogswell Education LLC. The agreement is subject to certain terms and conditions to be met during the transition process, including regulatory and accreditor approval, and the transaction is anticipated to be completed in early fiscal year 2019. As a result of this transaction, DeVry University has been classified as a discontinued operation. Adtalem recorded an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $25.4 million in the second quarter, which includes $47.2 million of pre-tax charges related to impairment of intangible and long-lived assets.\nThe fiscal 2018 second quarter results contained special items for restructuring charges of $2.6 million (pre-tax) related to workforce reductions and real estate consolidations at Carrington and Adtalem’s home office, and tax expense of $101.2 million related to adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nSegment Highlights\nMedical and Healthcare Segment\nSecond quarter segment revenue of $203.3 million increased 0.9 percent compared to the prior year, with growth at Chamberlain University partially offset by decreased revenue at the medical and veterinary schools. Chamberlain revenue in the quarter increased 1.9 percent from the prior year to $115.1 million, while revenue for the medical and veterinary schools decreased 0.3 percent from the prior year to $88.2 million.\nSecond quarter operating income for the segment was $55.0 million, representing an increase of 5.6 percent from the prior year.\nAmerican University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) reopened its campus in St. Maarten in January, following repairs to address the damage caused by Hurricane Irma. Ross University School of Medicine (RUSM) in Dominica continues to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Maria, and students have been temporarily relocated to Knoxville, Tenn. at a campus owned by Lincoln Memorial University.\nAdditional expenses in the second quarter related to maintaining alternative teaching sites for both AUC and RUSM and remediating the property damage to the campuses in St. Maarten and Dominica were largely offset by received and committed reimbursements under Adtalem’s insurance policies, after deductibles, which were met during the first quarter.\nProfessional Education\nSecond quarter segment revenue increased 10.9 percent compared to the prior year to $30.4 million, driven by growth from Association of Certified Anti Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS). Segment operating income for the second quarter was $2.2 million, up from $0.1 million in the prior year driven by revenue growth at ACAMS.\nIn the second quarter, ACAMS’ revenue increased 62 percent with particularly strong results coming from the Asia Pacific region, as well as solid gains generated through expanding partnerships in Europe.\nTechnology and Business\nSecond quarter segment revenue increased 2.4 percent to $75.1 million compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue in the segment grew 0.9 percent. Segment operating income in the second quarter increased 3.8 percent over the prior year to $14.0 million as a result of revenue growth and cost efficiencies.\nUS Traditional Postsecondary\nSecond quarter segment revenue declined 10.5 percent to $29.0 million compared to the prior year. An operating loss of $5.8 million was reported in the second quarter compared to an operating loss of $6.3 million in the prior year. Excluding special items, the segment reported an operating loss of $4.7 million for the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $3.9 million in the prior year.\nCarrington showed improvement in new student enrollment in the quarter, which was up 7.2 percent, highlighting the efforts to revise the institution’s program offerings and marketing efforts.\nAdtalem Outlook\nFiscal 2018 third quarter revenue is expected to increase 3 to 4 percent compared to the prior year. Revenue growth within the Medical and Healthcare, Professional Education and Technology and Business segments is expected to offset declining revenue within the US Traditional Postsecondary segment. Third quarter operating costs before special items are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent compared to the prior year. Third quarter expenses may be impacted by the timing of the receipt of insurance proceeds for the reimbursement of hurricane-related expenses.\nFiscal 2018 full year revenue is expected to increase 1 to 2 percent compared to the prior year and earnings growth from continuing operations before special items is expected to be 10 to 12 percent compared to the prior year. Full year capital spending is expected to be in the $60 to $65 million range, excluding hurricane-related spending. The effective income tax rate on continuing operations for the fiscal year is expected to be in the range of 16 to 17 percent, before special items. Adtalem’s outlook excludes potential charges related to restructuring plans and the pending sale of DeVry University.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAdtalem will hold a conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings on Tuesday, February 6, at 4 p.m. CST (5 p.m. EST).

During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2017, Adtalem recorded special items related to the following: (i) Restructuring charges primarily related to real estate consolidations at Carrington and Adtalem's home office in order to align its cost structure with enrollments; and (ii) Charges related to regulatory settlement agreements. In addition, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the operating results of DeVry University are reclassified as discontinued operations for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2017. The following tables illustrate the effects of the discontinued operations and special items on Adtalem’s operating income and net income. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of operating income and net income excluding the discontinued operations and special items provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Adtalem’s ongoing operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the special nature of discontinued operations, restructuring charges and regulatory settlements. Adtalem uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its management and budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Adtalem’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
