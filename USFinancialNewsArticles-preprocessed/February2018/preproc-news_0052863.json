    "text": "Trump says chief of staff Kelly will decide on Kushner security clearance Published 1 Hour Ago Reuters Jonathan Ernst | Reuters White House senior advisor Jared Kushner (C) looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump (R) delivers remarks at the White House in Washington, September 26, 2017. \nPresident Donald Trump said on Friday that White House chief of staff John Kelly will decide whether Trump son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner gets a security clearance. \nKushner has been operating under an interim security clearance for the past year while his financial background was investigated, and he has yet to be cleared for a full clearance. A week ago Kelly set a Friday deadline for resolving the cases of Kushner and dozens of administration officials like him. \n\"I will let General Kelly make that decision and he's going to do what's right for the country and I have no doubt he'll make the right decision,\" Trump said about the Kushner case at a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
