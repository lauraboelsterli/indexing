    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 3:41 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago Bayer offers to sell global vegetable seeds business in Monsanto deal - sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ) plans to sell its global vegetable seeds business and allow BASF ( BASFn.DE ) exclusive access to its digital farming data in a bid to address EU antitrust worries about its $63.5 billion (45.20 billion pounds) purchase of Monsanto ( MON.N ), three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. \nThe German drug and crop chemical maker submitted its offer last week after the European Commission said the deal may reduce competition in pesticides, seeds and plant traits such as herbicide tolerance and insect resistance. \nBayer clinched a deal in October last year to sell its seed and herbicide businesses to BASF for 5.9 billion euros (5.12 billion pounds).
