    "text": "CHICAGO, DialogTech , the world's leading provider of marketing analytics for inbound calls, today announced that Chief Operating Officer Doug Kofoid has been appointed Chief Executive Officer. Kofoid's appointment follows founder Irv Shapiro's decision to transition from CEO to Executive Chairman. The move comes at a time of accelerated growth for DialogTech, which analyzes more than 60 million minutes of voice conversations each month for businesses that rely on inbound calls to drive growth.\n\"I handpicked Doug for the COO role 13 months ago with this very promotion in mind,\" said Shapiro. \"To continue our exceptional growth, having an expert in martech/adtech at the helm of the organization is imperative. And that's what we get with Doug. He shares my vision to provide the world's biggest companies with the data and insights they need to convert inbound calls into revenue, while improving the entire customer experience. Today, DialogTech serves more Fortune 50 clients than any company in our space, and Doug is a critical part of that success.\"\nIn its first 10 years, DialogTech pioneered the science of call attribution, conversation analytics and caller experience optimization, becoming the leading provider in the industry. Thousands of the world's most recognized brands offering urgent or considered purchases – emergency services such as health care or pest control, high-cost products such as cars or cruises and high-consideration purchases such as financial or elderly care services – use DialogTech to optimize their marketing to generate more qualified calls and improve the quality of those customer interactions.\nKofoid joined DialogTech as COO in 2017 from Publicis Groupe, where he was President of Global Solutions, responsible for strategy, innovation and development of digital marketing product portfolio, including the data and technology operations. Prior to Publicis, he was Director of Search Operations for Google/DoubleClick. He has over 20 years of executive experience in digital marketing.\n\"I am as humbled by this elevation as I am excited,\" said Kofoid. \"Irv pioneered an entirely new martech discipline when he launched DialogTech to deliver call analytics. By recognizing the insights that marketers could capture and leverage from customer conversations, he changed the game for companies who grow revenue by creating a better, more personalized experience. We are looking at our best year on record in 2018, and I'm thrilled to build on the momentum that Irv and the incredible DialogTech team have achieved.\"\nAs Executive Chairman at DialogTech, Shapiro will continue to help shape the strategic direction and trajectory of the company he founded in 2006. A self-proclaimed serial entrepreneur, Shapiro founded Metamor Technologies and the online education platform Edventions prior to launching DialogTech. Both companies were successfully sold. An inductee into the Chicago Area Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame, Shapiro has won numerous awards for leadership and tech innovation.\nAbout DialogTech\nDialogTech provides actionable marketing analytics for businesses that value inbound calls.
