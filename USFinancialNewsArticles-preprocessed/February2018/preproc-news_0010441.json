    "text": "A judge in Michigan on Monday sentenced former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to up to 125 years in prison on three additional charges in Michigan related to his sexual abuse of girls and women during medical treatment sessions.\n\nThe effective life sentence—the minimum doctor could serve on the three counts is 40 years—will run concurrently with the 40- to 175-year term he received last month from a judge in another Michigan county, on similar charges. Dr. Nassar is currently serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison...
