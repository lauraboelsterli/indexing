We defined Adjusted EBITDA as net loss from continuing operations before taxes plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) depreciation, (iii) amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation and (v) certain identified expenses that are not expected to recur or be representative of future ongoing operation of the business. These further adjustments are itemized above. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in the presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nCompany Contact:\nInuvo, Inc.\nWally Ruiz, Chief Financial Officer\n501-205-8397\nwallace.ruiz@inuvo.com\nInvestor Contact:\nKCSA Strategic Communications\nValter Pinto, Managing Director\n212-896-1254\nvalter@kcsa.com\nSource:Inuvo Inc.",
