    "text": "FRANKFURT, Feb 9 (Reuters) - HNA’s stake in Deutsche Bank through shares and financial instruments dipped to 9.2 percent from 9.9 percent as of Feb. 2, Deutsche Bank said on Friday.\nBut HNA “will continue to be a significant investor in Deutsche Bank”, a spokesman for HNA’s holding said.\nThe change announced on Friday is technical in nature, according to C-Quadrat, which oversees HNA’s holding. It said the level of voting rights in Germany’s largest lender could fluctuate “due to changes in direct holdings and financial instruments”.\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
