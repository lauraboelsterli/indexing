This outlook implies consolidation of Yandex.Taxi with Uber’s operations in Russia and neighbouring countries starting from Feb. 7, 2018, but excludes the effect of potential deconsolidation of Yandex.Market.”\n* “We expect our Search and Portal rouble-based revenue to grow in the range of 18 percent to 20 percent in the full year 2018 compared with 2017.” Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: ($1 = 56.8250 roubles)\nReporting by Moscow Newsroom\n ",
