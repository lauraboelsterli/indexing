    "text": "BRISTOL, Conn., Truli Media Group, Inc., which is in the process of changing its name to Truli Technologies, Inc. (OTC:TRLI), a company focused on the development and acquisition of technology that solves industry challenges through connection, fluidity of business transactions and engagement, today is providing shareholders an update on its wholly-owned subsidiary, VocaWorks , and newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Miles Jennings.\nVocaWorks is seeking to disrupt the traditional staffing industry with an on-demand, cloud-based, online and mobile hiring platform, connecting technology professionals with some of the world’s most innovative emerging growth companies. With one-tap notifications, user profiles, and full project tracking, VocaWorks will bring a new level of engagement and simplicity to the recruitment and onboarding of talented consultants for project-based hiring needs. The platform is currently in development with expectations to launch online and mobile versions by the end of the 2018 second quarter.\nVideo: Hire Technical Talent with VocaWorks\nPer Staffing Industry Analysts’ “Global Staffing Industry Market Estimates and Forecast” report, the overall staffing industry is a $428 billion industry, with eighty-nine percent of revenue was generated via temporary staffing . The traditional, service-focused strategy of staffing firms has been deployed for decades with little evolution, often leaving the employers unsure about what talent is available for projects and relying heavily on the service agencies to procure talent. Additionally, third party agencies can be expensive, not web-enabled and do not usually provide price transparency. VocaWorks will bring a new level of engagement and simplicity to the recruitment and on-boarding of talented consultants for project-based hiring needs. Hiring will be efficient, transparent, without risk of hiring full-time and less expensive than other means of recruitment.\nThe Company appointed Miles Jennings as Chief Executive Officer. Miles is an entrepreneur, investor, founder, and CEO of companies focused on technology platform development and Internet marketing. Miles founded Recruiter.com in 2010 and built it into a leading career site and jobs marketplace that makes specialized direct hire recruiting scalable and more manageable. An early social media advocate, Miles created many of the most significant professional groups on LinkedIn and other platforms, with over 3 Million members and an active community. He has appeared in the WSJ, Entrepreneur, Inc., Mashable, Forbes, and hundreds of other business publications on the topics of entrepreneurship, education, careers, and marketing.\nMiles Jennings, Chief Executive Officer of Truli, commented, “The traditional staffing industry is a significantly large and important industry that has largely struggled to adopt technology into their business models. There is a desperate need for technology that will provide transparency, simplicity, and efficiency for employers. Our target audience is the tech start-up or small to mid-sized company such as a retailer or bank, where technology is vital to its operations to support, and that are searching for outsourced talent to augment their in-house staff. Today, we are in the final stages of our web development, with extensive discussions with strategic partners to continue building our talent pool of technology professionals for employers.”\nAbout Truli Media Group, Inc.:\nTruli Media Group, Inc. is focused on the development and acquisition of technology that solves industry challenges through connection, fluidity of business transactions and engagement.
