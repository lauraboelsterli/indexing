    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus ( AIR.PA ) expects to decide this year whether to increase output of the A350 jet, together with plans already under examination to increase single-aisle output to 70 planes a month from the planned rate of 60, said Chief Executive Tom Enders.\nEnders also said he expects that Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ) will start delivering CSeries jets to Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) “very soon” after Bombardier won a trade ruling against Boeing ( BA.N ).\nAirbus has agreed to buy majority control of the loss-making jet program from Bombardier, and plans to assemble U.S.-bound CSeries jets at its plant in Alabama in future.\nThese plans are unaffected, Enders told a news conference in Toulouse on Thursday.\nReporting by Tim HepherEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
