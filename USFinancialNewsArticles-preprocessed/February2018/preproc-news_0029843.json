(ITI) , closed during January 2018.\nColodny Fass handled the extensive negotiations, due diligence and documentation entailed in the transaction.\nLed by regulatory transactions lawyer Tim West , Managing Partner Mike Colodny and Associate Brittany Alexander , Colodny Fass worked closely with Canadian Brant Fisher of EBT Chartered Accountants LLP, and Reginald Bolton of the Canadian law firm of Bolton Bishop Bowman to resolve related compliance issues for its client, STS.\nIn its announcement of the deal, ITI explained that the acquisition will significantly expand its product offering and distribution capabilities to the United States and Canada.
