    "text": "Travis Konecny scored two goals, Jakub Voracek, Claude Giroux and Ivan Provorov added one each and the Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Montreal Canadiens 5-3 Thursday night at the Wells Fargo Center.\nShayne Gostisbehere earned three assists while Giroux also recorded two assists for the Flyers, who remain in the top wild-card spot in the standings.\nGoaltender Brian Elliott stopped 25 shots for the Flyers.\nArtturi Lehkonen, Logan Shaw and Brendan Gallagher scored one goal apiece for the Canadiens.\nCarey Price allowed four goals on 27 shots for Montreal.\nAfter a scoreless first period, the Flyers struck first when they took advantage of a turnover in the neutral zone. Giroux and Sean Couturier found Konecny, who tapped the puck home for a 1-0 lead 42 seconds into the second.\nThe Canadiens tied the game 1-1 with a spectacular short-handed goal by Lehkonen with 10:51 remaining in the second. Lehkonen stole the puck, broke free and ripped a shot into the top right hand corner of the net for his third goal in the last two games.\nThe Flyers allowed their ninth short-handed goal, tied for the most in the league.\nPhiladelphia took the lead 28 seconds later when Giroux connected on the power play for a 2-1 advantage.\nLate in the period, the Flyers began scuffling in their own zone and it resulted in Montreal tying the game 2-2 when Shaw equalized with 1:11 left.\nVoracek put the Flyers ahead 3-2 on the power play when he fired a shot which deflected off Price and into the net just 27 seconds into the third.\nKonecny registered his second goal of the game for a quick two-goal advantage 1:01 later. The puck was loose behind Price, and Konecny was able to tap it into the net for his career-best 13th of the season. It was Konecnyâ€™s seventh goal in the last nine games.\nScott Laughton was whistled for holding, and Gallagher responded with a power-play goal, his 19th of the season, to get the Canadiens within 4-3 at 17:06.\nProvorov scored a late empty-net goal with a length-of-the-ice shot to secure the win for the Flyers.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
