See \"Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Recent 2018 Operational Highlights\nStrengthened leading mobile portfolio, launched new self-developed hit mobile titles across global audiences including: Knives Out: Accumulated over 100 million registered users to date and has been recommended by Google Play Store in over 10 countries since its launch in November 2017. Terminator 2: Judgment Day: Accumulated over 80 million registered users to date, and the global release of Rules of Survival, has been ranked as one of the most popular games on the iOS platform and Google Play Store across multiple countries, including the U.S market, since its launch in November 2017. Popular games such as Japanese-themed RPG Forever 7 launched in November 2017 and highly-anticipated MMORPG Chu Liuxiang launched in January 2018. Successfully introduced Mojang's Minecraft in China across all platforms with early monetization progressing well. Invigorated the popularity of Onmyoji and expanded its international reach with the release of a new content update, successful launch in Thailand in November 2017 and introduction of a new MOBA version in January 2018, which was well-received by players. Reinforced strength of flagship titles with stable performances from self-developed games such as PC-client game Fantasy Westward Journey Online and mobile game Invincible. Progressed pipeline diversification strategy with upcoming games including asymmetrical battle arena game Identity V, RPG Sky and 2.5D casual battle arena game Alive.\n\"2017 marked another year of progress with growth across each of our core business segments year-over-year. Our total net revenues for the year increased by 41.7% as we brought a number of new blockbuster online games to audiences across the globe, considerably scaled our e-commerce business and further grew our landmark advertising services and e-mail and others business lines,\" said Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer and Director of NetEase. \"For the fourth quarter, our total net revenues continued to grow year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Although a few mobile titles such as Onmyoji and the mobile version of New Ghost experienced a decline, we have introduced new content for these games to attract players. During the fourth quarter, we held substantial promotions to support the successful launch of our new battle arena games Knives Out, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Rules of Survival. We also made additional investments to further scale our thriving e-commerce businesses. We believe these strategic investments provide us with extended reach and momentum to support our future long-term growth.\n\"Our business remains strong and our 2018 initiatives to bring exciting new titles to our robust and diverse portfolio of self-developed games are well underway. To expand our reach, we will also seek partnerships with other industry leaders to bring mobile and PC-client games to audiences worldwide. Our e-commerce businesses and advertising services are also thriving, with e-commerce accounting for approximately 22% of our total net revenues in 2017. We will continue to expand our Kaola.com and Yanxuan e-commerce platforms in 2018 along with our other business segments where we see opportunities to generate value for our shareholders, as well as serve and grow our community of users by providing best-in-class online content and services,\" Mr. Ding concluded.\nChange in Segment Reporting\nEffective as of December 31, 2017, the Company changed its segment disclosure to separately report the financial results of its e-commerce business in light of the significant growth of the revenue contribution from e-commerce to the Company's total consolidated net revenues in 2017. This segment primarily reflects the results of NetEase's two e-commerce platforms, Kaola.com and Yanxuan, which were established in January 2015 and April 2016, respectively. The Company now reports four reporting segments: online game services, e-commerce, advertising services, and e-mail and others. This change in segment reporting aligns with the manner in which the Company's operating decision maker (\"CODM\") currently receives and uses financial information to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of reporting segments. This change in segment presentation does not affect consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company retrospectively revised prior period segment information to conform to current period presentation.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB14,607.6 million (US$2,245.2 million), compared to RMB12,477.8 million and RMB12,099.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nNet revenues from online games were RMB8,004.4 million (US$1,230.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB8,111.7 million and RMB8,959.1 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Mobile games accounted for approximately 68.0% of net revenues from online games for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 68.3% and 64.4% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nNet revenues from e-commerce were RMB4,653.7 million (US$715.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2,667.5 million and RMB1,691.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nNet revenues from advertising services were RMB736.6 million (US$113.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB631.4 million and RMB664.8 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.

The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to the one-off recognition of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was partially offset by increased staff-related costs. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross profit margins was mainly due to increased staff-related costs.\nGross profit margin for e-commerce for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7.4%, compared to 11.5% and 12.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in e-commerce gross profit margin were primarily due to the larger-scale promotions and certain sales discounts in the fourth quarter of 2017, such as Singles Day on November 11, 2017.\nGross profit margin for advertising services for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 71.2%, compared to 68.0% and 66.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in gross profit margin were mainly due to NetEase's enhanced monetization efforts and better economies of scale.\nGross loss margin for e-mail and others for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.3%, compared to gross profit margin of 13.1% and 46.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases in gross margin were primarily due to the decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as the one-off recognition of expense related to certain copyrights in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB4,317.8 million (US$663.6 million), compared to RMB3,397.9 million and RMB2,596.6 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in operating expenses were mainly due to increased selling and marketing expenses and research and development investments, and higher staff-related costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to NetEase's e-commerce businesses. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB393.3 million (US$60.4 million), compared to RMB294.8 million and RMB177.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded a net income tax charge of RMB290.4 million (US$44.6 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB225.5 million and RMB882.0 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.2%, compared to 8.1% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the fact that certain subsidiaries of the Company were recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2016. The Company recognized related tax credits in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017 accordingly.\nNet Income After Tax\nNet income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.3 billion (US$197.6 million), compared to RMB2.5 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.9 billion (US$288.8 million), compared to RMB3.0 billion and RMB4.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had a net foreign exchange loss of RMB159.1 million (US$24.5 million), compared to a net foreign exchange loss of RMB109.9 million and a net foreign exchange gain of RMB90.5 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in foreign exchange gains and losses were mainly due to unrealized exchange gains and losses arising from the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances as the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the RMB fluctuated over the periods.\nNetEase reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$1.50 and US$1.49, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$2.95 and US$2.93, respectively, for the preceding quarter, and basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$4.31 and US$4.28, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates\" and similar statements. The accuracy of these statements may be impacted by a number of business risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated, including risks related to: the risk that the online game market will not continue to grow or that NetEase will not be able to maintain its leading position in that market, which could occur if, for example, its new online games or expansion packs and other improvements to its existing games do not become as popular as management anticipates; the ability of NetEase to successfully expand its mobile internet offerings; the ability of NetEase to effectively market its games and other services and achieve a positive return on its marketing expenditures; the risk that NetEase's affiliates will not be able to continue operating Minecraft, World of Warcraft ® , StarCraft ® II, Hearthstone ® , Diablo ® III: Reaper of Souls ™ , Heroes of the Storm ® , Overwatch ® or other games licensed by it for a period of time or permanently due to possible governmental actions or the risk that such games will not be popular with game players in China; the risk that changes in Chinese government regulation of the online game market and the market for NetEase's e-commerce businesses may limit future growth of NetEase's revenues or cause revenues to decline; competition in the online advertising business and the risk that investments by NetEase in its content and services may not increase the appeal of the NetEase websites among internet users or result in increased advertising revenues; the risk that NetEase may not be able to continuously develop new and creative online services, including its ability to maintain and enhance the popularity of its e-mail, mobile and e-commerce businesses and develop attractive mobile games; the risk that NetEase will not be able to control its expenses in future periods; competition in NetEase's existing and potential markets; governmental uncertainties (including possible changes in the effective tax rates applicable to NetEase and its subsidiaries and affiliates and the ability of NetEase to receive and maintain approvals of the preferential tax treatments and general competition and price pressures in the marketplace); the risk that fluctuations in the value of the Renminbi with respect to other currencies could adversely affect NetEase's business and financial results; and other risks outlined in NetEase's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetEase does not undertake any obligation to update this forward-looking information, except as required under the applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNetEase considers and uses non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS, as supplemental metrics in reviewing and assessing its operating performance and formulating its business plan. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nNetEase defines non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders as net income attributable to the Company's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities. Non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders enables NetEase's management to assess its operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities, which are non-cash charges. NetEase believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. NetEase also believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses and impairment on long-term investment of available-for-sale securities have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures NetEase uses may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\nNetEase compensates for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company's shareholders to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. See \"Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this press release. NetEase encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nContact for Media and Investors:\nMargaret Shi\nNetEase, Inc.\nir@service.netease.com\nTel: (+86) 571-8985-5201\nBrandi Piacente\nInvestor Relations\nbrandi@corp.netease.com\nTel: (+1) 212-481-2050\nNETEASE, INC.\nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(RMB and USD in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\n2017\nRMB\nRMB\nUSD (Note 1)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n5,439,499\n2,764,140\n424,841\nTime deposits\n19,361,098\n30,603,369\n4,703,652\nRestricted cash\n3,473,273\n5,926,906\n910,949\nAccounts receivable, net\n4,251,297\n3,619,725\n556,342\nInventories,net\n1,578,130\n5,474,929\n841,481\nPrepayments and other current assets\n3,697,952\n3,816,028\n586,514\nShort-term investments\n11,582,116\n9,742,663\n1,497,420\nTotal current assets\n49,383,365\n61,947,760\n9,521,199\nNon-current assets:\nProperty, equipment and software, net\n2,419,510\n3,769,326\n579,335\nLand use right, net\n588,887\n593,279\n91,185\nDeferred tax assets *\n560,323\n823,495\n126,569\nTime deposits\n550,000\n100,000\n15,370\nRestricted cash\n2,060,000\n200\n31\nOther long-term assets\n2,469,775\n3,797,355\n583,641\nTotal non-current assets\n8,648,495\n9,083,655\n1,396,131\nTotal assets\n58,031,860\n71,031,415\n10,917,330\nLiabilities, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and\nShareholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n1,396,187\n2,442,531\n375,410\nSalary and welfare payables\n1,491,448\n2,189,110\n336,460\nTaxes payable\n1,722,501\n1,564,692\n240,489\nShort-term loans\n3,815,691\n6,623,502\n1,018,014\nDeferred revenue\n7,531,238\n6,237,969\n958,758\nAccrued liabilities and other payables\n3,219,419\n4,692,310\n721,195\nTotal current liabilities\n19,176,484\n23,750,114\n3,650,326\nLong-term payable:\nDeferred tax liabilities *\n392,235\n213,215\n32,771\nOther long-term payable\n200\n18,250\n2,805\nTotal liabilities\n19,568,919\n23,981,579\n3,685,902\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\n-\n614,696\n94,477\nTotal NetEase, Inc.'s equity\n38,191,081\n45,732,007\n7,028,881\nNoncontrolling interests\n271,860\n703,133\n108,070\nTotal shareholders' equity\n38,462,941\n46,435,140\n7,136,951\nTotal liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests and\nshareholders' equity\n58,031,860\n71,031,415\n10,917,330\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of this press release.\n*In 2017, the Company adopted the guidance of ASU 2015-17 issued by FASB in November 2015, which requires entities to\npresent deferred tax assets (\"DTA\") and deferred tax liabilities (\"DTL\") as non-current in the balance sheets.
