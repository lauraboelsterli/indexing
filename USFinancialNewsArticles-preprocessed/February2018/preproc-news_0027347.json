    "text": "Fernley, NV, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verify Smart Corporation (VSMR), a Global innovator in financial fraud prevention and digital and mobile solutions, announced today that it has signed an LOI with Cbros Technologies to acquire an equity stake in their Mobile Safe Zones subsidiary for cash and stock.\nThe Mobile Safe Zones (MSZ) Patent Pending System prevents drivers from texting and keyboard/application use while driving without the ability to “opt out.” The system is easily installed in less than 10 minutes and can provide feedback to a monitoring party (e.g. insurance company). The MSZ device does not have any direct connection with the vehicle’s mechanics or electronics. Therefore, the device is usable in any moving vehicle regardless of the manufacturer.\nVerify Smart Corporation will incorporate this solution into its existing technologies to prevent or limit cell phone use in the workplace environment depending on user defined levels set by the employer. The product can also be used in schools, hospitals and public areas (e.g. crosswalks, train stations).\nLou Pingitore, CEO of Verify Smart, said, “Imagine how many lives will be saved using the MSZ software. Not to mention the savings realized in insurance premiums and claims as well as hospital and doctor expenses. With the incorporation of MSZ software into Verify Smart’s workplace technologies we expect employers to see a substantial increase in employee productivity, customer service, and improved public safety.”\nSteve Mahar, Founder/Owner of Cbros Technologies, LLC, said, “Cbros Technologies is thrilled to partner with Verify Smart to bring innovative products to market that provide safer travel and workplace environments by eliminating cell phone induced distractions.”\nABOUT VERIFY SMART CORPORATION\nVerify Smart Corp is an international technology company that develops and markets innovative solutions for the global digital market. The company also licenses patented technology for the prevention of debit/credit card and electronic transaction fraud. The company is expanding into the growing digital and mobile sector and will market innovative solutions for Healthcare, Consumer Brands, Educational Institutions and the Sports and Entertainment industries.\nContact Info: Verify Smart Corporation Info@verifysmartcorp.com 908-323-2380 ### MEDIA ONLY CONTACT: Lou Pingitore Verify Smart Corporation lou@verifysmartcorp.com +1-908-323-2380\nSource:Verify Smart Corp.",
