    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nTotal company production averaged 1,204 MMcfe (201 MBOE) per day in the fourth quarter Oil production up 36 percent year-over-year Proved Reserves increased 16% to 3.4 Tcfe (559 MMBOE); Cimarex replaced 211% of 2017 production\nCimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $174.7 million, or $1.83 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $47.8 million, or $0.50 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter net income (non-GAAP) was $140.0 million, or $1.47 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $66.4 million, or $0.70 per share 1 . Cash flow from operations was $340.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $185.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) totaled $357.1 million in the fourth quarter, a 63 percent increase from 2016 levels 1 .\nFor the year, net income totaled $494.3 million, or $5.19 per share. The adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the full year was $443.2 million, or $4.65 per share 1 . Cash flow from operations totaled $1,096.6 million in 2017 compared to $625.8 million in 2016. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) totaled $1,185.6 million in 2017, an 88 percent increase from 2016 levels 1 . Revenues in 2017 totaled $1.9 billion, a 53 percent increase from 2016. The increase in revenues and cash flow was the result of higher production and higher realized product prices.\nIn the fourth quarter, total company production volumes averaged 1,204 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day (201 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) per day), up 25 percent from a year ago. Fourth quarter oil production averaged 61,771 barrels per day, an increase of 36 percent from 2016 levels. For the full year, Cimarex reported daily production volumes of 1,142 MMcfe per day (190 MBOE per day), up 19 percent from our 2016 average daily output of 963 MMcfe per day.\nCimarex invested $1.28 billion in exploration and development (E&D) in 2017, including $344 million in the fourth quarter. Investments made in 2017 were funded with cash flow and cash on hand. E&D capital exceeded the company's estimate for 2017 of $1.2 billion due to higher infrastructure spending, higher working interest and costs in outside operated wells, land acquisition and acceleration of activity.\nProved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 3.4 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) or 559 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), up 16 percent year over year. Proved developed reserves increased 21 percent to 2.8 Tcfe. Cimarex added 941 Bcfe through extensions and discoveries and deducted 60 Bcfe through net revisions resulting in reserve replacement of 211 percent of 2017 production. Proved reserves are 83 percent proved developed.\nRealized oil prices averaged $51.68 per barrel in the fourth quarter, 16 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Realized natural gas prices were lower in the fourth quarter and averaged $2.58 per Mcf versus $2.86 a year ago. Realized NGL prices averaged $25.88 per barrel up 43 percent compared to fourth quarter 2016. For the full year, realized oil prices averaged $47.06, up 23 percent from 2016. Realized natural gas prices averaged $2.76 per Mcf, a 19 percent increase from 2016. Realized NGL prices averaged $21.61 per barrel, up 54 percent from 2016 levels.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2017 consisted of $1.5 billion of long-term notes, with $750 million maturing in 2024 and $750 million maturing in 2027. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had a cash balance of $401 million. Debt was 37 percent of total capitalization 2 .\nOperations Update\nCimarex invested $1.28 billion in exploration and development in 2017, 59 percent in the Permian region and 39 percent in the Mid-Continent. An additional $45 million was invested in midstream operations in 2017. During 2017, Cimarex participated in the drilling and completion of 319 gross (98 net) wells.\nAt year-end, 91 gross (34 net) wells were waiting on completion, of which 60 gross (16 net) are in the Mid-Continent and 31 gross (18 net) in the Permian. Cimarex currently is operating 14 drilling rigs.\nWELLS COMPLETED BY REGION\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nGross wells\nPermian Basin\n32\n11\n97\n48\nMid-Continent\n85\n44\n222\n105\n117\n55\n319\n153\nNet wells\nPermian Basin\n14\n8\n55\n30\nMid-Continent\n10\n17\n43\n31\n24\n25\n98\n61\nPermian Basin\nProduction from the Permian Basin averaged 673 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a 32 percent increase over fourth quarter 2016, and a seven percent increase sequentially. Oil volumes averaged 47,642 barrels per day and represented 42 percent of the region's total equivalent production. For the full year, production averaged 631 MMcfe per day, up 25 percent year over year.\nCimarex brought 32 gross (14 net) wells on production in the Permian region during the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to 97 gross (55 net) wells. Cimarex currently operates ten rigs in the Permian region.\nActivity in the Permian region in the fourth quarter included the completion of 14 wells in the Wolfcamp, Avalon and Bone Spring formations. Cimarex also began drilling operations on two multi-well Wolfcamp developments. The Animal Kingdom project, located in Culberson County, Texas, consists of eight wells targeting multiple landings in the Lower Wolfcamp and the Snowshoe project, located in Reeves County, Texas, is an eight-well project targeting multiple landings in the Upper Wolfcamp. Both are long lateral developments with first production expected during the third quarter of 2018.\nAs of year-end, Cimarex has completed 70 10,000-foot lateral Wolfcamp wells including 23 in the Lower Wolfcamp and 47 in the Upper Wolfcamp. In addition to the multiple spacing pilots drilled in the Wolfcamp in 2017, another highlight of the year's program was the completion of four 10,000-foot lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells on the western half of our Culberson County acreage, an area that was previously untested. These wells had an average 30-day peak initial production of 2,587 BOE per day (56 percent oil, 26 percent gas, 18 percent NGL). A fifth well is currently flowing back. Cimarex has additional activity planned in this area in 2018 including a development project with drilling scheduled to begin in the third quarter.\nMid-Continent\nProduction from the Mid-Continent region averaged 529 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a 19 percent increase over fourth-quarter 2016, and a three percent increase sequentially. Oil volumes averaged 13,999 barrels per day and represented 16 percent of the region's total equivalent production. For the full year, production averaged 509 MMcfe per day, up 11 percent year over year.\nWells brought on production during the fourth quarter totaled 85 gross (10 net) in the Mid-Continent region, bringing the total wells in 2017 to 222 gross (43 net). As planned, drilling to hold company's Meramec acreage was completed in 2017.\nActivity in the region continues to focus on the Woodford and Meramec shale plays in western Oklahoma. Recent highlights include the completion of a three-well, stacked Woodford/Meramec test in the 14N-10W township in Canadian County, Oklahoma. This test confirms results of our previous wells in the area. Cimarex operates nearly all of the 24,000 gross acres leased in the 14N-10W area with an average 62 percent working interest. Drilling activity continues in the high return Lone Rock area where Cimarex has six long lateral Woodford wells on production with average 30-day peak initial production of 1,806 BOE per day (35 percent oil, 36 percent gas, 29 percent NGL). The company is currently drilling the Shelly spacing pilot in Lone Rock with first production expected mid-summer.\nCimarex currently operates four rigs in the Mid-Continent.\nPlease see the latest Corporate Presentation on our website www.cimarex.com for further details.\nProduction by Region\nCimarex's average daily production and commodity price by region is summarized below:\nDAILY PRODUCTION BY REGION\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPermian Basin\nGas (MMcf)\n232.6\n179.3\n217.9\n178.1\nOil (Bbls)\n47,642\n36,253\n44,577\n36,018\nNGL (Bbls)\n25,747\n19,114\n24,269\n18,244\nTotal Equivalent (MMcfe)\n672.9\n511.5\n630.9\n503.7\nTotal Equivalent (BOE)\n112,157\n85,250\n105,157\n83,945\nMid-Continent\nGas (MMcf)\n300.3\n276.3\n294.4\n280.1\nOil (Bbls)\n13,999\n9,205\n12,457\n8,969\nNGL (Bbls)\n24,176\n19,036\n23,296\n20,513\nTotal Equivalent (MMcfe)\n529.3\n445.8\n508.9\n456.9\nTotal Equivalent (BOE)\n88,225\n74,291\n84,822\n76,165\nTotal Company\nGas (MMcf)\n534.0\n457.2\n513.6\n459.6\nOil (Bbls)\n61,771\n45,567\n57,153\n45,158\nNGL (Bbls)\n49,954\n38,184\n47,600\n38,797\nTotal Equivalent (MMcfe)\n1,204.4\n959.7\n1,142.1\n963.4\nTotal Equivalent (BOE)\n200,729\n159,951\n190,354\n160,555\nAVERAGE REALIZED PRICE BY REGION\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPermian Basin\nGas ($ per Mcf)\n2.56\n2.85\n2.72\n2.35\nOil ($ per Bbl)\n51.38\n44.75\n46.96\n38.45\nNGL ($ per Bbl)\n25.07\n15.71\n20.25\n12.32\nMid-Continent\nGas ($ per Mcf)\n2.60\n2.86\n2.78\n2.29\nOil ($ per Bbl)\n52.72\n44.36\n47.42\n37.65\nNGL ($ per Bbl)\n26.73\n20.58\n23.02\n15.59\nTotal Company\nGas ($ per Mcf)\n2.58\n2.86\n2.76\n2.31\nOil ($ per Bbl)\n51.68\n44.67\n47.06\n38.30\nNGL ($ per Bbl)\n25.88\n18.15\n21.61\n14.05\nOther\nThe following table summarizes the company's current open hedge positions:\n1Q18\n2Q18\n3Q18\n4Q18\n1Q19\n2Q19\n3Q19\nGas Collars:\nPEPL³\nVolume (MMBtu/d)\n130,000\n120,000\n90,000\n60,000\n50,000\n50,000\n20,000\nWtd Avg Floor\n2.57\n2.39\n2.33\n2.28\n2.23\n2.23\n1.98\nWtd Avg Ceiling\n2.93\n2.70\n2.56\n2.49\n2.46\n2.46\n2.16\nEl Paso Perm³\nVolume (MMBtu/d)\n90,000\n90,000\n70,000\n50,000\n40,000\n40,000\n20,000\nWtd Avg Floor\n2.52\n2.22\n2.14\n2.06\n1.98\n1.98\n1.65\nWtd Avg Ceiling\n2.84\n2.48\n2.32\n2.23\n2.14\n2.14\n1.80\nOil Collars:\nWTI⁴\nVolume (Bbl/d)\n29,000\n29,000\n25,000\n19,000\n13,000\n13,000\n6,000\nWtd Avg Floor\n47.28\n47.83\n47.48\n48.63\n48.92\n48.92\n50.00\nWtd Avg Ceiling\n56.33\n57.93\n57.76\n58.80\n61.04\n61.04\n66.82\nOil Basis Swaps:\nWTI Midland⁵\nVolume (Bbl/d)\n13,000\n14,000\n14,000\n9,000\n6,000\n6,000\n1,000\nWeighted Avg Differential⁶\n(0.72)\n(0.72)\n(0.72)\n(0.59)\n(0.51)\n(0.51)\n(0.70)\nConference call and webcast\nCimarex will host a conference call tomorrow, February 15, at 11:00 a.m. EST (9:00 a.m. MST).

The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:\na) Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the company's operating performance between periods and to compare the company's performance to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.\nb) Adjusted net income is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.\n*\nThe tax impact of the 2016 periods is calculated using a tax rate that excludes the effects of tax adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter primarily related to the revision of previous tax balances.\n**\nEarnings (loss) per share are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted cash flows from operations (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n340,759\n$\n185,061\n$\n1,096,564\n$\n625,849\nChange in operating assets and liabilities\n16,339\n33,679\n89,067\n3,289\nAdjusted cash flow from operations\n$\n357,098\n$\n218,740\n$\n1,185,631\n$\n629,138\nManagement uses the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted cash flow from operations as a means of measuring our ability to fund our capital program and dividends, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors for the same reason, and that it is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nPROVED RESERVES\nGas\nOil\nNGL\nTotal\nTotal\n(Bcf)\n(MBbls)\n(MBbls)\n(Bcfe)\n(MBOE)\nDecember 31, 2016\n1,471\n105,878\n130,633\n2,890.5\n481,748\nRevisions of previous estimates\n(40)\n(1,225)\n(2,099)\n(59.7)\n(9,951)\nExtensions and discoveries\n364\n53,464\n42,692\n940.7\n156,786\nPurchase of reserves\n1\n42\n78\n1.4\n227\nProduction\n(187)\n(20,861)\n(17,374)\n(416.9)\n(69,479)\nSale of properties\n(1)\n(60)\n(70)\n(1.8)\n(294)\nDecember 31, 2017\n1,608\n137,238\n153,860\n3,354.2\n559,037\nProved developed reserves\nYear-end 2016\n1,145\n92,032\n99,176\n2,292.0\n381,995\nYear-end 2017\n1,335\n114,116\n126,227\n2,776.6\n462,761\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nPre-tax PV-10 ($ in millions) *\n3,725\n2,122\n76 %\nStandardized Measure ($ in millions)\n3,285\n1,893\n74 %\nAverage prices used in Standardized Measure\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nGas ($ per Mcf)\n2.98\n2.48\n20 %\nOil ($ per Bbl)\n51.34\n42.75\n20 %\nNGL ($ per Bbl)\n19.09\n14.37\n33 %\n* Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $439.8 million and $229.3 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $3,285.0 million at year-end 2017 and $1,892.6 million at year-end 2016. Management uses pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves to other exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. Management believes pre-tax PV-10 is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike standardized measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend on the unique income tax characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves. Management further believes that professional research analysts and rating agencies use pre-tax PV-10 in similar ways. However, pre-tax PV-10 is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.\nPROVED RESERVES BY
