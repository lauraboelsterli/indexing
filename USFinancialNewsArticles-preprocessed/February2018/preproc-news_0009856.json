    "text": "Bitcoin dropped Monday below $7,000 to its lowest in more than two months.\nThe digital currency fell 14.6 percent to $6,988.85, its lowest since Nov. 15, according to CoinDesk, whose bitcoin price index tracks prices from four major exchanges. Bitcoin recovered slightly to near $7,076 in early afternoon trading.\nWith Monday's declines, bitcoin has now lost about 50 percent for the year so far. \n\nThe latest sell-off follows reports in the last week that have raised worries about increased regulation , hackers and potential price manipulation at a major cryptocurrency exchange. On Friday, J.P. Morgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup also said they have decided to ban cryptocurrency purchases by their credit card customers. \nThe heads of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are also set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.\nEthereum fell 17 percent to $692, according to CoinMarketCap, while ripple declined about 13.5 percent to 70.5 cents in early afternoon trading. \nBitcoin remains several hundred percent higher over the last 12 months, while ethereum and ripple are several thousands of percent higher.",
