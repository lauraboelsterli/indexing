    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average fell to a near 1-week low on Thursday morning on across-the-board selling after U.S. shares dropped overnight, while office equipment maker Ricoh stumbled after a media report said it was considering an impairment charge.\nThe Nikkei declined 1.2 percent to 21,700.15 in midmorning trade, after dropping as low as 21,626.85, the lowest since Feb. 16.\nRicoh Co tumbled more than 5 percent shortly after the market opened, following the report which said it was considering taking a charge of up to 100 billion yen ($930 million) this fiscal year.\nRicoh said in a statement it was unclear if it would book an impairment loss or what the amount would be pending the test results. The company said it was conducting “impairment tests”.\nShippers underperformed, with Kawasaki Kisen falling 2.3 percent and Nippon Yusen dropping 1.3 percent.\nOn Wednesday, the European Commission handed out 546 million euros ($673.49 million) in fines to car shipping groups and car parts suppliers , including the two shippers, for anti-competitive behaviour.\nThe broader Topix declined 1.0 percent, with all of its 33 subsectors in negative territory.
