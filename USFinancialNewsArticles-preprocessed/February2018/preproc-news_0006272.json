    "text": "* Russia and Japan dispute ownership of four islands\n* Russian PM approves deployment of warplanes there\n* Japan says decision runs counter to its own stance\n* Moscow unhappy about U.S. missile systems in Japan\nBy Andrew Osborn\nMOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has approved the deployment of Russian warplanes on a disputed island near Japan, accelerating the area’s militarisation at a time when Moscow’s ties with Tokyo are strained over the roll-out of a U.S. missile system.\nIn a decree published late on Thursday, Medvedev allowed the Russian Defence Ministry to use a civilian airport on the island of Iturup as it is known by Russia, or Etorofu as it is known by Japan, for its warplanes.\nThe island was one of four seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War Two and is located off the north-east coast of Hokkaido, Japan’s biggest prefecture. The dispute over the islands, known as the Kuriles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, is so acrimonious that Moscow and Tokyo have not yet signed a peace treaty to mark the end of the war.\nMedvedev’s decree is the latest step in a Russian military build-up that has seen Moscow deploy some of its newest missile defence systems to the islands and plan to build a naval base there even as it continues talks about the territorial dispute.\nThe decree was published days before deputy foreign ministers from the two countries are due to hold talks about co-operation on the disputed islands and at a time when Russia is concerned that Japan is allowing Washington to use its territory as a base for a U.S. military build-up in north Asia under the pretext of countering North Korea.\nMORE OPTIONS It is unclear whether Russia will permanently deploy warplanes to the disputed island, which hosted a Soviet air base during the Cold War, or use its airport as and when needed.\nThe Kommersant daily cited an unnamed military source as saying the move would give the Russian military more options.\n“This move should show the aerodrome’s readiness for fighter planes that patrol our borders to be temporarily based there,” the source was Quote: d as saying.\nThe same source was Quote: d as saying that Russia was particularly concerned about a Japanese plan to deploy more Aegis U.S. missile systems in its Akita and Yagamata prefectures.\nThe Japanese embassy in Moscow did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Kommersant cited it as saying that the new Russian move would boost Moscow’s military power on the disputed islands.\nThat contradicted Japan’s own stance on the dispute, it was cited as saying, but Tokyo would keep trying to resolve the problem through talks.
