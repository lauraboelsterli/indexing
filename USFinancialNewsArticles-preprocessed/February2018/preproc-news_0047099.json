Junior forward Ethan Happ added 10 points and three steals as Wisconsin (13-16, 6-10 Big Ten) closed with a 22-5 run to defeat the Golden Gophers for the eighth straight time and 19th time in the past 20 meetings.\nJunior forward Jordan Murphy recorded 16 points and 11 rebounds for his 22nd double-double of the season for Minnesota, which has lost nine consecutive games and 12 of its past 13. Sophomore forward Michael Hurt contributed career highs of 15 points and eight rebounds, and senior guard Nate Mason added 11 points for the Golden Gophers (14-15, 3-13).\nPritzl buried a 3-pointer for the first points of overtime and knocked down another to give the Badgers a 67-61 lead with 2:53 remaining.

The Badgers pulled within 50-48 on a basket by freshman forward Aleem Ford with 9:01 to play before Hurt drained a 3-pointer and Mason hit a jumper to give the Golden Gophers a seven-point edge with 7:33 to play.\nPritzl drained two 3-pointers in a span of 2:09 to bring Wisconsin within 58-54 with 4:08 left.
