    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 3:54 AM / Updated 10 hours ago Disney raises prices of some U.S. theme park tickets Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Sunday it was changing the admission price for its U.S. theme parks, raising the cost of some single-day tickets by almost 9 percent. \nDisney, which has a three-tier structure that charges visitors more during peak periods to help spread out crowds, said peak one-day tickets for a single theme park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, would see the biggest increase, rising to $135 from $124. \nValue and regular one-day tickets are now $97 and $117, respectively, compared to $97 and $110 last year. \nOne-day prices to the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida rose 2 percent to 4 percent, with tickets there now ranging between $109 and $129. \nThe company also said it plans to make changes to its annual pass programme at Disneyland as well make its multiple-day tickets to Walt Disney World date-specific in order to help manage crowds, particularly as it prepares to open a new Star Wars attraction at both parks next year. \nTheme parks are Disneyâ€™s second-largest division, bringing in $18.4 billion in revenue and $3.8 billion in operating income for the fiscal year that ended in September, according to company earnings reports.
