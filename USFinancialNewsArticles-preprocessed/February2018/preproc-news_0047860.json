    "text": "TARRYTOWN, NY, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NightFood Holdings, Inc. (OTC: NGTF) the category leading, better-for-you, sleep-friendly nighttime snack company, is proud to announce the addition of Dr. Michael Breus to the NightFood brand team.\n“Dr. Breus is the face of sleep in America,” stated NightFood CEO Sean Folkson. “As the brand pioneering an expected billion-dollar category, I view this as a game changing moment. There is literally nobody else on the planet that combines Dr. Breus’ relevant domain expertise, celebrity, and media footprint.”\nBreus, known to millions as The Sleep Doctor™, is the Nation’s most trusted authority on sleep. He regularly appears in the national media to educate and inform consumers so they can sleep better and lead happier, healthier, more productive lives.\nIn addition to over 40 appearances on The Dr. Oz Show, Dr. Breus has appeared on The View, Oprah, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Ray, Fox and Friends, The Doctors, The CBS Early Show, Kelly and Michael, The Today Show, and more. He has been the resident sleep expert on WebMD for over 15 years, and is a regular contributor to The Huffington Post and Psychology Today.\n“Dr. Breus has long been educating the public about making proper choices if they’re going to snack before bed,” remarked NightFood CMO Peter Leighton. “It’s an honor to have him on board…his public writings on night snacking and sleep were inspirational, and laid some of the core nutritional principles of the NightFood brand since inception.”\nAs part of the NightFood team, Breus will serve as a scientific advisor in the launch of additional products and snack formats. In addition, he will assist the Company in communicating the importance of proper night snacking and the impact of evening nutritional choices on sleep.\n“I’m a night snacker, and I love the idea of better, healthier alternatives for myself and my patients,” commented Dr. Breus. “I’m looking forward to working with the team to develop additional products as alternatives to salty chips and fattening ice cream. So many people do not realize how night snacking can put on the pounds and affect the quality of your sleep! The NightFood concept and the products are fantastic.”\nBreus joins Dr. Michael Grandner on the NightFood Scientific Advisory Board. The Company believes having authoritative science to back up its powerful branding will be a key to explosive company growth and maintaining category dominance in the coming months and years.\nOver 75% of adults 18-54 snack regularly between dinner and bed, combining to spend over $50B annually on snacks consumed in that time slot. Recently, consumer research firms such as IRI Worldwide and Mintel have pointed to nighttime specific snacks as a major global opportunity.\n“This is a long term engagement, but we’re confident the positive impact will be seen almost immediately,” Folkson added. “With Dr. Breus on board, we have further solidified our position as category leader, both today and well into the future.”\nAbout NightFood:\nNightFood (OTC: NGTF), operates both NightFood, Inc. and MJ Munchies, Inc.\nNightFood, Inc, “The Nighttime Snack Company”, is a snack food company dedicated to providing consumers delicious, better-for-you, sleep-friendly choices for evening snacking and nighttime cravings. According to IRI Worldwide, 44% of snack consumption occurs at night, representing a consumer spend of over $1B weekly on nighttime snacks.\nMarket research giant Mintel recently released a report identifying nighttime specific food and beverages as one of their most “compelling and category changing” trends for 2017 and beyond.\nCurrently, consumer’s most popular choices are cookies, chips, ice cream, and candy. These options are generally understood to be unhealthy, and often contain ingredients and nutritional profiles that can impair sleep quality. NightFood creates, manufactures, and distributes snacks formulated to help consumers satisfy nighttime cravings in a better, healthier, more sleep friendly way.\nMJ Munchies, Inc. was recently formed as a new, wholly owned subsidiary, to exploit legally compliant opportunities in the CBD and marijuana edibles and related spaces. The Company intends to market some of these new products under the brand name “Half-Baked”. As the legal landscape around CBD and cannabis related products continues to change and evolve, MJ Munchies will continue to explore, identify, and capitalize on opportunities clearly defined as legal. The Company believes tremendous opportunities currently exist to launch successful and compliant products in this space, and that such opportunities will continue to grow over time.\nFor more information, visit http://ir.nightfood.com and www.nightfood.com and\nQuestions can be directed to investors@nightfood.com\nForward Looking Statements:\nThis current press release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined in Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
