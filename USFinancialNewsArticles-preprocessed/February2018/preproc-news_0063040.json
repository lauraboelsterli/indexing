    "text": "Shoppers walking into any Starbucks around the country are greeted not only by the smell of espresso and fresh ground coffee, but also by displays of themed coffee mugs, thermoses and coffee-brewing equipment such as french presses.\nBut Starbucks is scaling back those products by roughly 30 percent as part of an effort to streamline its business and pull back on efforts that don't grow revenue and profit.\nThe Seattle-based coffee company is removing roughly 200 products from its store shelves, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw told investors in January while discussing first-quarter financial results.\nRead more from the Puget Sound Business Journal:\nHow Amazon will beat UPS, FedEx at shipping: Driverless trucks\nBoeing reportedly gets Hawaiian Airlines to cancel Airbus A330-800neo order for 787 Dreamliners\nWarren Buffett says Wells Fargo 'incentivized bad behavior'\n\"We are examining each of our businesses in order to focus our investments on those businesses that will meaningfully contribute to revenue and profit growth, while licensing or exciting those that won't,\" Maw said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript . \"This simplification effort increases our focus and reduces operational complexity in our stores.\"\nEarnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations in part due to tepid holiday sales , including holiday merchandise. But Maw said sales of those lobby products have actually been \"flat to slightly negative for several years.\"\nStarbucks has not yet said what products will be rolled back or when.\nFortune points out that Starbucks is by no means the first retailer to realize less is more when it comes to shopping options. Target and Kohl's have also been shrinking the variety of sizes and brands offered on store shelves.\nThe decision to remove product from Starbucks' shelves follows other Starbucks streamlining efforts, including closing Teavana stores, selling Tazo tea and closing the Starbucks online store .",
