    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 11:51 AM / in 16 minutes Hasbro profit beats, Marvel lineup to power 2018 Uday Sampath Kumar 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Toymaker Hasbro Inc ( HAS.O ) reported a huge profit beat despite a surprise drop in quarterly sales, with the company expected to gain this year from a strong line-up of toys linked to Marvel’s movie franchises. \nThe company’s shares were up 6 percent at $99.94 by midday on Wednesday, recovering from premarket losses. \nThe company cited softer demand of Star Wars toys for the drop in sales in the holiday quarter, with some analysts wondering if there was fatigue in the Star Wars brand. \nThe long gap between the release of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and Force Friday, the day it launches Star Wars toys, hurt sales, Chief Executive Brian Goldner said. \nGoldner, however, looked to quell the concern by saying that the company was partnering with Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) to release toys closer to movie openings. \nFor example, Disney’s next Star Wars movie, “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is slated to be in theaters in May, with toys expected to be on shelves in April. \n“I thought the lineup for Marvel was among the strongest we’ve ever seen. And therefore, it really impacts the fact that I think our lineup for the year is among the strongest we’ve ever seen,” Goldner said.

Still, Hasbro ended the year with higher sales than rival Mattel ( MAT.O ), the first time since 1993. \nNet revenue from the company’s partner brands unit, which includes toys based on movie franchises, fell 21 percent to $342.9 million. \nNet loss attributable to the company of $5.3 million, or 4 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, due to a $296.5 million charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.
