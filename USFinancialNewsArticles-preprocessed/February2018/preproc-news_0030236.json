    "text": "Delray Beach, FL, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enerkon Solar International, Inc. (OTC PINK: ENKS) Enerkonâ€™s New CEO, Mr. Benjamin Ballout stated that we completed the acquisition process, bringing our assets and operations into the company which will prepare us for the next phases in our development plans as well as making our operations transparent as we are operating as a public company.\nMr. Ballout further stated that, Enerkon Solar International Inc. Renewable Energy Assets and Operations as acquired by the company today, were initially established in September 2016, with the vision to be a leader in Utility Scale PV Power Plants and renewable systems, with a particular focus on the Middle East and Africa, who have the greatest need and the highest Solar Intensity Coverage, compared to other parts of the world, a good ROI, compared to other geographic regions and less resistance to entry into the major markets.\nOur Strategic Plan, Vision 2028 is a long-term road-map to achieve our growth objectives and our technology and cost leadership goals. In executing our Long Term Strategic Plan, we are focusing on providing utility-scale PV solar energy solutions using our modules to key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for Utility-Scale PV electricity, including markets throughout the Americas, Asia, the Middle East and Africa whereas acquisition of strategic companies in the Panel and Technology Sectors as well as other small and mid- level renewable energy companies is also a large part of our near term plans.\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking\" statements, defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
