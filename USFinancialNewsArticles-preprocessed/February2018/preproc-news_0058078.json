    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexington Realty Trust (“Lexington”) (NYSE:LXP), a real estate investment trust focused on single-tenant real estate investments, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nGenerated Net Income attributable to common shareholders of $29.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share.

Increased the quarterly common share/unit dividend/distribution to $0.1775 per common share/unit.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nGenerated Net Income attributable to common shareholders of $79.1 million, or $0.33 diluted common share. Generated Adjusted Company FFO of $238.6 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share. Acquired/completed 15 consolidated properties and the last building of the Lake Jackson, Texas build-to-suit project for an aggregate initial basis of $727.6 million. Disposed of 34 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $241.7 million. Sold a non-consolidated interest in an office property for $6.2 million. Completed 3.8 million square feet of new leases and lease extensions. Retired an aggregate of $63.4 million of secured debt with a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 6.0% and obtained $45.4 million of secured debt with a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 5.2%. Amended the revolving credit facility, together with the related term loans, increasing the capacity by $200.0 million. Collected an aggregate of $138.0 million in full satisfaction of three loan investments. Issued 1.6 million common shares at an average gross price of $10.89 per share under its ATM offering program.\nAdjusted Company FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. It and certain other non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled later in this press release.\nT. Wilson Eglin, Chief Executive Officer and President of Lexington Realty Trust, commented “We finished off the year strong with fourth quarter Adjusted Company FFO of $0.26 per diluted common share. During 2017, we raised $386 million by monetizing our loan portfolio and disposing of 34 properties while adding 15 properties to our portfolio for $728 million. As a result, we have substantially upgraded the quality of our holdings, shrunk our office footprint and simplified our operations which we expect to lead to lower operating costs. Additionally, strong leasing volume, along with non-core assets sales, brought our overall portfolio to approximately 99% leased at year end.\nThe guidance we have initiated today in the range of $0.95 to $0.98 per share suggests that our operating results in 2018 will be comparable to 2017 even as we anticipate lengthening our average debt maturity, providing concessions on early lease extensions and continuing with our capital recycling activities. We intend to use proceeds from financings and dispositions to reinvest into industrial acquisitions and build-to-suit opportunities and to pay down debt.”\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, total gross revenues were $102.2 million, compared with total gross revenues of $95.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to revenue generated from property acquisitions and new leases, partially offset by 2017 property sales and lease expirations.\nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common shareholders was $29.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $14.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share.\nAdjusted Company FFO\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Lexington generated Adjusted Company FFO of $63.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Company FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $59.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.\nDividends/Distributions\nAs previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2017, Lexington increased its quarterly common share/unit dividend/distribution to $0.1775 per common share/unit, which equates to an annualized dividend of $0.71 per common share/unit. The declared quarterly dividend/distribution was paid on January 16, 2018 to common shareholders/unitholders of record as of December 29, 2017. In addition, Lexington declared a dividend of $0.8125 per share on its Series C Preferred, which was paid February 15, 2018 to Series C Preferred Shareholders of record as of January 31, 2018.\nTransaction Activity\nACQUISITIONS Primary Tenant (Guarantor) Location Sq.

This guidance is forward looking, excludes the impact of certain items and is based on current expectations.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 CONFERENCE CALL\nLexington will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Lexington seeks to expand its portfolio through build-to-suit transactions, sale-leaseback transactions and other transactions, including acquisitions.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the headings “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” in Lexington's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including risks related to: (1) the authorization by Lexington's Board of Trustees of future dividend declarations, (2) Lexington's ability to achieve its estimates of net income attributable to common shareholders and Adjusted Company FFO for the year ending December 31, 2018, (3) the successful consummation of any lease, acquisition, build-to-suit, disposition, financing or other transaction, (4) the failure to continue to qualify as a REIT, (5) changes in general business and economic conditions, including the impact of any legislation, (6) competition, (7) increases in real estate construction costs, (8) changes in interest rates, (9) changes in accessibility of debt and equity capital markets, and (10) future impairment charges. Copies of the periodic reports Lexington has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available on Lexington's web site at www.lxp.com . Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe Lexington's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “projects”, “may,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “will likely result,” “is optimistic,” “goal,” “objective” or similar expressions. Except as required by law, Lexington undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to those forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the occurrence of unanticipated events. Accordingly, there is no assurance that Lexington's expectations will be realized.\nReferences to Lexington refer to Lexington Realty Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries. All interests in properties and loans are held, and all property operating activities are conducted, through special purpose entities, which are separate and distinct legal entities that maintain separate books and records, but in some instances are consolidated for financial statement purposes and/or disregarded for income tax purposes. The assets and credit of each special purpose entity with a property subject to a mortgage loan are not available to creditors to satisfy the debt or other obligations of any other person, including any other special purpose entity or affiliate. Consolidated entities that are not property owner subsidiaries do not directly own any of the assets of a property owner subsidiary (or the general partner, member of managing member of such property owner subsidiary), but merely hold partnership, membership or beneficial interests therein which interests are subordinate to the claims of the property owner subsidiary's (or its general partner's, member's or managing member's) creditors.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Definitions\nLexington has used non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G in this Quarterly Earnings Press Release and in other public disclosures.\nLexington believes that the measures defined below are helpful to investors in measuring our performance or that of an individual investment. Since these measures exclude certain items which are included in their respective most comparable measures under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), reliance on the measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are weighed in balance with other GAAP measures. These measures are not necessarily indications of our cash flow available to fund cash needs. Additionally, they should not be used as an alternative to the respective most comparable GAAP measures when evaluating Lexington's financial performance or cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities or liquidity.\nCash Rent: Cash Rent is calculated by making adjustments to GAAP rent to remove the impact of GAAP required adjustments to rental income such as adjustments for straight-line rents relating to free rent periods and contractual rent increases. Cash Rent excludes lease termination income. Lexington believes Cash Rent provides a meaningful indication of an investment's ability to fund cash needs.\nCompany Funds Available for Distribution (“FAD”): FAD is calculated by making adjustments to Adjusted Company FFO (see below) for (1) straight-line rent adjustments, (2) lease incentive amortization, (3) amortization of above/below market leases, (4) lease termination payments, net, (5) non-cash interest, net, (6) non-cash charges, net, (7) cash paid for tenant improvements, and (8) cash paid for lease costs. Although FAD may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), Lexington believes it provides a meaningful indication of its ability to fund cash needs. FAD is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of operating performance to net income, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Company FFO: Lexington believes that Funds from Operations, or FFO, which is a non-GAAP measure, is a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Lexington believes FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. As a result, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing perspective that may not necessarily be apparent from net income.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as “net income (or loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for non-consolidated partnerships and joint ventures.” NAREIT clarified its computation of FFO to exclude impairment charges on depreciable real estate owned directly or indirectly. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.\nLexington presents FFO available to common shareholders and unitholders - basic and also presents FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted on a company-wide basis as if all securities that are convertible, at the holder's option, into Lexington’s common shares, are converted at the beginning of the period. Lexington also presents Adjusted Company FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted which adjusts FFO available to all equityholders and unitholders - diluted for certain items which we believe are not indicative of the operating results of Lexington's real estate portfolio. Lexington believes this is an appropriate presentation as it is frequently requested by security analysts, investors and other interested parties. Since others do not calculate these measures in a similar fashion, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by others. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of Lexington’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.\nGAAP and Cash Yield or Capitalization Rate: GAAP and cash yields or capitalization rates are measures of operating performance used to evaluate the individual performance of an investment. These measures are estimated and are not presented or intended to be viewed as a liquidity or performance measure that present a numerical measure of Lexington's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows. The yield or capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the annualized NOI (as defined below, except GAAP rent adjustments are added back to rental income to calculate GAAP yield or capitalization rate) the investment is expected to generate (or has generated) divided by the acquisition/completion cost (or sale) price.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”): NOI is a measure of operating performance used to evaluate the individual performance of an investment. This measure is not presented or intended to be viewed as a liquidity or performance measure that presents a numerical measure of Lexington's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows. Lexington defines NOI as operating revenues (rental income (less GAAP rent adjustments and lease termination income), tenant reimbursements and other property income) less property operating expenses. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, Lexington's NOI may not be comparable to other companies. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expenses, other nonproperty income and losses, and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing a perspective on operations not immediately apparent from net income. Lexington believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI.\nLEXINGTON REALTY TRUST AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited and in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThree months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, 2017 2016\n2017 2016 Gross revenues: Rental $ 93,909 $ 87,261 $ 359,832 $ 398,065 Tenant reimbursements 8,260 8,065 31,809 31,431 Total gross revenues 102,169 95,326 391,641 429,496 Expense applicable to revenues: Depreciation and amortization (45,262 ) (41,361 ) (173,968 ) (166,048 ) Property operating (12,410 ) (12,512 ) (49,194 ) (47,355 ) General and administrative (8,597 ) (8,072 ) (34,158 ) (31,104 ) Litigation settlement — — (2,050 ) — Non-operating income 5,381 3,543 10,378 13,043 Interest and amortization expense (20,055 ) (19,459 ) (77,883 ) (88,032 ) Debt satisfaction gains (charges), net 3,818 (157 ) 6,196 (975 ) Impairment charges and loan losses (1,419 ) (24,332 ) (44,996 ) (100,236 ) Gains on sales of properties 8,350 23,097 63,428 81,510 Income before provision for income taxes and equity in earnings (losses) of non-consolidated entities 31,975 16,073 89,394 90,299 Provision for income taxes (743 ) (340 ) (1,917 ) (1,439 ) Equity in earnings (losses) of non-consolidated entities 216 1,196 (848 ) 7,590 Net income 31,448 16,929 86,629 96,450 Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (598 ) (928 ) (1,046 ) (826 ) Net income attributable to Lexington Realty Trust shareholders 30,850 16,001 85,583 95,624 Dividends attributable to preferred shares – Series C (1,572 ) (1,572 ) (6,290 ) (6,290 ) Allocation to participating securities (43 ) (38 ) (226 ) (225 ) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 29,235 $ 14,391 $ 79,067 $ 89,109 Net income attributable to common shareholders – per common share basic $ 0.12 $ 0.06 $ 0.33 $ 0.38 Weighted-average common shares outstanding – basic 238,131,814 235,066,967 237,758,408 233,633,058 Net income attributable to common shareholders – per common share diluted $ 0.12 $ 0.06 $ 0.33 $ 0.37 Weighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted 241,821,194 235,204,568 241,537,837 237,679,031 LEXINGTON REALTY TRUST AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of December 31,\n(Unaudited and in thousands, except share and per share data)\n2017 2016 Assets: Real estate, at cost $ 3,936,459 $ 3,533,172 Real estate -
