    "text": "(Corrects to remove reference to “bictegravir” as a previously approved drug)\nFeb 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s three-drug regimen to treat HIV-1 infection.\nThe treatment, Biktarvy, is a once-daily tablet that combines two previously approved drugs - emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide and a new integrase inhibitor bictegravir, the company said.\nIt is available to patients who have been on a stable regimen for at least three months.\nBiktarvy has a boxed warning about the risk of post-treatment acute increase of hepatitis B.\nThe approval puts GlaxoSmithKline’s HIV businesses under threat as the company has been facing slowing demand and new competition.\nGilead’s shares were up 3.45 percent at $83.16 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.
