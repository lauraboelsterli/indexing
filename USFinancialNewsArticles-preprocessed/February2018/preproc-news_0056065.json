Maduro, 55, whose main rivals are barred from standing against him, presented his candidacy at the national election board in Caracas before joining a rally of supporters. “I will be loyal to the legacy of the giant Hugo Chavez!” he said, dancing reggaeton on stage with his wife Cilia Flores in front of a large banner showing his and Chavez’s faces. Maduro narrowly won election after Chavez’s 2013 death from cancer, but has seen his popularity plunge during a punishing economic crisis for OPEC member Venezuela that has exposed the failure of government policies and worsened by the fall in global oil prices. Maduro blames a U.S.-led “economic war”, including sanctions imposed last year by President Donald Trump, for the unprecedented recession that has left millions hungry, created widespread shortages and fueled a migration exodus. Critics say incompetent policies, such as dysfunctional currency controls, and rampant graft are behind the crisis. President Nicolas Maduro leaves the National Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters after registering his candidacy for re-election, in Caracas, Venezuela February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello Venezuela’s opposition coalition is boycotting the April 22 vote, given its two most popular leaders - Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles - are prohibited from running, various parties have been outlawed, and the election board is pro-Maduro. “Elections in these conditions will not solve anything,” the coalition said in a statement on Tuesday.

The most significant figure to have expressed an interest in running against Maduro is a former state governor, Henri Falcon, but by breaking with the opposition coalition to do that, he would find it tough to mount a serious challenge. In his speech, Maduro called for the blessing of Jesus Christ, Chavez and Venezuelan independence hero Simon Bolivar for his re-election campaign. “I am the people’s president, the oligarchy have under-estimated me,” said Maduro, a former bus driver and union activist.
