    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matrix Medical Network (Matrix), announced that it has successfully completed the acquisition of HealthFair. This brings together two established population health leaders -- Matrix with its expansive in-home capabilities and HealthFair with its national fleet of mobile health clinics.\nThe combination will provide more options and flexibility for health plan members to access care, leading to even higher levels of engagement. The advanced capabilities of the HealthFair mobile clinics, including laboratory, ultrasound, EKG and mammography equipment, expands the scope of diagnostic and preventive services available to members, further improving compliance and health outcomes.\n“It can be challenging for individuals to get needed support for their health conditions and stay current with recommended care and tests,” said Walt Cooper, President and Chief Executive Officer of Matrix. “Bringing together the established capabilities of our two organizations will lead to unparalleled levels of patient engagement and compliance with quality care guidelines.”\nWith the addition of HealthFair, Matrix’s network increases to more than 6,000 community-based providers across all 50 states. Through its relationship with leading health plan and provider groups across the country, Matrix’s services will be available to nearly one in five Medicare Advantage members.\nPopulation health services from Matrix include comprehensive health assessments that develop complete medical and health risk profiles, comprehensive care management for those with complex medical conditions, post-acute care transition support, quality care gap closure programs, community care-determination assessments and specialized programs to engage hard-to-reach members.\nThe HealthFair management team will continue to lead the business as part of Matrix. Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\nAbout Matrix Medical Network\nMatrix Medical Network provides a broad array of assessment and care management services to individuals that improve health outcomes and health plan financial performance. Using advanced data capture and diagnostic technologies, Matrix providers visit with health plan members to gain a deep understanding about how to best support their care needs. This information is used to enhance their relationships with primary care providers and ensure that health plan services are appropriately aligned, resulting in better overall health outcomes. Matrix is headquartered in Scottsdale, AZ, and partners with leading health plans and providers across the country. Matrix is backed by Frazier Healthcare ( frazierhealthcare.com ) and Providence Service Corporation ( prscholdings.com ) (Nasdaq:PRSC) of Stamford, CT.
