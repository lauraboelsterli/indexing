    "text": "2017 Results Show Impact of Shifts in Consumer Shopping\n2018 Outlook Anticipates Sales Growth and Return to Profitability\nSANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- JAKKS Pacific, Inc. [NASDAQ: JAKK] today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Overview vs. Same Period Last Year:\nNet sales were $136.6 million compared to $167.0 million reported in the prior year period. Gross margin was 22.1%, down from 31.2%. Net loss attributable to JAKKS was $30.4 million, or $1.33 per basic and diluted share vs. net loss of $7.6 million, or $0.47 per basic and diluted share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $6.8 million, compared to positive $4.0 million in 2016. See note below on “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” Retail inventories of JAKKS products ended 2017 significantly below year-ago levels, allowing the company to enter the year with relatively clean shelves.\nManagement Commentary\nStephen Berman, JAKKS Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “A number of factors contributed to a soft fourth quarter, including the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as well as the continued decline of some legacy product lines that were not fully offset by new launches. Some of the shifts we saw last year in consumer habits – buying more online and less in stores, and less interest in some film licenses, were even more pronounced in 2017. That being said, we did see a number of product lines with sales growth and improved performance in the quarter. As we look to 2018, we will continue to expand our retail private label programs and exclusive product initiatives and we are excited to launch a number of new major licenses. Moreover, we have positioned ourselves well for the future with our investments in skincare and cosmetics, as well as augmented reality and content to cater to the needs of the young, modern consumer.”\nMr. Berman continued, “We have taken several aggressive steps so that our core brands and new products can allow us to grow sales and return to profitability in 2018, paving the way for further growth in the years beyond.”\nProgress on Strategic Initiatives\nJAKKS continues to make steady progress on long-term strategic initiatives.\nCreating a strong portfolio of owned intellectual properties : In 2017, JAKKS successfully launched multiple properties across many categories, many of which are positioned to have great extension programs for 2018 - including Squish-Dee-Lish and Real Workin’ Buddies. Additionally, JAKKS entered the games category with the release of Pull My Finger, an innovative action game, paving the way for more games to come. Entering new categories: With production currently underway and initial distribution partners secured, early shipments of C’est Moi reformulated skincare and cosmetic products began in January 2018, which the Company expects will have significantly higher margins than its toy business. In addition, Studio JP is in development of a new franchise which will be comprised of original animated content created specifically for digital distribution, an app featuring augmented reality and a line of toys slated for a Fall 2018 launch. Also, the Company will begin shipments of Morf, an outdoor sports action product. Broadening geographic reach : The Company continues to execute on its geographic expansion strategy with newly established sales offices in France and Italy building momentum. JAKKS Mexico continues to grow, and the Company plans further investment in the market in 2018 to support local distribution. Increasing portion of sales to online retailers : Despite a decrease in overall sales, JAKKS increased sales to online retailers, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales in 2017.\nAdditional Financial Overview:\nFourth Quarter\nNet sales for the fourth quarter were $136.6 million compared to $167.0 million reported in the prior year period. Products that had a significant positive contribution to fourth quarter sales included Squish-Dee-Lish, Tangled, Stanley, Chocolate Egg Surprise, Moana and various DC Comics products. Products that showed significant declines included Tsum Tsum, Graco, Frozen, Elena of Avalor and Gift ‘Ems.\nAs reported GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter 2017 was 22.1%, down from 31.2% last year, primarily as a result of minimum guarantee shortfalls, inventory impairment and the impact of low margin sales recognized in the quarter. The fourth quarter gross margin includes the impact of a higher portion of closeout and other low margin sales, as well as $13.8 million in charges related to inventory impairment and minimum guarantee shortfalls.\nOperating costs for the quarter were $56.7 million, which included certain pre-tax charges totaling $2.5 million related to restructuring and bad debt write-offs.\nGAAP net loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific was $30.4 million, or a loss of $1.33 per basic and diluted share, which included pre-tax charges totaling $17.2 million relating to the impairment of inventory, minimum guarantee shortfalls, restructuring charges, bad debt expense, and the impact of the exchange of convertible notes. This compares to GAAP net loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific of $7.6 million, or a loss of $0.47 per basic and diluted share, reported in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was negative $6.8 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of positive $4.0 million in 2016. See note below on “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nFull Year\nNet sales for 2017 were $613.1 million compared to $706.6 million in 2016. Products that had a significant positive contribution to full year sales included Moana, Squish-Dee-Lish, Moose Mountain ride-ons, Tangled, Real Workin’ Buddies Dusty and various DC Comics products. Products that showed significant full year sales declines include Frozen, Tsum Tsum, Star Wars, Graco and Sofia the First.\nAs reported GAAP gross margin for 2017 was 25.4%, down from 31.6% last year. Included in the 2017 gross margin are charges for minimum guarantee shortfalls and inventory impairment totaling $30.1 million, as well as the impact of low margin sales recognized during the year.\nOperating costs for 2017 were $219.8 million, which includes certain charges totaling $25.8 million related to goodwill and intangibles impairment, restructuring charges, and bad debt expense, compared to $205.9 million in 2016.\nFor 2017, GAAP net loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific was $83.1 million, or a loss of $3.89 per basic and diluted share, which included pre-tax charges totaling $30.1 million relating to the impairment of inventory and minimum guarantee shortfalls, and other significant and unusual pre-tax charges totaling $33.7 million relating to goodwill and other intangibles impairment, write-off of investment in DreamPlay LLC, restructuring charges, bad debt expense, and the impact of the exchange of convertible notes. This compares to GAAP net income attributable to JAKKS Pacific of $1.2 million, or earnings of $0.07 per diluted share, reported in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 was positive $15.8 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of positive $41.7 million in 2016. See note below on “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s working capital was $146.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $65.0 million, compared to working capital of $236.6 million including cash and cash equivalents of $86.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Consistent with the seasonality of the business, net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was $17.2 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $37.4 million in the prior year period.\n2018 Outlook\nOur expectation for 2018 is to grow sales modestly and return to profitability as in years past.\nConvertible Senior Note Retirement\nThe Company continues to make a high priority the retirement of the remaining $21.2 million of its convertible senior notes that mature on August 1, 2018, after having completed the previously announced exchange of $21.6 million of such notes, extending their maturity to November 1, 2020.\nExpression of Interest from Hong Kong Meisheng Cultural Company Limited\nOn January 25, 2018, Hong Kong Meisheng Cultural Company Limited (“Meisheng”) sent the Company a letter expressing an interest in buying additional shares to bring its holdings to 51% of our shares. A committee of independent members of our Board of Directors has been formed and has recently engaged a legal counsel and an investment banking firm. This committee is evaluating Meisheng’s expression of interest as well as other possible interests.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the preliminary results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP included in this release, the Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information including Adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP metric that excludes various items that are detailed in the financial tables and accompanying footnotes reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP results contained in this release.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the press release are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP financial measures below, as required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization and adjusted for certain non-recurring charges incurred, primarily related to reorganization expenses and certain non-cash charges for restricted stock compensation expense. Net income (loss) is similarly adjusted and tax-effected to arrive at Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) are not recognized financial measures under GAAP, but we believe that they are useful in measuring our operating performance. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA enhances an overall understanding of the Company’s past financial performance, and provides useful information to the investor by comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis and the use of Adjusted EBITDA by other comparable companies as a measure of performance.\nInvestors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure for determining the Company’s operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands) (In thousands) Net (loss) income $ (30,487 ) $ (7,752 ) $ (83,028 ) $ 1,249 Income from joint ventures - (28 ) (105 ) (889 ) Other income (50 ) (23 ) (342 ) (305 ) Loss on extinguishment of convertible senior notes 919 - 919 - Interest income (11 ) (5 ) (37 ) (51 ) Interest expense 2,333 3,509 9,829 12,975 Provision for income taxes 716 1,908 1,606 4,127 Depreciation and amortization 2,588 6,047 21,003 22,944 Restricted stock compensation expense 859 367 3,112 1,621 Goodwill and other intangibles impairment\n- - 13,536 - Write-off of investment in DreamPlay LLC - - 7,000 - Bad debt write-offs 1,600 - 11,212 - Inventory impairment 5,231 - 9,600 - Minimum guarantee shortfalls 8,575 - 20,461 - Restructuring charge 880 - 1,080 - Adjusted EBITDA $ (6,847 ) $ 4,023 $ 15,846 $ 41,671 Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands) (In thousands) Net (loss) income attributable to JAKKS Pacific, Inc. $ (30,413 ) $ (7,585 ) $ (83,085 ) $ 1,243 Goodwill and other intangibles impairment\n- - 13,536 - Write-off of investment in DreamPlay LLC - - 7,000 - Loss on extinguishment of convertible senior notes 919 - 919 - Bad debt write-offs 1,600 - 11,212 - Inventory impairment 5,231 - 9,600 - Minimum guarantee shortfalls 8,575 - 20,461 - Restructuring charge 880 - 1,080 - Tax impact of additional charges (661 ) - (2,418 ) - Adjusted Net (Loss) Income attributable to JAKKS Pacific, Inc. $ (13,869 ) $ (7,585 ) $ (21,695 ) $ 1,243 Adjusted (loss) earnings per share - basic $ (0.61 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (1.02 ) $ 0.08 Shares used in adjusted (loss) earnings per share 22,799 16,098 21,341 16,542 Adjusted (loss) earnings per share - diluted $ (0.61 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (1.02 ) $ 0.07 Shares used in adjusted (loss) earnings per share - diluted 22,799 16,098 21,341 16,665\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222005484/en/\nJAKKS Pacific\nRachel Griffin (424) 268-9363\nVice President, Public Relations\nor\nLiolios Investor Relations\nSean McGowan, (949) 574-3860\nManaging Director/ JAKK@liolios.com\nSource: JAKKS Pacific, Inc.",
