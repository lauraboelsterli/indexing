    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 4:33 PM / Updated an hour ago Premier League remains Man City's top priority, says Guardiola Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has placed winning the Premier League title at the top of his list of priorities, as they look to wrap up their second major trophy of the season. The Spanish manager collected his first piece of silverware at City with victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final on Sunday and his team takes on the north London outfit again in the league on Thursday. City, currently 13 points clear of second-placed Manchester United, need six more wins to be crowned Premier League champions having won 23 of their 27 matches so far this campaign. “We must be focused. The next six fixtures are terrible in terms of quality of opposition. Four are away,” Guardiola told a news conference on Wednesday. ”We think about Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham (Hotspur), Manchester United and away games at Stoke who are playing to avoid relegation. We are going to Goodison Park (to face Everton), where it is always a tough game. “In sport you forget what you have done - good or bad - and focus on the next one. We think about tomorrow’s game and at the end of the season we may think how was the season.” Forward Raheem Sterling is closing in on a return to action having recovered from a hamstring injury but Guardiola is unsure if the 23-year-old could feature in City’s trip to the Emirates Stadium. “Raheem is much, much better,” Guardiola said. “I don’t know if he can play tomorrow but hopefully Chelsea or Basel (he will be ready).” City host Chelsea in the league on Sunday and Basel in their Champions League last-16 second leg three days later. Midfielder Fernandinho was ruled out having suffered a hamstring strain at Wembley. Yaya Toure seems a natural fit to replace the Brazil international but he has not played since Jan. 9 and has not featured in the squad for City’s last four matches in all competitions. When asked if the 34-year-old Ivorian could make a return, Guardiola replied: “It depends on him. If he is coming back who he is, he is going to play.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis",
