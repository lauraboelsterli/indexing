    "text": "Blackstone's Byron Wien believes the market decline isn't completely over.\n\"I don't think the overall market has cleansed itself enough to represent a broad buying opportunity. I think we have more work to do,\" he said on CNBC's \" Squawk Alley \" Friday. \"I think we will end the year higher than we started, but I think we may not be done with this correction yet.\"\nWien predicted on Jan. 2 the market would have a 10 percent correction this year as one of his \"Ten Surprises for 2018.\" The S&P 500 fell officially into correction territory on Thursday, down more than 10 percent from its record reached in January. \nThe investor thinks the market volatility is not a sign of an imminent recession. He cited strong economic numbers such as leading indicators and unemployment figures.\n\"We've been waiting for a 10 percent correction for over a year now. And now we're having it, so it's really not a surprise,\" he said. \"It's a healthy cleansing. Is it the beginning of bear market? I think not. The economy is revving along at a frequent pace. It looks like growth this year is going to be pretty close to 3 percent.\"\nThe Wall Street veteran has been publishing his list of surprises since 1986. Wien defines a \"surprise\" as something the average investor would assign only a 33 percent chance of taking place, but which he thinks has a more than 50 percent chance of happening.\nWien is vice chairman of Blackstone's Private Wealth Solutions group. Previously, he was the chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.\nDisclaimer",
