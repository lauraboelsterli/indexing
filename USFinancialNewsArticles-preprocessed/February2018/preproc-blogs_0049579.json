    "text": "By Natasha Bach 4:23 AM EST \nIvanka Trump is Olympics-bound on Thursday; she’ll lead the American delegation at the closing ceremony in PyeongChang, South Korea this weekend. \nWhile high-level members of the North Korean delegation will also be present at the event, White House officials have asserted that Trump’s trip is not intended to facilitate a meeting with the North Koreans. Instead, Trump reportedly plans to focus on reaffirming U.S.-South Korean relations and cheer on American athletes participating in the Games. \nRead: Germany’s Olympic Athletes Are Consuming Hundreds of Gallons of a Surprising Sports Drink: Beer \nIn a statement , Trump said, “I am honored to lead the U.S. delegation to the closing ceremonies of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. We look forward to congratulating Team USA and celebrating all that our athletes have achieved. Their talent, drive, grit, and spirit embodies American excellence, and inspire us all.” A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 13, 2018 at 4:40am PST \nTrump is scheduled to have dinner with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Seoul on Friday and will then attend the Games on Saturday and the closing ceremony on Sunday.
