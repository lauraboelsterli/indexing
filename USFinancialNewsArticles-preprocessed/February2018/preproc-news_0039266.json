    "text": "Feb 15 (Reuters) - The Japanese government is considering nominating economist Masazumi Wakatabe as one of the deputy governors at the Bank of Japan, Nikkei reported on Thursday, citing sources.\nWakatabe, a professor at Waseda University and an advocate of bolder monetary easing, would fill one of the two deputy governor seats that will fall vacant next month, Nikkei reported. s.nikkei.com/2By8KrK\nThe potential choice of Wakatabe comes amid speculation that the central bank is looking to start normalizing its monetary policy.\nThe government will submit nominees for the central bankâ€™s governor and deputy governors to parliament on Friday, Reuters reported earlier.\nGovernment leaders reaffirmed their confidence in current BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda on Tuesday, bolstering expectations he will be reappointed for a rare second term.
