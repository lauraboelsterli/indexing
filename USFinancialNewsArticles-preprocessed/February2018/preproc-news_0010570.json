The Company’s GAAP results were impacted by “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” and the divestitures of its public sector and education business and its consulting businesses in 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nGAAP revenue decreased 4.7 percent to $2,329 million from $2,445 million in the prior year quarter. Operating income increased to $485 million from $432 million in the prior year quarter, while operating income margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.8 percent. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders and diluted EPS in the period were significantly impacted by “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” which recently passed into legislation. This legislation resulted in a net tax benefit of $781 million to our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders, or $2.32 of diluted EPS. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $988 million for the quarter, or $2.93 per diluted share, compared to $0.63 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 3.1 percent. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $881 million for the quarter, from $846 million in the prior year quarter, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 340 basis points to 37.8 percent. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $458 million for the quarter, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared to $1.14 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\nFull-Year 2017\nGAAP revenue decreased 1.3 percent to $9,123 million from $9,241 million in the prior year period. Operating income increased to $1,492 million from $1,298 million in the prior year period, while operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 16.4 percent. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $1,319 million for the year, or $3.93 per diluted share, compared to $1.72 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nFor the year, organic revenue increased 2.0 percent. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $3,068 million for the year, from $2,945 million in the prior year period, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points to 33.6 percent. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $1,483 million for the year, or $4.42 per diluted share, compared to $3.82 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n“We are very pleased to deliver results that exceeded our profitability and earnings expectations, delivering exceptional margin expansion and significant shareholder returns,” said Gary Norcross, FIS president and chief executive officer. “Our strategy is working and our leadership team is continuing to execute very well. We are confident in our continuing ability to deliver positive results in a rapidly changing industry.”\nSegment Information\nThe Company’s segment GAAP results were impacted by the divestitures of its public sector and education business and its consulting businesses in 2017.\nIntegrated Financial Solutions (IFS):\nFourth quarter GAAP revenue increased 4.6 percent to $1,200 million from $1,147 million in the prior year quarter.

The Company’s 2018 GAAP guidance is also impacted by the divestitures of its public sector and education business and its consulting businesses in 2017.\n2018 GAAP Guidance\nConsolidated GAAP revenue decrease of 1.5 to 2.5 percent; IFS GAAP revenue increase of 1.5 to 2.5 percent; and GFS GAAP revenue decrease of 4.0 to 5.0 percent Net earnings from continuing operations margin of 11.5 to 13.0 percent Diluted EPS of $3.00 to $3.35\n2018 Non-GAAP Guidance\nConsolidated organic revenue increase of 2.5 to 3.5 percent; IFS organic revenue increase of 2.0 to 3.0 percent; and GFS organic revenue increase of 4.0 to 5.0 percent Adjusted EBITDA margin of 36.0 to 37.0 percent Adjusted EPS of $5.10 to $5.30\nAs a direct result of “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” in 2018 FIS will be incrementally investing up to $100 million into: our employees, innovation and data center consolidation.\nWebcast\nFIS will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. (EDT) Tues., Feb. 6, 2018. To access the webcast, go to the Investor Relations section of FIS’ homepage, www.fisglobal.com . A replay will be available after the conclusion of the live webcast.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP measures include adjusted revenue, constant currency revenue, organic revenue increase/decrease, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (including per share amounts), adjusted cash flow from operations and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’s core operating performance. The constant currency and organic revenue increase/decrease measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue increase/decrease also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures, giving investors further insight into our core performance. Finally, the non-GAAP cash flow measures provide further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.\nAdjusted revenue consists of processing and services revenue, increased to reverse the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment made upon the acquisition of SunGard. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard under GAAP but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting adjustments. The deferred revenue adjustment in purchase accounting was made entirely in the Corporate and Other segment; reported GAAP results for the IFS and GFS segments are not affected by this adjustment and, therefore, no adjusted revenue is presented for these segments.\nConstant currency revenue represents (i) adjusted revenue, as defined above, in respect of the consolidated results and the corporate and other segment and (ii) reported revenue in respect of the IFS and GFS segments, in each case excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.\nOrganic revenue increase/decrease is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period, which is further adjusted to add pre-acquisition revenue of acquired businesses for a portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was owned, and subtract pre-divestiture revenue for divested businesses for the portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was not owned, for any acquisitions or divestitures by FIS.\nEBITDA reflects earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA, as defined above, which also excludes certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted revenue.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. It also excludes the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization, which is recurring.\nAdjusted net earnings per diluted share, or Adjusted EPS, reflects adjusted net earnings from continuing operations divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nAdjusted cash flow from operations reflects GAAP cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations, and excludes certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows.\nFree cash flow reflects adjusted cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.\nAny non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS web site, www.fisglobal.com .\nAbout FIS\nFIS is a global leader in financial services technology, with a focus on retail and institutional banking, payments, asset and wealth management, risk and compliance, and outsourcing solutions.
