    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French defense electronics group Thales ( TCFP.PA ) enjoyed a jump in sales at its cybersecurity business in 2017 and expects further strong growth in the coming years, said executive Laurent Maury.\nMaury said the business generated about 900 million euros ($1.10 billion) in sales over 2017, up from 700 million euros a year earlier. He added it is expected to grow by about 10 percent annually in the coming years.\nGovernments and companies are behind a surge in demand for services and products aimed at better protecting data and information systems, in the wake of several global cyber attacks last year.\n“We’re only at the dawn of a world in which this kind of risk emerges, constantly evolving with increased virulence,” Maury told reporters on Monday.\n“Every additional interconnection represents a potential vulnerability,” he added.\nLast December, research firm Gartner published a report which forecast that worldwide enterprise security spending would total $96.3 billion in 2018, an increase of 8 percent from 2017.\nThales has strengthened its range of cybersecurity products over the last few years.\nIn 2016, it bought data protection services provider Vormetric for 375 million euros ($460 million) - a deal which Maury said had enabled Thales to win a data security contract with BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), France’s biggest bank.\nThales, led by chief executive Patrice Caine, is also expecting its 4.8 billion-euro ($5.9 billion) takeover of digital security group Gemalto ( GTO.AS ), due to be finalised later this year, to reinforce its cybersecurity expertise further.\nOn the cybersecurity front, Thales’ competitors include the likes of telecoms operator Orange ( ORAN.PA ), digital consulting firm Atos ( ATOS.PA ) and Raytheon ( RTN ).\n($1 = 0.8151 euros)\nReporting by Mathieu RosemainEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
