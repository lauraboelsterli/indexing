    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- In a move signaling a shift in RE/MAX technology strategy, RE/MAX, LLC announced today it has acquired booj , an award-winning Colorado-based web design and technology company.\nThe acquisition exemplifies a new approach for RE/MAX that goes beyond adapting third-party vendor products to fit broker and agent needs. Moving forward, RE/MAX will leverage the capabilities of booj and other strategic partners to deliver core technology solutions designed for and with RE/MAX affiliates. The objective: technology platforms that create a distinct competitive edge for RE/MAX brokerages and agents and complement other tech products they choose to use.\n\"Our strategy is to serve the industry's most productive agents by providing technology that saves them time, connects them to buyers and sellers, helps them leverage the brand and its many competitive advantages, and ultimately enables them to be even more productive and successful,\" said Adam Contos , RE/MAX CEO. \"In collaboration with booj, our membership and other strategic partners, we will deliver the best technology to the world's most productive real estate network. The future of global real estate is RE/MAX.\"\nBooj has developed powerful technology systems for more than 40 regional real estate companies and 20,000 agents, allowing agents and brokerages to grow their business. These platforms, designed by and for the real estate industry, include websites, mobile apps, lead generation and cultivation systems and predictive analytics.\n\"We're passionate about building technology that changes agents' lives and makes buying and selling a home easier,\" said Ido Zucker, Enterprise Director and Managing Partner of booj. \"Putting our existing platform and new innovations into the hands of RE/MAX agents will be incredibly rewarding for our entire team. We're excited to see what world-class technologies we can build together.\"\nThe acquisition is one of many RE/MAX initiatives in the past year demonstrating the global franchisor's drive to continue to lead the industry - including a refresh of the powerful RE/MAX brand, the creation of a new Business and Product Strategy team, and the launch of new automated social media and digital marketing solutions for agents.\n\"We're investing in tremendous talent, proven systems and future innovations by acquiring booj, which will develop modern technology that helps our brokers and agents deliver even better service to their buyers and sellers,\" said Contos.\nWhy booj?\nFounded in 2005 by Managing Partners and technology evangelists Ido Zucker and John Sable, booj has rapidly become an industry leader in producing end-to-end productivity solutions for real estate brokerages. The company has won numerous awards and was ranked in the Inc. 5000 for rapid growth for six consecutive years. With its staff of 77 members, booj, whose motto is \"be original or jealous,\" will retain its name and office.\n\"Our extremely talented team at booj has worked hard to deliver dynamic technology to the real estate industry,\" said booj Managing Partner John Sable. \"Joining forces with RE/MAX allows us to invest even more in research and development to take our suite of tools to the next level, bringing new and powerful solutions to busy agents and their buyers and sellers.\"\nAbout the RE/MAX Network\nRE/MAX was founded in 1973 by Dave and Gail Liniger, with an innovative, entrepreneurial culture affording its agents and franchisees the flexibility to operate their businesses with great independence.
