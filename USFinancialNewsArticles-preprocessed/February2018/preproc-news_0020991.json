Based on our strong first-half results and the U.S. tax reform changes, we are increasing our fiscal 2018 Adjusted EPS outlook and now expect growth of 24% to 30% year-over-year.”\n1 This earnings release includes several metrics, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Please see Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release for definitions of such non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to their respective most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSecond-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary\nTotal case volume increased 4.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, with underlying organic growth of 2.0%. Total case volume was driven by a 6.5% increase in independent cases, growth in Performance Brands cases and broad-based growth in Vistar’s sales channels, partially offset by declines in the casual dining segment within Customized.\nNet sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 6.4% to $4.3 billion versus the comparable prior year period. The increase in net sales was driven by growth in Vistar, particularly in the theater, hospitality, retail and vending channels, case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent restaurant channel, and recent acquisitions. Overall food cost inflation was approximately 2.5% in the second quarter.\nGross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 9.7% compared to the prior year period, to $567.6 million. The gross profit increase was led by case growth and from selling an improved mix of customer channels and products, specifically to the independent restaurant channel. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was up 40 basis points over the prior year period to 13.2%.\nOperating expenses grew by 11.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, to $518.5 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to growth in case volume and the resulting impact on variable operational expenses, one-time expenses totaling approximately $18 million, acquisition integration costs within Vistar, as well as an accelerating increase in sales personnel. A significant majority of the one-time costs related to the exit of the Company’s private-equity shareholder during the quarter. Excluding these non-recurring charges, operating expenses would have increased approximately 8.0%.\nDue primarily to one-time expenses, EBITDA decreased 0.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period to $81.5 million. For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA increased 12.2% to $105.0 million compared to the prior year period.\nNet income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 240.6% year-over-year to $78.0 million. The net income increase was a result of the $59.2 million decrease in income tax expense. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) and the excess tax benefit of $15.4 million, or $0.14 per share associated with the performance vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards.\nDiluted EPS increased 240.9% to $0.75 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 over the prior year period. The federal tax rate reduction caused PFG to recognize a $37.4 million, or $0.36 per share, one-time non-cash gain in the second quarter, related to the revaluation of its net deferred income tax liability. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 37.9% to $0.40 per share in the second quarter over the prior year period.\nFirst-Half Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary\nTotal case volume increased 3.9% in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, with underlying organic growth of 2.1%.\nNet sales for the first half of fiscal 2018 was $8.7 billion, an increase of 7.1% versus the comparable prior year period. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales growth in Vistar, particularly in the theater, hospitality, retail, and vending channels, case growth in Performance Foodservice, particularly in the independent restaurant channel, and recent acquisitions.\nGross profit increased 9.1% compared to the prior year period, to $1.1 billion. The gross profit increase in the first half of fiscal 2018 was led by case growth and an improved sales mix of customer channels and products, specifically to the independent restaurant channel. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was up 20 basis points over the prior year period to 12.9%.\nOperating expenses increased 8.2% in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period, to $1.0 billion. The increase was primarily due to case volume growth and the resulting impact on variable operational expenses, one-time costs primarily related to the exit of the Company’s private-equity shareholder and acquisition integration costs within Vistar, partially offset by a decrease in professional, legal and consulting expenses within Corporate.\nOperating profit was up 20.1% to $99.6 million driven by strong top-line and gross profit growth and mix of business specifically within the independent restaurant channel. Net income was up 186.6% to $100.6 million for the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. The significant increase in net income was a result of the Company’s strong operating profit performance combined with the $52.9 million decrease in income tax expense due primarily to the Act.\nEBITDA increased 13.6% in the first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period to $163.7 million. For the first half of fiscal 2018, Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.4% to $195.7 million compared to the prior year period.\nDiluted EPS increased 182.4% in the first half of fiscal 2018 over the prior year period, to $0.96. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 36.7% in the first half over the prior year period, to $0.67 per share.\nCash Flow and Capital Spending\nIn the first six months of fiscal 2018, PFG generated $32.6 million in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of $58.1 million versus the prior year period. The improvement in cash flow from operating activities was largely driven by higher operating income and improvements in working capital.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Company invested $38.5 million in capital expenditures. PFG now expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 will be between $140 million and $160 million. The fiscal 2018 capital expenditures estimate is lower than the Company’s previously provided estimate due to the timing of projects.\nSecond-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Segment Results\nPerformance Foodservice (PFS)\nPFS net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 7.5% to $2.5 billion compared to the prior year period. Net sales growth was driven by an increase in cases sold, including 6.5% independent case growth and solid independent customer demand for Performance Brands. For the quarter, independent sales as a percentage of total segment sales was up over 100 basis points to 44.5%.\nEBITDA for PFS increased almost 10% to $83.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. EBITDA growth was driven by a nearly 8% increase in gross profit and strong operating expense control, offset slightly by an increase in fuel expense. The increase in gross profit per case resulted from a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold to independent customers and increased sales of Performance Brands.\nVistar\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Vistar net sales grew 13.7% to $838.9 million compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by strong case sales growth in the segment’s theater, hospitality, retail, and vending channels.\nSecond-quarter EBITDA for Vistar was up 3.0% versus the prior year to $34.0 million. Gross profit dollar growth of 19.3% for the second quarter was fueled by an increase in the number of cases sold and a favorable change in sales mix. Second quarter EBITDA was impacted by higher variable operating costs associated with higher case volume, integration costs related to recent acquisitions and higher warehouse personnel costs and fuel expense. The Company expects these higher costs to mostly abate throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.\nPFG Customized\nNet sales for PFG Customized decreased 4.9% to $888.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the Georgia facility that was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, net sales would have been slightly positive in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period as a result of a favorable shift in customer mix.\nPFG Customized EBITDA decreased 11.9% to $5.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in EBITDA was driven by higher operating expenses, including higher warehouse personnel costs and fuel expense, partially offset by an increase in gross profit, which was primarily the result of a favorable shift in customer mix.\nTax Update\nOn December 22, 2017, HR1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. The federal income tax rate for PFG will decrease from the previous 35% rate to a blended 28% rate for fiscal 2018 based on PFG’s fiscal year calendar. This federal rate will decrease in fiscal 2019 and thereafter to 21%. PFG’s effective tax rate from operations is expected to decrease from the previous 40% rate to approximately 33% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, and further decline to approximately 27% in fiscal 2019.\nThe federal rate reduction caused PFG to recognize a $37.4 million one-time non-cash gain in the second quarter, relating to the revaluation of its net deferred income tax liability. There was also a year-to-date true up of tax expense in the second quarter to adjust the federal tax rate booked in the first quarter at 35% down to the 28% blended tax rate applicable to fiscal 2018. This resulted in a non-cash gain of approximately $2.5 million in the second quarter.\nFor the remainder of fiscal 2018, the Company expects cash tax savings of approximately $15 million to $18 million, driven by the lower federal tax rate and the first-year deduction for machinery and equipment, excluding discreet items.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018, PFG reaffirms its Adjusted EBITDA growth to be in a range of 8% to 11% higher than its fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $390.7 million. The Company continues to expect second-half Adjusted EBITDA growth to be in the high single digits. The Company also continues to expect to be at the higher end of the full-year Adjusted EBITDA range. Based on the Company’s strong first-half results and the U.S. tax reform changes, PFG increases its Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook representing growth in a range of 24% to 30% to $1.54 to $1.61 over its fiscal 2017 Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.24. This compares to the Company’s prior Adjusted Diluted EPS growth of 13% to 18%.\nPFG’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook and full-year forecast for its effective tax rate on operations exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, but are not limited to, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, certain tax items, and charges associated with non-recurring professional and legal fees associated with acquisitions. PFG’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these income and expense items on its reported net income, its reported Diluted EPS, and its reported effective tax rate because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, PFG does not provide a reconciliation to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measure for its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook or its effective tax rate on operations forecast. Please see the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this release for a discussion of certain risks to PFG’s outlook.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, a conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on February 7, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Such measures are not recognized terms under GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are not indicative of net income as determined under GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate the Company’s liquidity or financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because of varying methods of calculation.\nManagement measures operating performance based on PFG’s EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization.\nPFG believes that the presentation of EBITDA enhances an investor’s understanding of PFG’s performance. PFG believes this measure is a useful metric to assess PFG’s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that PFG believes are not representative of PFG’s core business. PFG uses this measure to evaluate the performance of its segments and for business planning purposes.\nIn addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the company’s credit and indenture agreements (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under PFG’s credit agreement and indenture, the Company’s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement and indenture).\nManagement also uses Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure by excluding the same items excluded in PFG’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as certain one-time income tax items, to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable GAAP financial measure.\nPFG believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is useful to investors because these metrics are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in PFG’s industry.\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nPERFORMANCE FOOD GROUP COMPANY\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited)\nThree months ended ($ in millions, except per share data) December 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nChange % Net income (GAAP) $ 78.0 $ 22.9 $ 55.1 240.6 Interest expense 15.1 13.6 1.5 11.0 Income tax (benefit) expense (43.9 ) 15.3 (59.2 ) NM Depreciation 24.3 22.5 1.8 8.0 Amortization of intangible assets 8.0 7.9 0.1 1.3 EBITDA 81.5 82.2 (0.7 ) (0.9 ) Impact of non-cash items (A) 11.8 3.8 8.0 210.5 Impact of acquisition, integration & reorganization charges (B) 1.7 3.8 (2.1 ) (55.3 ) Impact of productivity initiatives (C) 8.5 2.7 5.8 214.8 Impact of other adjustment items (D) 1.5 1.1 0.4 36.4 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $ 105.0 $ 93.6 $ 11.4 12.2 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.75 $ 0.22 $ 0.53 240.9 Impact of non-cash items 0.11 0.04 0.07 175.0 Impact of acquisition, integration & reorganization charges 0.02 0.04 (0.02 ) (50.0 ) Impact of productivity initiatives 0.08 0.03 0.05 166.7 Impact of other adjustment items 0.01 0.01 — — Tax impact of above adjustments (0.07 ) (0.05 ) (0.02 ) (40.0 ) Tax impact of revaluation of net deferred tax liability (E) (0.36 ) — (0.36 ) NM Tax impact of stock-based compensation - performance vesting (F) (0.14 ) — (0.14 ) NM Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (Non-GAAP) $ 0.40 $ 0.29 $ 0.11 37.9 A.

Segment Results\nWe have three segments as described above—Performance Foodservice, PFG Customized, and Vistar. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on their respective sales growth and EBITDA. For PFG Customized, EBITDA includes certain allocated corporate expenses that are included in operating expenses. The allocated corporate expenses are determined based on a percentage of total sales. This percentage is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that the allocation reflects a reasonable rate of corporate expenses based on their use of corporate services.\nCorporate & All Other is comprised of corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense, as well as the operations of certain recent acquisitions.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reorganized its information technology department, and expenses associated with business application teams are now included in the segments results. The EBITDA for Performance Foodservice, Vistar and Corporate & All Other for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016 has been adjusted to reflect this change.\nThe following tables set forth net sales and EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\nNet Sales\nThree Months Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change % Performance Foodservice $\n2,535.3\n$\n2,358.2\n$\n177.1\n7.5 PFG Customized 888.2 933.5 (45.3\n)\n(4.9\n)\nVistar 838.9 737.9 101.0 13.7 Corporate & All Other 110.6 77.9 32.7 42.0 Intersegment Eliminations (61.9\n)\n(55.7 ) (6.2\n)\n(11.1\n)\nTotal net sales $\n4,311.1\n$\n4,051.8\n$\n259.3\n6.4 Six Months Ended\nDecember 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change % Performance Foodservice $\n5,162.4\n$\n4,794.6\n$\n367.8\n7.7 PFG Customized 1,784.3 1,800.8 (16.5\n)\n(0.9\n)\nVistar 1,635.7 1,479.4 156.3 10.6 Corporate & All Other 218.7 136.8 81.9 59.9 Intersegment Eliminations (125.1\n)\n(113.7\n)\n(11.4\n)\n(10.0\n)\nTotal net sales $\n8,676.0\n$\n8,097.9\n$\n578.1\n7.1 EBITDA\nThree Months Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change % Performance Foodservice $\n83.0\n$\n75.5\n$\n7.5\n9.9 PFG Customized 5.9 6.7 (0.8\n)\n(11.9\n)\nVistar 34.0 33.0 1.0 3.0 Corporate & All Other (41.4\n)\n(33.0\n)\n(8.4\n)\n(25.5\n)\nTotal EBITDA $\n81.5\n$\n82.2\n$\n(0.7\n)\n(0.9\n)\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change % Performance Foodservice $\n161.8\n$\n148.1\n$\n13.7\n9.3 PFG Customized 11.1 10.6 0.5 4.7 Vistar 59.8 54.8 5.0 9.1 Corporate & All Other (69.0\n)\n(69.4\n)\n0.4 0.6 Total EBITDA $\n163.7\n$\n144.1\n$\n19.6\n13.6\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005206/en/\nPerformance Food Group Company\nInvestors:\nMichael D.
