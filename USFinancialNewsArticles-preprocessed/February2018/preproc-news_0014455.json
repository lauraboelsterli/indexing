    "text": "GREENEVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ:FWRD) today reported operating revenue, income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 15.6% to $306.1 million from $264.8 million for the same quarter in 2016. Income from operations was $28.8 million, compared to $28.2 million in the prior year quarter. Net income during the period was $35.4 million compared to $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.18 compared to $0.42 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted to exclude the $0.16 per share impact of the second quarter 2016 TQI impairment on income taxes, prior year quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.58.\nBruce A. Campbell, Chairman, President, and CEO, commenting on fourth quarter results said, “Our business units had mixed results during an operationally challenging fourth quarter. Expedited LTL managed its seasonally busy quarter amid a tight Truckload market to deliver strong performance despite a higher use of brokered transportation. Truckload Premium Services also faced a higher use of brokered transportation as it began adjusting to market rates while honoring its committed customer contracts. Our Intermodal group showed good growth while completing the integration of Atlantic and Kansas City Logistics. Pool Distribution managed its peak quarter to generate revenue growth but faced higher variable costs in accommodating this volume, along with an equipment disposal charge.”\nIn closing Mr. Campbell said, “During 2017, our revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time in Forward Air’s history. As we end the year, I would like to thank all of our employees and independent contractors for their hard work in helping us achieve this milestone. As we enter 2018 we are well positioned to continue Forward Air’s growth by providing our customers with value added freight and logistics solutions.”\nCommenting on the Company’s fourth quarter results, Michael J. Morris, Senior Vice President and CFO, said, “Our fourth quarter net income per diluted share reflects a $0.53 benefit related to the fourth quarter enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). When excluding this TCJA impact, our net income per diluted share would have been $0.65, exceeding our $0.60-$0.64 guidance range.” Regarding the Company’s first quarter 2018 guidance, Mr. Morris said, “We expect first quarter year-on-year revenue growth to be 19% to 23%. This revenue outlook contemplates our 2018 implementation of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which now requires that we report fuel surcharge revenue on a gross basis. As such, our growth outlook reflects a comparison to our first quarter 2017 revenue which reported fuel surcharge revenue on a net basis. If this prior year period was adjusted to reflect fuel surcharge revenue on a gross basis, we expect our year-on-year revenue growth to be 12% to 16%. We expect net income per diluted share to be between $0.55 and $0.59 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.47 in the prior year quarter.”\nA tabular reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to reported results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) is contained in the financial summary statements attached to this press release.\nOn February 6, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2018, and is expected to be paid on March 23, 2018.\nThis quarterly dividend is pursuant to a cash dividend policy approved by the Board of Directors, which anticipates a total annual dividend of $0.60 per share of common stock, payable in quarterly increments of $0.15 per share of common stock. The actual declaration of future cash dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates, is subject to final determination by the Board of Directors each quarter after its review of the Company's financial performance.\nReview of Financial Results\nForward Air will hold a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. EST. The Company's conference call will be available online at www.forwardaircorp.com or by dialing (800) 230-1074. A replay of the conference call will be available at www.forwardaircorp.com beginning shortly after the completion of the live call.\nAbout Forward Air Corporation\nForward Air keeps your business moving forward by providing services within four business segments: Expedited LTL (provides expedited regional, inter-regional and national LTL services, including local pick-up and delivery, shipment consolidation/deconsolidation, warehousing, and customs brokerage by utilizing a comprehensive national network of terminals); Truckload Premium Services (provides expedited truckload brokerage, dedicated fleet services, as well as high-security and temperature-controlled logistics services); Intermodal (provides first-and last-mile high-value drayage services both to and from seaports and railheads, dedicated contract and Container Freight Station warehouse and handling services); and Pool Distribution (provides high-frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations within a specific geographic region).

However, the Company also uses “non-GAAP financial measures” that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, the Company believes that meaningful analysis of its financial performance in 2017 and 2016 requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance, including an understanding of items that are non-operational. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.\nThis press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted effective income tax rate and guidance with respect to adjusted net income per diluted share. These measures exclude intangible asset impairment costs and intangible asset impairment tax ramifications related to TQI for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company believes that excluding these items will assist investors in understanding our core operating performance and allow for more accurate comparisons of results.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. As required by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the tables below present, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nForward Air Corporation Reconciliation to U.S. GAAP (In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) Three months ended December 31, 2016 Income\nbefore\ntaxes\nIncome\ntaxes\nEffective\ntax rate\nNet\nIncome\nDiluted\nearnings\nper share\nReported (GAAP) $ 28.0 $ 15.3 54.6 % $ 12.7 $ 0.42 Items impacting comparability: Impact of TQI impairment on income taxes — (5.0 ) 17.8 % 5.0 0.16 After considering items (Non-GAAP) $ 28.0 $ 10.3 36.8 % $ 17.7 $ 0.58 The following table summarizes supplemental full year 2018 guidance information that management believes to be useful.\nForward Air Corporation Additional Guidance Data (In thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Three months ended Actual December 31, 2017 Net income $ 35,373 Income allocated to participating securities (284 ) Numerator for diluted income per share - net income $ 35,089 Fully diluted share count 29,635 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.18 Projected Full year 2018 Projected tax rate 25.0 % Projected year end fully diluted share count (before consideration of future share repurchases) 28,800 Projected capital expenditures, net $ 46,000 Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will” and similar references to future periods. Forward-looking statements included in this press release relate to expected first quarter 2018 operating results, such as revenue growth and earnings, and guidance relating to income per diluted share, adjusted income per diluted share and adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight moving through our network or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network, tax matters, the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner-operators and freight handlers needed to serve our transportation needs, our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions and the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006114/en/\nForward Air Corporation\nMichael J.
