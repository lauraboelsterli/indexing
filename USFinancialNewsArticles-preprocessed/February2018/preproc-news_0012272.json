    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 11:27 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Goldman in talks with Apple to finance iPhone sales: WSJ Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) is in talks to offer financing to shoppers buying Apple ( AAPL.O ) products including iPhones, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. \nBuyers of a $1,000 iPhone X could take out a loan from Goldman instead of charging it to credit cards that often carry high interest rates, the report said, citing anonymous sources. ( on.wsj.com/2EaOgYg ) \nTalks between the iPhone maker and the Wall Street bank are ongoing and could still fall apart, the Journal reported. \nNeither Apple nor Goldman were immediately available for comment.
