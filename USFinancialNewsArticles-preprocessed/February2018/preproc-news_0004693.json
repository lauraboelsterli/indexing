The volume in the previous trading session was 20.73 billion. ** As of 0703 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 29.40 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is above its 50-day moving average and above its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 15.89 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 1.8 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has fallen by -2.01 percent to 30.69 trillion yuan.
