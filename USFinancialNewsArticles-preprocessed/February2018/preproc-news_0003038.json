    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) today reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"2017 was a strong year for Facebook, but it was also a hard one,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO. \"In 2018, we're focused on making sure Facebook isn't just fun to use, but also good for people's well-being and for society. We're doing this by encouraging meaningful connections between people rather than passive consumption of content. Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people's time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\"\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear-\nover- Year\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear-\nover-Year\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\nIn millions, except percentages and per share amounts\nRevenue:\nAdvertising\n$\n12,779\n$\n8,629\n48\n%\n$\n39,942\n$\n26,885\n49\n%\nPayments and other fees\n193\n180\n7\n%\n711\n753\n(6)\n%\nTotal revenue\n12,972\n8,809\n47\n%\n40,653\n27,638\n47\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n5,620\n4,243\n32\n%\n20,450\n15,211\n34\n%\nIncome from operations\n$\n7,352\n$\n4,566\n61\n%\n$\n20,203\n$\n12,427\n63\n%\nOperating margin\n57\n%\n52\n%\n50\n%\n45\n%\nProvision for income taxes (1)\n$\n3,194\n$\n4,660\nEffective tax rate (1)\n43\n%\n23\n%\nNet income (1)\n$\n4,268\n$\n3,568\n20\n%\n$\n15,934\n$\n10,217\n56\n%\nDiluted Earnings per Share (EPS) (1)\n$\n1.44\n$\n1.21\n19\n%\n$\n5.39\n$\n3.49\n54\n%\n(1)\nIn December 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and significantly impacted U.S. tax law. As a result of this legislation, our fourth quarter and full year 2017 provision for income taxes increased by $2.27 billion, which impacted our effective tax rate, net income and diluted EPS for such periods. Our diluted EPS decreased by $0.77 for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. See \"2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" below for additional information.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\nDaily active users (DAUs) – DAUs were 1.40 billion on average for December 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Monthly active users (MAUs) – MAUs were 2.13 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mobile advertising revenue – Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 89% of advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from approximately 84% of advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures – Capital expenditures were $2.26 billion and $6.73 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities – Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $41.71 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Headcount – Headcount was 25,105 as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 47% year-over-year.\n2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As a result, our provision for income taxes increased by $2.27 billion and our diluted EPS decreased by $0.77 for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be provisional due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nFacebook will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today.

People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what's going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nDeborah Crawford\ninvestor@fb.com / investor.fb.com\nPress:\nVanessa Chan\npress@fb.com / newsroom.fb.com\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business expectations, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; risks associated with new product development and their introduction as well as other new business initiatives; our emphasis on user growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; competition; litigation; privacy and regulatory concerns; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; and our ability to manage growth and geographically-dispersed operations. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 2, 2017, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is January 31, 2018, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment. We subtract purchases of property and equipment in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nFACEBOOK, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except for per
