    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 2:52 AM / Updated an hour ago Casino magnate Steve Wynn steps down as CEO after sexual misconduct claims Farah Master 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - U.S. casino mogul Steve Wynn has resigned as CEO of his company Wynn Resorts following claims he routinely subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances, becoming the latest prominent business leader to quit over sexual misconduct allegations. \nThe company said it has appointed Matt Maddox, its president since 2013, as chief executive. \nWynn, 76, has denied the accusations published by the Wall Street Journal as “preposterous” and said they were instigated by his ex-wife to seek advantage in their divorce lawsuit. \n“In the last couple of weeks, I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity...I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles,” he said in a statement. \nHis decision to step down as CEO and chairman from the company he founded follows his resignation as the finance chairman of the U.S. Republican Party’s fundraising arm, the Republican National Committee, in January. \nShares in Wynn Resorts, worth around $17 billion, have tumbled nearly 20 percent since the Journal report on Jan 26. Shares in Wynn Macau Ltd slumped around 17 percent before they were put on a trading halt on Wednesday.

Kerkorian then created MGM Mirage and Wynn went on to create Wynn Resorts with his ex-wife in 2002. \nWynn has a net worth of $3.3 billion according to Forbes.
