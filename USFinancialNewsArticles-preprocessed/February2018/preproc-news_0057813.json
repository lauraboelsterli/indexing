    "text": "NEW YORK, via NetworkWire – NetworkNewsWire (\"NNW\"), a multifaceted financial news and publishing company, today announces the publication of an editorial featuring SinglePoint, Inc. (OTC:SING), a client of NNW focused on strengthening its position in the marijuana industry through the acquisition of, or investment in, small to mid-sized cannabis companies.\nTo view the full publication, titled “Blockchain Innovations Set to Disrupt Healthcare,” visit: http://nnw.fm/8HkkD .\nOne company delving into this application of blockchain is SinglePoint (SING) . Established as a mobile technology provider, the company has grown into a diverse holding company with a portfolio of investments in cannabis, blockchain and related technologies. By using an acquisition-based growth strategy, SinglePoint has significantly increased the technology and expertise it can bring to bear on a blockchain project and other corporate endeavors. This has led to a dramatic expansion in its services and a subsequent rise in its share price, from $0.01 to nearly $0.08 on volume of more than 3.5 million in a single year.\nData integration is central to the challenge facing healthcare providers. The scattered nature of medical records means that one of the biggest problems is connecting the dots to provide better care and improve efficiency. Fortunately, the integration of existing systems lies at the heart of SinglePoint’s work. Its acquisition of various blockchain companies has led to the deployment of integrated solutions in areas such as payment processing ( http://nnw.fm/74SlQ ). It is also providing technological solutions for supply chain management and delivery of goods, areas where the medical sector could benefit from improved data collection and process efficiency.\nAbout SinglePoint, Inc.\nSinglePoint, Inc. (SING) has grown from a full-service mobile technology provider to a publicly traded holding company. Through diversification into horizontal markets, SinglePoint is building its portfolio by acquiring an interest in undervalued subsidiaries, thereby providing a rich, diversified holding base. Through its subsidiary company SingleSeed, the company is providing products and services to the cannabis industry.
