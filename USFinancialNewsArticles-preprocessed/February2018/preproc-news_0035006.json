    "text": "LUSAKA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Austalian company EMR Capital plans to double production at Zambia’s Lubambe copper mine, a company official said on Wednesday after completion of EMR’s acquisition of a majority stake for $100 million.\n“Our first task is to lift copper production to above 40,000 tonnes and we want to do that in the next two years,” EMR Capital executive chairman Owen Hegarty told reporters.\nHegarty said EMR would also embark on a feasibility study in the next six months for the development of another mine within the Lubambe Copper Mine licence area over the next two years.
