Net income was attributable to market-to-market changes in valuation of the Company's derivative securities, with additional efficiencies from reduced operating expenses.\nFor the First Quarter of 2018, or the quarterly period ending September 30, 2017, the Company reported:\nNet Income of $555,989, or $0.003 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018; Revenues of $504,778, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018; Revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 related to producer reimbursement fees and animation services, in connection with the commencement of production of a planned world tour featuring the virtual performance of one of the world's historically highest selling music groups. Net income was attributable to the market-to-market changes in valuation of the Company's derivative securities, with continuing efficiencies from reduced operating expenses.\nAbout Pulse Evolution Corporation\nThe Company is a recognized pioneer and leading developer of hyper-realistic digital humans for entertainment, virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. Pulse is most popularly known for producing the animated digital human likeness of the late Michael Jackson that appeared in a live performance of the Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014, seen by more than 11 million television viewers and generating more than 2,400 news articles and 98 billion Internet impressions.\nFounded by the world's leading executives and producers of photorealistic digital humans, such as the lead character from the film \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" and the concert experience \"Tupac at Coachella', Pulse Evolution is currently developing computer-generated digital humans for entertainment and media applications, such as holographic live performances, virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. The Company has a multi-year revenue share agreement with the Estate of Michael Jackson, and the Company also counts the estates of Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as significant shareholders.\nThe Company sees digital humans emerging as ubiquitous in society, culture and industry. They will not only perform for audiences on stage or in film, but they will also represent individual consumers as digital likeness avatars, in realistic and fantasy form, appearing and interacting on the consumer's behalf in electronic and mobile communication, social media, video games and virtual reality. Future digital humans will provide a relatable human interface for artificial intelligence applications, 'thinking' machine systems that, through the Company's technology, will appear as realistic communicating humans in mobile devices, digital signage, classrooms and through lightweight wearable augmented reality glasses and virtual reality headsets. The Company's long-term goal is to develop its technology beyond entertainment applications, ultimately supporting licensees and joint venture partners who are seeking to build the 'face' of artificial intelligence, to provide a human form to interactive artificially intelligent computer beings.\nPulse has operations in Hobe Sound, Florida and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nForward-Looking Statements and Unaudited Reporting Disclaimer:\nCertain statements contained in this news release are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
