    "text": "February 5, 2018 / 4:00 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Indian bond yields rise further tracking U.S. peers; RBI in focus Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian bond yields rose on Monday morning tracking their U.S. counterparts while fears of the Reserve Bank of India adopting a more hawkish stance after the recent central budget also weighed on sentiment. \nThe RBI is set to hold its monetary policy meeting on Feb. 6-7, the outcome of which is due at 0900 GMT on Wednesday. \nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield was at 7.58 percent, up 2 basis points on the day by 0350 GMT. Yields had risen as much as 6 bps to 7.62 pct in early trade. \nA strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday raised concerns the Federal Reserve might hasten to increase interest rates to stem inflation, compounding a bond market rout that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high.
