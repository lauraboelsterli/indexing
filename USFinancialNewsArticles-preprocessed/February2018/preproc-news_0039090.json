Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net MORNING CALL: EUROPE SEEN UP (0619 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. European shares are seen opening higher today following strong gains on Friday when continued strenght in company updates helped the pan-European STOXX 600 snap a three-week losing. Over in Asia, shares gained, joining a global recovery for equity markets as sentiment improved gradually from a recent shakeout that stemmed from fears of creeping inflation and higher borrowing costs. Financial spreadbetters expect London's FTSE to open 12 points higher at 7,306.4, Frankfurt's DAX to open 95 points higher at 12,545.5 and Paris' CAC to open 23 points higher at 5,305 (Danilo Masoni)",
