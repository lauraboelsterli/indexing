    "text": "UNITED NATIONS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - A Reuters investigation into the killing of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and other reports of grave abuses “demand our attention and action,” a senior United Nations official told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.\nDeputy U.N. political affairs chief Miroslav Jenca called for the release of two detained Reuters journalists, telling the 15-member council: “The ability to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information is a barometer for respect for human rights more broadly.” (Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n ",
