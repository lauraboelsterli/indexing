Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, predictions, forecasts, objectives or assumptions of future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements include our expectation regarding the effective time o f the proposed merger of IBCP and TCSB. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, known and unknown risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual strategies, actions or results to differ materially from those expressed in them, and are not guarantees of timing, future results or other events or performance. Because forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future strategies, actions or results, based on management’s current expectations, assumptions and estimates on the date hereof, and there can be no assurance that actual strategies, actions or results will not differ materially from expectations, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the failure to obtain the requisite approval of the merger agreement by TCSB shareholders or the failure of any other condition to the closing of the proposed merger. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and IBCP undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise.\nImportant Additional Information\nThis communication is being made in respect of the proposed merger transaction involving IBCP and TCSB.
