    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorney Advertising--Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (\"Bristol-Myers\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: BMY) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Bristol-Myers securities during the period between January 27, 2015 and October 9, 2016, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/bmy .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) that Bristol-Myers' CheckMate-026 trial was more likely to fail than Defendants were representing; (2) that Bristol- Myers' CheckMate-026 trial failed more severely than the Company indicated it did in the Company's August 5, 2016 announcements and disclosures; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' statements about Bristol-Myers' business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and/or misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.\nOn August 5, 2016, Bristol-Myers revealed that its CheckMate-026 trial exploring the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy failed for not meeting its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Following this news, Bristol-Myers stock dropped $12.04 per share, or 16%, to close at $63.28 per share on August 5, 2016. The stock price continued to drop and closed at $60.30 per share on August 8, 2016. Then on October 9, 2016, Bristol-Myers revealed the final primary analysis of CheckMate-026, and that the overall Opdivo survival was only 14.4 months compared to chemotherapy's 13.2 months. Following this news, Bristol-Myers stock dropped $5.62 per share, or over 10%, to close at $49.81 per share on October 10, 2016.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
