    "text": "(Adds details)\nFeb 7 (Reuters) - British business support services company DCC Plc said on Wednesday it would buy a U.S.-based healthcare manufacturing services provider, and said third-quarter operating profit rose from last year, in line with expectations.\nThe deal to buy Elite One Source Nutritional Services, with an enterprise value of $50 million, will bring DCCâ€™s healthcare business into the U.S. market, the UK group said.\nDCC, which provides services ranging from distributing oil to making The Body Shop brand body butters, had announced a record 550 million pounds in deals in 2017 as it seeks to broaden its footprint beyond Europe.\nIn its energy business, its largest, the third-quarter operating profit was in line with expectations as a rise in crude oil prices was offset by cost control, the company said.
