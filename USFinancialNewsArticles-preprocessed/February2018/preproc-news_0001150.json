    "text": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Allergan ( AGN.N ) will make a one-time payment of $700 million to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries ( TEVA.TA ) to settle a dispute over working capital, Israel-based Teva said on Thursday. \nTeva will use the payment, which is expected during the first quarter of 2018, to repay part of its debt. \nTeva ( TEVA.N ) and Allergan agreed to jointly dismiss the working capital dispute arbitration. \nAs of Jan. 12, 2018, Allergan owned 68.7 million shares in Teva, which it received as partial payment for Tevaâ€™s $40.5 billion acquisition of Actavis Generics from Allergan in 2016. \nReporting by Tova Cohen\n ",
