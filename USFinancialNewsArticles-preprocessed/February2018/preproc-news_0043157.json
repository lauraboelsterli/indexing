    "text": "11:40 AM EST \nIf you’re an Apple iPhone user who also enjoys Twitter, listen up. \nPranksters on the social media service have been sharing a character from the Indian Telugu language that causes iPhones to crash, according to Mashable. The offending users have been putting the character into their Twitter usernames and tweets and encouraging people to share them with their friends. If the character lands in a user’s Twitter feed, it will cause the social app to crash. The app will continue to crash after users try to boot it back up, ultimately stopping victims from accessing the service on their iPhones. \nLast week, reports surfaced saying that a single Telugu character was enough to wreak havoc on iPhones. When the character is sent via any messaging or social networking app, the affected user’s app will crash . While it’s an obscure bug that only affects Apple’s iOS 11, it’s one that pranksters and those trying to cause harm are exploiting across the Internet. Worst of all, there’s no fix at the moment and unsuspecting victims needn’t do anything to be affected. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nApple acknowledged the Telugu bug last week and has promised a fix . The company hasn’t yet delivered, though, and it’s impossible to say when it’ll be released. \nAccording to Mashable, which tested the bug on Twitter, the only way for affected users to regain access to the app is to log in via Safari and block the person that shared the character. At that point, the character won’t show up in their feeds and Twitter will be accessible. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
