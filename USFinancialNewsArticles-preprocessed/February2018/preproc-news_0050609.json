Fourth quarter 2017 production averaged 128,045 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) and came in at the high end of guidance. Capex for the fourth quarter 2017 of $171 million was $38 million below guidance. Fourth quarter 2017 net cash provided by operating activities of $287 million exceeded capital expenditures by $116 million. Whiting’s oil differentials of $4.21 per barrel (Bbl) came in below the low end of guidance and general and administrative (G&A) expense of $2.69 per BOE came in at the low end of guidance. Guidance at the midpoint called for $7.00 per Bbl and $2.80 per BOE, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017 and subsequent to year-end, the Company added to its hedges and is now 70% hedged for 2018 as a percentage of December 2017 production with a mix of swaps and collars as detailed later in the press release. On February 1, 2018, Whiting paid $61 million to settle a volume contract associated with its Redtail field on a discounted basis. The contract commitment equaled 20,000 gross barrels of oil per day through April 2020 and had an associated fee of $3.93 per barrel.\nOperating and Financial Results\nThe following table summarizes the operating and financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, including non-cash charges recorded during those periods:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Production (MBOE/d) (1) 128.05 118.89 Net cash provided by operating activities-MM $ 286.7 $ 236.8 Discretionary cash flow-MM (2) $ 266.9 $ 170.9 Realized price ($/BOE) $ 40.07 $ 33.27 Total operating revenues-MM $ 474.4 $ 342.7 Net loss attributable to common shareholders-MM (3)(4) $ (798.3 ) $ (173.3 ) Per basic share (5) $ (8.80 ) $ (2.34 ) Per diluted share (5) $ (8.80 ) $ (2.34 ) Adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders-MM (6) $ (15.7\n) $ (82.6 ) Per basic share (5) $ (0.17\n) $ (1.12 ) Per diluted share (5) $ (0.17\n) $ (1.12 ) (1) Fourth quarter 2016 includes 6,690 BOE/d from properties that have since been divested.

Holly, Whiting’s President and CEO, commented, “I would like to thank Whiting employees for their outstanding efforts that culminated in an excellent fourth quarter and strong start to 2018. Looking forward, we will work together to achieve our goal of becoming a top-tier E&P company as measured by capital efficient growth and free cash flow generation.”\n2018 Capital Plan\nIn 2018, Whiting plans to spend $750 million as part of its capital plan which is forecast to generate average annual production of 128,400 BOE/d. This represents 9% growth over 2017 average annual production. At current prices, Whiting estimates this will generate solid free cash flow.\n$600 million, or 80%, of the capital budget will be spent on operated development activities in the Williston Basin. Williston Basin operated production is forecast to grow 14% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. $50 million, or 7%, will be spent on non-op development activities in the Williston Basin. $75 million, or 10%, will be spent on development activities at Redtail to complete 22 drilled uncompleted (DUC) wells. $25 million, or 3%, will be dedicated to land and facilities.\nThe Company ended 2017 with 51 DUC wells in its Bakken/Three Forks play in the Williston Basin and 39 DUC wells at its DJ Basin/Redtail field in Weld County, Colorado. During 2018, Whiting plans to drill 120 Bakken/Three Forks wells in its Williston Basin area and no wells in its Redtail area. The Company plans to put on production 123 wells in its Williston Basin area and 22 wells in its Redtail area.\nReserves Update\nYear-end 2017 proved reserves totaled 617.6 MMBOE. Proved developed producing reserves equaled 54% of total reserves versus 47% of 2016 year-end reserves.\nOperations Update\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, total net production for the Company averaged 128,045 BOE/d, a 12% increase over third quarter levels. The Bakken/Three Forks play in the Williston Basin averaged 106,850 BOE/d, a 5% increase over third quarter levels. Operated Williston Basin production averaged 95,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter 2017. The Redtail Niobrara/Codell play in the DJ Basin averaged 20,625 BOE/d, a 75% increase over third quarter levels. During the fourth quarter 2017, Whiting drilled 27 wells in its Williston Basin area and no wells in its Redtail area and put 21 wells on production in the Williston Basin and 25 wells on production at Redtail.\nThe following table depicts noteworthy pads Whiting brought on production during the fourth quarter 2017:\nPad Name\nWell Count\nCounty\nAverage 24-Hour IP\nPer Well\nFlatland 24-9 Pad 3 McKenzie 2,862 Frick 24-8 Pad 3 McKenzie 2,059 Hellandsaas 44-8 Pad 2 McKenzie 3,085 King 11-8 Pad 3 Williams 2,492 Scanlan 11-5 Pad 2 Williams 2,332 Scanlan 42-9 Pad 3 Williams 1,916 Implementing New Operating Philosophy and Compensation Metric to Incentivize Returns\nWhiting plans to implement a new optimized completion philosophy designed to maximize resource recovery and economic returns per drilling spacing unit. In 2018, the Company anticipates completing wells with proppant loads that range from 6-12 million pounds across 33-50 stages. This program is designed to maximize capital productivity at the corporate level through determining the optimal well configuration and cost by operating area. In support of this initiative, the Whiting Board of Directors has elected to incentivize a focus on returns and profitability by adding a drilling rate of return metric to Whiting’s executive compensation metrics.\nOther Financial and Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s net production and commodity price realizations for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Production\nOil (MMBbl) 8.00 7.55 6 % NGLs (MMBbl) 1.94 1.69 15 % Natural gas (Bcf) 11.01 10.20 8 % Total equivalent (MMBOE) (1) 11.78 10.94 8 % Average sales price\nOil (per Bbl): Price received $ 51.15 $ 40.16 27 % Effect of crude oil hedging (2) (0.29 ) 2.81 Realized price (3) $ 50.86 $ 42.97 18 % Weighted average NYMEX price (per Bbl) (4) $ 55.36 $ 49.26 12 % NGLs (per Bbl): Realized price $ 22.90 $ 12.11 89 % Natural gas (per Mcf): Realized price $ 1.87 $ 1.87 - Weighted average NYMEX price (per MMBtu) (4) $ 2.87 $ 2.98 (4 %) (1) Fourth quarter 2016 includes 6,690 BOE/d from properties that have since been divested. (2) Whiting paid $2 million and received $21 million in pre-tax cash settlements on its crude oil hedges during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. A summary of Whiting’s outstanding hedges is included later in this news release. (3) Whiting’s realized price was reduced by $1.74 per Bbl and $1.79 per Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to the Redtail fixed fee differential deficiency payment. The remaining contract ends in April 2020. (4) Average NYMEX prices weighted for monthly production volumes.

In addition, management believes that Adjusted Net Loss Attributable to Common Shareholders is widely used by professional research analysts and others in valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions. Adjusted Net Loss Attributable for Common Shareholders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, net cash provided by operating activities or other income, cash flow or liquidity measures under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
