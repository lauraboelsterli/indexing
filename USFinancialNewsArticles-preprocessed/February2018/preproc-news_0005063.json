    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VIAVI (NASDAQ: VIAV) today reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nGAAP net revenue was $201.8 million, with net loss of $(3.7) million, or $(0.02) per share. Prior quarter GAAP net revenue was $195.2 million, with net loss of $(4.8) million or $(0.02) per share. GAAP net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $206.5 million, with net income of $49.2 million, or $0.21 per share.\nNon-GAAP net revenue was $201.8 million, with net income of $20.2 million, or $0.09 per share. Prior quarter non-GAAP net revenue was $195.2 million, with net income of $25.3 million, or $0.11 per share. Non-GAAP net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $206.5 million, with net income of $23.6 million, or $0.10 per share.\n\"VIAVI's fiscal Q2 revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS all came in above the high end of our guidance,\" said Oleg Khaykin, VIAVI's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Strong service providers' end market demand drove year-on-year revenue increase in the NE segment and OSP's core business was stronger than expected.\"\nKhaykin added, \"Looking ahead, we anticipate continued strength in network test spending and broader 3D Sensing product adoption in calendar 2018.\"\nFinancial Overview:\nThe tables below (in millions, except percentage data) provide comparisons of quarterly results to prior periods, including sequential quarterly and year-over-year changes. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in this release under the section titled \"Use of Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures.\"\nSecond Quarter Ended December 30, 2017\nGAAP Results\nQ2\nQ1\nQ2\nChange\nFY 2018\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNet revenue\n$\n201.8\n$\n195.2\n$\n206.5\n3.4\n%\n(2.3)\n%\nGross margin\n57.5\n%\n59.5\n%\n60.4\n%\n(200) bps\n(290) bps\nOperating margin\n1.8\n%\n5.1\n%\n3.2\n%\n(330) bps\n(140) bps\nIncome from operations\n3.7\n10.0\n6.7\n(63.0)\n%\n(44.8)\n%\nNet (loss) income per share\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n0.21\nâ€”\n%\n(109.5)\n%\nNon-GAAP Results\nQ2\nQ1\nQ2\nChange\nFY 2018\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNet revenue\n$\n201.8\n$\n195.2\n$\n206.5\n3.4\n%\n(2.3)\n%\nAdj. gross margin\n60.7\n%\n62.8\n%\n62.9\n%\n(210) bps\n(220) bps\nAdj. operating margin\n12.6\n%\n15.1\n%\n13.0\n%\n(250) bps\n(40) bps\nAdj. income from operations\n25.4\n29.4\n26.9\n(13.6)\n%\n(5.6)\n%\nAdj. net income per share\n0.09\n0.11\n0.10\n(18.2)\n%\n(10.0)\n%\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Net Revenue by Segment\nQ2\n% of Net\nQ1\nQ2\nChange\nFY 2018\nrevenue\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNetwork Enablement\n$\n121.5\n60.2\n%\n$\n111.8\n$\n117.0\n8.7\n%\n3.8\n%\nService Enablement\n32.1\n15.9\n%\n29.0\n40.6\n10.7\n%\n(20.9)\n%\nOptical Security and Performance Products\n48.2\n23.9\n%\n54.4\n48.9\n(11.4)\n%\n(1.4)\n%\nTotal\n$\n201.8\n100.0\n%\n$\n195.2\n$\n206.5\n3.4\n%\n(2.3)\n%\nAmericas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA customers represented 54.6%, 22.6% and 22.8%, respectively, of total net revenue for the quarter ended December 30, 2017. As of December 30, 2017, the Company held $1,212.8 million in total cash and investments. As of December 30, 2017, the Company had $911.0 million of total aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes, with net carrying value of $799.0 million. The Company had $451.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Senior Convertible Notes (\"0.625% Notes\"), after repurchasing $12.5 million of principal amount during the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017. The 0.625% Notes with net carrying value of $436.8 million as of December 30, 2017 was classified as current portion of the long-term debt. The Company also had $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Senior Convertible Notes with a net carrying value of $362.2 million classified as long-term debt. During the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017, the Company generated $23.9 million of cash from operations.\nBusiness Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ending March 31, 2018, the Company expects non-GAAP net revenue to be between $190 million to $210 million and non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.08 to $0.10. With respect to our expectations above, the Company has not reconciled non-GAAP net income per share to GAAP net income (loss) per share in this press release because it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate estimate of certain reconciling items described in the \"Use of Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures\" section below and the information is not available without unreasonable effort as a result of the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and/or amounts of certain items, including gain or loss on debt extinguishment and certain charges related to acquisition and integration. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\nConference Call\nThe Company will discuss these results and other related matters at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time on February 1, 2018 in a live webcast, which will also be archived for replay on the Company's website at www.viavisolutions.com/investors . The Company will post supplementary slides outlining the Company's latest financial results on www.viavisolutions.com/investors under the \"Quarterly Results\" section concurrently with this earnings press release.

These statements include any expectation, anticipation or guidance as to future financial performance, including future revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating margin, profitability targets, cash flow and other financial metrics, as well as the impact and duration of certain trends and market position and conditions. These involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, the Company's ability to predict future financial performance continues to be difficult due to, among other things: (a) continuing general limited visibility across many of our product lines; (b) quarter-over-quarter product mix fluctuations, which can materially impact profitability measures due to the broad gross margin ranges across our portfolio; (c) consolidations in our customer base; (d) customer purchasing delays as they assess or transition to new technologies and/or new architectures, which limit near-term demand visibility, and could negatively impact potential revenue; (e) continued decline of average selling prices across our businesses; (f) notable seasonality and a significant level of in-quarter book-and-ship business; (g) various product and manufacturing transfers, site consolidations, product discontinuances and the restructuring and workforce reduction plan announced in January 2017 that have caused and may cause short-term disruptions; (h) the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to meet production and delivery requirements to our forecasted demand; (i) potential disruptions or delays to our manufacturing and operations due to natural disasters such as the recent wildfires in Northern California; and (j) inherent uncertainty related to global markets and the effect of such markets on demand for our products. These involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

charges unrelated to core operating performance primarily consisted of acquisition related costs, amortization of inventory step-up, loss on disposal of long-lived assets and VIAVI specific charges related to the separation.\nThe preliminary financial schedules are estimated based on our current information.\nUse of Non-GAAP (Adjusted) Financial Measures\nThe Company provides non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA financial measures as supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. The Company uses the measures disclosed in this release to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance, as well as its performance relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses these items to further its own understanding of the Company's core operating performance, which the Company believes represent its performance in the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of its operations. Accordingly, management excludes from core operating performance items such as those relating to acquisition, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and inventory step-up, stock-based compensation, restructuring, separation costs, and certain investing expenses and non-cash activities that management believes are not reflective of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities. Additionally, the Company excludes the results of discontinued operations in calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for all periods reported. The Company believes excluding these items enables investors to evaluate more clearly and consistently the Company's core operational performance as the Company is no longer active in its discontinued operations.\nThe Company believes providing this additional information allows investors to see Company results through the eyes of management. The Company further believes that providing this information allows investors to better understand the Company's financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe non-GAAP adjustments described in this release have historically been excluded by the Company from its non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP adjustments, and the basis for excluding them, are outlined below.\nCost of revenues, costs of research and development and costs of selling, general and administrative: The Company's GAAP presentation of gross margin and operating expenses may include (i) additional depreciation and amortization from changes in estimated useful life and the write-down of certain property, equipment and intangibles that have been identified for disposal but remained in use until the date of disposal, (ii) workforce related charges such as severance, retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to formal restructuring plans, (iii) costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain equipment from these facilities and/or contract manufacturer facilities, (iv) stock-based compensation, and (v) other charges unrelated to our core operating performance comprising mainly of acquisition, integration, litigation and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current and future operations, including VIAVI specific incremental charges for professional fees and additional personnel costs to complete the separation as well as transformational initiatives such as the implementation of simplified automated processes, site consolidations, and reorganizations. The Company excludes these items in calculating non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes excluding these items enables investors to evaluate more clearly and consistently the Company's core operational performance.\nAmortization of intangibles: The Company includes amortization expense related to intangibles in its GAAP presentation of cost of revenues and operating expense. The Company excludes these significant non-cash items in calculating non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, because it believes doing so provides investors a clearer and more consistent view of the Company's core operating performance in terms of cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nNon-cash interest expense and other expense: The Company incurred non-cash interest expense accretion of the debt discount on its convertible debt instruments. The Company incurred a loss in connection with repurchasing certain of its 0.625% Senior Convertible Notes which was recorded in interest and other income, net, in compliance with the authoritative guidance. The Company eliminates these items in calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, because it believes that in so doing, it can provide investors a clearer and more consistent view of the Company's core operating performance.\nGain or loss on sale of available for-sale investments: The Company has sold available-for-sale investments and includes the impact of these activities in its GAAP presentation of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. The Company's core business does not include making financial investments in third parties. Moreover, the amount and timing of gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are unpredictable. Consequently, the Company excludes these items in calculating non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it believes gains or losses on these sales are not related to the Company's ongoing core business and operating performance.\nIncome tax expense or benefit: The Company excludes certain non-cash tax expense or benefit items, such as the utilization of net operating losses where valuation allowances were released, intra-period tax allocation benefit and other significant events, such as impact of US tax reform enacted in December 2017 and the spin-off of Lumentum. The Company believes excluding these items enables investors to evaluate more clearly and consistently the Company's core operational performance.\nInterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other adjustments: The Company's EBITDA calculation primarily excludes interest and other income (expense), interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that are not part of its core operating performance described above. The Company's adjusted EBITDA excludes items in addition to the items excluded from the EBITDA calculation such as stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, restructuring and related charges (benefits), and other charges related to activities that are not part of its core operating performance described above. Management believes adjusted EBITDA is a good indicator of the Company's core operational cash flow.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income (loss) is net income (loss). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is net income (loss) per share.
