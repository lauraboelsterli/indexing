    "text": "7:16 AM EST \nGoogle is hiring more people outside of its Silicon Valley base—thousands of them, in fact. \nChief executive Sundar Pichai said during Thursday’s Alphabet earnings call that Google (googl) would be “making significant investments in offices across nine states, including Colorado and Michigan.” \nGoogle currently has six open data centers across the U.S., but will now also open or build five more during this year. A data center can typically employ a few hundred people. \nThe company is also planning a “massive expansion” into San Jose, Calif., not far from its Mountain View headquarters, according to CNN . \nFacebook (fb) and Apple (aapl) are also planning to build out more facilities and hire more staff across the U.S., and jobs are a key part of Amazon’s pitch for a second North American headquarters. \nAlphabet’s adjusted earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations when they were released Thursday. Google’s traffic acquisition costs are increasing, and then there was a one-time $9.9 billion tax charge relating to recent changes in tax law. \nThose contributed to a $3 billion quarterly net loss, as did operating losses from Alphabet’s “Other Bets” unit. \nOverall revenues beat analyst forecasts, though, increasing 24% to $32.3 billion. Google’s enterprise unit, including its cloud business, is notably expanding. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
