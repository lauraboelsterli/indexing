    "text": "0 COMMENTS The women’s figure skating final in Pyeongchang came down to a duel: Russia athlete Alina Zagitova vs. Russia athlete Evgenia Medvedeva.\nThe 15-year old newcomer Zagitova back-loaded her routine with impressive jumps, all with her hands over her head. But two-time European champion Medvedeva answered with her own outstanding performance.\nWatch more Olympics videos here Medvedeva finished up weeping -- as the entire world awaited a gold medal that could have gone either way and came down to a little more than a point difference. But it was the younger skater who took home gold.\nUnfortunately, we can’t show you those precise highlights. NBC paid over $1 billion for the rights to broadcast this and all other Olympic events at the Winter Games in South Korea. The Wall Street Journal paid far less than that to bring you this exclusive look at highlights from the first-ever Olympic big air competition -- portrayed by puppets.\nWe’re very serious about this.\nSign up to receive our Olympics Briefing. Reporting live from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Get the smartest insights delivered to your inbox.\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com",
