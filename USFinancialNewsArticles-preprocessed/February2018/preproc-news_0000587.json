    "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban official data released this week showed the economy grew 0.5 percent in 2016, an upwards revision from a preliminary government estimate of a 0.9 percent contraction.\nPresident Raul Castro had told the National Assembly in Dec. 2016 that the centrally planned economy had shrunk in tandem with the crisis in key trading partner Venezuela.\nBut the long-overdue report by the National Statistics Office showed an uptick instead, with the trade surplus remaining steady after dropping in the previous year.\nExports of goods and services were $13.6 billion and imports $11.2 billion, compared with $14.9 billion and $12.6 billion in the previous year, the report showed. ( www.onei.cu/aec2016/05 %20Cuentas%20Nacionales.pdf)\nThe chapter of the 2016 abstract published this week, that includes specifics on gross domestic product, exports and money supply as well as data on debt, had been expected in the second half of last year.\nIts absence had raised eyebrows among analysts and left would-be investors more in the dark than usual about the Communist-run economy.\nMany were also surprised when in December when the government announced Cubaâ€™s economy grew 1.6 percent in 2017, given the backdrop of falling subsidized oil shipments from Venezuela, lower exports and a cash crunch.\nReporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
