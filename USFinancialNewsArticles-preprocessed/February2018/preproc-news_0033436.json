    "text": "Center Doral Moore scored 17 points as Wake Forest ended a three-game losing streak by defeating Georgia Tech 79-62 on Wednesday night at Joel Coliseum in Winston-Salem, N.C.\nBryant Crawford poured in 16 points and distributed nine assists, and Mitchell Wilbekin and Brandon Childress each supplied 11 points as the Demon Deacons secured their most-lopsided victory in Atlantic Coast Conference play this season.\nMoore, who shot 8-for-11 from the field, also pulled down 12 rebounds. Wilbekin was in his second game since returning from a four-game absence caused by an ankle injury.\nWake Forest (10-16, 3-11 ACC) won for only the second time since the opening week of January. All three of the Demon Deaconsâ€™ conference victories have come on their home court.\nJosh Okogie scored 13 of his 20 points in the first half for the Yellow Jackets (11-15, 4-9). He hit 10 of 11 free throws.\nBen Lammers added 14 points and Abdoulaye Gueye had 12 points for Georgia Tech, which lost its fourth game in a row.\nThe Yellow Jackets, who committed 14 turnovers, were playing their first game since starting freshman point guard Jose Alvarado was lost for the season with a fractured elbow sustained Sunday night against Duke.\nGeorgia Tech fell into foul trouble by early in the second half. It was also hurt by 1-for-9 shooting from 3-point range for the game.\nMeanwhile, the Demon Deacons were 9-for-17 from beyond the arc and were charged with only five turnovers.\nWake Forest reserves outscored the Yellow Jackets backups 26-2.\nThe Demon Deacons shot 62.1 percent from the field in the first half to build a 44-36 lead.\nWake Forest broke away from a 26-26 tie with a 10-0 spurt for what became a 41-30 advantage.\nGeorgia Tech stayed within range by going 9-for-9 on first-half free throws.\nThe teams will meet again March 3 in Atlanta to close the regular season.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
