    "text": "The 2018 Super Bowl thrilled fans by many accounts, with the Philadelphia Eagles winning the biggest game for the first time, beating the New England Patriots 41-33.\nAnd as much as the game is huge for sports supporters, it is also massive for advertisers, which this year focused on entertaining people over the chest-thumping political stands they made in 2017. With 30-second TV spots going for more than $5 million , advertisers need to get the most out of their investments.\nAnalytics company iSpot.tv analyzed how the biggest ads did on game day, based on \"digital share of voice,\" which means the total number of times ads were liked, shared, watched and commented on via the big social platforms. The company also looked at TV \"impressions,\" or the number of times households are \"exposed\" to commercials. It also looked at the advertisers estimated media spend.\nHere is the top 10, ranked by how they did online (digital share of voice).\n1. Lucasfilm — Solo: A 'Star Wars' Story\n\"I'm going to be a pilot — the best in the galaxy,\" Han Solo says in this 45-second spot for the next installment of the \"Star Wars\" movie franchise, effectively a trailer for the trailer, out Monday. It was watched more than 3 million times online on game day and had the highest digital share of voice at 8.84 percent. It also achieved 64.6 million TV ad impressions, against an estimated ad spend of $7.8 million.\n2. Marvel — 'Avengers: Infinity War'\nAnother Disney-owned movie franchise, Marvel's 30-second ad, featured stars including Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Tom Holland as they line up to fight Josh Brolin's Thanos. Its share of voice online was 8.55 percent, and TV impressions reached nearly 70 million, on an estimated ad spend of $5.2 million.\n3. PepsiCo — Doritos Blaze vs Moutain Dew Ice: Battle\nPepsicCo pitted two of its biggest brands against each other in this 60-second spot featuring \"Game of Thrones\" star Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman to a hip-hop soundtrack from Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott. It was watched online more than 3.5 million times and got a digital share of voice of 8.42 percent. Its TV impressions reached 72.6 million, with an estimated ad spend of $10.2 million.\n4. Amazon Echo — Alexa Loses her Voice\nSir Anthony Hopkins, Cardi B, Gordon Ramsay and Rebel Wilson all \"replace\" Alexa as she loses her voice in this 90-second ad, which also stars Amazon boss Jeff Bezos himself. The ad had a 7.92 share of voice online and hit 81.2 million TV impressions, with an estimated ad spend of $14.9 million.\n5. Universal Pictures — 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom'\nAnother movie ad, this time for the latest in Steven Spielberg's \"Jurassic World\" series, set to hit movie theaters in the U.S. in June. It's a pretty scary trailer, which got a 6.85 percent share of voice online and 55.9 million TV impressions, with an estimated ad spend of $11.9 million.\n6. Paramount Pictures — 'Mission: Impossible — Fallout'\nFilm studios continued to push their big summer movies with Tom Cruise variously attempting to board a helicopter midflight, ram his motorcycle into a moving car and leap between buildings in this ad for the sixth in the \"Mission: Impossible\" series. The 30-second spot had a 5.18 percent share of voice online and got 78.8 million TV impressions with an estimated spend of $5.4 million.\n9. Amazon Prime Instant Video — Tom Clancy's 'Jack Ryan'\nCIA agent Jack Ryan — played by John Krasinski — is seen in a 60-second spot promoting the Amazon Prime series that is set to hit screens come August. The spot got 3.43 percent digital share of voice and 77.4 million TV impressions, against an estimated ad spend of nearly $10 million.\n10. Tide — It's a Tide Ad\nCommercials for cars, beer, perfume, razors, soda and even voice assistants are sent up in this ad, one of a series for Tide, starring \"Stranger Things\" Police Chief David Harbour. How do we know it's a Tide ad? Because all the clothes are so clean, silly. The ad got a 3.02 percent digital share of voice score and 67.2 million TV impressions, with an estimated ad spend of $8.1 million.\nDisclosure: NBC Sports televised Sunday's Super Bowl.
