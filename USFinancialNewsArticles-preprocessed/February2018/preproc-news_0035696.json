We delivered another year of robust global growth, opening 26 new company-operated domestic Shacks and 19 net licensed Shacks, representing a nearly 40% increase on our base. 2017 marked a milestone year of digital innovation for Shake Shack, with the launch of the Shack app, self-serve kiosks at select locations and several integrated delivery pilots designed to further enhance the guest digital experience. We will continue to build on this momentum into 2018 and beyond.”\nGarutti concluded, “Looking ahead, 2018 is shaping up to be another exciting year of growth with 32 to 35 new domestic company-operated Shacks, our biggest year of openings to date. We expect 16 to 18 net new licensed Shacks for the year, with a significant portion of our international growth targeted in Asia including our first Shack in Hong Kong. We’re also focused on further strengthening our infrastructure to deliver against the significant long-term opportunity we have in our sights. By the end of 2020, we plan to have more than doubled our 2017 system-wide Shack count and increase our revenue to over $700 million.\"\nDevelopment Highlights\nDuring the quarter, the Company opened 11 domestic company-operated Shacks, which included Shack openings in three new markets, San Diego, St. Louis and Milwaukee, as well as the debut of its first kiosk-only, cashless environment at Astor Place in New York City. Additionally, the Company opened five international licensed Shacks during the quarter, with two openings in Japan, which included its first Shack outside of Tokyo, as well as openings in the Middle East and the United Kingdom.\nLocation Type Opening Date Dallas, TX — Preston Royal Domestic Company-Operated September 29\nYokohama, Japan — Minatomirai International Licensed September 29\nNew York, NY — Astor Place Domestic Company-Operated October 10 Washington D.C. — The Wharf Domestic Company-Operated October 12 San Diego, CA — UTC Domestic Company-Operated October 20 Troy, MI — Troy Domestic Company-Operated October 25 London, United Kingdom — Cambridge Circus International Licensed October 26 Manama, Bahrain — The Avenues Mall International Licensed October 29 Tokyo, Japan — Roppongi International Licensed November 2 El Segundo, CA — El Segundo Domestic Company-Operated November 5 Milwaukee, WI — Third Ward Domestic Company-Operated December 6 St. Louis, MO — Central West End Domestic Company-Operated December 11 Columbia, MD — Mall in Columbia Domestic Company-Operated December 20 Las Vegas, NV — Las Vegas N.

Shack sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $93.1 million, an increase of 31.3% from $70.9 million in the same quarter last year due primarily to the opening of 26 new domestic company-operated Shacks. Licensing revenue for the fourth quarter was $3.0 million, an increase of 27.9% from $2.4 million in the same quarter last year, primarily due to the opening of 19 net new licensed Shacks and the initial strength of newer Shacks in South Korea.\nSame-Shack sales increased 0.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus 1.5% growth in the fourth quarter last year. The comparable Shack base includes those restaurants open for 24 full fiscal months or longer. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the comparable Shack base included 43 Shacks versus 29 Shacks for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAverage weekly sales for domestic company-operated Shacks was $85,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $90,000 for the same quarter last year, a 5.6% decrease, primarily due to the addition of newer Shacks at lower average unit volumes.\nOperating income increased 17.0% to $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $5.0 million in the same quarter last year. Operating income margins decreased 70 basis points to 6.1%. Shack-level operating profit, a non-GAAP measure, increased 30.3% to $23.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $18.0 million in the same quarter last year. As a percentage of Shack sales, Shack-level operating profit margins decreased 20 basis points to 25.2% primarily due to (i) increased labor and related expenses resulting from the company-wide increase to the starting hourly wage that was implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year and regulatory factors, such as the Fair Workweek legislation in New York; (ii) other operating expense deleverage driven mainly by certain fixed expenses and an increase in facility costs as our Shacks mature; and (iii) the introduction of a broader range of unit volume Shacks into the system. A reconciliation of operating income to Shack-level operating profit, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $11.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $8.3 million in the same quarter last year. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses increased to 12.1% for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 11.3% in the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to higher payroll expense from increased headcount at the home office to support future growth plans, technology development costs related to our digital products, initial costs related to Project Concrete, the Company's operational and financial systems upgrade initiative, and duplicative non-cash deferred rent related to the Company's new home office.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"TCJA\") was enacted into law. The TCJA provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, among other provisions. As a result of the TCJA, the Company recognized a $125.9 million benefit in other income related to the reduction in liabilities under its tax receivable agreement. The Company also recognized an additional $138.6 million of income tax expense as a provisional amount, relating to the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets.\nNet loss attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $14.4 million, or $(0.55) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income of $3.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 30.7% to $14.9 million. As a percent of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA margins decreased approximately 10 basis points to 15.5% compared to 15.6% for the year ago period. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nAdjusted pro forma net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $3.9 million, or $0.10 per fully exchanged and diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. to adjusted pro forma net income is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFiscal Year 2017 Review\nTotal revenue increased 33.6% to $358.8 million for fiscal 2017, from $268.5 million for fiscal 2016. The growth in Shack sales was primarily driven by the opening of 26 new domestic company-operated Shacks, partially offset by a decline in same-Shack sales.\nShack sales for fiscal 2017 were $346.4 million, an increase of 33.6% from fiscal 2016. Same-Shack sales decreased 1.2% during fiscal year 2017 versus 4.2% growth in the prior year. For fiscal 2017, the comparable Shack base included 43 Shacks, compared to 29 Shacks for fiscal 2016.\nAverage unit volume for domestic company-operated Shacks was $4.6 million for 2017 compared to $5.0 million for the prior year, a 7.7% decrease, primarily due to the addition of newer Shacks at lower average unit volumes.\nOperating income increased 21.6% to $33.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $27.8 million in the same quarter last year. Operating income margins decreased 100 basis points to 9.4%. Shack-level operating profit, a non-GAAP measure, increased 25.9% to $92.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $73.3 million for fiscal 2016. As a percentage of Shack sales, Shack-level operating profit margins decreased approximately 170 basis points to 26.6% primarily due to (i) increased labor and related expenses resulting from the company-wide increase to the starting hourly wage that was implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year and regulatory factors, such as the Fair Workweek legislation in New York; (ii) other operating expense deleverage driven mainly by certain fixed expenses and an increase in facility costs as our Shacks mature; and (iii) the introduction of a broader range of unit volume Shacks into the system. A reconciliation of operating income to Shack-level operating profit, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $39.0 million for fiscal 2017 from $30.6 million for fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher payroll expense from increased headcount at the home office to support future growth plans, technology development costs related to our digital products, initial costs related to Project Concrete, the Company's operational and financial systems upgrade initiative, and duplicative non-cash deferred rent related to the Company's new home office. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 10.9% for fiscal 2017 from 11.4% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased levels of Shack sales.\nIn December 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law. The TCJA provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, among other provisions. As a result of the TCJA, the Company recognized a $125.9 million benefit in other income related to the reduction in liabilities under its tax receivable agreement. The Company also recognized an additional $138.6 million of income tax expense as a provisional amount, relating to the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets.\nNet loss attributable to Shake Shack Inc. was $2.3 million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, for fiscal 2017, compared to income of $12.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 28.7% to $64.7 million from $50.2 million for the fiscal year. As a percent of total revenue, adjusted EBITDA decreased roughly 70 basis points to 18.0% compared to 18.7% for the year ago period. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nAdjusted pro forma net income, a non-GAAP measure, was $21.0 million, or $0.57 per fully exchanged and diluted share for fiscal 2017, compared to $16.8 million, or $0.46 per fully exchanged and diluted share for fiscal 2016. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. to adjusted pro forma net income is set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n2018 Outlook\nFor the fiscal year ending December 26, 2018, the Company is providing the following financial outlook:\nTotal revenue of between $444 million and $448 million inclusive of licensing revenue. Licensing revenue to be between $12 and $13 million. Same-Shack sales to be flat, which includes approximately 1.5% to 2% of menu price increases taken in December 2017.

Effective December 29, 2016, the Company changed its methodology for calculating same-Shack sales whereby Shacks enter the comparable base at the beginning of their 25th full fiscal month, whereas previously they entered at the beginning of their 105th full fiscal week. Prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the current period methodology.\n\"Average unit volume\" or \"AUV\" for any 12-month period consist of the average annualized sales of all domestic company-operated Shacks over that period. AUV is calculated by dividing total Shack sales from domestic company-operated Shacks by the number of domestic company-operated Shacks open during that period. For Shacks that are not open for the entire period, fractional adjustments are made to the number of Shacks open such that it corresponds to the period of associated sales. The measurement of AUV allows the Company to assess changes in guest traffic and per transaction patterns at domestic company-operated Shacks.\n\"Average weekly sales\" is calculated by dividing total Shack sales by the number of operating weeks for all Shacks in operation during the period. For Shacks that are not open for the entire period, fractional adjustments are made to the number of operating weeks open such that it corresponds to the period of associated sales.\n\"Shack-level operating profit,\" a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Shack sales less Shack-level operating expenses including food and paper costs, labor and related expenses, other operating expenses and occupancy and related expenses.\n\"Shack-level operating profit margin,\" a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Shack sales less Shack-level operating expenses including food and paper costs, labor and related expenses, other operating expenses and occupancy and related expenses as a percentage of Shack sales.\n“EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n“Adjusted EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which also excludes equity-based compensation expense, deferred rent expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations.\n“Adjusted EBITDA margin,” a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which also excludes equity-based compensation expense, deferred rent expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations, as a percentage of revenue.\n\"Adjusted pro forma net income,\" a non-GAAP measure, represents net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. assuming the full exchange of all outstanding SSE Holdings, LLC membership interests (\"LLC Interests\") for shares of Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations.\nAbout Shake Shack\nShake Shack is a modern day “roadside” burger stand known for its 100% all-natural Angus beef burgers and flat-top vienna beef dogs (no added hormones and no antibiotics ever), 100% all-natural cage-free chicken (no antibiotics ever), spun-fresh frozen custard, crinkle cut fries, craft beer and wine (available at select locations) and more.

The Company does not recognize the sales from licensed Shacks as revenue. Of these amounts, revenue is limited to Shack sales from domestic company-operated Shacks and licensing revenue based on a percentage of sales from domestic and international licensed Shacks.\n(3)\nShack-level operating profit and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Shack-level operating profit to operating income and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nSHAKE SHACK INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: Shack-level operating profit, Shack-level operating profit margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share (collectively the \"non-GAAP financial measures\").\nShack-Level Operating Profit\nShack-level operating profit is defined as Shack sales less Shack-level operating expenses including food and paper costs, labor and related expenses, other operating expenses and occupancy and related expenses.\nHow This Measure Is Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of its Shacks. Additionally, Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are key metrics used internally by management to develop internal budgets and forecasts, as well as assess the performance of its Shacks relative to budget and against prior periods. It is also used to evaluate employee compensation as it serves as a metric in certain performance-based employee bonus arrangements. The Company believes presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin provides investors with a supplemental view of its operating performance that can provide meaningful insights to the underlying operating performance of the Shacks, as these measures depict the operating results that are directly impacted by the Shacks and exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the ongoing operations of the Shacks. It may also assist investors to evaluate the Company's performance relative to peers of various sizes and maturities and provides greater transparency with respect to how management evaluates the business, as well as the financial and operational decision-making.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of this Measure\nShack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin are not necessarily equivalent to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Shack-level operating profit excludes certain costs, such as general and administrative expenses and pre-opening costs, which are considered normal, recurring cash operating expenses and are essential to support the operation and development of the Company's Shacks. Therefore, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the Company's operating results as a whole and Shack-level operating profit and Shack-level operating profit margin should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of Shack-level operating profit to operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is set forth below.\nFiscal Quarter Ended Fiscal Year Ended December 27\nDecember 28\nDecember 27\nDecember 28\n(dollar amounts in thousands) 2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nOperating income $ 5,838 $ 4,988 $ 33,813 $ 27,805 Less: Licensing revenue 3,006 2,351 12,422 9,125 Add: General and administrative expenses 11,651 8,291 39,003 30,556 Depreciation expense 6,094 4,273 21,704 14,502 Pre-opening costs 2,642 2,812 9,603 9,520 Loss on disposal of property and equipment 291 34 608 34 Shack-level operating profit $ 23,510 $ 18,047 $ 92,309 $ 73,292 Total revenue $ 96,136 $ 73,271 $ 358,810 $ 268,475 Less: licensing revenue 3,006 2,351 12,422 9,125 Shack sales $ 93,130 $ 70,920 $ 346,388 $ 259,350 Shack-level operating profit margin 25.2 % 25.4 % 26.6 % 28.3 % SHAKE SHACK INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income before net interest, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as defined above) excluding equity-based compensation expense, deferred rent expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations and may not be indicative of the Company's recurring business operations.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to historical performance and competitors' operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used internally by management to develop internal budgets and forecasts and also serves as a metric in its performance-based equity incentive programs and certain bonus arrangements. The Company believes presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a supplemental view of the Company's operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of its ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude certain normal recurring expenses. Therefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the Company's performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to evaluate performance period over period and relative to its competitors. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Interests, the Company believes these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures, as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. driven by increases in its ownership of SSE Holdings, which are unrelated to the Company's operating performance, and excludes items that are non-recurring or may not be indicative of ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nAdjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share, as determined under GAAP. While these measures are useful in evaluating the Company's performance, it does not account for the earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest holders and therefore does not provide a complete understanding of the net income attributable to Shake Shack Inc. Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share are set forth below.\nFiscal Quarter Ended Fiscal Year Ended December 27\nDecember 28\nDecember 27\nDecember 28\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) 2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNumerator: Net income (loss) attributable to Shake Shack Inc. $ (14,408 ) $ 3,920 $ (2,265 ) $ 12,446 Adjustments: Reallocation of net income attributable to non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of LLC Interests (1) 1,431 1,537 9,204 9,700 Executive transition costs (2) — — 664 — Project Concrete (3) 181 — 181 — Home Office relocation expenses (4) 264 — 264 — Other income related to the adjustment of liabilities under tax receivable agreement (1,362 ) (688 ) (1,362 ) (688 ) Other income related to the remeasurement of liabilities under tax receivable agreement resulting from the enactment of the TCJA (125,859 ) — (125,859 ) — Remeasurement of deferred tax assets 138,636 (1,526 ) 138,636 (1,526 ) Income tax expense (5) 5,016 7 1,568 (3,164 ) Adjusted pro forma net income $ 3,899 $ 3,250 $ 21,031 $ 16,768 Denominator: Weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding—diluted 26,305 36,858 25,876 23,449 Adjustments: Assumed exchange of LLC Interests for shares of Class A common stock (1) 10,445 — 10,773 13,360 Dilutive effect of stock options 676 — 555 — Adjusted pro forma fully exchanged weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding—diluted 37,426 36,858 37,204 36,809 Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged share—diluted $ 0.10 $ 0.09 $ 0.57 $ 0.46",
