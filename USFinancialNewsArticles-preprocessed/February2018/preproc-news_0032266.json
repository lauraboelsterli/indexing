It was also hit by adjustments for U.S. tax reforms in the third quarter.\nIts net profit of 3.65 billion rupees ($57 million) for the October-December quarter was its smallest profit in over two and a half years, and well below analysts forecasts of 9.12 billion rupees in a Reuters poll.\nThe company said its U.S. sales slumped 35 percent to $328 million in the quarter, hurt by lower sales of generic versions of cancer drug imatinib and olmesartan, which is used in the treatment of high blood pressure.\nU.S. sales accounted for nearly a third of the company’s total sales, which fell 14 percent to 65.9 billion rupees.\nThe company said its profit was also hit by a one-off deferred tax adjustment of 5.13 billion rupees on account of tax reforms in the United States.
