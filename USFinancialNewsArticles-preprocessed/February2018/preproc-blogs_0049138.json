    "text": "Materials and Metals Sony is building an A.I.-based taxi hailing system in Japan Sony said on Tuesday that it has plans for a joint venture to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based taxi hailing system. Sony plans to build the AI-based hailing platform with Daiwa Motor Transportation and five other domestic taxi firms. Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi , is in Tokyo meeting regulators. Published 13 Hours Ago Reuters SHARES \nSony Corp said on Tuesday it would become the latest blue-chip firm to jockey for position in Japan's taxi and ride-hailing market, with plans for a joint venture to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based hailing system. \nJapan is seen as a potentially lucrative ride-hailing market, with regulators under pressure to ease stringent rules. \nCurrently, non-professional drivers are barred from offering taxi services on safety grounds, and ride-hailing companies are limited to services that \"match\" users to existing taxi fleets via mobile platforms. \nSony plans to build the AI-based hailing platform with Daiwa Motor Transportation and five other domestic taxi firms. \nThis month, SoftBank Group Corp and China's Didi Chuxing said they would roll out a venture in Japan this year to provide matching services. \nToyota Motor Corp has said it will take a stake in taxi-hailing service JapanTaxi, set up by Japan's largest taxi firm, Nihon Kotsu. \nUber's new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi , is in Tokyo meeting regulators.
