    "text": "Brook Lopez received a video tribute at the end of the first quarter in his return to Brooklyn and scored 19 points as the Los Angeles Lakers took the lead for good midway through the fourth quarter and held on for a 102-99 victory over the Nets on Friday night.\nLopez, who is the Nets’ all-time leading scorer, received a nice hand from fans in pregame introductions and then was given a tribute at the end of the opening quarter. The center scored 14 points in the second half and finished making 8-of-13 shots and 3-of-5 3-pointers.\nJulius Randle added 19 points and 12 rebounds as the Lakers won for the ninth time in 13 games. Brandon Ingram contributed 16 points and a career-high 10 assists while rookie Josh Hart chipped in 15 and 14 rebounds.\nSpencer Dinwiddie scored 14 of his 23 points in the third quarter as Brooklyn lost for the fifth time in six games. Rookie Jarrett Allen contributed a career-high 20 points while the Nets shot 45.1 percent.\nD‘Angelo Russell, who was acquired from the Lakers for Lopez added 15 points on 7-of-18 shooting while Joe Harris had 11 points.\nBrooklyn held a 78-69 lead on a 3-pointer by Dinwiddie with 6:07 in the third quarter left but the Lakers scored the next 11 points to get an 80-79 lead on a 3-pointer by Jordan Clarkson with 2:46 remaining. Russell forged an 85-85 tie with 25 seconds left.\nClarkson hit consecutive 3-pointers to give the Lakers a 93-87 lead with 9:04 remaining. Those 3-pointers were part of an 11-0 run that spanned about 3 1/2 minutes, giving the Lakers a 96-87 lead.\nAfter Brooklyn missed 10 straight shots, Russell hit a 3-pointer and connected with Allen for a dunk with 5:18 remaining. Those shots sparked an 8-0 run but Los Angeles took a 99-95 lead on a 3-pointer by Hart with 3:05 remaining.\nLopez’s hook shot made it 101-97 with 88 seconds left. After Dinwiddie’s layup made it 101-99, Randle split a pair at the line with 8.9 seconds left and the Net missed a chance for the win when Harris’ 3-point attempt at the buzzer over Randle was long.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
