    "text": "BEDFORD, Mass., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aware, Inc. (NASDAQ: AWRE), a leading supplier of biometrics software and services, today reported financial results for its quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue of 2017 was $3.3 million compared to $3.9 million in the same quarter last year. Operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.5 million compared to operating income of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, which compares to net income of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.\nThe decrease in revenue and operating income in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily due to: i) lower imaging software license sales, ii) lower services sales, and iii) lower patent related income from an unaffiliated third party this quarter.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16.3 million compared to $21.6 million in 2016. Operating income for 2017 was $1.8 million compared to $5.9 million in 2016. The decrease in revenue and operating income in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to: i) lower biometrics license sales to the United States Marine Corps (\"USMC\") and the United States Navy (\"Navy\"), ii) lower imaging product license sales related to a $4.5 million license sale in 2015 that we recognized over the period October 2015 to October 2016 that was only partially offset by a large software license agreement with a medical imaging customer in 2017, iii) lower software maintenance revenue, iv) lower service revenue, v) no hardware sales, vi) lower DSL royalties; and vii) higher operating expenses. This was partially offset by: i) higher patent related income from an unaffiliated third party, ii) lower cost of software licenses; and iii) lower cost of hardware.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, which compared to net income of $4.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in 2016. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, net income in 2017 was $0.4 million lower due to higher income tax expense caused by the effect of the federal tax rate change on our deferred tax assets.\nKevin Russell, Aware's chief executive officer and president, said, \"2017 was a year of investment in new products and technology areas in order to further enhance our position as a leading global supplier of biometrics software and solutions. In 2017, we introduced Indigo|Onboard™, a cloud-based biometric identity solution for better onboarding and Knomi™, a mobile biometric authentication framework offering face, voice and keystroke dynamics. We also added solutions for new biometric modalities in voice and behavioral (keystroke) biometrics to our existing fingerprint, face and iris offerings. While our revenue results for the year were lower than we hoped for, we continue to be encouraged by the interest in and the worldwide opportunities for our biometric solutions in the government, commercial and mobile markets in the future.\"\nAbout Aware\nAware is a leading provider of biometrics software products and development services to governments, system integrators, and solution providers globally.
