    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Finance Ministry said on Thursday it has appointed VTB Capital as an organizer for its sovereign Eurobond issue to be placed and to be swapped later this year.\nRussia plans to sell or swap Eurobond worth up to $3 billion in 2018 using the investment wing of a state controlled bank.\nSome bonds will be issued as part of President Vladimir Putinâ€™s order to repatriate some of the assets that Russian businesspeople currently hold abroad, meaning Russia will give preference to domestic investors.
