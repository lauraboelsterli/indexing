    "text": "Where the Jobs Are: National police shortage 2 Hours Ago A storm of state and local budget constraints, retirements and high-profile police-involved shootings in recent years have led to a growing shortage of police officers. Add to the mixâ€”a strengthening economy, making private sector employment even more enticing.

We talk to the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police about the root of the problem, recruitment and what it means for officers nationwide.",
