According to data reported by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (\"CAAM\"), in the fourth quarter of 2017, sales of commercial vehicles (excluding gasoline-powered and electric-powered vehicles) decreased by 0.4%. Truck sales decreased by 1.0% with heavy-duty truck sales increasing by 0.6%. GYMCL's heavy-duty truck engine sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 22.5%.\nGross profit increased by 6.1% to RMB 1.1 billion (US$ 165.4 million) compared with RMB 1.0 billion in the same quarter last year. Gross margin rose to 28.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 27.3% in the same quarter last year. The gross profit increase was mainly attributable to better product mix.\nOther operating income was RMB 485.8 million (US$ 74.3 million) compared with RMB 43.6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly due to higher bank interest income, and a one-time gain of RMB 115.2 million (US$ 17.6 million) on the completion of engineering design services for the YC6K heavy-duty engine platform for our joint venture, Y&C Engine Company Limited (\"Y&C\"), and a one-time gain of RMB 324.1 million (US$ 49.6 million) on the sale of HL Global Enterprises Limited's (\"HLGE\") hotel assets, compared with the same quarter last year. Excluding these one-time items, the other operating income was RMB 46.5 million (US$ 7.1 million) compared with RMB 43.6 million in the same quarter last year.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses increased by 23.3% to RMB 231.0 million (US$ 35.4 million) from RMB 187.3 million in the same quarter last year. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D spending was 6.1% compared with 5.0% in the same quarter last year. R&D expenses reflected increased development and testing costs for new engines to meet higher emission standards and GYMCL's continued initiatives to improve engine quality. In January 2018, 14 new engines were introduced that complied with the more stringent National VI (equivalent to Euro VI) emission standard, which is expected to be implemented by mid-2020 according to the China Ministry of Environmental Protection requirement.\nSelling, general & administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased by 19.0% to RMB 590.0 million (US$ 90.3 million) from RMB 495.7 million in the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses represented 15.6% of net revenue compared with 13.3% in the same quarter last year. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 included an impairment charge of RMB 40.0 million (US$ 6.1 million) related to the intellectual property for the 4Y20 engine platform, and also included a staff severance cost of RMB 31.5 million (US$ 4.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are extraordinary events. In the same quarter last year, a staff severance cost of RMB 1.8 million was recorded. Excluding these extraordinary events, the SG&A expenses increased by 5.0% to RMB 518.5 million (US$79.4 million) from RMB 493.9 million in the same quarter last year. These expenses represented 13.7% of net revenue, compared with 13.2% in 2016.\nOperating profit increased by 96.5% to RMB 745.3 million (US$ 114.1 million) from RMB 379.3 million in the same quarter last year.

Excluding the one-time and extraordinary events, the operating profit decreased by 1.0% to RMB 377.4 million (US$ 57.8 million) from RMB 381.1 million in the same quarter last year.\nFinance costs increased to RMB 24.5 million (US$ 3.8 million) from RMB 11.3 million in the same quarter last year. Higher finance costs were mainly due to higher bank borrowings and higher trade bills discounting.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, total net profit attributable to China Yuchai's shareholders increased by 80.4% to RMB 407.9 million (US$ 62.4 million) from RMB 226.0 million in the same quarter last year. Basic and diluted earnings per share were RMB 9.99 (US$ 1.53) and RMB 9.97 (US$1.53) respectively compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of RMB 5.55 in the same quarter last year.

As a percentage of net revenue, R&D spending was 3.7% compared with 4.3% in 2016.

The Company remains committed to its R&D programs and continues to introduce new engine models for both the on-road and off-road markets compliant with increasingly stringent emission standards. In January 2018, 14 new engine models were introduced that are compliant with the more stringent National VI (equivalent to Euro VI) emission standard.\nSG&A expenses increased by 20.7% to RMB 1.8 billion (US$ 277.9 million) from RMB 1.5 billion in 2016.

Management uses these non-IFRS financial measures for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of ongoing operations and in analyzing the Company's business performance and trends. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company's financial information reported under IFRS.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide the following additional information\non the adjustments:\nUNAUDITED Reconciliation of adjusted net profit for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(RMB and US$ amounts expressed in thousands, except per share data)\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nNet profit\n665,882\n101,907\n318,812\n48,791\nAdjustments to net profit:\nCompletion of the engineering design services\nof YC6K\n(115,235)\n(17,636)\n–\n–\nSales of hotel assets\n(324,092)\n(49,599)\n–\n–\nStaff Severance cost\n31,485\n4,818\n1,755\n269\nImpairment charge on intellectual property\n40,000\n6,122\n���\n–\nRelated income tax effects\n21,271\n3,255\n(263)\n(40)\nAdjusted net profit\n319,311\n48,867\n320,304\n49,020\nAdjusted net profit attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n228,081\n34,905\n227,169\n34,766\nNon-controlling interests\n91,230\n13,962\n93,135\n14,254\n319,311\n48,867\n320,304\n49,020\nNet earnings per common share\n- Basic\n9.99\n1.53\n5.55\n0.85\n- Diluted\n9.97\n1.53\n5.55\n0.85\nNet earnings per common share adjustment\ndue to one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n(4.40)\n(0.68)\n0.03\n0.00\n- Diluted\n(4.39)\n(0.68)\n0.03\n0.00\nAdjusted net earnings per common share\nexcluding one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n5.59\n0.85\n5.58\n0.85\n- Diluted\n5.58\n0.85\n5.58\n0.85\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide the following additional information\non the adjustments:\nUNAUDITED Reconciliation of adjusted net profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(RMB and US$ amounts expressed in thousands, except per share data)\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nRMB '000\nUS$ '000\nNet profit\n1,405,070\n215,033\n723,608\n110,741\nAdjustments to net profit:\nCompletion of the engineering design services\nof YC6K\n(115,235)\n(17,636)\n–\n–\nSales of hotel assets\n(324,092)\n(49,599)\n–\n–\nStaff severance cost\n107,732\n16,487\n12,864\n1,969\nImpairment charge on intellectual property\n40,000\n6,122\n–\n–\nRelated income tax effects\n9,834\n1,505\n(1,930)\n(295)\nAdjusted net profit\n1,123,309\n171,912\n734,542\n112,415\nAdjusted net profit attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n823,670\n126,055\n524,092\n80,208\nNon-controlling interests\n299,639\n45,857\n210,450\n32,207\n1,123,309\n171,912\n734,542\n112,415\nNet earnings per common share\n- Basic\n23.40\n3.58\n12.89\n1.97\n- Diluted\n23.40\n3.58\n12.89\n1.97\nNet earnings per common share adjustment\ndue to one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n(3.19)\n(0.49)\n0.21\n0.03\n- Diluted\n(3.19)\n(0.49)\n0.21\n0.03\nAdjusted net earnings per common share\nexcluding one-time and extraordinary events\n- Basic\n20.21\n3.09\n13.10\n2.00\n- Diluted\n20.21\n3.09\n13.10\n2.00\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-yuchai-international-announces-unaudited-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-300604663.html\nSOURCE China Yuchai International Limited",
