    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), the world’s largest publicly-traded oil producer, named MetLife Inc ( MET.N ) Chief Executive Steven Kandarian to its board of directors on Thursday.\nExxon cited Kandarian’s financial and risk management experience as a reason for adding him to the board, which will now have 11 members.\nExxon does not hedge is oil production but does have insurance and other financial protections for part of its operations.\nShares of Exxon rose 1.9 percent to $88.95 in afternoon trading.\nExxon’s move came the same day rival Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) named Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) CEO Jim Umpleby to its own board. [nL2N1PR0WI]\nBoth Exxon and Chevron are slated to report quarterly results on Friday morning.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
