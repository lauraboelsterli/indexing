This compares with net earnings of $295.5 million, or $2.45 per diluted share reported in the full-year 2016. The airline achieved its 51 st consecutive quarter of profitability, reporting fourth quarter net earnings of $48.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share compared to $55.2 million, or $0.47 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full-year and in each quarter of 2017, the airline flew a record number of guests. Based on the trailing twelve months, the airline recorded a return on invested capital of 10.0 per cent, down 0.2 percentage points from the 10.2 per cent reported in the previous quarter.\n\"In 2017, we continued our evolution toward becoming a global airline while flying a record number of guests and achieving our highest annual load factor in our history. We announced an agreement to enter a joint venture with Delta Airlines, which will give Canadians more access to our low fares and growing network. We also proudly took delivery of Canada's first Boeing 737 MAX aircraft this fall, and it was in service with high reliability before the busy holiday season,\" said WestJet President and CEO Gregg Saretsky. \"WestJetters care to the core by safely providing our guests with award-winning and friendly service every day. I thank each of the more than 13,000 WestJetters for their work and dedication this quarter, especially in light of the severe cold and weather-related operational challenges.\"\nOperating highlights (stated in Canadian dollars)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nChange\nFull-year\n2017\nFull-year\n2016\nChange\nNet earnings (millions)\n$48.5\n$55.2\n(12.2%)\n$283.6\n$295.5\n(4.0%)\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.42\n$0.47\n(10.6%)\n$2.42\n$2.45\n(1.2%)\nTotal revenue (millions)\n$1,117.4\n$1,017.8\n9.8%\n$4,502.3\n$4,122.9\n9.2%\nOperating margin\n7.0%\n8.4%\n(1.4 pts)\n9.7%\n10.7%\n(1.0 pts)\nASMs (available seat miles) (billions)\n7.659\n7.253\n5.6%\n30.998\n29.298\n5.8%\nRPMs (revenue passenger miles) (billions)\n6.329\n5.816\n8.8%\n25.904\n23.968\n8.1%\nLoad factor\n82.6%\n80.2%\n2.4 pts\n83.6%\n81.8%\n1.8 pts\nSegment guests\n6,010,069\n5,424,052\n10.8%\n24,137,477\n21,951,463\n10.0%\nYield (revenue per revenue passenger mile) (cents)\n17.66\n17.50\n0.9%\n17.38\n17.20\n1.0%\nRASM (revenue per available seat mile) (cents)\n14.59\n14.03\n4.0%\n14.52\n14.07\n3.2%\nCASM (cost per available seat mile) (cents)\n13.57\n12.86\n5.5%\n13.11\n12.57\n4.3%\nCASM, excluding fuel and employee profit share (cents)*\n10.23\n9.87\n3.6%\n9.89\n9.75\n1.4%\n*Refer to reconciliations in the accompanying tables for further information regarding calculations.\nDividend declaration\nOn February 5, 2018, WestJet's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per common voting share and variable voting share for the first quarter of 2018, to be paid on March 30, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 14, 2018.

excludes the effects of aircraft fuel expense and employee profit share expense to assess the operating performance of the business. Fuel expense is excluded from operating results due to the fact that fuel prices are impacted by a host of factors outside WestJet's control, such as significant weather events, geopolitical tensions, refinery capacity and global demand and supply. Excluding this expense allows WestJet to analyze its operating results on a comparable basis. Employee profit share expense is excluded from operating results due to its variable nature and excluding this expense allows greater comparability.\nThree months ended December 31\nTwelve months ended December 31\n($ in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nOperating expenses\n1,039,391\n932,492\n106,899\n4,063,360\n3,682,762\n380,598\nAircraft fuel expense\n(251,619)\n(210,489)\n(41,130)\n(950,043)\n(765,867)\n(184,176)\nEmployee profit share expense\n(4,401)\n(6,454)\n2,053\n(46,793)\n(59,342)\n12,549\nOperating expenses, adjusted\n783,371\n715,549\n67,822\n3,066,524\n2,857,553\n208,971\nASMs\n7,658,815,460\n7,253,281,603\n5.6%\n30,998,306,475\n29,298,340,363\n5.8%\nCASM, excluding above items (cents)\n10.23\n9.87\n3.6%\n9.89\n9.75\n1.4%\nReturn on invested capital\n(Stated in thousands of Canadian dollars, except percentages)\n(Unaudited)\nROIC is a measure commonly used to assess the efficiency with which a company allocates its capital to generate returns.
