    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 5:28 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Rugby - England rack up seven tries in emphatic win over Italy Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nROME (Reuters) - England scored seven tries on the way to an emphatic 46-15 win away to Italy as they began the defence of their Six Nations title in style on Sunday. \nWinger Anthony Watson got England off to a flying start with two early tries and number eight Sam Simmonds also bagged two. Flyhalf Owen Farrell, George Ford and Jack Nowell added one apiece and Farrell kicked four conversions and a penalty. \nThe score was harsh on Italy who resisted bravely until a flurry of England tries in the closing minutes. \nThe winners of the last two wooden spoons were refreshingly positive and replied with two tries of their own from Tommaso Benvenuti and Mattia Bellini with Tommaso Allan kicking a conversion and penalty. \nEngland, who have won all 24 games against Italy, lost scrumhalf Ben Youngs in the first half when he suffered a knee injury. \n”They played exceptionally well,“ England head coach Eddie Jones said. ”It was a tough game of rugby but we ran away with it in the end. \n“We let them into the game a bit with individual discipline lapses but, in general, everything was positive.” \nWatson finished off two flowing moves in the first 10 minutes as England took quick control but Italy reduced the arrears with a superb effort when Allen’s looping pass set up Benvenuti for a converted try. \nEngland went in with a 17-10 halftime lead after Farrell scored and converted a try and Allan replied with a penalty for Italy.

But our lads held out and we built and built,” Farrell said. \n“Simmonds was brilliant. He’s quick and powerful and we’re pleased to have him in our squad.” \nItaly coach Conor O‘Shea was encouraged by his team’s performance. \n“We played some excellent rugby and contributed to an entertaining game, but I‘m proud and annoyed,” he said. \n“It will be another statistic in the book but anyone here today could see what we were trying to do. We know we’re off in certain areas and the progress we need to make. But we’re making it.” \n”What they saw out there was a team playing competitive rugby with more to come.
