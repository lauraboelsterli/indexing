    "text": "The information in this document is based on the unaudited interim financial results of Sun Life Financial Inc. for the period ended December 31, 2017. Sun Life Financial Inc., its subsidiaries and, where applicable, its joint ventures and associates are collectively referred to as \"the Company\", \"Sun Life Financial\", \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\". Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are in Canadian dollars. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we stopped reporting operating net income and its related measures, operating earnings per share (\"EPS\") and operating return on equity (\"ROE\"). The adjustments previously used to derive operating net income will continue to be used to derive underlying net income.\nTORONTO, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Sun Life Financial Inc. (TSX: SLF) (NYSE: SLF) today announced its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Fourth quarter reported net income was $207 million and underlying net income (1) was $641 million.\nQuarterly results\nFull Year\nQ4'17\nQ4'16\n2017\n2016\nReported net income ($ millions)\n207\n728\n2,149\n2,485\nUnderlying net income (1) ($ millions)\n641\n560\n2,546\n2,335\nReported EPS (2) ($)\n0.34\n1.18\n3.49\n4.03\nUnderlying EPS (1)(2) ($)\n1.05\n0.91\n4.15\n3.80\nReported ROE (1)\n4.1%\n14.8%\n10.7%\n13.0%\nUnderlying ROE (1)\n12.7%\n11.4%\n12.7%\n12.2%\nMinimum Continuing Capital and Surplus Requirements (\"MCCSR\") (4) ratio for Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada of 221%. The MCCSR ratio for Sun Life Financial Inc. was 246%, which includes cash and other liquid assets of $2.0 billion for Sun Life Financial Inc. and its wholly-owned holding companies (3) Insurance sales (1) were $1,106 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($1,071 million in the fourth quarter of 2016) and $3,042 million in 2017 ($2,758 million in 2016). Wealth sales (1) were $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($37.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016) and $145.3 billion in 2017 ($138.3 billion in 2016) Global assets under management of $975 billion compared to $903 billion as at December 31, 2016 Common share dividend declared of $0.455 per share\n\"2017 was a year of strong financial performance for Sun Life. We grew underlying net income 9% in the year to over $2.5 billion, raised our common share dividend 8% in the year, and generated a 12.7% underlying return on equity,\" said Dean Connor, President & CEO, Sun Life Financial.\n\"Our fourth quarter capped off a year of continued momentum on a number of fronts,\" said Connor. \"We launched new digital offerings in Canada, improved the profitability of our U.S. Group Benefits business, continued building out our wealth and asset management businesses, and invested to grow our distribution capabilities in Asia.\"\n(1)\nRepresents a non-IFRS financial measure.

Sun Life teams around the world implemented hundreds of Client-focused changes – big and small. Taken together, we are making a difference in our Clients' lives, and there is so much more to do to help them achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives. An exciting initiative is our new partnership in the U.S. with Collective Health, an innovative technology company that serves as an alternative to traditional health plans for self-funded employers. Leveraging their advanced health benefits platform, together we intend to transform the benefits experience for self-funded employers and their employees by integrating stop-loss protection into Collective Health's enterprise benefits platform and collaborating on enhanced data analytics to serve these Clients better.\"\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nOur strategy is focused on four key pillars of growth, where we aim to be a leader in the markets in which we operate.

See section J - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document.\n(2)\nNot meaningful\nOur reported net income in the quarter includes a net charge of $251 million ($444 million pre-tax) related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. tax reform\") which reflects the net impact on actuarial liabilities, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, and a one-time tax charge on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Our reported net income also includes the previously announced restructuring charge of $44 million ($60 million pre-tax), related to actions to enhance business processes and organizational structures and capabilities. These impacts are excluded from underlying net income.\nA Leader in Insurance and Wealth Solutions in our Canadian home market\nSLF Canada's reported net income was $172 million in the quarter, down 57% compared to the same period in 2016, largely reflecting unfavourable market impacts driven predominantly by a decline in interest rates, as well as impacts from adverse assumption changes and management actions (\"ACMA\"). Underlying net income was $232 million, down 5% from the same period in 2016, due to the release of a litigation provision which increased 2016 underlying net income.\nInsurance sales were down 26% mainly due to a decrease in individual insurance sales compared to strong sales in the fourth quarter in 2016 in anticipation of the Canadian life insurance tax legislation changes that came into effect on January 1, 2017, while Group Benefits sales were in line with fourth quarter of 2016, reaching $10 billion of business in-force driven by strong sales in 2017. Wealth sales were down 32% compared to the same quarter last year mainly due to a large-case sale in Group Retirement Services (\"GRS\") in 2016, while individual wealth sales were in line with the prior year.\nIn the quarter, we enhanced the my Sun Life mobile app by adding dental and vision providers to our growing network of paramedical healthcare providers, and we now have a network of over 3 million ratings of 110,000 providers where our Clients can locally search, view ratings by peers, and click to call for appointments. In the quarter SLGI (1) achieved $20 billion in assets under management (\"AUM\"), and subsequent to the quarter closed the acquisition of Excel Funds Management Inc. (\"Excel\"), adding approximately $800 million in AUM, expanding our product suite into emerging market funds. Excel's India fund had the highest return of any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund in Canada for the 15-year period ending December 31, 2017, according to data from Morningstar.\n(1)\nSun Life Global Investments (Canada) Inc.\nA Leader in U.S. Group Benefits and International high net worth solutions\nReported net loss was $25 million, down from the same quarter in the prior year, reflecting the unfavourable impact of the U.S. tax reform and unfavourable market related impacts primarily driven by interest rates. SLF U.S.'s underlying net income was $126 million, up 45% from the same quarter in the prior year. This reflects improved underwriting experience in Group Benefits, as our pricing actions, investments in claims management and expense initiatives, as well as progress on the integration of the U.S. employee benefits business acquired in 2016, continue to improve profitability. The after-tax profit margin for Group Benefits increased to 5.0% (1) in 2017.\nInsurance sales increased by 22% compared to the same quarter in 2016, with increases in Group Benefits mainly driven by strong medical stop-loss sales, partially offset by lower group life and disability sales as a result of pricing discipline and fewer large cases. Insurance sales results also reflect strong International life sales.\nIn addition to partnering with CollectiveHealth Inc. during the quarter, we formed a stop-loss arrangement with Pareto Captive Services, providing captive solutions for employers seeking an alternative way to self-fund while pooling financial risks. In our dental and vision portfolio, we delivered more options for Clients by adding a new plan to our Vision offering and launching our new Sun Life Dental Network® which is the largest preferred provider (\"PPO\") dental network in the U.S. (2)\nA Leader in global Asset Management\nSLF Asset Management's reported net income of $114 million was down 42% from the fourth quarter of 2016 largely due to the unfavourable impact of the U.S. tax reform. Underlying net income was $226 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by higher average net assets resulting in a pre-tax operating profit margin ratio for MFS (1) of 40%.\nSLF Asset Management ended the fourth quarter with $678 billion in assets under management consisting of $618 billion (US$492 billion) from MFS Investment Management (\"MFS\") and $59 billion from Sun Life Investment Management (\"SLIM\"). SLIM continued its momentum with net inflows of $1.6 billion while MFS net outflows of $5.0 billion (US$4.0 billion) in the quarter were primarily driven by institutional Client portfolio re-balancing.\nMFS long-term retail fund performance remained strong with 84%, 79% and 92% of MFS's U.S. retail mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their Lipper categories based on three-, five-, and ten-year performance, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nA Leader in Asia through Distribution Excellence in Higher Growth Markets\nSLF Asia's reported net income was up 43% from the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting the favourable impact of ACMA, partially offset by less favourable market related impacts primarily driven by interest rates. Underlying net income was $80 million, up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting continued growth in our wealth businesses and contributions from our joint ventures.\nSLF Asia insurance sales were $203 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, largely in line with the fourth quarter of 2016, with growth across all markets except Hong Kong. SLF Asia wealth sales were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Strong wealth sales were led by continued growth in our Indian joint venture mutual fund company, and our asset management company in the Philippines, as well as our growing pension business in Hong Kong.\nSun Life Malaysia enhanced its new arrangement with U Mobile announced earlier in the year by launching GOLIFE in November, 2017. This first-of-its-kind telco-assurance product allows Clients to apply, subscribe and manage their life insurance policies entirely on their mobile device. In addition, Sun Life Hong Kong completed the acquisition of the Mandatory Provident Fund business and commenced an exclusive 15-year distribution agreement with FWD Life Insurance Company (Bermuda) Limited (\"FWD\"), in Hong Kong, in the quarter.\n(1)\nRepresents a non-IFRS financial measure.

See section J - Non-IFRS Financial Measures.\n(4)\nExperience related items reflect the difference between actual experience during the reporting period and best estimate assumptions used in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities.\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nOur reported net income was $207 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease compared to the same quarter in 2016, mainly driven by the unfavourable impact of the U.S. tax reform, the restructuring charge, and the impact from interest rates. The 14% increase in underlying net income compared to the same quarter in 2016, to $641 million, reflected the growth in our wealth businesses and favourable morbidity and mortality experience.\n1. Market related impacts (1)\nMarket related impacts in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by unfavourable interest rate changes reflecting decreases in long term risk free rates in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to increases in 2016, and flattening of the yield curve, partially offset by favourable changes in fair values of real estate.\n2. Assumption changes and management actions (1)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the net impact of ACMA resulted in a decrease of $34 million (excluding the impact of the U.S. tax reform) to reported net income which included updates to lapse and other policyholder behaviour, compared to an increase of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n3. Other adjustments (1)\nOther adjustments decreased reported net income by $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, were primarily driven by the restructuring charge of $44 million ($60 million pre-tax), related to actions to enhance business processes and organizational structures and capabilities, and fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards.\n(1)\nSee section J - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document for a breakdown of the components.\n4. U.S. tax reform\nThe U.S. tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, which took effect on January 1, 2018 includes a reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after 2017, changes to the amount of reserves that are tax deductible, and a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. In addition, this legislation includes a number of base broadening measures including provisions limiting the deductibility of certain amounts including payments to related foreign taxpayers, and expanded rules impacting foreign source income of non-US affiliates.\nAs a result of this legislation, the Company has booked a net charge of $251 million ($444 million pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2017. This reflects an after-tax charge of $288 million ($444 million pre-tax) to ACMA, and a one-time charge on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings of $46 million. These are partially offset by a benefit of $83 million (1) relating to the revaluation of deferred tax balances from 35% to 21%.\n5. Experience related items\nExperience related items in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected favourable morbidity and mortality experience primarily in SLF U.S. Group Benefits and improved expense experience. Expense experience in both periods included incentive compensation costs arising from overall strong business performance and investments in growing our businesses.\n6. Income taxes\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, our effective income tax rates on reported net income and underlying net income (2) were (36.7)% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to 19.5% and 16.5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our effective tax rate on reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 is below our expected range, primarily due to the impacts of the U.S. tax reform. Our effective tax rate on underlying net income is within our expected range.\nOur expected tax range for future years is revised to 15% to 20% as a result of the U.S. tax reform. Our statutory tax rate is normally reduced by various tax benefits, such as lower taxes on income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions, a range of tax exempt investment income, and other sustainable tax benefits that are expected to decrease our effective tax rate. This new range is based on our current understanding of the base broadening measures referred to in section 4. above, which could impact our corporate structure and/or arrangements between our affiliates. There is also uncertainty surrounding the U.S. states' interpretation of the U.S. tax reform and the extent to which they will conform with the federal legislation. Note that we expect additional interpretive guidance on these provisions to be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Treasury and state tax departments in the future. Such future guidance could impact this updated range.\n7. Impact of foreign exchange rates\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, our reported net income and underlying net income decreased by $9 million and $22 million, respectively, as a result of the impact of the movement of the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n(1)\nExcludes $(30) million relating to the net impact on deferred tax balances attributable to participating policyholders.\n(2)\nOur effective income tax rate on underlying net income is calculated using underlying net income and income tax expense associated with underlying net income, which excludes amounts attributable to participating policyholders.\n2017 vs. 2016\nOur reported net income decreased to $2,149 million for 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting the unfavourable impact of the U.S. tax reform, the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, integration costs, Fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards, and interest rates impacts. Underlying net income growth of 9% to $2,546 million reflected favourable mortality and morbidity experience, partially offset by a lower level of gains from investing activity, unfavourable lapse experience and the impact of foreign exchange rates.\n1. Market related impacts (1)\nMarket related impacts in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by unfavourable changes in interest rates reflecting the flattening of the yield curve in 2017 as long term interest rates dropped compared to rising long term interest rates in 2016, and the unfavourable impact of significant increases in swap spreads. This was partially offset by favourable changes in the fair value of real estate.\n2. Assumption changes and management actions (1)\nACMA increased reported net income by $81 million in 2017 (excluding the impact of the U.S. tax reform), compared to an increase of $45 million in 2016. See section D - Profitability - 2017 vs. 2016 - ii. Assumption changes and management actions in our 2017 annual MD&A for details on ACMA in 2017.\n3. Other adjustments (1)\nOther adjustments in 2017 decreased reported net income by $220 million, which compared to 2016 were primarily due to the impact of integration costs related to the U.S. employee benefits business acquired in 2016 of $68 million ($105 million pre-tax), the restructuring charge of $44 million ($60 million pre-tax) related to actions to enhance business processes and organizational structures and capabilities, and Fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards.\n4. U.S. tax reform\nAs a result of the U.S. tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, which took effect on January 1, 2018, the Company has booked a net charge of $251 million in fourth quarter of 2017. See Q4 2017 vs. Q4 2016 for more information.\n5. Experience related items\nExperience related items in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected favourable mortality and morbidity experience in the SLF U.S. Group Benefits business, improved mortality experience in SLF Canada and SLF U.K. and improved expense experience. Expense experience in both periods includes incentive compensation costs arising from overall strong business performance and investments in growing our businesses. Experience related items also reflected a lower level of gains from investing activity on insurance contract liabilities and unfavourable lapse and other policyholder behaviour experience.\n6. Income taxes\nFor 2017, our effective tax rates on reported and underlying net income (2) were 10.8% and 20.5%, respectively, compared to 18.0% and 20.9%, respectively, for 2016. Our effective tax rate on reported net income for 2017 was most notably impacted by higher reported net income in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates and losses in jurisdictions with higher statutory income tax rates, by the U.S. tax reform, ACMA in SLF U.S., as well as the finalization of prior years' tax filings, which have resulted in an unusually low effective tax rate on a reported basis for 2017. Our effective tax rate on underlying net income is within our expected range. See Q4 2017 vs. Q4 2016 for - 6 - Income Taxes for additional information on our expected effective tax rate range.\n7. Impact of foreign exchange rates\nDuring 2017, our reported and underlying net income decreased by $53 million and $56 million, respectively, as a result of the impact of the movement of the Canadian dollar in 2017 relative to the average exchange rates in 2016.\n(1)\nSee section J - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document for a breakdown of the components.\n(2)\nOur effective income tax rate on underlying net income is calculated using underlying net income and income tax expense associated with underlying net income, which excludes amounts attributable to participating policyholders.\nD.

Net premium revenue was $15.3 billion in 2017, up $0.3 billion from 2016, primarily driven by higher premiums in Individual and GB in SLF Canada and all business units in SLF U.S., partially offset by decreases in Hong Kong in SLF Asia and the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar.\nSegregated fund deposits were $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segregated fund deposits were $10.9 billion in 2017, compared to $11.6 billion in 2016. In both cases, the decrease was primarily driven by GRS in SLF Canada and the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar, partially offset by increases in Individual Wealth in SLF Canada.\nSales of mutual funds were $21.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $1.0 billion over the fourth quarter of 2016, largely reflected the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar and lower sales in MFS, partially offset by increased sales from the Philippines and India in SLF Asia. Sales of mutual funds were $87.5 billion in 2017, compared to $84.7 billion in 2016, primarily driven by the growth of sales in India and the Philippines in SLF Asia, partially offset by the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar and decreased sales from MFS.\nSales of managed funds were $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $0.9 billion from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to higher sales in MFS and Hong Kong in SLF Asia, partially offset by the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar and lower sales in SLIM. Sales of managed funds of $44.1 billion in 2017 increased $3.8 billion from 2016 primarily due to increases from SLIM, MFS, as well as Hong Kong in SLF Asia, partially offset by the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar.\nASO premium and deposit equivalents in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for 2017 were both up compared to the same periods in 2016. In both cases, the increase was attributable to increases in GRS and GB in SLF Canada, partially offset by decreases in Hong Kong in SLF Asia and the currency impact from the change in the Canadian dollar.\nThe currency impact for total premium and deposits for the fourth quarter of 2017 and for 2017 from the change in the Canadian dollar relative to average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2016 decreased total premiums and deposits by approximately $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.\n3.

The increase in AUM of $71.5 billion between December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from:\n(i)\nan increase of $129.0 billion from favourable market movements; and\n(ii)\nan increase of $3.5 billion of other business activities including $0.7 billion from the first stage of our acquisition of the pension business of FWD in SLF Asia; partially offset by\n(iii)\na decrease of $46.3 billion from the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to exchange rates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016; and\n(iv)\nnet outflow of mutual, managed, and segregated funds of $14.7 billion.\nThe net outflow of mutual, managed, and segregated funds of $14.7 billion in 2017 was predominantly driven by net outflows from MFS of $28.5 billion, which were partially offset by net inflows of $6.1 billion from each of SLIM and SLF Asia, and $2.6 billion from SLF Canada. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net outflows of mutual, managed and segregated funds were $2.5 billion, predominantly driven by net outflows from MFS of $5.0 billion, partially offset by net inflows of $1.6 billion from SLIM, $0.8 billion from SLF Asia and $0.5 billion from SLF Canada.\nE.

For additional information see section I - Capital and Liquidity Management - 1 - Capital in our 2017 annual MD&A.\nAs at December 31, 2017, SLF Inc.'s MCCSR ratio was 246%, compared to 253% as at December 31, 2016. The primary difference between the MCCSR ratio of SLF Inc. and Sun Life Assurance relates to cash and liquid assets held at the holding company level of $2,019 million as discussed below and capital related to certain insurance subsidiaries held directly by SLF Inc.\nOur total capital consists of subordinated debt and other capital instruments, participating policyholders' equity, and total shareholders' equity which includes common shareholders' equity and preferred shareholders' equity. As at December 31, 2017, our total capital was $27.1 billion, compared to $26.9 billion as at December 31, 2016. The increase in total capital was primarily the result of common shareholders' net income of $2,205 million and the issuance of $400 million of subordinated debentures detailed below, partially offset by the foreign currency translation impact included in other comprehensive income (loss) of a loss of $737 million, the payment of $1,066 million of dividends on common shares, and the redemption of $800 million of subordinated debentures detailed below.\nThe legal entity, SLF Inc. (the ultimate parent company), and its wholly-owned holding companies had $2,019 million in cash and other liquid assets as at December 31, 2017 ($1,616 million as at December 31, 2016). The increase in cash and liquid assets in these holding companies in 2017 was primarily attributable to net cash generated from operations and the issuance of $400 million of subordinated debentures, which were partially offset by the redemption of $800 million of subordinated debt, shares purchases under the normal course issuer bid and other operational requirements. Liquid assets as noted above include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and publicly traded securities.\nAs at December 31, 2017, Sun Life Assurance's MCCSR ratio was 221%, compared to 226% as at December 31, 2016. The decrease in Sun Life Assurance's MCCSR ratio over the period primarily resulted from a recapture of a reinsurance arrangement, partially offset by the contribution of reported net income net of dividends.\nOn March 2, 2017, SLF Inc. redeemed all of its outstanding $800 million principal amount of Series 2012-1 Subordinated Unsecured 4.38% Fixed/Floating Debentures.\nOn November 21, 2017, SLF Inc. issued $400 million principal amount of Series 2017-1 Subordinated Unsecured 2.75% Fixed/Floating Debentures due 2027. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes of Sun Life Financial, which may include investments in subsidiaries and repayment of indebtedness.\nOn January 30, 2018, SLF Inc. redeemed all of the outstanding $400 million principal amount of Series 2008-1 Subordinated Unsecured 5.59% Fixed/Floating Debentures at a redemption price equal to the principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest to that date.\nLife Insurance Capital Adequacy Test\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\"OSFI\") has implemented a revised regulatory capital framework referred to as the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (\"LICAT\") in Canada effective January 1, 2018. OSFI's objective is to create a new capital framework that results in improved overall quality of available capital, greater risk sensitivity, better measurement of certain risks and closer alignment of risk measures with the economics of the life insurance business. LICAT is not expected to significantly change the level of excess capital in the industry, however capital requirements by company may change. Results as measured under LICAT are fundamentally different than under MCCSR and will not be directly comparable to MCCSR. OSFI released the final LICAT Guideline on November 24, 2017.\nWe currently have a strong capital position under MCCSR and expect that to continue under LICAT.\nNormal Course Issuer Bid\nOn August 14, 2017, SLF Inc. launched a normal course issuer bid under which it is authorized to purchase up to 11.5 million common shares between August 14, 2017 and August 13, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2017, SLF Inc. purchased and cancelled approximately 1.7 million common shares at a total cost of $87 million.

Underlying net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $232 million, compared to $243 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nReported net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected unfavourable market related impacts primarily driven by interest rates and lower equity market gains partially offset by real estate appreciation, and the unfavourable impact of ACMA in the fourth quarter of 2017 within Individual Insurance & Wealth. Underlying net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 decreased due to the release of a litigation provision which increased 2016 underlying net income.\n2017 vs. 2016\nReported net income was $963 million in 2017, compared to $936 million in 2016. Underlying net income was $949 million in 2017, compared to $887 million in 2016.\nReported net income in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected less favourable market related impacts driven by the impact of interest rate and swap spreads partially offset by real estate gains. The impact of ACMA in 2017 was primarily in Individual Insurance & Wealth and favourable compared to the prior year. Underlying net income in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected higher new business gains, favourable mortality experience with GRS and Individual Wealth, and favourable credit experience, partially offset by lower investing activity gains.\nGrowth\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nSLF Canada insurance sales were $227 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $308 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Individual insurance sales of $120 million were 41% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016 following a strong fourth quarter in 2016 in anticipation of the Canadian life insurance tax legislation changes that came into effect on January 1, 2017. Sales in Group Benefits of $107 million increased 2% compared to fourth quarter 2016, continuing its sales momentum experienced over the first nine months of the year.\nSLF Canada wealth sales of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased compared to $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to GRS sales, largely reflecting a large Client sale in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Individual wealth sales of $1.5 billion were level compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSLF Canada insurance sales were $1,125 million in 2017, compared to $950 million in 2016. Individual insurance sales of $451 million were down 5% from the same period in the prior year, driven by strong sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year in anticipation of the Canadian life insurance tax legislation changes that came into effect on January 1, 2017. Sales in Group Benefits of $674 million increased 42% compared to 2016 driven by several large case sales.\nSLF Canada wealth sales were $15.0 billion in 2017, compared to $13.2 billion in 2016. Individual wealth sales of $5.9 billion were up 9% in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by continued growth in our wealth manufactured (1) products, including SLGI (2) mutual funds and Sun GIF (3) segregated funds.

Underlying net income was US$99 million ($126 million), compared to US$65 million ($87 million) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased underlying net income by $6 million.\nReported net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to reported net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected the unfavourable impact of the U.S. tax reform and market related impacts driven by interest rates, largely in In-force Management.\nUnderlying net income was up 52% in U.S. dollars from the fourth quarter 2016 resulting in after-tax profit margin for Group Benefits (1) to increase to 5.0% from 3.5% for the comparable period in 2016. This reflects our improved underwriting experience in the group life and disability businesses, as our pricing actions, investments in claims management and expense initiatives, as well as progress on the integration of the U.S. employee benefits business acquired in 2016, continue to progress. These results also reflected more favourable mortality experience in In-force Management, partially offset by lapse and other policyholder experience in In-force Management.\n(1)\nBased on underlying net income, on a trailing four quarters basis, and which is described in section J - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSLF U.S.'s reported net income was US$240 million ($308 million) in 2017, compared to reported net income of US$385 million ($508 million) in 2016. Underlying net income was US$392 million ($507 million) in 2017, compared to US$339 million ($447 million) in 2016. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in 2017 relative to average exchange rates in 2016 decreased reported net income and underlying net income by $6 million and $11 million, respectively.\nReported net income in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected the adverse impact of the U.S. tax reform and less favourable market impacts primarily driven by interest rates. ACMA in 2017 (excluding the impact of the U.S. tax reform) were primarily driven by the impact in the second quarter of 2017 related to reinsurance and taxes (1) .\nUnderlying net income in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected improved mortality and morbidity experience in Group Benefits, an increase in gains from investing activities on insurance contract liabilities, and a full twelve months of income from the employee benefits business purchased in the prior year. These items were partially offset by unfavourable policyholder behaviour in In-force Management and less favourable mortality experience in International.\nGrowth\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nSLF U.S. insurance sales were US$532 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to US$415 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Group Benefit sales increased by 25% to US$494 million reflected strong medical stop-loss sales which almost doubled from the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower group life and disability sales. International life sales of US$38 million increased by 81% compared to the same quarter in 2016, including several large case sales, maintaining a leadership position in this market.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSLF U.S. insurance sales increased by US$93 million in 2017 compared to 2016, Group Benefits sales increased 9% compared to 2016 driven by increased sales of medical stop-loss insurance.

SLF Asset Management had underlying net income of $226 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased reported net income and underlying net income by $6 million and $11 million, respectively.\nSLF Asset Management's reported net income decreased compared to the same quarter in 2016 primarily due to the impact of the U.S. tax reform, which is excluded from underlying net income.\nIn U.S. dollars, MFS's reported net income was US$72 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to US$142 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. MFS's reported net income compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects the charge related to the U.S. tax reform and the Fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards. MFS's underlying net income was US$174 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to US$135 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by higher average net assets and lower taxes. MFS's pre-tax operating profit margin ratio was 40% in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 35% in the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to higher average net assets.\nSLIM's reported net income was $23 million compared to $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to a benefit related to the U.S. tax reform discussed above. SLIM's underlying net income was $6 million compared to $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSLF Asset Management's reported net income in 2017 was $653 million, compared to $729 million in 2016. Underlying net income was $812 million in 2017, compared to $699 million in 2016. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar in 2017 relative to average exchange rates in 2016 decreased reported net income and underlying net income by $14 million and $17 million, respectively.\nMFS's reported net income in 2017 was US$471 million, compared to US$528 million in 2016. MFS's reported net income compared to 2016 reflects the Fair value adjustments on MFS's share-based payment awards and the impact related to the U.S. tax reform. MFS's underlying net income was US$610 million in 2017, compared to US$506 million in 2016. MFS's underlying net income in 2017 increased compared to prior year driven primarily by higher average net assets, expense management, and lower taxes.\nSLIM's reported net income in 2017 was $41 million compared to $29 million in 2016, primarily due to a benefit related to the U.S. tax reform. SLIM's underlying net income was $24 million compared to $29 million in 2016.\nGrowth\nSLF Asset Management's AUM was $677.6 billion as at December 31, 2017, compared to $624.8 billion as at December 31, 2016. The increase in AUM was primarily due to asset appreciation, partially offset by unfavourable currency impact and net outflows. MFS's AUM was US$491.6 billion ($618.3 billion) as at December 31, 2017, compared to US$425.6 billion ($571.6 billion) as at December 31, 2016. The increase of US$66.0 billion was primarily driven by asset appreciation of US$87.8 billion and gross sales of US$82.1 billion, partially offset by redemptions of US$103.9 billion. Net outflows at MFS were primarily driven by institutional Client portfolio re-balancing and the trend to passive investing. 84%, 79% and 92% of MFS's retail fund assets ranked in the top half of their Lipper categories based on three-, five-, and ten-year performance, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nSLIM's AUM was $59.3 billion as at December 31, 2017, compared to $53.2 billion as at December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to net sales of $6.1 billion.\n4.

Underlying net income in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected growth in fee income business and higher level of gains from available-for-sale (\"AFS\") assets.\nGrowth\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016\nSLF Asia insurance sales were $203 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $208 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total individual insurance sales decreased 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and lower sales in Hong Kong. On a constant currency basis, individual insurance sales increased 3%. With the exception of lower sales in Hong Kong, all other markets achieved double-digit growth.\nSLF Asia wealth sales were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Strong wealth sales were led by continued growth in equity and fixed income funds in our Indian joint venture mutual fund company, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited, and our asset management company in the Philippines, as well as our growing pensions business in Hong Kong.\n2017 vs. 2016\nSLF Asia insurance sales were $687 million in 2017, compared to $660 million in 2016. Total individual insurance sales in 2017 increased 5% from 2016.

Reported net loss in Corporate in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected the unfavourable impact of acquisition, integration and restructuring amounts and the impact of the U.S. tax reform. Underlying net loss was $23 million, compared to underlying loss of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSLF U.K.'s reported net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 which reflected impacts from the treatment of policyholder tax losses, ACMA, and a lower level of gains from investing activity on insurance contract liabilities, partially offset by favourable mortality.\nCorporate Support had a reported net loss of $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a reported net loss of $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in loss was primarily due to the restructuring charge related to actions to enhance business processes and organizational structures and capabilities and the impact of the U.S. tax reform in Run-off reinsurance.\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe reported net loss was $101 million in the Corporate segment in 2017, compared to a reported net income of $3 million in 2016, reflected the unfavourable impact of acquisition, integration and restructuring amounts and the impact of the U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the favourable impact of ACMA. Underlying net loss was $52 million in 2017, compared to an underlying net income of $7 million in the prior year. The impact from the movement of the Canadian dollar relative to average exchange rates in 2017 increased reported net loss by $15 million and increased underlying net loss by $9 million.\nSLF U.K.'s reported net income in 2017 compared to 2016 reflected the favourable impact of ACMA, improved equity markets and favourable mortality experience, offset by lower level of gains from investing activity on insurance contract liabilities and impacts from the treatment of policyholder tax losses.\nIn Corporate Support, the reported net loss in 2017 was $282 million compared to a reported net loss of $181 million in 2016 primarily due to the impact of the U.S. tax reform and the restructuring charge related to actions to enhance business processes and organizational structures.\nG. Investments\nWe had total general fund invested assets of $146.1 billion as at December 31, 2017, compared to $142.4 billion as at December 31, 2016. The increase in general fund invested assets was primarily due to changes in operating activity and net fair value growth, partially offset by the currency impact of the strengthening Canadian dollar and the net redemption of subordinated debt. Our general fund invested assets are well diversified across investment types, geographies and sectors with the majority of our portfolio invested in fixed income high quality assets.\nThe following table sets out the composition of our general fund invested assets.

Generally, the carrying values for Fair value through profit or loss (\"FVTPL\") and AFS invested assets are equal to their fair values; however our mortgages and loans are generally carried at amortized cost. For invested assets supporting insurance contracts, in the event of default, if the amounts recovered are insufficient to satisfy the related insurance contract liability cash flows that the assets are intended to support, credit exposure may be greater than the carrying value of the assets.\n(2)\nAs a result of the relocation of our head office location, the December 31, 2017 balance includes the reclassification of our former head office location in the second quarter of 2017, previously classified as owner-occupied, with a fair value of $259 million at the time of transfer from Other Assets to Investment properties. The reclassification recognized revaluation surplus of $172 million which was recorded as an increase of $139 million of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes of $33 million.\n1. Debt Securities\nOur debt securities portfolio is actively managed through a regular program of purchases and sales aimed at optimizing yield, quality and liquidity, while ensuring that it remains well diversified and duration-matched to insurance contract liabilities. With the exception of certain countries where we have business operations, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, our exposure to debt securities from any single country did not exceed 1% of total invested assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as at December 31, 2017.\nThe carrying value of FVTPL and AFS debt securities by geographic location is presented in the following table.\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n($ millions)\nFVTPL\ndebt\nsecurities\nAFS debt\nsecurities\nTotal\n% of Total\nFVTPL\ndebt\nsecurities\nAFS debt\nsecurities\nTotal\n% of Total\nDebt securities\nCanada\n24,132\n4,114\n28,246\n39%\n22,507\n3,589\n26,096\n36%\nUnited States\n20,758\n5,719\n26,477\n36%\n21,469\n5,910\n27,379\n38%\nEurope\n8,923\n1,402\n10,325\n14%\n9,087\n1,507\n10,594\n15%\nAsia\n3,694\n571\n4,265\n6%\n3,841\n651\n4,492\n6%\nOther\n2,460\n846\n3,306\n5%\n2,562\n764\n3,326\n5%\nTotal debt securities\n59,967\n12,652\n72,619\n100%\n59,466\n12,421\n71,887\n100%\nOur debt securities with a credit rating of \"A\" or higher represented 70.6% of the total debt securities as at December 31, 2017, compared to 69.6% as at December 31, 2016. Debt securities with a credit rating of \"BBB\" or higher represented 98.3% of total debt securities as at December 31, 2017, compared to 97.6% as at December 31, 2016.\nOur gross unrealized losses as at December 31, 2017 for FVTPL and AFS debt securities were $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, compared with $0.7 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, as at December 31, 2016.\n2. Mortgages and Loans\nMortgages and loans disclosures in this section are presented at their carrying value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Our mortgage portfolio consisted almost entirely of first mortgages and our loan portfolio consisted of private placement loans.\nThe carrying value of mortgages and loans by geographic location is presented in the following table.

Our mortgage portfolio consists entirely of commercial mortgages, including retail, office, multi-family, industrial and land properties. As at December 31, 2017, 30% of our commercial mortgage portfolio consisted of multi-family residential mortgages; there are no single family residential mortgages. Our uninsured commercial portfolio had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 55% as at December 31, 2017, consistent with December 31, 2016. While we generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 75% at issuance, we may invest in mortgages with a higher loan-to-value ratio in Canada if the mortgage is insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (\"CMHC\"). The estimated weighted average debt service coverage for our uninsured commercial portfolio is 1.77 times. Of the $3.2 billion of multi-family residential mortgages in the Canadian commercial mortgage portfolio, 91% were insured by the CMHC.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held $27.3 billion of loans, compared to $25.4 billion as at December 31, 2016. Private placement loans provide diversification by type of loan, industry segment and borrower credit quality. The private placement loan portfolio consists of senior secured and unsecured loans to large- and mid-market sized corporate borrowers, securitized lease/loan obligations secured by a variety of assets, and project finance loans in sectors such as power and infrastructure.\nMortgages and Loans Past Due or Impaired\nThe gross carrying value and allowance for mortgages and loans past due or impaired are presented in the following table.\nDecember 31, 2017\nGross carrying value\nAllowance for losses\n($ millions)\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nNot past due\n15,482\n27,180\n42,662\n—\n—\n—\nPast due:\nPast due less than 90 days\n—\n71\n71\n—\n—\n—\nPast due 90 days or more\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nImpaired\n33\n89\n122\n22 (1)\n28\n50\nTotal\n15,515\n27,340\n42,855\n22\n28\n50\nDecember 31, 2016\nGross carrying value\nAllowance for losses\n($ millions)\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nMortgages\nLoans\nTotal\nNot past due\n15,378\n25,379\n40,757\n—\n—\n—\nPast due:\nPast due less than 90 days\n2\n—\n2\n—\n—\n—\nPast due 90 days or more\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nImpaired\n39\n7\n46\n23 (1)\n7\n30\nTotal\n15,419\n25,386\n40,805\n23\n7\n30\n(1)\nIncludes $20 million of sectoral provisions as at December 31, 2017, and $21 million of sectoral provisions as at December 31, 2016.\nOur impaired mortgages and loans, net of allowance for losses, were $72 million as at December 31, 2017, compared to $16 million as at December 31, 2016. The increase of $56 million in impaired loans was primarily due to the addition of two creditors in the first quarter of 2017.\n3. Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe values associated with our derivative instruments are presented in the following table. Notional amounts serve as the basis for payments calculated under derivatives contracts and are not exchanged.\n($ millions)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet fair value asset (liability)\n(278)\n(904)\nTotal notional amount\n54,121\n54,350\nCredit equivalent amount\n561\n510\nRisk-weighted credit equivalent amount\n5.6\n5.2\nThe total notional amount of our derivatives decreased to $54.1 billion as at December 31, 2017 from $54.4 billion as at December 31, 2016 reflecting a decline in interest rate contracts, partially offset by foreign currency contracts.\nThe net fair value of derivatives was a net liability of $278 million as at December 31, 2017, compared to a net liability of $904 million as at December 31, 2016. The increase in net fair value was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by upward shifts in the yield curve.\n4. Asset Default Provision\nWe make provisions for possible future credit events in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities. The amount of the provision for asset default included in insurance contract liabilities is based on possible reductions in future investment yields that vary by factors such as type of asset, asset credit quality (rating), duration and country of origin. To the extent that an asset is written off, or disposed of, any amounts that were set aside in our insurance contract liabilities for possible future asset defaults in respect of that asset are released.\nOur asset default provision reflects the provision relating to future credit events for fixed income assets currently held by the Company that support our insurance contract liabilities. Our asset default provision as at December 31, 2017 was $2,288 million compared to $2,247 million as at December 31, 2016. The increase of $41 million was primarily due to increases in the provision for assets purchased, net of dispositions offset by strengthening of the Canadian dollar and the release of provisions on fixed income assets supporting our insurance contract liabilities.\nH. Risk Management\nThe Company has established a Risk Management Framework to assist in identifying, measuring, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The Risk Management Framework covers all risks and these have been grouped into six major categories: credit, market, insurance, business and strategic, operational and liquidity risks.\nThrough our enterprise risk management processes, we oversee the various risk factors identified in the Risk Management Framework and provide reports to senior management and to the Board Committees at least quarterly. Our enterprise risk management processes and risk factors are described in our annual MD&A and AIF.\nWhen referring to segregated funds in this section, it is inclusive of segregated fund guarantees, variable annuities and investment products and includes Run-off reinsurance in our Corporate business segment.\n1. Market Risk Sensitivities\nOur net income (1) is affected by the determination of policyholder obligations under our annuity and insurance contracts. These amounts are determined using internal valuation models and are recorded in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, primarily as Insurance contract liabilities. The determination of these obligations requires management to make assumptions about the future level of equity market performance, interest rates, credit and swap spreads and other factors over the life of our products. Differences between our actual experience and our best estimate assumptions are reflected in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to Sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates.\nThe market value of our investments in fixed income and equity securities fluctuates based on movements in interest rates and equity markets. The market value of fixed income assets designated as AFS that are held primarily in our surplus segment increases with declining interest rates and decreases with rising interest rates. The market value of equities designated as AFS and held primarily in our surplus segment increases (decreases) with rising (declining) equity markets. Changes in the market value of AFS assets flow through other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and are only recognized in net income when realized upon sale, or when considered impaired. The amount of realized gains (losses) recorded in net income in any period is equal to the unrealized gains (losses) or OCI position at the start of the period plus the change in market value during the current period up to the point of sale for those securities that were sold during the period. The sale or impairment of AFS assets held in surplus can therefore have the effect of modifying our net income sensitivity.\nWe realized $41 million (pre-tax) in net gains on the sale of AFS assets during the fourth quarter of 2017 ($41 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter of 2016). The net unrealized gains or OCI position on AFS fixed income and equity assets were $171 million and $175 million, respectively, after-tax as at December 31, 2017 ($86 million and $125 million, respectively, after-tax as at December 31, 2016).\n(1)\nNet income refers to common shareholders' net income in section H - Risk Management in this document.\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of our net income and OCI, and Sun Life Assurance's MCCSR ratio to certain instantaneous changes in interest rates and equity market prices as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nInterest Rate and Equity Market Sensitivities\nAs at December 31, 2017 (1)\n($ millions, unless otherwise noted)\nInterest rate sensitivity (2)(6)\n100 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\nincrease\n100 basis point\nincrease\nPotential impact on net income (3)(6)\n$\n(250)\n$\n(100)\n$\n50\n$\n100\nPotential impact on OCI\n$\n550\n$\n250\n$\n(250)\n$\n(550)\nPotential impact on MCCSR (4)\n9% points\ndecrease\n4% points\ndecrease\n4% points\nincrease\n7% points\nincrease\nEquity markets sensitivity (5)\n25% decrease\n10% decrease\n10% increase\n25% increase\nPotential impact on net income (3)\n$\n(300)\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\n$\n300\nPotential impact on OCI\n$\n(200)\n$\n(50)\n$\n50\n$\n200\nPotential impact on MCCSR (4)\n4% points\ndecrease\n1% points\ndecrease\n2% points\nincrease\n3% points\nincrease\nAs at December 31, 2016 (1)\n($ millions, unless otherwise noted)\nInterest rate sensitivity (2)(6)\n100 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n50 basis point\nincrease\n100 basis point\nincrease\nPotential impact on net income (3)(6)\n$\n(200)\n$\n(100)\n$\n50\n$\n50\nPotential impact on OCI\n$\n550\n$\n250\n$\n(250)\n$\n(500)\nPotential impact on MCCSR (4)\n8% points\ndecrease\n3% points\ndecrease\n4% points\nincrease\n7% points\nincrease\nEquity markets sensitivity (5)\n25% decrease\n10% decrease\n10% increase\n25% increase\nPotential impact on net income (3)\n$\n(300)\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\n$\n250\nPotential impact on OCI\n$\n(150)\n$\n(50)\n$\n50\n$\n150\nPotential impact on MCCSR (4)\n3% points\ndecrease\n1% points\ndecrease\n2% points\nincrease\n4% points\nincrease\n(1)\nNet income and OCI sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $50 million. The sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income from our joint ventures and associates, which we account for on an equity basis.\n(2)\nInterest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 with no change to the Actuarial Standards Board (\"ASB\") promulgated Ultimate Reinvestment Rate (\"URR\"). Variations in realized yields based on factors such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing interest rate hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 10 basis point intervals (for 50 basis point changes in interest rates) and at 20 basis point intervals (for 100 basis point changes in interest rates).\n(3)\nThe market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation impact of our hedging programs in effect as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and include new business added and product changes implemented prior to such dates.\n(4)\nThe MCCSR sensitivities illustrate the impact on Sun Life Assurance as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. This excludes the impact on assets and liabilities that are in SLF Inc. but not included in Sun Life Assurance.\n(5)\nRepresents the respective change across all equity markets as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Assumes that actual equity exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets. Since in actual practice equity-related exposures generally differ from broad market indices (due to the impact of active management, basis risk, and other factors), realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2% intervals (for 10% changes in equity markets) and at 5% intervals (for 25% changes in equity markets).\n(6)\nThe majority of interest rate sensitivity, after hedging, is attributed to individual insurance products. We also have interest rate sensitivity, after hedging, from our fixed annuity and segregated funds products.\nOur net income and MCCSR sensitivities to changes in interest rates and equity markets have changed since December 31, 2016. The increase in sensitivities is primarily the result of ACMA during 2017.\n2. Credit Spread and Swap Spread Sensitivities\nWe have estimated the immediate impact or sensitivity of our net income attributable to certain instantaneous changes in credit and swap spreads. The credit spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in credit spreads on our asset and liability valuations (including non-sovereign fixed income assets, provincial governments, corporate bonds, and other fixed income assets). The swap spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in swap spreads on swap-based derivative positions and liability valuations.\nCredit Spread Sensitivities ($ millions, after-tax)\nNet income sensitivity (1)(2)\n50 basis point decrease\n50 basis point increase\nDecember 31, 2017\n$\n(100)\n$\n100\nDecember 31, 2016\n$\n(125)\n$\n125\n(1)\nSensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $25 million.\n(2)\nIn most instances, credit spreads are assumed to revert to long-term insurance contract liability assumptions generally over a five-year period.\nSwap Spread Sensitivities ($ millions, after-tax)\nNet income sensitivity (1)\n20 basis point decrease\n20 basis point increase\nDecember 31, 2017\n$\n25\n$\n(25)\nDecember 31, 2016\n$\n25\n$\n(25)\n(1)\nSensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $25 million.\nThe credit and swap spread sensitivities assume a parallel shift in the indicated spreads across the entire term structure. Variations in realized spread changes based on different terms to maturity, geographies, asset classes and derivative types, underlying interest rate movements, and ratings may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those provided above. The credit spread sensitivity estimates exclude any credit spread impact that may arise in connection with asset positions held in segregated funds. Spread sensitivities are provided for the consolidated entity and may not be proportional across all reporting segments. Refer to Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to Sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates.\n3. General Account Insurance and Annuity Products\nMost of our expected sensitivity to changes in interest rates and about two-thirds of our expected sensitivity to changes in equity markets are derived from our general account insurance and annuity products. We have implemented market risk management strategies to mitigate a portion of the market risk related to our general account insurance and annuity products.\nIndividual insurance products include universal life and other long-term life and health insurance products. Major sources of market risk exposure for individual insurance products include the reinvestment risk related to future premiums on regular premium policies, asset reinvestment risk on both regular premium and single premium policies and the guaranteed cost of insurance. Interest rate risk for individual insurance products is typically managed on a duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment policy or guidelines. Targets and limits are established so that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and assets are re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within policy limits using a combination of assets and derivative instruments. A portion of the longer-term cash flows are backed with equities and real estate.\nFor participating insurance products and other insurance products with adjustability features, the investment strategy objective is to provide a total rate of return given a constant risk profile over the long term.\nFixed annuity products generally provide the policyholder with a guaranteed investment return or crediting rate. Interest rate risk for these products is typically managed on a duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment guidelines. Targets and limits are established such that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and are re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of fixed income assets and derivative instruments.\nCertain insurance and annuity products contain minimum interest rate guarantees. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit potential financial loss due to reductions in asset earned rates relative to contract guarantees. These typically involve the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors, swaps and swaptions.\nCertain insurance and annuity products contain features which allow the policyholders to surrender their policy at book value. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss due to changes in interest rate levels and policyholder behaviour. These typically involve the use of hedging strategies such as dynamic option replication and the purchase of interest rate swaptions.\nCertain products have guaranteed minimum annuitization rates. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss and typically involve the use of fixed income assets, interest rate swaps, and swaptions.\n4. Segregated Fund Guarantees\nApproximately one-third of our equity market sensitivity and a small amount of interest rate risk sensitivity as at December 31, 2017 are derived from segregated fund products. These products provide benefit guarantees, which are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. The cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors including general capital market conditions, our hedging strategies, policyholder behaviour and mortality experience, each of which may result in negative impacts on net income and capital.\nThe following table provides information with respect to the guarantees provided for our segregated fund products.\nAs at December 31, 2017\n($ millions)\nFund value\nAmount at Risk (1)\nValue of\nguarantees (2)\nInsurance contract\nliabilities (3)\nSLF Canada\n12,448\n315\n10,875\n399\nSLF U.S.\n3,727\n250\n3,755\n107\nRun-off reinsurance (4)\n2,534\n375\n1,546\n385\nTotal\n18,709\n940\n16,176\n891\nAs at December 31, 2016\n($ millions)\nFund value\nAmount at Risk (1)\nValue of\nguarantees (2)\nInsurance contract\nliabilities (3)\nSLF Canada\n12,354\n348\n10,961\n499\nSLF U.S.\n4,361\n430\n4,681\n171\nRun-off reinsurance (4)\n2,695\n494\n1,864\n469\nTotal\n19,410\n1,272\n17,506\n1,139\n(1)\nThe Amount at Risk represents the excess of the value of the guarantees over fund values on all policies where the value of the guarantees exceeds the fund value. The Amount at Risk is not currently payable as the guarantees are only payable upon death, maturity, withdrawal, or annuitization if fund values remain below guaranteed values.\n(2)\nFor guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, the value of guarantees is calculated as the present value of the maximum future withdrawals assuming market conditions remain unchanged from current levels. For all other benefits, the value of guarantees is determined assuming 100% of the claims are made at the valuation date.\n(3)\nThe insurance contract liabilities represent management's provision for future costs associated with these guarantees and include a provision for adverse deviation in accordance with Canadian actuarial standards of practice.\n(4)\nThe Run-off reinsurance business includes risks assumed through reinsurance of variable annuity products issued by various North American insurance companies between 1997 and 2001. This line of business is part of a closed block of reinsurance, which is included in the Corporate segment.\nThe movement of the items in the table above from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from the following factors:\n(i)\nthe total fund values decreased due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar and the net redemptions from legacy business, this was partially offset by favourable equity market movements;\n(ii)\nthe amount at risk decreased due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, favourable equity market movements and the net redemptions from legacy business;\n(iii)\nthe total value of guarantees decreased due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar and the net redemptions from legacy business; and\n(iv)\nthe total insurance contract liabilities decreased due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, favourable equity market movements, and the net redemptions from legacy business.\n5. Segregated Fund Hedging\nOur hedging programs use derivative instruments to mitigate the interest and equity related exposure of our segregated fund contracts. As at December 31, 2017, over 90% of our segregated fund contracts, as measured by associated fund values, were included in a hedging program. While a large percentage of contracts are included in the hedging program, not all of our market risk exposure related to these contracts is hedged. For those segregated fund contracts included in the hedging program, we generally hedge the value of expected future net claims costs and associated margins.\nThe following table illustrates the impact of our hedging program related to our sensitivity to a 50 basis point and 100 basis point decrease in interest rates and a 10% and 25% decrease in equity markets for segregated fund contracts as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Segregated Fund Hedging\nDecember 31, 2017\n($ millions)\nChanges in interest rates (3)\nChanges in equity markets (4)\nNet income sensitivity (1)(2)\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n100 basis point\ndecrease\n10% decrease\n25% decrease\nBefore hedging\n(200)\n(400)\n(150)\n(450)\nHedging impact\n200\n400\n100\n350\nNet of hedging\n—\n—\n(50)\n(100)\nDecember 31, 2016\n($ millions)\nChanges in interest rates (3)\nChanges in equity markets (4)\nNet income sensitivity (1)(2)\n50 basis point\ndecrease\n100 basis point\ndecrease\n10% decrease\n25% decrease\nBefore hedging\n(250)\n(550)\n(200)\n(550)\nHedging impact\n250\n550\n150\n450\nNet of hedging\n—\n—\n(50)\n(100)\n(1)\nNet income sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest $50 million.\n(2)\nSince the fair value of benefits being hedged will generally differ from the financial statement value (due to different valuation methods and the inclusion of valuation margins in respect of financial statement values), this will result in residual volatility to interest rate and equity market shocks in net income and capital. The general availability and cost of these hedging instruments may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including volatile and declining equity and interest rate market conditions.\n(3)\nRepresents a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, with no change to the ASB promulgated URR. Variations in realized yields based on factors such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing interest rate hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 10 basis point intervals (for 50 basis point changes in interest rates) and at 20 basis point intervals (for 100 basis point changes in interest rates).\n(4)\nRepresents the change across all equity markets as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Assumes that actual equity exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets. Since in actual practice equity-related exposures generally differ from broad market indices (due to the impact of active management, basis risk, and other factors), realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above. Sensitivities include the impact of re-balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2% intervals (for 10% changes in equity markets) and at 5% intervals (for 25% changes in equity markets).\n6. Real Estate Risk\nReal estate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from fluctuations in the value of, or future cash flows from our investments in real estate. We are exposed to real estate risk and may experience financial losses resulting from the direct ownership of real estate investments or indirectly through fixed income investments secured by real estate property, leasehold interests, ground rents, and purchase and leaseback transactions. Real estate price risk may arise from external market conditions, inadequate property analysis, inadequate insurance coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals, or from environmental risk exposures. We hold direct real estate investments that support general account liabilities and surplus, and fluctuations in value will impact our profitability and financial position. A material and sustained increase in interest rates may lead to deterioration in real estate values. An instantaneous 10% decrease in the value of our direct real estate investments as at December 31, 2017 would decrease net income (1) by approximately $250 million ($200 million decrease as at December 31, 2016). Conversely, an instantaneous 10% increase in the value of our direct real estate investments as at December 31, 2017 would increase net income by approximately $250 million ($200 million increase as at December 31, 2016).",
