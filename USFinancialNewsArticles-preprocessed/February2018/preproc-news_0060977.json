(“Kindred” or the “Company”) (NYSE:KND) today announced its operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also today will file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nOn December 19, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a definitive agreement under which it will be acquired by a consortium of three companies: TPG Capital (“TPG”), Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“WCAS”) and Humana Inc. (“Humana”) (NYSE:HUM) (together, the “Consortium”) for approximately $4.1 billion in cash including the assumption or repayment of net debt (the “Merger”). Immediately following the Merger, the home health, hospice and community care businesses will be separated from the Company and operated as a standalone company owned 40 percent by Humana, with the remaining 60 percent owned by TPG and WCAS. The Company’s long-term acute care (“LTAC”) hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and contract rehabilitation services businesses will be operated as a separate specialty hospital company owned by TPG and WCAS.\nBenjamin A. Breier, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kindred, commented, “Our fourth quarter results reflect continued execution of the Company’s strategy. We are pleased to be moving forward with the Consortium and look forward to completing the Merger to deliver immediate and certain value to Kindred stockholders at a substantial premium and eliminate the significant risks associated with continuing to operate as a standalone public company or pursuing other strategic alternatives. We are confident that the Merger will enhance innovation at both the home care and specialty hospital companies, further Kindred’s culture of a patient-first approach to care and create new opportunities for Kindred employees.”\n(1) Results reflect after-tax costs of $163.7 million or $1.86 per diluted share related to impairment charges, insurance restructuring costs, other restructuring charges, litigation contingency expense, net change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance and an adjustment to reduce deferred tax liabilities based upon certain changes enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“the Tax Reform Act”).\n(2) Results reflect pretax costs of $312.0 million related to impairment charges, insurance restructuring costs, other restructuring charges and litigation contingency expense. As used herein, “EBITDA” means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. See reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) results to non-GAAP results beginning on page 14.\n(3) See reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results beginning on page 14. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of “core” non-GAAP measures. See “Non-GAAP Measures” beginning on page 14 for a discussion regarding the revised definitions. For comparability, core results for 2016 were revised to conform to the current year presentation.\nThe agreement is subject to certain conditions to closing, including, without limitation, the approval of the agreement by the stockholders of Kindred, the receipt of certain licensure and regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The waiting period for the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, expired on February 20, 2018. The Merger is expected to close during the summer of 2018.\nAll financial and statistical information included in this earnings release reflects the continuing operations of the Company’s businesses for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. As previously disclosed, while the operating results, direct overhead and losses associated with the skilled nursing facility business divestiture, and elimination of intercompany profits for certain applicable RehabCare contracts, are classified as discontinued operations, they do not include any allocations of indirect overhead related to the skilled nursing facility business. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reclassified historical intercompany profits from certain RehabCare contracts that were retained with new operators of divested skilled nursing facilities from discontinued operations to continuing operations for all periods presented. The impact of the retained RehabCare contracts on fourth quarter 2017 revenues, loss from continuing operations before income taxes, EBITDA and Core EBITDA was immaterial.\nFourth Quarter Consolidated Results (1) :\nConsolidated revenues were $1.5 billion, a 2.3% year-over-year decrease, primarily attributable to the impact of the closure of seven LTAC hospitals and termination of over 100 RehabCare sites of service during 2017. GAAP loss from continuing operations was $135.4 million compared to a loss of $1.9 million in the same period a year ago. EBITDA decreased to a loss of $192.8 million compared to $88.7 million of income in the prior year. The increase in the loss from continuing operations and the adverse change in EBITDA was primarily due to a $241.3 million increase in impairment charges and a $41.4 million increase in restructuring charges. Core EBITDA increased to $119.2 million compared to $108.2 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to growth in home health and IRF volumes, growth in home health and hospice revenue rates, and lower professional liability and workers compensation costs. GAAP operating cash flows were $67.2 million compared to $147.0 million for the same period a year ago. Core operating cash flows were $86.5 million compared to $142.5 million for the same period a year ago. Core free cash flows were $49.7 million compared to $104.4 million in the same period a year ago. GAAP operating cash flows declined compared to the prior year period due to severance, retention and transaction costs associated with the skilled nursing facility business divestiture and other restructuring activities, and an increase in net working capital. Core operating cash flows and core free cash flows declined compared to the prior year period due to increases in net working capital. GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $1.65 as compared to $0.12 a year ago. The increase in the GAAP diluted loss per share was primarily due to the increase in impairment charges and restructuring charges. Core diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing operations increased to $0.20, as compared to core diluted EPS of $0.07 for the same period last year, primarily due to growth in home health and IRF volumes, growth in home health and hospice revenue rates, and lower professional liability and workers compensation costs. The Company recorded a $236.3 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reflect an adjustment to the carrying value of its Hospital division reporting unit in connection with its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2017. The Company also recorded non-cash impairment charges of $3.2 million for an intangible asset and $1.9 million for property and equipment, both related to the Hospital division, and a $3.5 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge in the Kindred at Home division (“KAH”).\nFull Year Consolidated Results (1) :\nConsolidated revenues were $6.0 billion, a 4.1% year-over-year decrease, primarily attributable to the impact of the transition to LTAC patient criteria, the sale or closure of 22 LTAC hospitals since the third quarter of 2016 and termination of over 100 RehabCare sites of service during 2017. GAAP loss from continuing operations was $247.2 million compared to a loss of $597.7 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in the loss was primarily due to a $280.3 million decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance provision as well as a $130.5 million tax benefit from the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for certain changes enacted by the Tax Reform Act. EBITDA declined to a loss of $61.6 million compared to income of $79.9 million in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in impairment charges, the impact of LTAC patient criteria, the sale or closure of LTAC hospitals noted above and operating losses associated with the one-time impact of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey (the “Hurricanes”) of $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by lower professional liability and workers compensation costs. Core EBITDA declined to $443.5 million compared to $508.4 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to LTAC patient criteria, the sale or closure of LTAC hospitals and the Hurricane losses, partially offset by lower professional liability and workers compensation costs.\n(1) See reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results beginning on page 14. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of “core” non-GAAP measures. See “Non-GAAP Measures” beginning on page 14 for a discussion regarding the revised definitions. For comparability, core results for 2016 were revised to conform to the current year presentation. GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $3.31 as compared to $7.29 a year ago. The decrease in the GAAP diluted loss per share was primarily due to a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance provision as well as a tax benefit from the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for certain changes enacted by the Tax Reform Act. Core diluted EPS from continuing operations declined to $0.34, as compared to core diluted EPS of $0.73 for the same period last year, primarily due to LTAC patient criteria and the Hurricane losses in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by lower professional liability and workers compensation costs. GAAP operating cash flows were $75.7 million compared to $188.2 million for the same period a year ago. Core operating cash flows were $136.9 million compared to $299.3 million for the same period a year ago. Core free cash flows were $5.9 million compared to $157.2 million in the same period a year ago. GAAP and core operating cash flows and core free cash flows declined compared to the prior year period due to LTAC patient criteria and increases in net working capital.\nFourth Quarter Segment Results (1)(2)(3) :\nKAH recorded fourth quarter revenues that increased 3.0% to $649.0 million from $630.2 million in the prior year period. On a same-store basis, home health admissions increased 1.6%, but same-store hospice admissions decreased 2.0% over the prior year period. Home health revenue per episode increased 2.6% and hospice revenues per patient day increased 2.7%. GAAP segment adjusted operating income and core segment adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 both increased to $103.6 million, an increase of 14.7% and 16.6%, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The improvements are a result of increased home health volumes, home health and hospice revenue rates, and improved operating efficiencies compared to the prior year. Home health direct labor costs per visit declined 2.6% and hospice direct labor costs per patient day declined 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 both as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nKindred’s Hospital division fourth quarter revenues declined 7.3% to $505.8 million from $545.9 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the elimination of approximately $20 million of revenue related to the closure of seven LTAC hospitals during 2017 and an 8.2% decline in same-hospital admissions compared to last year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately 92% of same-hospital revenue came from LTAC compliant patients, which include all patients except Medicare site neutral patients, an increase from approximately 89% in both the third quarter of 2017 and the prior year period. Same-hospital managed care and commercial volumes increased 6.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period. GAAP segment adjusted operating income and core segment adjusted operating income both declined to $91.0 million, a decrease of 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, as compared to a year ago. The declines were primarily due to the closure of seven LTAC hospitals, which contributed $1.0 million in both GAAP and core segment operating income during 2017 compared to $2.3 million in 2016, and declines in same-hospital admissions.\nKindred Rehabilitation Services division fourth quarter revenues declined 4.1% to $346.6 million as compared to $361.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to operating fewer sites of service in RehabCare resulting from the sale of the Company’s affiliated skilled nursing facility business and termination of unprofitable contracts. GAAP segment adjusted operating income and core segment adjusted operating income both decreased to $52.4 million, or by 2.7% as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the reduction in RehabCare sites of service and lower affiliated LTAC volumes and sites of service within the Kindred Hospital Rehabilitation Services (“KHRS”) contract services business. The KHRS segment achieved revenue growth of 1.4% to $173.7 million from $171.3 million a year ago. This growth is primarily due to IRF revenues increasing 7.5% to $97.8 million as compared to $91.0 million in the prior year as a result of IRF development and a 2.9%\n(1) See reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results beginning on page 14. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of “core” non-GAAP measures. See “Non-GAAP Measures” beginning on page 14 for a discussion regarding the revised definitions. For comparability, core results for 2016 were revised to conform to the current year presentation.\n(2) See same-hospital and full segment data on pages 9 through 13.\n(3) For each of the Company’s segments, Segment adjusted operating income (loss) is a measure of performance used by the Company’s chief operating decision makers in accordance with “Accounting Standard Codification 280 – Segment Reporting.” The Company defines Segment adjusted operating income (loss) as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and total rent for each of the Company’s operating segments, excluding litigation contingency expense, impairment charges, restructuring charges, transaction costs, and the allocation of support center overhead.\nFourth Quarter Segment Results (1)(2) (Continued):\nincrease in same-hospital discharges. KHRS GAAP segment adjusted operating income and core segment adjusted operating income both declined to $49.0 million or by 1.3%, as compared to the same period a year ago, primarily as a result of lower affiliated LTAC volumes and sites of service. The IRFs contributed $33.2 million to KHRS GAAP segment adjusted operating income, a 19.7% increase over the prior year. RehabCare revenues declined 9.1% to $172.9 million from $190.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to operating fewer sites of service. RehabCare GAAP segment adjusted operating income and core segment adjusted operating income both decreased to $3.4 million or 18.5%, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to operating fewer sites of service.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $33.1 million of pretax charges related to the continued divestiture of its skilled nursing facility business, including $14.4 million of transaction, severance and retention costs, $13.2 million related to asset write downs, a $5.0 million lease guarantee provision and $0.5 million of lease termination costs.\n2018 Outlook and Other Commentary (3)\nAll forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures used to provide the “2018 Outlook” are provided only on a non- GAAP basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of items that would be included in the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. As a result, reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is not available without unreasonable effort and the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nFor the 2018 Outlook, Kindred anticipates:\nAnnual revenues of $6.0 billion, with a range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion; Core EBITDA of $515 million, with a range of $500 million to $530 million; and Core diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.75, with a range of $0.65 to $0.85.\nThese estimates are identical to the 2018 Outlook provided in the Company’s third quarter earnings release dated November 6, 2017, with the exception of the annual revenues estimate, which was adjusted primarily to reflect LTAC hospital closures, a reduction in RehabCare sites of service and certain adjustments related to the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard on January 1, 2018.\nThe Company noted that its 2018 Outlook incorporates the estimated near-term impact of the federal budget passed on February 8, 2018. The Company further noted that the estimated future reimbursement impact on the Company’s LTAC, home health and rehabilitation businesses from the 2018 federal budget is consistent with the Company’s longer term expectations.\nThe Company reaffirmed its previously disclosed 2018 midpoint estimate of approximately $175 of core free cash flows from continuing operations and net operating loss (“NOLs”) utilization, comprising approximately $120 million of core free cash flows from continuing operations and an anticipated cash benefit of approximately $55 million from federal and state tax NOLs. In addition, the Company expects negative free cash flows from discontinued operations, at the midpoint, of approximately $80 million in 2018. Combining continuing and discontinuing operations, on a consolidated basis the Company anticipates 2018 core free cash flow from operations at the midpoint of approximately $95 million, which includes the $55 million of anticipated cash NOL benefits noted above. The Company expects to use approximately $20 million of these cash flows to fund its previously announced IRF development projects, some of which will contribute to 2018 results.\n(1) See reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results beginning on page 14. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of “core” non-GAAP measures. See “Non-GAAP Measures” beginning on page 14 for a discussion regarding the revised definitions. For comparability, core results for 2016 were revised to conform to the current year presentation.\n(2) For each of the Company’s segments, Segment adjusted operating income (loss) is a measure of performance used by the Company’s chief operating decision makers in accordance with “Accounting Standard Codification 280 – Segment Reporting.” The Company defines Segment adjusted operating income (loss) as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and total rent for each of the Company’s operating segments, excluding litigation contingency expense, impairment charges, restructuring charges, transaction costs, and the allocation of support center overhead.\n(3) See beginning on page 14.\n2018 Outlook and Other Commentary (1) (Continued):\nThe Company indicated that its actuarially estimated aggregate insurance settlement cash outflows from discontinued operations for all future periods as of December 31, 2017 approximates $100 million, which comprises approximately $30 million of cash outflows in 2018 and $70 million of cash outflows for periods after 2018. The Company estimated $80 million at the midpoint of expected negative free cash flows from discontinued operations described above includes the estimated $30 million related to insurance settlements, with the remaining estimated $50 million related to the Company’s completion of its skilled nursing facility business divestiture.\nThe Company does not expect the Tax Reform Act to have a material impact on its book income tax provision for 2018, as the reduction in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% will be effectively offset for Kindred by the new limitation on interest expense deductibility and other changes.\nThe Company updated its preliminary midpoint estimate of available gross federal NOLs to roughly $775 million at December 31, 2017, up from a midpoint estimate of available gross federal NOLs of $575 million included in the Company’s earnings release on November 6, 2017 (2) .\nThe Company noted that while the estimated gross federal NOLs have increased, the net cash value of the Company’s federal NOLs has decreased by approximately $40 million. Using the new 21% federal statutory rate, the Company’s current gross federal NOLs are estimated to offset approximately $160 million of 2018 and future federal cash tax liabilities, down from approximately $200 million of expected cash value for the Company’s federal NOL estimate at November 6, 2017 using the 35% federal statutory rate prior to the Tax Reform Act. The Company expects the Tax Reform Act will result in the accelerated utilization of its NOLs, particularly given the new limitations on the tax deductibility of interest expense.\nDue to the pending Merger, Kindred does not intend to provide future guidance updates.\nCancellation of Conference Calls\nIn light of the Merger, the Company has discontinued its practice of holding quarterly earnings conference calls.\n and Non-GAAP Reconciliations\nSee page 14 for important disclosures regarding the Company’s and the non-GAAP financial reconciliations that follow.\nAbout Kindred Healthcare\nKindred Healthcare, Inc., a top-105 private employer in the United States, is a FORTUNE 500 healthcare services company based in Louisville, Kentucky with annual revenues of approximately $6.0 billion.

You can also follow us on Twitter and Facebook .\n(1) See beginning on page 14.\n(2) The increase in gross NOLs is primarily due to certain fourth quarter 2017 changes in book-to-tax temporary differences, finalization of the Company’s 2017 taxable loss, the Company’s previously disclosed insurance program restructuring and additional clarity on the tax attributes of the Company’s skilled nursing facility business divestiture.\nKINDRED HEALTHCARE, INC.

This earnings release includes “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These are often identified by words such as “anticipate,” “approximate,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “will,” “intend,” “hope,” “may,” “potential,” “upside,” “seek,” “continue,” and other similar expressions. Such are inherently uncertain, and stockholders and other potential investors must recognize that actual results may differ materially from the Company’s expectations as a result of a variety of factors. Such upon management’s include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the Company is unable to predict or control, that may cause the Company’s actual results, performance, or plans to differ materially from any future results, performance or plans expressed or implied by such . Risks and uncertainties related to the Merger include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; the failure of the parties to satisfy conditions to completion of the Merger, including the failure of the Company’s stockholders to approve the Merger or the failure of the parties to obtain required regulatory approvals; the risk that regulatory or other approvals are delayed or are subject to terms and conditions that are not anticipated; changes in the business or operating prospects of the Company or its businesses; changes in healthcare and other laws and regulations; the impact of the announcement of, or failure to complete, the Merger on the Company’s relationships with employees, customers, vendors and other business partners; and litigation related to the Merger. In addition, these statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors detailed from time to time in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control. The Company cautions investors that any made by the Company are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to announce publicly the results of any revisions to any of the to reflect future events or developments. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided information in this earnings release using certain non-GAAP measures. The use of these non-GAAP measures is not intended to replace the presentation of the Company’s financial results Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the following pages of this earnings release. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definitions of “core” non-GAAP measures. As revised, the Company’s core non-GAAP measures, including core net income (loss) attributable to Kindred, core EBITDA, core diluted EPS, core operating cash flows and core free cash flows, no longer exclude (1) transaction, integration, research and development, and litigation contingency expenses that are not individually material, (2) non-restructuring related facility closing charges, and (3) non-executive or non-restructuring related severance, retirement and retention costs. For comparability, “core” results for 2016 were revised to conform to the current year presentation. For each of the Company’s segments, Segment adjusted operating income (loss) is a measure of performance used by the Company’s chief operating decision makers in accordance with “Accounting Standard Codification 280 − Segment Reporting.” In this context, the Company defines Segment adjusted operating income (loss) as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and total rent for each of the Company’s operating segments, excluding litigation contingency expense, impairment charges, restructuring charges, transaction costs, and the allocation of support center overhead. EBITDA: The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and believes that the presentation of EBITDA is useful to investors because creditors, securities analysts and investors use EBITDA to compare the performance and valuation of companies in the healthcare industry before consideration of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, and financing costs, which can vary significantly among companies. Non-GAAP Measures (Continued) Core Operating Results: The Company calculates core operating results, including core net income (loss) attributable to Kindred, core EBITDA, and core diluted EPS, by excluding charges related to impairments, business interruption settlements, restructuring charges, debt amendment costs, executive or restructuring-related severance, retirement and retention costs, restructuring-related facility closing charges, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, deferred tax liability adjustment associated with the Tax Reform Act, and material transaction, integration, litigation, and research and development costs. The Company believes that the presentation of core operating results provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison between periods by excluding certain charges that are not representative of its ongoing operations due to the materiality and nature of the charges. The Company’s management uses core net income (loss) attributable to Kindred, core EBITDA, and core diluted EPS as measures of operational performance that are meaningful to investors. The Company uses these measures to assess the relative performance of its operating divisions, as well as the employees that operate these businesses. In addition, the Company believes these measures are important, because securities analysts and investors use these measures to compare the Company’s performance to other companies in the healthcare industry. Same-Hospital Revenues: The same-hospital revenues are calculated by excluding from the Company’s Hospital division revenues the results from two hospitals that closed during the fourth quarter of 2017, four hospitals that closed during the third quarter of 2017, one hospital that closed during the second quarter of 2017, three hospitals acquired in 2016, 15 hospitals sold in 2016, and three hospitals that closed during 2016. The Company believes the presentation of same-hospital revenues provides investors, equity analysts and others with useful information regarding the performance of the Company’s hospital operations that are comparable for the periods presented. For core net income (loss) attributable to Kindred and core EBITDA, the Company believes that income (loss) from continuing operations is the most comparable GAAP measure. For core diluted EPS, the Company believes that GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations is the most comparable GAAP measure. Readers of the Company’s financial information should consider income (loss) from continuing operations and diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations as important measures of the Company’s financial performance, because they provide the most complete measures of its performance. For same-hospital revenues, the Company believes that reported hospital segment revenues is the most comparable GAAP measure. Readers of the Company’s financial information should consider reported hospital segment revenues as an important measure of the Company’s Hospital division financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of its revenue performance. Operating results presented on a core basis, as well as a same-hospital basis, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures based upon GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. Also in this earnings release, the Company provides the financial measures of operating cash flows and free cash flows excluding certain items, which the Company refers to as core operating cash flows and core free cash flows, respectively. Core Operating Cash Flows: The Company defines core operating cash flows as operating cash flows excluding payments related to business interruption settlements, restructuring charges, debt amendment costs, executive or restructuring-related severance, retirement and retention costs, restructuring-related facility closing charges, and material transaction, integration, litigation, and research and development costs, net of income tax benefits. The Company believes that core operating cash flows provide important information to investors for comparability to other companies that use similar measures. Management uses core operating cash flows to evaluate consolidated operating performance and in making decisions related to acquisitions, development capital expenditures, dividends, long-term debt repayments and other uses. Core Free Cash Flows: The Company defines core free cash flows as operating cash flows excluding payments related to business interruption settlements, restructuring charges, debt amendment costs, executive or restructuring-related severance, retirement and retention costs, restructuring-related facility closing charges, and material transaction, integration, litigation, and research and development costs, net of income tax benefits but including routine capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests. The Company believes that core free cash flows provide important information to investors for comparability to other companies that use similar measures. Management uses core free cash flows in making decisions related to acquisitions, development capital expenditures, dividends, long-term debt repayments and other uses. The Company recognizes that core operating cash flows and core free cash flows are non-GAAP measures and are not intended to replace the presentation of the Company’s cash flows For core operating cash flows and core free cash flows, the Company believes net cash flows provided by operating activities is the most comparable GAAP measure. Readers of the Company’s financial information should consider net cash flows provided by operating activities as an important measure because it provides the most complete measure of cash provided by operating activities. Core operating cash flows and core free cash flows should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures based upon GAAP as an indicator of the Company’s cash flows provided by operating activities. KINDRED HEALTHCARE, INC. Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts and statistics) In addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP, the Company has provided information in this earnings release to compute certain non-GAAP measures for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, before certain charges or on a core basis. The charges that were excluded from core operating results are denoted in the tables below. The income tax benefit associated with the excluded charges, including the deferred tax liability adjustment associated with the Tax Reform Act and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the three months and for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the three months and for the year ended December 31, 2016 was calculated using an effective income tax rate of 47.5% and 12.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 36.4% and 63.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The difference in the effective income tax rate compared to the same prior year period is primarily attributable to the change in the amount of deferred tax valuation allowance, the deferred tax liability adjustment associated with the Tax Reform Act and the composition of charges that are non-deductible for income tax purposes, including the impairment charges.

In 2016, the Company did not pay these taxes as a result of a consolidated taxable loss. These cash savings in both years are recognized in GAAP cash flows and offer additional sources of cash when evaluating the Company's cash flow generating capability before certain payments. The Company anticipates it will have approximately $775 million of federal NOLs that, on a tax effected basis of approximately $160 million, should offset approximately 90% of core book tax estimates until exhausted.\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005452/en/\nKindred Healthcare, Inc.\nTodd Flowers, 502-596-6569\nSource: Kindred Healthcare, Inc.",
