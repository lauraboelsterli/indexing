    "text": "(Reuters) - Pandora Media Inc will cut 5 percent of its workforce and take other measures to save costs, as it battles intense competition in the online music streaming market.\nShares of the company were up 2.5 pct in extended trading on Wednesday.\nPandora said the move would result in annual savings of about $45 million to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nThe company currently has 2,488 employees, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n“The redesign shifts resources to focus on ad-tech and audience development efforts...,” it said in a statement.\nThe online music streaming industry has become a battleground for market share, with companies such as Apple Inc and Alphabet’s Google bolstering their services to attract new users.\nPandora said it expected a lower percentage of revenue in full-year 2018, hurt by operating expenses required for cost cuts.\nThe company also disclosed its plans to expand presence and workforce in Atlanta, saying the lower costs of the region compared to its headquarters in Oakland, California, provides a “significant opportunity.”\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
