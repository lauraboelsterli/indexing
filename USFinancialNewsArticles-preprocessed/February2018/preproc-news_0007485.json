    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass., Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NERV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies to treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced that Dr. Rémy Luthringer has been appointed as Executive Chairman of Minerva’s Board of Directors and William Doyle has been appointed as Lead Independent Director.\nDr. Luthringer, as Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Minerva, will continue his close involvement with Minerva’s R&D team in the execution of five late stage clinical trials with three molecules. Dr. Luthringer will also lead the implementation of Minerva’s commercial strategy, initially focused on Minerva’s lead molecule, MIN-101, currently in Phase 3 clinical testing for the treatment of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia.\nWilliam Doyle, a current director of Minerva, is the Executive Chairman of Novocure Ltd. (NASDAQ:NVCR), a commercial stage oncology company pioneering a novel therapy for solid tumors. “Bill's deep industry experience in strategic development, partnering, product launches, marketing and commercialization will benefit Minerva as the foundation is laid for the commercialization of its lead product candidate, MIN-101, and its other clinical stage assets,” said Dr. Fouzia Laghrissi-Thode, a director of Minerva.\nMarc Beer has resigned as Chairman of Minerva’s Board of Directors to pursue new opportunities. During his tenure over the past four years, he guided Minerva from a private company through its initial public offering and growth into late-stage clinical development. “We would like to thank Marc Beer for his valuable contributions during the past four years,” said Dr. Luthringer. “We wish him well in his future endeavors.”\nAbout Minerva Neurosciences\nMinerva Neurosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a portfolio of products to treat CNS diseases.
