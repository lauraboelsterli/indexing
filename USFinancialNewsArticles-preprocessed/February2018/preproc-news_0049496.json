(NYSE: CIR) today updated its Q4 2017 adjusted EPS and revenue guidance ahead of its presentation at Gabelli & Company’s Pump, Valve & Water Systems Symposium. CIRCOR originally provided fourth-quarter guidance during its third-quarter 2017 earnings call on October 27.\nThe Company now forecasts Q4 2017 revenue in the range of $167 million to $170 million (compared with a previous range of $155 million to $175 million) and adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.51 (compared with a prior range of $0.35 to $0.55 per share). This updated guidance and the prior guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted earnings per share exclude any transaction and financing costs related to CIRCOR’s acquisition of the Fluid Handling business from Colfax Corporation, and also exclude the results of operations from the acquisition for the period December 11, 2017 to December 31, 2017. The transaction was closed on December 11, 2017. Adjusted EPS excludes any restructuring and special charges.\nGabelli Symposium Webcast\nCIRCOR President and Chief Executive Officer Scott Buckhout will participate in an analyst-hosted discussion at the Gabelli Symposium.
