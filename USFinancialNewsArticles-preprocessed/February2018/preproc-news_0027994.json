Bison Capital now beneficially owns a majority of the outstanding Class A Common Stock On November 20 th , 2017, the Company received CFIUS approval for the Bison transaction In the first week of November, the Company eliminated the entire remaining Convertible Notes on the balance sheet, completing the full retirement of all of the $64.0 million in notes issued in 2015 On December 29 th , 2017, the Company borrowed $10.0 million from Bison Capital in unsecured debt in accordance with our June, 2017 agreement During the quarter, the Company paid down nearly $5.0 million in non-recourse debt related to the Digital Cinema business, and paid down $19.8 million for the year-to-date The Company significantly extended the availability of its fast-growing OTT services by supporting Google’s Chromecast and Android TV Platforms, as well as Amazon Fire TV for the first time, expanding reach by over 60+ million potential consumers The Company launched a 24/7 channel of its OTT service CONtv on the popular social video service Twitch. The new Twitch channel ( www.twitch.tv/CONtv) provides viewers with both a “lean-back” and a curated on-demand option The Company signed a major new deal with a top three domestic telecom and media company to distribute our channels that is scheduled to be announced and launch in April Subsequent to quarter end, the Company announced a strategic alliance with leading Chinese entertainment company Starrise Media Holdings Limited to release films in China theatrically and to digital platforms. Reciprocally, the alliance also provides for Cinedigm distribution of Chinese films in the North American marketplace. In addition to selectively releasing quality films theatrically, this new arrangement contemplates the release of hundreds of films into the home entertainment marketplaces in China and North America, with particular focus on digital platforms Subsequent to quarter end, the Company announced the launch of its digital-first linear networks and video-on-demand (VOD) services on XUMO . XUMO provides over-the-top (OTT) VOD and live, premium digital channels direct to consumers via smart TVs, mobile and streaming device integrations. XUMO has strategic partnerships with companies such as LG Electronics, Hisense, VIZIO and Panasonic to provide one-click access for consumers. Through the partnership with XUMO, Cinedigm’s channels will now be made available and readily accessible in over 45% of all smart TVs sold in the U.S., which equates to more than 20 million households nationwide This morning, the Company announced a significant distribution deal to embed our Dove Channel in select VIZIO SmartCast and VIZIO Internet Apps Plus devices. VIZIO users will now be able to access free, linear, and premium subscription offerings from Dove Channel, which also includes hundreds of hours of free ad-supported programming. VIZIO is a \"top three\" Consumer Electronics Device manufacturer, and since their founding in 2002, VIZIO has sold over 75 million products, including televisions, sound bars and other devices\n“We are very pleased to have closed the game changing Bison transaction, obtained CFIUS approval and received $40 million in investments from Bison during this past quarter,” said Chris McGurk, Cinedigm Chairman and CEO. “As exemplified by the Starrise strategic alliance, we are now moving forward with our plan to become the first true U.S./China independent studio. This is a huge opportunity for us to become an important two-way pipeline for independent content and OTT services into and out of China. We will focus on leveraging our proven channel, servicing and aggregation capabilities in the OTT streaming space, a projected $65 billion market segment, with the U.S. and China by far the two largest and fastest growing territories in that high growth business.”\n“The Bison transaction dramatically improved our balance sheet as we eliminated all of the remaining approximately $50 million in Convertible Notes on our balance sheet,” said Jeffrey Edell, Chief Financial Officer. “With a total reduction in debt of $66 million this year and further enhancements planned, including a new revolving credit agreement, our balance sheet continues to grow stronger. In addition to the new initiatives for independent content and channels, our drive to profitability in our content distribution and OTT businesses will be based on continued cost efficiencies, more high return content acquisitions in a less competitive environment using new Bison-related capital and higher margin, low risk OTT and digital aggregation deals that leverage our expertise and success in that arena.”\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company for the periods presented to be earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income, net, goodwill impairment, litigation related expenses and recoveries, stock-based compensation, expenses, restructuring, transition and acquisitions expenses, net, and certain other items. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation in the tables attached to this release of loss from continuing operations calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company calculated and communicated Adjusted EBITDA in the tables because the Company's management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders by providing additional information with respect to the performance of its fundamental business activities. Management presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net loss as an indicator of operating performance. Management also believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an industry-wide financial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating the Company's performance and comparing our performance with the performance of our competitors. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, as well as to evaluate the Company's performance because it believes that adjusted EBITDA more accurately reflects the Company's results, as it excludes certain items, such as stock-based compensation charges, that management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net loss as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. The Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income (loss). In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. Management does not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call\nCinedigm will host a conference call to discuss its financial results at 4:30 p.m. EST on February 14, 2018.\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial (877) 754-5303 or for international callers (678) 894-3030 at least five minutes prior to the start of the call.
