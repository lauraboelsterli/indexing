    "text": "SAO PAULO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Brazil’s central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn said on Monday that Latin America’s top economy must somehow continue on the path of reforms to maintain low inflation and a sustainable economic recovery.\nGoldfajn also said that the central bank expects a solid economic recovery this year with inflation reaching goals, though he warned of risks. President Michel Temer last week gave up pension reform ahead of October’s presidential elections, a legislative setback that prompted Fitch to cut Brazil’s credit rating further into junk territory.
