    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO and LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Union International, the West Coast's leading luxury real estate brand and the eighth-largest real estate brokerage in the U.S., today named Leah Sternberg vice president of business development, Southern California. Sternberg, a Southern California native, brings three decades of luxury real estate management and business experience to Pacific Union, including a past role at Compass as regional vice president, launching the brokerage's brand in Pasadena and building a team of more than 80 real estate professionals and staff under her management.\nAs the newest member of Pacific Union's Los Angeles executive team, Sternberg will serve as chief business advisor to more than 900 real estate professionals in Southern California, with a focus on accelerating growth through programs that maximize efficiency and productivity while leveraging the company's proprietary marketing platform.\n\"We're in the people business, and Leah is one of the most passionate and motivating people I know,\" Pacific Union International President in Southern California Nick Segal says. \"Leah has keen real estate insight based on her exceptional experience, which is essential to our mission of redefining the value proposition of our real estate professionals versus the common agent.\"\n\"My passion is inspiring and empowering real estate professionals to achieve their best, and I believe that Pacific Union offers the most dynamic marketing and sales tools, bar none,\" Sternberg says. \"From selling million-dollar homes to $200 million compounds, Pacific Union delivers the best approach and the most powerful reach of any other real estate company in California.\" Sternberg continues, \"It's no wonder that Pacific Union is the No. 1 ranked independent brokerage in Los Angeles and California. I'm excited and eager to contribute to the individual successes of its real estate professionals and the company as a whole.\"\nSternberg's hiring comes on the heels of Pacific Union's Southern California launch earlier this month. Through aggressive growth, Pacific Union now has more than 1,700 real estate professionals across 51 offices throughout Northern and Southern California, projecting sales volume of $18 billion in 2018. Sternberg will work alongside the brokerage's Southern California executive team, including President Nick Segal, Chief Marketing Officer Heidi Hockenberry, Executive Vice President Gus Ruelas, Broker of Record and Legal Counsel Sam Kraemer, and Vice President of Operations Chatty Arrieta.\nPrior to her previous role with Compass, Sternberg served as regional vice president at Coldwell Banker and was responsible for the performance of 15 offices and more than 1,000 independent sales associates serving clients throughout Santa Barbara, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, and Downtown Los Angeles.\nAbout Pacific Union International\nFounded in San Francisco in 1975, Pacific Union International, Inc. is the West Coast's premier luxury real estate brand, with 2017 sales volume of $14.1 billion. In 2016, real estate industry leaders RISMedia and REAL Trends ranked Pacific Union as the eighth-largest brokerage in the U.S.\nThrough its 2015 acquisition of The Mark Company, the nation's leading sales and marketing firm for new urban luxury developments, Pacific Union expanded its brand to development projects from San Diego to Seattle.\nIn 2016, Pacific Union merged with Los Angeles-based brokerage John Aaroe Group, followed in 2017 with mergers with Partners Trust and Gibson International also based in Los Angeles, and Empire Realty Associates, extending the Pacific Union brand to become the preeminent leader and ultimate California real estate company. The strategic alliance of these five powerhouses supports 1,700 elite real estate professionals in more than 50 offices throughout the West Coast. Northern California markets include San Francisco, Marin, Contra Costa, Alameda, Napa, and Sonoma counties; Silicon Valley; and the Lake Tahoe region. Greater Los Angeles markets include Beverly Hills, Malibu, Downtown, Northeast L.A., the Westside, as well as the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys.\nTo extend Pacific Union's international reach, the brokerage established an award-winning, Beijing-based China Concierge program in 2013 that fully supports its Chinese investors on the mainland. Additionally, Pacific Union offers a full range of personal and commercial real estate services, including buying, selling and relocation, in addition to operating joint-venture businesses that provide rental and commercial property management and insurance services. Locally owned, Pacific Union executes with a vision for the future, an entrepreneurial mindset and an unwavering commitment to deliver exceptional service and expertise.
