That expansion has raised costs at the lender.\nMUFG posted a net profit of 236.5 billion yen ($2.16 billion) for the October-December period, its smallest profit in three quarters, according to a Reuters calculation. MUFG and other Japanese banks only disclosed nine-month cumulative figures.\nThe No.1 Japanese lender said on Friday its expense ratio for the nine months ended in December rose to 67.3 percent from 63.7 percent in the year earlier period. Its operating costs rose 6.5 percent during October-December from the year-ago period, a Reuters calculation shows.\nThe bank has taken steps to contain costs. MUFG CEO Nobuyuki Hirano has launched a drive to become more efficient at home and overseas, including setting up a back-office centre in the Philippines and targeting headcount reduction of 6,000 by the year starting in April 2023.\nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group earlier this week reported quarterly profit rises after hefty gains in their stock portfolios.\nMUFG already holds stakes in Vietnam’s VietinBank, Thailand’s Bank of Ayudhya and Security Bank Corp of the Philippines.\nIn December, MUFG said it had agreed with Temasek Holdings , Singapore’s state investment arm, to buy 73.8 percent of Indonesia’s fifth-largest bank in three stages, adding that eventually it wants to make it wholly owned.\nFor the full year through March, the Japanese bank kept its net profit forecast of 950 billion yen, up 2.5 percent from the previous year and below an average estimate of 1.01 trillion yen in a poll of 14 analysts by Thomson Reuters.
