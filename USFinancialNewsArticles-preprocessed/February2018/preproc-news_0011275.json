Resolutions, such as vacating the board and installing new members, require majority support to pass.\nOnce a dominant force in Australian retailing, Myer’s business model has buckled under pressure from new foreign “fast fashion” rivals, lacklustre consumer spending and flat wage growth.\n“I think Solly’s got everything going for him at this point,” said Mathan Somasundaram, Market Portfolio Strategist at stockbroker Blue Ocean Equities.\n“If you’re holding that stock right now, you’re probably hoping that he could do something,” he said.\nMyer shares fell 0.8 percent in mid-session trading on Wednesday, while the broader market rose. Premier shares were down 0.6 percent.\nMyer shares have never traded over their A$4.10 issue price when the company was floated in 2009.
