It raised its dividend by 8.1 percent to 2 euros per share.\nEarlier, Publicis had said it had seen improved underlying sales growth in the second half and expected margins to improve, starting in 2018.\n“We’re not pretending that today’s results will satisfy the markets for the next 10 years,” Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun told reporters. “However, we think we’ve done some solid work here.”\nThat included 2.2 percent growth in fourth-quarter underlying sales buoyed by big accounts such as USAA, Wal-Mart and Hewlett-Packard, Sadoun said, on top of a contract with McDonald’s in partnership with IT consulting firm Capgemini .\nFor 2018, Publicis targets an operating margin rate above 2017’s 15.5 percent and underlying sales growth higher than last’s year’s 0.8 percent.\nThe operating target is lower than one it set in 2013 of 17.3-19.3 percent seen by 2018. That is because of the costs involved in integrating digital arm Publicis.Sapient, seen as a key driver for growth, as well as a push for increased collaboration among its many agencies.\nPublicis and peers WPP, Omnicom and Interpublic, which have all underperformed the leading stock indexes on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe big four face a growing threat from consultancies Accenture and Capgemini while data-driven tech giants such as Facebook and Alphabet’s Google have taken a big slice of the media space online.\nGlobal clients reviewing the effectiveness of their marketing budgets has prompted fierce competition among traditional advertisers.\nPublicis will detail its strategy and financial targets during an investor day to be held in London on March 20.\n$1 = 0.8176 euros Editing by G Crosse and Jason Neely\n ",
