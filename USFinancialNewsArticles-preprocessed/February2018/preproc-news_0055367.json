    "text": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 that ended on Tuesday, January 2, 2018. The fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results include one less operating week compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nTotal revenues declined 1.7% to $261.1 million (13 weeks vs. 14 weeks). The extra operating week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $21.3 million in sales. Excluding fiscal 2016’s extra operating week, fiscal 2017 total fourth quarter revenues increased approximately 6.9% compared to the same quarter last year. Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 6% (13 weeks vs. 13 weeks) Comparable restaurant sales increased 1.6% Net income and diluted net income per share were $23.5 million and $1.12, respectively, inclusive of a tax benefit of $15.7 million, or $0.75 diluted net income per share, from the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). Excluding the Tax Act benefit, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share were $7.8 million and $0.37, respectively.\nFiscal 2017 Highlights Compared to Fiscal 2016\nTotal revenues grew 3.9% to $1.0 billion (52 weeks vs. 53 weeks). The extra operating week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $21.3 million in sales last year. Excluding the extra operating week, total revenues increased approximately 6.2% compared to last year. Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 8% (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks) Comparable restaurant sales declined 0.7% Net income and diluted net income per share were $44.8 million and $2.06, respectively, inclusive of a tax benefit of $15.7 million, or $0.72 diluted net income per share, from the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding the Tax Act benefit as well as charges for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, severance related expenses resulting from a reorganization at the Company’s restaurant support center, and the write-off of the remaining net book value of certain convection ovens and point of sale terminals as a result of our new slow roasting oven and server handheld tablet rollouts, fiscal 2017 non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share were $30.8 million and $1.41, respectively.\n“BJ’s solid fourth quarter comparable restaurant sales growth of 1.6% and strong traffic gains of 0.7% highlight the ongoing progress and initial financial benefits from the sales driving initiatives implemented at the start of 2017,” commented Greg Trojan, CEO. “This past year we undertook a series of challenging initiatives to continue our quest to be the leading casual dining concept. Our team members embraced this challenge as they learned and mastered new cooking methods, became proficient at taking orders on hand held devices and re-organized their processes to bring efficiencies to our growing off-premise revenue stream. As our team members worked through these learning curves and our guests experienced BJ’s higher quality dining experience, our sales strengthened and continue to show momentum in early fiscal 2018.\n“Over the course of the year, our craveable, differentiated, high quality slow roast menu has become a guest favorite on weekends, while our daily Brewhouse Specials are contributing to meaningful mid-week sales growth. Consistent with our 2017 strategic priorities, we continued to grow our off premise channel in the fourth quarter through take-out, large party catering options and delivery. As a result, off premise sales grew at a healthy double digit pace in the fourth quarter and represented over 7% of our total sales, up from just 5.6% at the same time last year. As we move through 2018, I am extremely excited about our prospects to further perfect and optimize these platforms to drive additional top line sales and productivity throughout our entire business.”\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, BJ’s opened two new restaurants in Bowie, Maryland and Taylor, Michigan, thereby achieving its goal of opening 10 new restaurants in fiscal 2017. “As previously announced, the slower rate of expansion in fiscal 2017 allowed us to focus on our operational initiatives and to shift personnel resources towards sales and traffic building initiatives and financial resources to expanded returns of capital to shareholders,” Trojan continued. “Looking at fiscal 2018, we will continue harvesting the opportunities available to us from our new platforms while focusing on other sales building and profitability enhancements. As a result, we anticipate opening four to six new restaurants this year. Notwithstanding our 2018 expansion plans, with only 197 restaurants in 26 states currently open and an estimated national capacity for at least 425 BJ’s restaurants, we remain excited about the significant ongoing mid- and long-term growth opportunity for the BJ’s brand and concept. With our sales growth and profit building operating plan, prudent restaurant expansion strategy, and steady return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend, BJ’s is consistently executing on a range of initiatives to support our goal of further enhancing shareholder value.”\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 0.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $9.6 million. Since the Company’s first share repurchase authorization was approved in April 2014, BJ’s has repurchased and retired approximately 9.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $357.5 million and has reduced its outstanding share count approximately 31%. The Company currently has approximately $42.5 million available under its authorized $400 million share repurchase program.\nThe Company paid its first quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock on December 4, 2017, at a cost of approximately $2.3 million. On February 20, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock payable March 27, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2018. While the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, the dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared by the Board of Directors at its discretion.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nBJ’s Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings release today, February 22, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

Each of these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses. As a general matter, the Company uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of its core business. The Company believes that such non-GAAP adjusted financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze the Company’s results and in formulating estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP adjusted measures may result in confusion among analysts and others and a misplaced perception that the Company’s results have underperformed or exceeded expectations.\nThese non-GAAP adjusted financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company’s results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. However, these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the fourth quarter ended January 2, 2018, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share excludes the tax benefit resulting from changes in U.S. tax law.\nFor fiscal year 2017, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share excludes the write-off of the remaining net book value of certain convection ovens and point of sale terminals, as a result of our new slow roasting oven and server handheld tablet rollouts, natural disaster and related expense resulting from Hurricanes Harvey/Irma, as well as severance related expenses incurred to reorganize the Company’s restaurant support center, offset by the tax benefit resulting from changes in U.S. tax law. For fiscal year 2016, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net income per share excludes the settlement of a wage and hour claim.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures (Unaudited, dollars in thousands except for per share data) Fourth Quarter Ended January 2, 2018 January 3, 2017 $ % Per\nShare $ % Per\nShare Net income & diluted net income per share, as reported $ 23,486 9.0 % $ 1.12 $ 12,887 4.9 % $ 0.55 Re-measurement of net deferred tax liability to new corporate tax rate (15,705 ) (6.0 ) (0.75 ) - - - Non-GAAP adjusted net income & diluted net income per share $ 7,781 3.0 % $ 0.37 $ 12,887 4.9 % $ 0.55 Fiscal Year Ended January 2, 2018 January 3, 2017 $ % Per\nShare $ % Per\nShare Net income & diluted net income per share, as reported $ 44,780 4.3 % $ 2.06 $ 45,557 4.6 % $ 1.88 Loss on disposal and impairment of assets 1,426 0.1 0.07 - - - Natural disaster related expenses 905 0.1 0.04 - - - Severance related expenses 423 - 0.02 369 - 0.02 Income tax effect of reconciling items (1) (1,057 ) (0.1 ) (0.05 ) (139 ) - (0.01 ) Re-measurement of net deferred tax liability to new corporate tax rate (15,705 ) (1.5 ) (0.72 ) - - - Non-GAAP adjusted net income & diluted net income per share $ 30,772 3.0 % $ 1.41 $ 45,787 4.6 % $ 1.89 Per share amounts and percentages reflected above may not reconcile due to rounding.\nPercentages represent percent of total revenues.\n(1) The income tax effect of the reconciling items was calculated based on the change in the tax provision calculation after adjusting for the reconciling items.\nRestaurant Level Operating Margin\nRestaurant level operating margin, a Non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of cost of sales, labor and benefits, and occupancy and operating costs. This performance measure includes only the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company’s business, as detailed in the table below. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a supplemental measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other companies may calculate restaurant level margin differently than we do, restaurant level margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nA reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant level operating margin for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 2, 2018 and January 3, 2017 is set forth below:\nSupplemental Financial Information – Restaurant Level Operating Margin (Unaudited, dollars in thousands) Fourth Quarter Ended Fiscal Year Ended January 2,\n2018 January 3,\n2017 January 2,\n2018 January 3,\n2017 Income from operations $ 10,973 4.2 % $ 16,616 6.3 % $ 37,904 3.7 % $ 61,641 6.2 % General and administrative 13,911 5.3 14,356 5.4 55,447 5.4 55,406 5.6 Depreciation and amortization 17,434 6.7 16,345 6.2 68,665 6.7 64,275 6.5 Restaurant opening 668 0.3 1,761 0.7 3,873 0.4 6,977 0.7 Loss on disposal and impairment of assets 607 0.2 705 0.3 4,775 0.5 2,971 0.3 Natural disaster and related - - - - 905 0.1 - - Severance related expenses - - - - 423 - 369 - Restaurant level operating margin $ 43,593 16.7 % $ 49,783 18.7 % $ 171,992 16.7 % $ 191,639 19.3 % Percentages above represent percent of total revenues and may not reconcile due to rounding.\nSource:BJ's Restaurants, Inc.",
