I look forward to helping Wendy continue to foster an environment where our people can do their best work.\"\nUnder Clark's leadership as CEO of DDB North America, the agency has grown by enhancing existing relationships such as State Farm, Mars, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as a strong new business track record.

Her experience leading DDB North America coupled with her expertise as a leading marketer makes this a seamless leadership transition that will build upon DDB's capabilities and reputation as a leader in the business.\"\nClark joined the agency in 2016, from Coca-Cola North America, where she was President, Sparkling Brands and Strategic Marketing. Previously, she served as Senior Vice President, Global Sparkling Brand Center, where she was responsible for the global leadership of all Coca-Cola's Sparkling brands.
