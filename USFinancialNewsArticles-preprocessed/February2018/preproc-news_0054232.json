    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vince Holding Corp. (NYSE: VNCE), a leading global luxury apparel and accessories brand (“Vince” or the “Company”), today announced unaudited preliminary sales results for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018. For the quarter, net sales increased approximately 14.0% to $73.0 million, excluding an estimated $1.5 million from the 14 th week, compared to $63.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Direct-to-consumer segment sales increased approximately 17.5% to $34.5 million as compared to the same period last year, excluding sales from the 14 th week. Comparable sales increased approximately 16.1% on a 13-week basis, including e-commerce sales. Wholesale segment sales increased approximately 11.5% to $38.5 million as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The 14 th week had an immaterial impact on the wholesale segment.\nBrendan Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased to have delivered strong sales growth in the fourth quarter as our new product continued to resonate well with customers. We saw strong comparable sales performance in our direct-to-consumer business with double digit growth in both full price retail stores and our e-commerce business as well as higher full-price sell through. We believe we are making good progress in transitioning customers from the department store partners we exited to our own retail stores. In fact, the largest comparable sales increase was generated in stores located near locations that we exited. We also expect improvement in operating income versus last year, excluding potential asset impairment charges. We are highly encouraged by both our partner and customer response to product and will remain focused on driving forward with our strategic initiatives. We look forward to providing detailed fourth quarter results and our plans for fiscal 2018 on our fourth quarter conference call.”\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company plans to release fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results on or about Thursday, April 19, 2018 and host a conference call on that day at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss results.
