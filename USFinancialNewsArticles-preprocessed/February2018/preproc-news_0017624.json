    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 11:12 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Sprinter Levine suspended after failing drugs test Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British Olympic sprinter Nigel Levine has been provisionally suspended after for failing a drugs test, UK Athletics said on Wednesday. \nBritish media reported in December that Levine had tested positive for the banned asthma drug clenbuterol, which is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list. \nThe 28-year-old has not competed since he broke his pelvis in a serious motorbike crash in January last year, an accident which also involved compatriot James Ellington. \n“The provisional suspension was issued by UK Anti-Doping and is in accordance with IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) Anti-Doping Rules,” UK Athletics said in a statement. \n“The individual now has the opportunity to respond to the charge against him including the right to a full hearing of the case.” \nLevine, who specializes in the 400 metres, competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics and was part of the British squad that won relay gold at the 2014 European Championships in Zurich.
