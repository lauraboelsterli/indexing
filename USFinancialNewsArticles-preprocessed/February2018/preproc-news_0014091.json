    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Docutech, the leading provider of document, eSign, eClosing, and compliance technology for the mortgage, home equity and consumer lending industries, has named Amy Brandt as its new chief executive officer. Brandt, formerly president and chief operating officer (COO), will continue to serve as the company’s president and will assume the CEO role from founder Ty Jenkins, now the company’s chairman.\nBrandt’s appointment to CEO represents a key development in Docutech’s growth strategy. Recognizing the company’s long-standing document and compliance leadership position and potential for growth, Serent Capital, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, made an investment in Docutech in 2016. As part of a broader ownership structure, an Advisory Board was formed and collaborated in the selection of Amy Brandt as the company’s new CEO. In taking Docutech to the next level, Brandt will drive the company’s strategic vision and lead its growth initiatives by adding new products, entering new market segments and seeking strategic acquisitions.\nBrandt is a mortgage industry veteran who brings more than 20 years of expertise to the new role. Prior to joining Docutech last spring, she most recently served as president of originations and corporate technology at New Penn Financial, where she oversaw all origination channels, including direct-to-consumer products, third-party originations and retail. Prior to New Penn Financial, Brandt served as chief operating officer of Prospect Mortgage, where she enhanced day-to-day operations and transformed the lender’s technology infrastructure.\n“I couldn’t be more pleased to announce the appointment of Amy Brandt as Docutech’s new CEO,” said Ty Jenkins, Docutech’s founder and chairman. “Amy possesses the strategic vision, expertise, tenacity, and exemplary leadership qualities we were seeking for this role and it’s clear she has what it takes to lead Docutech in this exciting next chapter of growth and beyond.”\nIn addition to her executive career, Brandt is currently a board member of Sun to Water Technologies and a scholar rescue fund advisory board member of the Institute of International Education. She is a former board member of Source Corp Inc. and a former board member and capital founder of Bluebeam Software Inc. Amy is also the former chair of Your Music America and was a federal housing policy council member with the Financial Services Roundtable. Brandt holds a Juris Doctorate from Arizona State University College of Law and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Southern California.\n“I’m thrilled to be at Docutech’s helm during such an exciting time in our industry and to continue to evolve our world-class technology and solutions to transform the way lenders do business and serve their customers,” said Brandt. “I am truly honored to be a part of such an outstanding team that is well poised for success.”\nAbout Docutech\nFounded in 1991, Idaho Falls, Idaho- and Scottsdale, Arizona-based Docutech offers a wide range of document technology solutions for mortgage, home equity, and consumer lending from document generation to eDelivery, eSign, eClose and print fulfillment.
