(NYSE:EL) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company achieved net sales of $3.74 billion, an increase of 17%, compared with $3.21 billion in the prior-year quarter. Incremental sales from the Company’s acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the reported sales growth. Net earnings were $123 million, and include provisional one-time charges of $394 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that was signed into law in December 2017. On a diluted earnings per share basis, including the one-time charges and restructuring and other charges, the Company earned $.33. In the prior-year second quarter, the Company reported net earnings of $428 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.15.\nAdjusting for the restructuring and other charges and the impact of the TCJA provisional charges, diluted net earnings per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 25% to $1.52, and in constant currency rose 23%.\nFabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “In our second quarter we continued our strong momentum and generated stellar results. In constant currency, our sales grew 14%, led by exceptional strength in travel retail, global online and Asia, along with strong double-digit growth in several markets in Europe, including Italy and Benelux. We delivered double-digit sales gains across most product categories and many brands, including Estée Lauder, luxury brands and most mid-sized brands. In the holiday season, our brands achieved outstanding results from their e-commerce businesses, and customizable gift options were significant contributors. These elements, along with our accelerating cost saving efforts and our progress executing our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives, resulted in an impressive adjusted 23% earnings per share growth in constant currency.\n“Our strong results, combined with future benefits we expect from the passage of the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further enhance our ability to strategically invest in faster-growing areas of prestige beauty to attract new consumers. Our strategy is sound and effective, and we have the brands, resources and talent to continue above-industry growth in our second half and full fiscal year. We have confidence in our outlook and are raising our full-year constant currency sales growth forecast to between 10% and 11% and increasing our constant currency earnings per share growth estimate, to 19% to 20%, before restructuring charges and the impact of one-time tax act items.”\nThe second quarter provision for income taxes included the following amounts related to the TCJA. These amounts, which are provisional, may require adjustments as anticipated guidance is issued and as additional analysis of the provisions of the TCJA is completed:\n$325 million charge related to a tax on historical foreign earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S. (Transition Tax). $51 million charge related to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets at the lower statutory rate. $18 million charge to reflect the establishment of a net deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriation of certain foreign earnings. The Company’s reported effective tax rate in the fiscal 2018 second quarter is approximately 82%. The effective tax rate excluding the impact of the Transition Tax, the revaluation of U.S. net deferred tax assets, the net deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes related to the planned repatriation of certain foreign earnings and restructuring and other charges would have been approximately 24%.\nExcluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 14%. For the quarter, the positive impact of foreign currency translation on diluted net earnings per common share was $.03.\nDuring the fiscal 2018 second quarter, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $69 million ($55 million after tax), equal to $.15 per diluted share, in connection with its previously announced Leading Beauty Forward initiative. During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $41 million ($26 million after tax), equal to $.07 per diluted share. Information about GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation information, is included in this release.\nReconciliation between GAAP and\nnon-GAAP\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDecember 31\nNet Sales Growth Diluted EPS Growth Diluted Earnings\nPer Share\n(Unaudited) Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\nReported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2017 2016 Results including restructuring and other\ncharges and the TCJA charges\n17 % (1) 14 % (72 )% (1) (74 )% $.33 (1) $1.15 (1)\nNon-GAAP\nRestructuring and other charges .15 .07 Transition Tax resulting from the TCJA .86 Remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax\nassets resulting from the TCJA\n.14 Net deferred tax liability related to certain foreign\nwithholding taxes on planned repatriation\nresulting from the TCJA\n.05 Adjusted results 17 % 14 % 25\n% 23\n% 1.52 $1.22 Impact of foreign currency on earnings per share\n(.03 ) Constant currency earnings per share $1.49\n(1) Represents GAAP.\nAmounts may not sum due to rounding.\nResults by Product Category\nThree Months Ended December 31 (Unaudited; Dollars in millions) Net Sales Percent Change Operating\nIncome (Loss)\nPercent\nChange\n2017 2016 Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2017 2016 Reported\nBasis\nSkin Care $ 1,494 $ 1,248 20 % 17 % $ 453 $ 351 29 % Makeup 1,515 1,306 16 13 219 221 (1 ) Fragrance 565 497 14 10 85 69 23 Hair Care 144 137 5 4 17 13 31 Other 26 20 30 30 5 4 25 Subtotal 3,744 3,208 17 14 779 658 18 Charges associated with\nrestructuring and other activities.\n— — (69 ) (41 ) Total $ 3,744 $ 3,208 17 % 14 % $ 710 $ 617 15 % Net sales and operating income in the Company’s major product categories were favorably impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies. Total operating income in constant currency, before charges, increased 14%.\nSkin Care\nNet sales increased sharply, with exceptional double-digit gains from Estée Lauder, La Mer, Origins and GLAMGLOW, and strong growth from Clinique. The Estée Lauder brand grew globally, particularly in China and travel retail, due largely to the continued success of the recently launched Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix and gains in other Advanced Night Repair products. La Mer was driven by the success of new products in its Genaissance collection, the launch of The Moisturizing Matte Lotion, gains from existing products, and targeted expanded consumer reach. Origins generated sales growth in every region, particularly Asia, as well as in travel retail due to the continued success of several product lines in the facial mask and moisturizer sub-categories. Sales gains from GLAMGLOW reflected additional product assortments and targeted expanded consumer reach. Clinique’s sales gains reflected increases in the brand’s Moisture Surge product line. These increases were partially offset by lower skin care sales from Aveda, which faced an unfavorable comparison to the prior-year period due to the launch of the brand’s Tulasara line of products. Operating income increased sharply, primarily from the Company’s heritage brands and La Mer, reflecting higher sales.\nMakeup\nStrong sales growth in makeup was primarily driven by incremental sales from the Company’s fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, exceptionally strong double-digit increases from Tom Ford, and strong double-digit gains from Estée Lauder. Higher makeup sales were also generated from M•A•C. Sales from Tom Ford were driven primarily by strength in the eyeshadow and lip color sub-categories. At Estée Lauder, higher sales were fueled by the Double Wear foundation and Pure Color lip product lines. The higher sales from M•A•C were due to strong growth in the Asia/Pacific region, particularly China and Hong Kong, and in travel retail, as well as success in the specialty-multi channel in the United States. These increases were partially offset by lower makeup sales in the United States, reflecting slow foot traffic in some U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Makeup operating income was flat. Growth from Clinique, Estée Lauder and M•A•C was primarily due to higher sales. Lower results were reported primarily from Too Faced, reflecting additional investments behind targeted expanded consumer reach internationally, and from Smashbox.\nFragrance\nNet sales increased, primarily due to strong double-digit gains from our luxury brands and Estée Lauder. Jo Malone delivered outstanding double-digit growth in travel retail and generated sales increases in every region, with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia/Pacific, reflecting strong growth from existing fragrances, targeted expanded consumer reach and the recent launch of the English Oak fragrances. Increased sales from Tom Ford reflect, in part, the continued success of the Private Blend line of fragrances, including new product launches and growth from existing fragrances. Le Labo, By Kilian and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle each benefitted from growth in existing products and new launches and targeted expanded consumer reach. Higher fragrance sales from Estée Lauder were driven by the timing of and strong demand for holiday gift sets. Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of certain designer fragrances. Fragrance operating income increased sharply, reflecting higher sales from Jo Malone, Estée Lauder and Tom Ford, as well as disciplined expense management.\nHair Care\nHair care sales rose reflecting gains from Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda grew, driven by solid performance in the online channel, while growth from Bumble and bumble was driven by the launch of the brand in Ulta Beauty. Partially offsetting the sales growth was softness in the salon channel, which impacted both brands, and lower sales in freestanding stores for Aveda. Hair care operating income increased, reflecting higher sales and disciplined expense management.\nResults by Geographic Region\nThree Months Ended December 31 (Unaudited; Dollars in millions) Net Sales Percent Change Operating\nIncome (Loss)\nPercent\nChange\n2017 2016 Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2017 2016 Reported\nBasis\nThe Americas $ 1,308 $ 1,242 5 % 5 % $ 98 $ 86 14 % Europe, the Middle East & Africa. 1,562 1,307 20 15 463 412 12 Asia/Pacific 874 659 33 30 218 160 36 Subtotal 3,744 3,208 17 14 779 658 18 Charges associated with\nrestructuring and other activities.\n— — (69 ) (41 ) Total $ 3,744 $ 3,208 17 % 14 % $ 710 $ 617 15 % Net sales and operating income outside the United States were favorably impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to most currencies.\nThe Americas\nSales in North America benefited from incremental sales from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA and growth from several other brands, reflecting demand for our products, including successful holiday gift sets. La Mer generated strong double-digit sales gains in skin care, while in the Estée Lauder brand strong sales growth was primarily in fragrance and skin care. Sales in the Company’s online and specialty-multi channels grew strong double-digits. Sales decreases were recorded in several brands, primarily attributable to the decline in retail traffic in some U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. On a reported basis, sales in Canada and Latin America increased double-digits. In constant currency, sales in Canada rose mid-single digits and Latin America increased high-single digits. Operating income in the Americas increased, primarily reflecting higher operating results from certain heritage brands as well as disciplined expense management. Partially offsetting the higher results were lower results from M•A•C, Tom Ford and certain designer fragrances, due to a decrease in sales. Operating income also reflects additional support spending behind new and existing launches at Too Faced.\nEurope, the Middle East & Africa\nThe Company generated strong sales growth in the region both on a reported basis and in constant currency. Contributing to the growth was strong double-digit sales gains in travel retail, Italy, Benelux and India, and strong increases in several emerging markets such as Russia and Turkey. Foreign currency translation increased reported sales by 5%, with the largest impact from the United Kingdom and Italy. In travel retail, double-digit sales growth was generated across most brands, led by Estée Lauder, Tom Ford, M•A•C, Jo Malone and La Mer. Growth in global airline passenger traffic, particularly by Chinese travelers, solid new launch initiatives, and targeted expanded consumer reach contributed to the sales gains. Lower sales were posted in the Middle East, driven by retailer inventory rebalancing, reflecting the impact of the macro-environment on consumer purchases. In constant currency, Germany and Switzerland recorded lower sales. Operating income increased, primarily due to strong double-digit operating results in travel retail. Certain developed and emerging markets also contributed to the higher profits. The gains were partially offset by lower results in the United Kingdom, Germany and France.\nAsia/Pacific\nOn a reported basis and in constant currency, sales increased sharply, led by strong double-digit growth in China, Hong Kong and Thailand, and strong gains in Taiwan and Japan. The higher sales in China reflected strong double-digit gains in every brand except designer fragrances. Estée Lauder, M•A•C, La Mer, Tom Ford and Jo Malone led the sales growth. Sales benefitted, in part, from continued demand for makeup products, acceleration in skin care and targeted expanded consumer reach. The Company generated double-digit sales growth in every channel, particularly in department stores and online. The sales increase in Hong Kong reflected solid domestic growth and a rise in tourism. Most brands generated strong double-digit growth, primarily Estée Lauder, La Mer, M•A•C and Tom Ford. In Asia/Pacific, operating income increased significantly, primarily due to improved results in China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Taiwan driven by higher sales.\nSix-Month Results\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net sales of $7.02 billion, a 16% increase compared with $6.07 billion in the comparable prior-year period. The Company’s fiscal 2017 second quarter acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 3 percentage points of incremental sales to the Company’s overall sales growth. Net earnings were $550 million, and include provisional one-time charges of $394 million related to the TCJA. On a diluted earnings per share basis, including the one-time charges and restructuring and other charges, the Company earned $1.46. In the prior-year six months, the Company reported net earnings of $722 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.94. Adjusting for the restructuring and other charges and the impact of the TCJA provisional charges, diluted net earnings per common share for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.73, and in constant currency rose 30%. The fiscal 2018 six months also includes the impact of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement for share-based compensation, which added $.06 to diluted earnings per share. See note C on page 12. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, net sales increased 14%. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, the positive impact of foreign currency translation on diluted net earnings per common share was $.05. During the six-months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $107 million ($81 million after tax), equal to $.22 per diluted share, in connection with its previously announced Leading Beauty Forward initiative. The prior-period six-month results include charges of $72 million ($46 million after tax), equal to $.12 per share.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1.45 billion, compared with $824 million in the prior year. The change primarily reflected higher earnings before income taxes and an increase in other accrued and noncurrent liabilities and changes in deferred income taxes, due largely to the impact of the TCJA provisional charges, which lowered net earnings. These charges had no impact on the Company’s reported cash flows from operations for the six months ended December 31, 2017.\nOutlook for Fiscal 2018 Third Quarter and Full Year\nGlobal prestige beauty is vibrant and is estimated to accelerate to growth of about 5% during the year. The Company’s annual growth has consistently outpaced global prestige beauty and is expected to grow more than double the industry for fiscal 2018. The Company expects its sales growth to benefit from loyalty to our high-quality products, strong innovation, outreach to new target consumers and growth from recent acquisitions, while continuing to emphasize a digital-first marketing approach and a strong focus on fast-growing markets and channels as consumer preferences evolve.\nWe are mindful of risks related to social and political issues, geopolitical tensions, terrorism, currency volatility and economic challenges affecting consumer spending in certain countries and travel corridors. The Company is also cautious of the decline in retail traffic, primarily related to some brick-and-mortar stores in the United States.\nThe six-month benefit ($.06 per share) of a new accounting standard related to the excess tax benefits for share-based compensation is included in the Company’s full-year estimate. However, the Company is not forecasting the potential impact for the remainder of the year, as any additional impact could fluctuate depending on its stock price, the timing and level of employee stock option exercises and applicable tax rates.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018\nReported net sales are forecasted to increase between 12.5% and 13.5% versus the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation is expected to positively impact sales by approximately 2.5% versus the prior-year period. Net sales are forecasted to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency. The Company’s fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA are forecasted to contribute approximately 2 percentage points of incremental sales to the Company’s overall sales growth. Reported diluted net earnings per share are projected to be between $2.79 and $2.88. The provision for income taxes includes $394 million, equal to $1.05 per diluted common share of one-time charges under the TCJA. For the full fiscal year, the Company expects the global effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, before charges associated with restructuring and other activities, and the impact of the TCJA provisional charges. The Company expects to take charges associated with previously approved restructuring and other activities in fiscal 2018 of approximately $195 million to $215 million, equal to $.39 to $.43 per diluted common share. Diluted net earnings per share before charges associated with restructuring and other activities, and the impact of the TCJA provisional charges are projected to be between $4.27 and $4.32. The positive currency impact on the sales growth equates to about $.15 of earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, before charges associated with restructuring and other activities, and the impact of the TCJA provisional charges, diluted earnings per share are expected to increase between 19% and 20%.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018\nReported net sales are forecasted to increase between 12% and 13% versus the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation is expected to positively impact sales by approximately 3% versus the prior-year period. Net sales are forecasted to grow between 9% and 10% in constant currency. Reported diluted net earnings per share are projected to be between $.89 and $.92. The Company expects to take charges associated with previously approved restructuring and other activities in its fiscal 2018 third quarter of approximately $60 million to $65 million, equal to $.12 to $.13 per diluted common share. Diluted net earnings per share before charges associated with restructuring and other activities are projected to be between $1.02 and $1.04. The positive currency impact on the sales growth equates to about $.06 of earnings per share. On a constant currency basis, before charges associated with restructuring and other activities, diluted earnings per share are expected to increase between 7% and 9%.\nReconciliation between GAAP and\nnon-GAAP\nThree Months Ending March 31, 2018 (F) Three Months March 31 Net Sales Growth Diluted EPS Growth Diluted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited) Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\nReported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2018 (F) 2017 Forecast / actual results including\nrestructuring and other charges and\nadjustments\n12-13 % (1)\n9-10\n%\n11-15\n% (1)\n4-8\n% $.89-$.92 (1) $.80 (1)\nNon-GAAP\nRestructuring and other charges .12-.13 .11 Contingent consideration (.01 ) Forecast / actual results excluding charges 12-13 % 9-10 % 13-16 % 7-9 % 1.02-1.04 $.90 Impact of foreign currency on earnings per share\n(.06 ) Forecasted constant currency earnings per share\n$.96-$.98 Reconciliation between GAAP and\nnon-GAAP\nYear Ending June 30, 2018 (F) Twelve Months June 30 Net Sales Growth Diluted EPS Growth Diluted Earnings Per Share (Unaudited) Reported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\nReported\nBasis\nConstant\nCurrency\n2018 (F) 2017 Forecast / actual results including\nrestructuring and other charges, the TCJA\ncharges, and adjustments\n12.5-13.5 % (1) 10-11 % (17)-(14) % (1) (21)-(18) % $2.79-$2.88 (1) $3.35 (1) Non-GAAP\nRestructuring and other charges .39-.43 .38 Contingent consideration (.12 ) Transition Tax resulting from the TCJA .86 Remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets resulting from the TCJA\n.14 Net deferred tax liability related to certain\nforeign withholding taxes on planned\nrepatriation resulting from the TCJA\n.05 Intangible asset impairments .06 China deferred tax asset valuation allowance\nreversal\n(.20 ) Forecast / actual results adjusted 12.5-13.5 % 10-11 % 23-24 % 19-20 % 4.27-4.32 $3.47 Impact of foreign currency on earnings per share\n(.15 ) Forecasted constant currency earnings per share\n$4.12-$4.17\n(1) Represents GAAP.\n(F) Represents forecast.\nConference Call\nThe Estée Lauder Companies will host a conference call at 9:30 a.m. (ET) today, February 2, 2018 to discuss its results.

The Company expects Leading Beauty Forward will result in related restructuring and other charges totaling between $600 million and $700 million, before taxes. Once fully implemented, Leading Beauty Forward is expected to yield annual net benefits of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes, of which a portion is expected to be reinvested in future growth initiatives.

During the six months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $4 million of such expense. (C) During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company adopted a new accounting standard for share-based compensation that requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation awards be recorded as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. As a result of the adoption of this new standard, the Company recognized $1 million and $24 million of excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. This reduced the effective rate for income taxes by 190 basis points and added approximately $.06 to diluted net earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2017.\n(D) The three and six months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rate, as well as provisional amounts for the impact of the TCJA. During the second quarter, the Company recorded a charge of $325 million, equal to $.86 per common share attributable to the Transition Tax, a $51 million charge, equal to $.14 per common share related to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets, and an $18 million charge, equal to $.05 per common share to record a net deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. These amounts, which are provisional, may require adjustments as anticipated guidance is issued and as additional analysis of the provisions of the TCJA is completed.
