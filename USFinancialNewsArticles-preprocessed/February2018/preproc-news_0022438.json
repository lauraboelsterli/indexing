We are delighted to have gained a seasoned markets and cyber-security expert, who has implemented information security programs across heavily dynamic and regulated environments,\" Frank added.\nMr. Rajan earned his Bachelor Degree from Rutgers College, Rutgers University and holds an MBA from the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.\nAbout CAT NMS, LLC\nCAT NMS, LLC was formed by the national securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
