Have a look at the last few hours of trading on S&P 500 futures: (Julien Ponthus) EARLY MORNING EUROPEAN HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0715 GMT) As some calm looks set to return to the market today, corporate news is again in the spotlight with some earnings beats from Statoil, ABN Amro and Aker possibly providing support. Also in focus is Tesco after the BBC reported that the retailer is facing Britain's largest ever equal pay claim from women and a possible bill of up to 4 billion pounds. Here's your early morning headline round-up with links to the full stories.

Traders, however, don't rule out there could be further turbulence ahead. Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) EUROPEAN EARNINGS: BEATS LAG TYPICAL QUARTER, BUT REVENUES AHEAD (0637 GMT) The latest Thomson Reuters Earnings Outlook report for the pan-European STOXX 600 index is out, showing how fourth-quarter earning beats so far are lagging the typical quarter, while revenue beats are ahead. As a result earnings growth forecasts for the quarter have been revised downwards.

Excluding the Energy sector, earnings are expected to increase 7.9%. * Fourth quarter revenue is expected to increase 1.5% from Q4 2016. Excluding the Energy sector, earnings are expected to increase 0.6%. * 85 companies in the STOXX 600 have reported earnings to date for Q4 2017. Of these, 48.2% reported results exceeding analyst estimates. In a typical quarter 50% beat analyst EPS estimates. * 89 companies in the STOXX 600 have reported revenue to date for Q4 2017. Of these, 57.3% reported revenue exceeding analyst estimates. In a typical quarter 54% beat analyst revenue estimates. * During the week of Feb. 12, 33 STOXX 600 companies are expected to report quarterly earnings. (Danilo Masoni)",
