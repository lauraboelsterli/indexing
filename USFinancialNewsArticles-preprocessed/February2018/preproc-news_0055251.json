    "text": "CINCINNATI and GREENSBURG, Ind., First Financial Bancorp (NASDAQ: FFBC) and MainSource Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFG) today announced the receipt of regulatory approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to move forward with the proposed merger of MainSource Financial Group, Inc. (MainSource) into First Financial Bancorp (First Financial). The Ohio Division of Financial Institutions approved the proposed merger in January 2018.\nThe official closing of the merger transaction is scheduled for April 1, 2018, when the two banks will legally become one company. While MainSource will officially be First Financial Bank at that time, it is business as usual for associates and clients of each bank until the transition weekend targeted later in the second quarter, at which time MainSource Bank's operating systems will convert and its branches will be branded as First Financial Bank branches.\n\"We are extremely pleased that the final step of merging our two banks is now a reality. The integration process is underway and we are excited to continue the First Financial brand as a combined financial institution to better serve our clients and communities,\" said Claude E. Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Financial.\nAbout First Financial\nFirst Financial Bancorp is a Cincinnati, Ohio based bank holding company.

Such statements include, but are not limited to, certain plans, expectations, goals, projections and benefits relating to the proposed merger (the \"Merger\") between MainSource Financial Group (\"MainSource\") and First Financial Bancorp (\"First Financial\"), which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties.

Please refer to each of MainSource's and First Financial's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as their other filings with the SEC, for a more detailed discussion of risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead express only management's beliefs regarding future results or events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the management's control.
