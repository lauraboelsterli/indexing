    "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, announced today that Kevin Gregoire will join the company in April as Group President overseeing its Enterprise Market Group (EMG) for North America. Brian Boruff, former EMG leader, has been tapped to expand Blackbaud's Partner Ecosystem & Global Alliances business.\nGregoire joins Blackbaud with more than 20 years of leadership experience in the software industry with responsibilities spanning product management, business development, sales, support and more. He is a 16-year veteran of Fiserv, a global provider of financial services technology solutions, where he played a leadership role in the company's growth.\nMost recently at Fiserv, Gregoire had full P&L accountability for one of the company's operating groups and was responsible for a portfolio of businesses as a Group President. Under his leadership, the business achieved revenue growth while optimizing technology platforms and expanding customer support. During his tenure at Fiserv, Gregoire served in other key leadership roles including Division President and Chief Operating Officer, Card Services, and Senior Vice President of Product and Network Strategy.\n\"Blackbaud serves many of the world's largest, most recognized enterprise social good brands,\" said Mike Gianoni, president & CEO of Blackbaud. \"We see it as our responsibility to not only help customers achieve digital transformation, but also to partner with them to achieve measurable mission impact every day. Kevin Gregoire knows how to do this well; bringing deep acumen in the software industry and an understanding of what it truly takes to build a world-class customer experience. He's the right leader at the right time to lead our enterprise business to new levels of customer satisfaction and growth.\"\nGregoire is also a veteran of the United States Army, where he served as Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers and was awarded three Army Commendation Medals. He has a BS from the United States Military Academy at West Point, and a MBA from the F.W. Olin School of Business at Babson College. Gregoire will report directly to President and CEO Mike Gianoni and will serve on the company's executive leadership team.\n\"One constant we can count on is that the digital landscape is changing rapidly, and all companies and organizations need a thoughtful strategy to consume this change in an agile and flexible way or they risk being left behind,\" said Gregoire. \"Social good organizations deserve the same kind of innovation, partnership and transformation support as for-profit players, and Blackbaud completely gets that. I've never encountered a company with a staff so completely obsessed with driving global good. That, along with a relentless focus on innovation, is an incredible combination. I look forward to joining the team and unlocking new ways to help enterprise organizations thrive in their work to change the world.\"\nWith this announcement, Brian Boruff, former head of EMG, will transition to build and lead Blackbaud's Partner Ecosystem and Global Alliances business, continuing to report directly to Mike Gianoni as a member of the company's Executive Leadership Team. This change will put a higher emphasis on the growing partner program at Blackbaud and on high impact partnerships like the expanded Microsoft partnership announced in the fall .\n\"As we work to power an ecosystem of good in a cloud context, the role of partners has become even more critical\", said Gianoni. \"From ensuring a robust partner program for those who sell and service our solutions, to expanding resources for tech providers who leverage our open REST APIs to complement our offerings, to forming strategic global alliances with like-minded industry leaders, we can create a network effect that strengthens the entire social economy at a greater speed and scale than we could do on our own. Brian's extensive experience leading at software industry players with thriving partner ecosystems made him the ideal fit to re-envision and build this critical business.\"\nFor more about Blackbaud's Executive Leadership Team, visit www.blackbaud.com/company/executive-leadership.aspx .\nAbout Blackbaud\nBlackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB ) is the world's leading cloud software company powering social good.
