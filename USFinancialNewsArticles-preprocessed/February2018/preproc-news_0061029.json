    "text": "BALTIMORE, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBGI), the \"Company\" or \"Sinclair,\" today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n\"As we begin 2018, there are many positive events we are looking forward to driving value for the Company and the industry,\" commented David Smith, Executive Chairman of Sinclair. \"Among them are the Federal Communications Commission's approval of ATSC 3.0 (the Next Generation Broadcast Platform) and certain deregulatory rulemakings relating to local market and national ownership rules, both of which are important for the broadcast industry's long-term outlook. We are confident the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation will result in a favorable effect through the many small and medium sized local businesses we support on the advertising front. Meanwhile, we continue to work with the required governmental agencies towards the successful acquisition of Tribune Media Company, expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\"\nCEO Comment:\n\"The fourth quarter 2017 performance was better than expected with results that exceeded our previously provided guidance for key financial metrics, after adjusting for transaction, legal and other one-time charges,\" commented Chris Ripley, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"While first quarter of 2018 is off to a slower than expected start due to our low percentage of NBC affiliates which is the network that aired the Super Bowl and Olympics, we are looking forward to growth drivers from the upcoming mid-term elections and the positive effects from tax reform and a growing economy.\"\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results:\nTotal revenues decreased 8.0% to $734.0 million, versus $797.7 million in the prior year period which included $113 million of political advertising in the 2016 presidential election year. Operating income was $357.6 million, including $15 million of transaction, legal and other one-time costs, and $9 million in one-time bonuses to our employees as a result of favorable tax reform legislation, versus operating income of $233.4 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to the Company was $443.5 million versus net income of $120.9 million in the prior year period, including a $272 million non-recurring tax benefit related to re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a $225 million gain recognized for vacating spectrum in certain markets. Diluted earnings per common share was $4.32 as compared to $1.32 in the prior year period.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results:\nTotal revenues declined 0.1% to $2.734 billion, versus $2.737 billion in the prior year period which included $199 million of political advertising in the 2016 presidential election year. Operating income was $737.5 million, including $38 million of transaction, legal, one-time tax reform bonuses, spectrum auction costs and other one-time costs, versus operating income of $602.9 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to the Company was $576.0 million versus net income of $245.3 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per common share was $5.72 as compared to $2.60 in the prior year period.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Operating Highlights:\nMedia revenues, before barter, decreased 5.7% to $685.4 million versus $726.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Political revenues were $16 million in the fourth quarter versus $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a presidential election year. Revenues from our digital businesses increased 64%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Market share, excluding political, was approximately flat in the fourth quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRecent Corporate Developments:\nAcquisitions:\nThe Company expects to close its announced acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Tribune Media Company (\"Tribune\") in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the FCC and antitrust clearance. In December 2017, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. (\"STG\"), raised $3.725 billion of new term B loans maturing 2024 and priced at LIBOR plus 2.50%. The proceeds from the term B loans, which will be drawn at closing, are expected to be used to purchase the outstanding shares of Tribune, refinance certain of Tribune's existing indebtedness, pay costs and expenses expected to be incurred in connection with the acquisition, and for general corporate purposes.\nContent and Distribution:\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into multi-year affiliation renewals with NBC in three markets. The affiliations renewed were for KSNV in Las Vegas NV, WJAC in Johnstown PA, and WTOV in Wheeling WV. Additionally, NBC also renewed an affiliation with KRNV in Reno, NV that Sinclair provides sales and other services to under a joint sales agreement. In January 2018, the Company entered into multi-year affiliation renewals with ABC that extend affiliations across all Sinclair stations to 2022. Additionally, ABC also agreed to an extension of all affiliations with ABC affiliated stations that Sinclair provides sales and other services to under joint sales agreements. In January 2018, the Company entered into a multi-year retransmission renewal with Verizon Fios for the carriage of Sinclair stations on its platforms. In December 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative (\"NCTC\"), which allows NCTC's member companies to opt into a multi-year retransmission consent agreement. ­­86% of NCTC's members, which are in Sinclair markets, opted into this agreement. The agreement also provides for carriage of Sinclair-owned Tennis Channel and Comet. In January 2018, the Company and Sorenson Media Group entered into the first large-scale addressable advertising agreement whereby the two companies will sell targeted ads via smart TVs. In February 2018, the Company entered into a multi-year renewal with Nielsen Holdings for TV ratings services. In February 2018, the CW Network announced it will expand its prime-time schedule to include Sunday nights beginning Fall 2018.\nATSC 3.0:\nIn January 2018, John Hane was named President of Spectrum Co, LLC (\"Spectrum Co\"), the ATSC 3.0 spectrum consortium founded by Sinclair and Nexstar Media Group, Inc., and for which Univision Local Media, Inc. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to join. Spectrum Co's focus is on advancing the promotion of spectrum efficiency, innovation and monetization in today's multi-platform environment. In January 2018, Sinclair, Nexstar, Univision and American Tower announced the first domestic deployment of the Next Gen TV standard and a single-frequency network in Dallas, TX. The deployment will involve multiple stations, Next Gen TV program transmissions and simulcasts on 1.0 host stations using customized channel sharing agreements for mobile, customized programming and other data-use cases enabled by the ATSC 3.0 standard. In January 2018, the Company and SK Telecom entered into a MOU for the development of systems to allow the convergence of NextGen and 5G data delivery.\nCommunity:\nIn February, Sinclair opened its Broadcast Diversity Scholarship for applications. Sinclair has distributed over $70,000 in financial assistance to students demonstrating a promising future in the broadcast industry.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights:\nDebt on the balance sheet, net of $681 million in cash and cash equivalents, was $3.367 billion at December 31, 2017 versus net debt of $3.453 billion at September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, 76.1 million Class A common shares and 25.7 million Class B common shares were outstanding, for a total of 101.8 million common shares outstanding. In December 2017, the Company paid a $0.18 per share quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders. Routine capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $26 million with another $2 million related to the spectrum repack. Program contract payments were $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNotes:\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial information to conform to the presentation in the current year.\nOutlook:\nThe following transactions closed during 2016 or 2017 and, therefore, the results of these transactions were not included in the corresponding pre-transaction periods: the acquisition of the South Bend station and sale of the Marquette station (February 15, 2016); the acquisition of Tennis Channel (March 1, 2016); the acquisition of the Lincoln stations (May 1, 2016); the acquisition of the Salt Lake City station, KJZZ (IND) (June 17, 2016); the swap of the ABC and CW affiliates in Peoria for the Fox affiliate in South Bend (August 1, 2016); the acquisition of Tennis Media Company (March 1, 2017); the acquisition of DataSphere (June 1, 2017); the sale of Alarm Funding (March 7, 2017); the conversion of ASN to a joint venture with Silver Chalice and 120 Sports (April 13, 2017); and the purchase of Bonten and Esteem Broadcasting by the Company and Cunningham, respectively (September 1, 2017).\nThe Company currently expects to achieve the following results for the three months ending March 31, 2018 and twelve months ending December 31, 2018.

Embedded in the anticipated 2018 results are: Approximately $8 million in political revenues as compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2017 $4 million of trade revenue as compared to $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.
