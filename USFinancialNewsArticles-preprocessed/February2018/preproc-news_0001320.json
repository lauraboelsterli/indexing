    "text": "Published: Feb 1, 2018 2:11 p.m. ET Share \nSubscription revenue helped power strong results for parent Time Warner as it prepares for a court battle over sale to AT&T HBO Shailene Woodley (left), Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in HBO’s hit show “Big Little Lies.” \nBy Joe Flint \nHBO posted its best year of subscriber growth as streaming customers more than doubled, helping to drive revenue and profit increases at parent company Time Warner Inc. \nStrong gains at both HBO and the Turner cable networks helped Time Warner TWX, +1.73% boost revenue and income more than analysts predicted. The company’s revenue rose 9% to $8.6 billion and operating income gained 13% to $1.9 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31. \nHBO’s direct-to-consumer subscriptions, which include HBO Now sign-ups through internet-based distributors like Amazon and DirecTV Now, have topped five million in the U.S., according to an HBO executive. That is a significant jump from the more than two million domestic streaming customers that Time Warner had disclosed in February 2017. \nAcross all of its offerings, HBO added five million domestic subscribers in 2017, its biggest year ever, and subscriber revenue climbed 11%, the strongest growth in 20 years.",
