    "text": "WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer welcomes Eric Mahr, most recently Director of Litigation of the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice, as its newest partner. Eric, who joins Freshfields’ Washington, DC office, will bolster the firm’s market-leading antitrust practice with his decades of experience in antitrust litigation, including cartel follow-on litigation, commercial civil antitrust litigation and merger litigation.\nThis press release features multimedia.

He joined the DOJ following 16 years in the antitrust litigation practice at WilmerHale, where he was a partner. During his time at that firm, Eric established himself in the uppermost echelon of the antitrust litigation field, earning national and international recognition for the breadth of his experience and expertise.\nAt Freshfields, Eric will enhance the firm’s global antitrust offering by adding to its US antitrust litigation capabilities, representing clients in litigation that arises from regulatory investigations, including merger investigations.\n“When it comes to US antitrust litigators, there’s quite simply nobody else who offers the track record that Eric has, and nobody else who can offer our clients in the US and around the world as deep a level of hands-on knowledge,” said Peter Lyons, US Regional Managing Partner at Freshfields. “It’s my pleasure to welcome him to the firm.”\n“As the appetite for antitrust litigation continues, clients seek our expertise to ensure their defense strategies are coordinated across key jurisdictions around the globe. Eric’s unsurpassed skill set further strengthens our US antitrust litigation practice and ensures our worldwide antitrust offering is in a class of its own,” said Thomas Janssens, global head of Freshfields’ antitrust, competition and trade group.\n“Eric joining the Freshfields partnership significantly enhances our global antitrust litigation capabilities, particularly when combined with our first-rate international and US antitrust practice and global antitrust litigation group. His litigation credentials are without peer, and having him on board in the US will augment the full-service legal offering we can provide our global clients,” said David Scott, global head of dispute resolution for Freshfields.\n“Throughout my career, my two greatest interests – international antitrust and US litigation – have always been in some tension with one another; Freshfields provides the unique opportunity finally to bring them together. I have admired the Freshfields competition practice since my four years based in Brussels and I am honoured to have the opportunity to join this extraordinary team,” said Eric.\nNotes for editors\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is a global law firm with a long-standing track record of successfully supporting the world's leading national and multinational corporations, financial institutions and governments on ground-breaking and business-critical mandates.
