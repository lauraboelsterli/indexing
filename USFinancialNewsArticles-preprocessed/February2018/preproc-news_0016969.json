Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Wales vs Scotland - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - February 3, 2018 Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend before the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers \nSean Maitland was chosen at wing to replace Byron McGuigan, who suffered a hamstring injury in the Cardiff encounter, and Pete Horne, who scored Scotland’s only try in the match, takes the place of Chris Harris at inside centre. \n“We are looking forward to putting in a performance that can energise our supporters,” said Townsend. \n“To do that we need to out-work the opposition and be more accurate in a number of aspects of our play. \n“We’ve seen a response from the players in training this week and that needs to continue into and through the 80-plus minutes of the match because France will pose a massive and immensely-physical challenge.” \nScotland, who were easily blown away by Wales, had been hoping to continue their good form from November’s internationals where they scored a half century of points against Australia and came close to upsetting world champions New Zealand. \nTeam:15-Stuart Hogg, 14-Tommy Seymour, 13-Huw Jones, 12-Pete Horne, 11-Sean Maitland, 10-Finn Russell, 9-Greig Laidlaw, 8-Ryan Wilson, 7-Hamish Watson, 6-John Barclay (captain), 5-Jonny Gray, 4-Grant Gilchrist, 3-Simon Berghan, 2-Stuart McInally, 1-Gordon Reid Replacements: 16-Scott Lawson, 17-Jamie Bhatti, 18-Jon Welsh19-Ben Toolis, 20-David Denton, 21-Ali Price, 22-Chris Harris, 23-Blair Kinghorn.
