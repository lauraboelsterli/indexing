    "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he is considering a range of options to address steel and aluminum imports that he said are unfairly hurting U.S. producers, including \"tariffs and/or quotas.\"\nTrump made his comments during a meeting with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators and representatives â€” some who favored curbs on imports, others who cautioned him on the impact on U.S. manufacturers.\n\"What we're talking about it tariffs and/or quotas,\" Trump said to the group.\n\"Part of the options would be tariffs coming in. As they dump steel, they pay tariffs, substantial tariffs, which means the United States would actually make a lot of money.",
