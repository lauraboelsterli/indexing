That means they could be on the hook for steep capital gains taxes if they try to sell the asset right away.\n\"Giving the money outright is fraught with complications,\" said Bernard A. Krooks, founding partner of Littman Krooks LLP in New York.\n\"Say you leave your daughter the money and she gets divorced; it's now part of the marital settlement,\" he said. \"If she gets sued, some creditor gets the money.\"\nTomas Rodriguez | Picture Press | Getty Images That's when an irrevocable trust may be the answer. Assets that go here are no longer under the control of the older person, and they are subject to protection from creditors.\nA single-premium income annuity is another way to help someone qualify for Medicaid. The applicant would use some assets to buy an annuity that will begin distributing income to that person's spouse.\nTread carefully when purchasing the annuity: If you liquidated some investments in order to come up with the proceeds, you could face tax consequences.\nFurther, once you've given a lump sum to an insurance company for an annuity, you can't get your money back.\n\"We're not big fans of annuities, but they're a way to set the surviving spouse up for a stream of income and qualify for Medicaid,\" said Stein Olavsrud, executive vice president and portfolio manager with FBB Capital Partners in Bethesda, Maryland.\nA team approach Given all the elements of elder-care planning — taxes, trusts and asset management — expect to work with a team of professionals in order to come up with a strategy.\nFinancial advisors should expect to collaborate with an elder law attorney who is well versed in the Medicaid laws in the client's state, plus an accountant.\n\"They have some assets, but if they needed care in a nursing home, they would be quickly wiped out.\" -Tom McCarthy, McCarthy & Cox \"I find that the attorneys are really good at crafting different documents, but the problem a lot of them have is that they can't quantify for the client the tax cost if they do this sort of planning,\" said McCarthy of McCarthy & Cox.\nClients should also already have handled their estate plans, particularly their medical directives, powers of attorney and any additional details on how they would like to be cared for once they are infirm.\nOther potential shakeups loom ahead for Medicaid planning.\nLegislative upheaval Elder law attorneys are keeping a close eye on any legislation coming out of Congress, and they are watching the White House for any sign that a pullback on Medicaid is coming.\nRecently, President Donald Trump's budget called for a rollback of Medicaid expansion . Prior to the expansion, states were able to deny coverage to people who didn't have children or who failed to meet very low income limits.\nSome states are making tweaks to their programs, changing eligibility requirements and other details.\nFor instance, last year Iowa called to eliminate Medicaid's guarantee of retroactive coverage for many beneficiaries in that state.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth Weekly advice on managing your money SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service. Privacy Policy . On Nov. 28, 2017, Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. wrote a letter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in November, expressing concerns that this change could affect the finances of seniors who may need care while they apply for the program.\nThis is also why, once a client has established a Medicaid plan, he will still need to review it over time.\n\"These aren't pleasant topics to talk about, but you have some control over how it will affect you and your family,\" said Krooks of Littman Krooks. \"Work with a competent individual and revisit your plan every few years.\"",
