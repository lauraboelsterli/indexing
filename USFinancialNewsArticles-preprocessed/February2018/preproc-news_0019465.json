We are very pleased with our new shareholder, Zhaojin and with Mr. Zhao and look forward to his contributions both technical and as a Director as we begin an exciting year for the Company.”\nMr. Zhao has more than 17 years of experience in global mining investment and EPC project management in China, Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Middle East.

At a US$1,150 gold price and a 0.80 (US$:C$) exchange rate, the Study delivers a potential after tax internal rate of return of approximately 24.2% with an initial CAPEX of $415 million.\nThe Project received its final Project Certificate on December 19, 2017.
