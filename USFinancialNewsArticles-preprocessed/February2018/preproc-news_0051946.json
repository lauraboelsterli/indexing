    "text": "LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mozambique will present to its creditors the key elements of a debt restructuring proposal and give an update on its fiscal and macroeconomic situation at a meeting in London on March 20, the Ministry of Economy and Finance said on Thursday.\n“The government remains committed to finding a consensual and collaborative resolution to the current debt situation through dialogue with the holders of the Republic’s direct and guaranteed external commercial obligations,” the ministry said in an emailed statement.\nDebt-ridden Mozambique has been in turmoil since the 2016 discovery of previously hidden loans granted to three state-owned companies, which led the International Monetary Fund and Western donors to halt budget support, triggering a currency collapse and debt defaults as well as hitting economic growth.
