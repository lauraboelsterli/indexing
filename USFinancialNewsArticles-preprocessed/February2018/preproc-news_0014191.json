Commandos already killed one of the gunmen involved and captured a another. \nSecurity forces entered the West Bank village of Yamoun in the early morning in search of Ahmad Nasr Jarrar, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. They found him there armed with an automatic weapon.

He condemned the Israeli forces for killing him. Reporting by Ali Sawafta and Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",
