    "text": "AGOURA HILLS, Calif., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hixme , a breakthrough platform for consumerizing large employer health benefits, today announced the appointment of Kirsten Thayer to Vice President, Product. Hixme CEO Denny Weinberg made the appointment after a long and studied national search.\n\"Kirsten is the perfect leadership fit to advance Hixme's Product function, in an industry where traditional, customized, service-heavy solutions have failed to provide real value for either large employers or their workers,\" says Weinberg. \"Her product, market, and strategic experiences with technology solutions built for enterprise and consumer users are a great match for us.\"\nThayer has 17 years of extensive experience in software development and delivery. Most of her career has been spent in demanding industries where complex requirements, execution and collaboration are paramount.\nIn her most recent position, Thayer satisfied her appetite for research and user-centered design when she built an internal User Experience team from the ground up. This established consistency and better client experience across a variety of software solutions.\nThe complex B2B2C solutions she brought to the entertainment industry have striking parallels to the need for modernization of the healthcare/benefits industry.\n\"The healthcare space is ripe for consumerization, similar to film and TV production that still use paper for most back-office activities such as employee onboarding and weekly time cards,\" notes Thayer. \"Workers use technology for all other aspects of their lives, so why wouldn't they want those same options and user experience dealing with their benefits?\"\nShe also oversaw the development of tools for internal and external client users of enterprise systems. This helped her understand the nuances and complexities of developing a product to balance the needs of a growing business.\n\"I am passionate about finding new and better ways to create value through technology,\" says Thayer. \"I'm excited to join the company because of our insur/fintech hybrid solution. Hixme is centered on improving client experience, choice and portability in the critical arena of health financing.\" Notably, Hixme is part of a growing trend to transform the trillion-dollar market of employer benefits – a trend, which is only at its infancy.\nThayer will be responsible for the overall product vision and product portfolio, both introducing and sunsetting products. \"This demands an imaginative communicator and strategic thinker who deeply understands the ins and outs of the industry,\" says Weinberg. \"Kirsten will coordinate the development and execution of valued products with significant appeal for employers, their workers and families and the company.\"\nThayer earned a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism from Penn State. She will be located in Hixme's Agoura Hills headquarters.\nAbout Hixme\nFounded in 2013, Hixme is capitalized through $26 million dollars of investment funding from Kleiner Perkins , Propel Ventures , Rosemark Capital and Transamerica Ventures . Hixme is leading a new revolution to replace an obsolete group insurance model using innovative technology to usher in a new era of worker-owned health benefits for large organizations. Hixme creates quality benefit programs that enrich the lives of workers and their families by 'bringing back the benefit' lost in the costly and complex traditional employer-by-employer based model. Hixme's intuitive WorkPlace Market™ platform gives workers and their families the freedom to choose and personally own benefits they uniquely value. Hixme's large company clients leave the expensive annual benefits treadmill behind, reduce administrative complexity and costs, and focus on what matters most: building value in their own products and services.\nVisit hixme.com , Facebook , Twitter and LinkedIn .\nHixme Media contact : Linda Hubbard Lalande, 818-730-2943\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hixme-appoints-seasoned-leader-kirsten-thayer-vice-president-product-300601011.html\nSOURCE Hixme",
