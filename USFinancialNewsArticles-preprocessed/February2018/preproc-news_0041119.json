(NYSE: B), a global provider of highly engineered products and differentiated industrial technologies, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 net sales of $373 million were up 15% from $324 million in the prior year period driven by strong organic sales growth (1) of 10%. Foreign exchange favorably impacted sales by approximately 4% while acquisition sales contributed 1%. Net loss for the fourth quarter was ($59.2) million, or ($1.10) per diluted share, compared to net income of $36.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $96.7 million related to the new U.S. tax legislation. On an adjusted basis, net income was $0.71 per diluted share, up 6% from $0.67 last year. Adjusted net income per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017 excludes a $1.79 charge related to new U.S. tax laws and $0.02 per share related to restructuring actions within our Industrial Segment. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted net income per share excludes $0.03 of FOBOHA short-term purchase accounting adjustments in our Industrial Segment and a $0.03 benefit related to a contract termination dispute in our Aerospace Segment.\nFor the full year 2017, Barnes Group generated net sales of $1,436 million, up 17% from $1,231 million in the prior year. Full year organic sales were up 11%, while acquisitions contributed 5% and favorable foreign exchange provided 1%. Net income for the year was $59.4 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, compared to $135.6 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, net income was $2.88 per diluted share, up 14% from $2.53 last year. For 2017, adjusted net income per share excludes a $1.77 charge related to tax law changes, $0.03 of FOBOHA short-term purchase accounting adjustments and a $0.01 benefit from restructuring actions. Adjusted net income per share for 2016 excludes $0.05 of FOBOHA short-term purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition transaction costs in our Industrial Segment and a contract termination arbitration award which offset related charges in our Aerospace Segment.\nA table reconciling 2017 and 2016 non-GAAP adjusted results presented in this release to the Company’s GAAP results is included at the end of this press release.\n“Barnes Group delivered a strong 2017 with double-digit organic sales and adjusted earnings per share growth,” said Patrick J. Dempsey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Barnes Group Inc. “Our sustained focus on enhancing our portfolio and pipeline of innovative products and services, advancing the Barnes Enterprise System (“BES”), and developing a high-performing global organization has resulted in continued progress along our transformation journey and positions us to perform well moving forward.”\n“Accordingly, we expect 2018 to be another solid year as generally favorable end markets coupled with our BES emphasis on driving commercial, operational and financial excellence across our Company are anticipated to drive revenue, margin, and earnings growth,” added Dempsey.\nIndustrial\nFourth quarter 2017 sales were $254.3 million, up 18% from $215.7 million in the prior year period. Organic sales increased by 11%, with growth across all three business units; Molding Solutions, Nitrogen Gas Products, and Engineered Components. Favorable foreign exchange increased sales by approximately $13.1 million, or 6%, while acquisition revenues were $2.6 million, or 1%. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was $26.9 million, down 11% from $30.2 million in the prior year period, as continuing higher costs incurred on certain programs within Engineered Components’ Associated Spring business and incentive compensation at select SBUs were only partially offset by the profit benefit of increased sales and the absence of $1.8 million in FOBOHA short-term purchase accounting adjustments taken last year. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes restructuring related costs of $1.4 million related to two previously announced plant consolidations. Excluding this item, adjusted operating profit was $28.3 million, down 12% from an adjusted $32.0 million a year ago. Adjusted operating margin was 11.1%, down 370 bps, driven by lower productivity, primarily at Engineered Components, and a low margin contribution from the FOBOHA business. Full year 2017 sales were $973.9 million, up 18% from $824.2 million last year. Organic sales were up 10%, while acquisitions contributed 7% and favorable foreign exchange contributed 1%. Full year operating profit of $127.1 million was down 2% from $129.7 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, operating profit was $129.4 million for 2017 versus $133.2 million a year ago, a decrease of 3%. Adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, down 290 bps from last year.\nAerospace\nFourth quarter 2017 sales were $118.7 million, up 9% from $108.5 million in the same period last year. Aerospace original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) sales increased 6% due to the continuing ramp of new engine programs. Aerospace aftermarket sales increased 17% from continuing growth in maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”), and spare parts sales. Operating profit was $22.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 7% as compared to $21.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting the profit impact from higher sales volumes and productivity benefits, partially offset by scheduled price deflation. Excluding a contract termination award of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, adjusted operating profit was up 15% from $19.8 million a year ago while operating margin of 19.1% was up 90 bps from an adjusted 18.2% a year ago. Full year 2017 sales were $462.6 million, up 14% from $406.5 million last year. Operating profit was $83.2 million, up 33%, versus $62.5 million a year ago. Full year 2017 Aerospace operating profit was up 30% versus an adjusted $64.1 in the prior year. Operating margin was 18% versus an adjusted 15.8% last year, up 220 bps. Aerospace OEM backlog ended 2017 at $714 million, up 14% compared to a year ago and up 1% sequentially from the third quarter of 2017. The Company expects to ship approximately 50% of this backlog over the next 12 months.\nAdditional Information\nFull year 2017 interest expense increased $2.7 million to $14.6 million primarily as a result of a higher average effective interest rate versus a year ago. Other income, net for the year decreased $2.3 million versus a year ago primarily due to the absence of $1.4 million of interest income related to the contract termination arbitration award in 2016. The Company’s effective tax rate from continuing operations was 69.6% in 2017 compared with 25.7% in 2016. The increase in the 2017 effective tax rate is primarily due to a provisional $96.7 million income tax charge recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) enacted in December 2017. Excluding the impact of the Act, the Company’s 2017 effective tax rate would have been 20.2%. The comparable decrease from 25.7% to 20.2% is due to the adjustment of the Swiss valuation reserves worth $0.12 of earnings per share, the settlement of tax audits and closure of tax years for various tax jurisdictions, and the change in the mix of earnings. These items were partially offset by the expiration of certain tax holidays.\n2018 Outlook\nBarnes Group expects 2018 total revenue growth of 4% to 6%, with organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. Foreign exchange is anticipated to benefit revenues by approximately 1% for the year. Operating margin is forecasted to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.13 per diluted share, up 3% to 9% from 2017’s adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.88. Further, the Company anticipates capital expenditures of between $60 million to $65 million and cash conversion of greater than 100% of net income. Based upon our forecasted geographic mix of earnings, the effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be between 25% and 26%. The Company does not expect the new Revenue Recognition standard to have a material impact on future revenues or net income.\n“2017 was a good year for Barnes Group even as we dealt with some operational challenges within one of our Industrial businesses. As we move beyond this in the first half of 2018, we anticipate solid revenue growth, improved financial performance, and good cash generation. With our supportive balance sheet, we will continue to invest in organic growth opportunities and strategic acquisitions that position us well for the future,” said Christopher J. Stephens, Jr., Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, Barnes Group Inc.\nConference Call Information\nBarnes Group Inc. will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 8:30 a.m. ET today, February 16, 2018.

This metric can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity.\n(2) For the purpose of calculating the cash conversion ratio, the Company has excluded the effects of U.S. tax reform, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from 2017 net income.\nBARNES GROUP INC.

The Company has excluded the following from its \"as adjusted\" financial measurements for 2016: 1) transaction costs related to its FOBOHA acquisition, 2) short-term purchase accounting adjustments related to its FOBOHA acquisition, 3) charges related to the contract termination dispute and 4) operating income related to the contract termination arbitration award and the non-operating interest income awarded. The tax effects of these items, excluding the effects of U.S. tax reform which impacted tax expense directly, were calculated based on the respective tax jurisdiction of each item and range from approximately 19% to 37%. Management believes that these adjustments provide the Company and its investors with an indication of our baseline performance excluding items that are not considered to be reflective of our ongoing results. Management does not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative measurement calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Company's performance. Accordingly, the measurements have limitations depending on their use.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180216005058/en/\nBarnes Group Inc.\nWilliam Pitts\nDirector, Investor Relations\n860-583-7070\nSource: Barnes Group Inc.",
