    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) today announced fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.\n2017 Highlights:\nCompleted acquisition of Rice Energy Announced 59% increase in proved reserves Received FERC Certificate for Mountain Valley Pipeline Production sales volume was 17% higher than 2016 Average realized price was 23% higher than 2016\nFinancial Results Year Ended December 31, ($ millions, except EPS) 2017 2016 Difference Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to EQT $ 1,508.5 $ (453.0 ) $ 1,961.5 Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to EQT (a non-GAAP measure) $ 276.3 $ (54.3 ) $ 330.6 Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) $ 8.04 $ (2.71 ) $ 10.75 Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Share (EPS) (a non-GAAP measure) $ 1.47 $ (0.33 ) $ 1.80 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 1,637.7 $ 1,064.3 $ 573.4 Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Attributable to EQT (a non-GAAP measure)\n$ 1,193.1 $ 832.8 $ 360.3 Three Months Ended December 31, ($ millions, except EPS) 2017 2016 Difference Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to EQT $ 1,280.1 $ (192.0 ) $ 1,472.1 Adjusted Net Income Attributable to EQT (a non-GAAP measure) $ 167.5 $ 43.8 $ 123.7 Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) $ 5.83 $ (1.11 ) $ 6.94 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (a non-GAAP measure) $ 0.76 $ 0.25 $ 0.51 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 426.3 $ 296.6 $ 129.7 Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Attributable to EQT (a non-GAAP measure) $ 415.6 $ 332.3 $ 83.3\nAs a result of the federal tax reform legislation, net income for the three months and year-ended December 31, 2017, includes a tax benefit of approximately $1.2 billion for the revaluation of existing net deferred tax liabilities to the lower corporate tax rate. Adjusted earnings for the year-ended December 31, 2017, were higher primarily due to increased commodity prices and sales volume, partly offset by higher operating expenses. Adjusted cash flow for year-ended December 31, 2017, includes $183 million of transaction-related expenses.\nFourth quarter adjusted earnings were higher primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nThe Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as important disclosures regarding certain projected non-GAAP financial measures.\nRESULTS BY BUSINESS\nEQT PRODUCTION\nFinancial Results Year Ended December 31, ($ millions, except average realized price) 2017 2016 Difference Sales volume (Bcfe) 887.5 759.0 128.5 Pipeline and net marketing services $ 65.0 $ 41.0 $ 24.0 Operating revenue $ 3,106.3 $ 1,387.1 $ 1,719.2 Adjusted operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) $ 2,694.2 $ 1,872.3 $ 821.9 Operating expenses $ 2,516.6 $ 2,114.8 $ 401.8 Operating income / (loss) $ 589.7 $ (719.7 ) $ 1,309.4 Adjusted operating income / (loss) (a non-GAAP measure) $ 262.9 $ (164.0 ) $ 426.9 Average realized price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.04 $ 2.47 $ 0.57 The increase in operating income for 2017 was primarily due to a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges, a higher average realized price, and increased sales volumes for produced natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs), as a result of recent acquisitions and drilling activity, partly offset by increased operating expenses.\nThe increase in the average realized price for the year was primarily due to an increase in the average NYMEX natural gas price, including cash settled derivatives, of $0.29 per Mcf; an increase in the average natural gas differential of $0.19 per Mcf; and an increase in NGLs pricing.\nOperating expenses for 2017 were $401.8 million higher than last year. Transmission expense increased $154.1 million, gathering expense increased $66.4 million, and processing expense increased $54.7 million, all consistent with higher volumes and improved access to premium markets. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) increased $123.1 million as a result of higher sales volumes, partly offset by a lower depletion rate year-over-year. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) was $14.6 million lower due to the absence of one-time items from the prior year, including a charge for pension settlement and legal reserves in 2016, partially offset by higher SG&A associated with the Rice acquisition.\nThree Months Ended December 31, ($ millions, except average realized price) 2017\n2016\nDifference Sales volume (Bcfe) 294.4 198.4 96.0 Pipeline and net marketing services $ 33.3 $ 12.9 $ 20.4 Operating revenue $ 1,048.9 $ 318.3 $ 730.6 Adjusted operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) $ 896.3 $ 578.5 $ 317.8 Operating expenses $ 781.4 $ 577.4 $ 204.0 Operating income / (loss) $ 267.4 $ (251.1 ) $ 518.5 Adjusted operating income (a non-GAAP measure) $ 163.5 $ 32.1 $ 131.4 Average realized price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.04 $ 2.92 $ 0.12 The increase in operating income for the quarter was primarily due to a sales volume increase for both produced natural gas and NGLs related to recent acquisitions, including Rice, and drilling activity and a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges, partly offset by increased operating expenses.\nThe increase in the average realized price for the quarter was primarily due to an improvement in NGLs pricing.\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $204.0 million higher than the same period last year. DD&A increased $103.9 million, gathering expense increased $39.2 million, transmission expense increased $34.7 million, and processing expense increased $9.4 million, consistent with increased volumes and improved access to premium markets.\nEQT MIDSTREAM PARTNERS (EQM) GATHERING\nFinancial Results Year Ended December 31, ($ millions) 2017 2016 Difference Operating revenue $ 454.5 $ 397.5 $ 57.0 Operating expenses $ 121.0 $ 108.5 $ 12.5 Operating income $ 333.6 $ 289.0 $ 44.6 Three Months Ended December 31, ($ millions) 2017 2016 Difference Operating revenue $ 123.5 $ 100.2 $ 23.3 Operating expenses $ 32.7 $ 29.4 $ 3.3 Operating income $ 90.8 $ 70.8 $ 20.0 Operating income increased 15% in 2017, and 28% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher revenues driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. Revenue from firm reservation fees represented 90% of total revenue during 2017 and 86% for the fourth quarter.\nOperating expenses increased primarily as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional assets placed in-service, including those associated with the Range Resources header pipeline project and various affiliate wellhead gathering expansion projects. Operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily as a result of higher personnel costs and increased property taxes, consistent with the Company’s growth.\nEQM TRANSMISSION\nFinancial Results Year Ended December 31, ($ millions) 2017 2016 Difference Operating revenue $ 379.6 $ 338.1 $ 41.5 Operating expenses $ 132.4 $ 100.2 $ 32.2 Operating income $ 247.1 $ 237.9 $ 9.2 Three Months Ended December 31, ($ millions) 2017 2016 Difference Operating revenue $ 101.0 $ 94.8 $ 6.2 Operating expenses $ 42.8 $ 31.0 $ 11.8 Operating income $ 58.2 $ 63.8 $ (5.6 ) The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher firm reservation fee revenue on the Ohio Valley Connector (OVC). Revenue from firm reservation fees represented 92% of total revenues during 2017.\nOperating expenses were $1.3 million higher than last year, excluding a $10.5 million non-cash charge to depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The non-cash charge related to a revaluation of differences between regulatory and tax bases in property, plant, and equipment.\nOTHER BUSINESS\nAcquisition of Rice Energy\nOn November 13, 2017, EQT completed the acquisition (Rice Merger) of Rice Energy Inc. (Rice). EQT acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rice common stock in exchange for 0.37 shares of EQT stock and $5.30 in cash per share of Rice stock.\nThe foundation of the transaction with Rice was the ability to realize significant synergies on SG&A expenses, as well as capture improved capital returns resulting from the ability to drill longer laterals on its much larger contiguous acreage position.\nIn 2018, SG&A savings from the acquisition are approximately $110 million and capital efficiency savings are approximately $210 million. The forecasted average lateral length in southwestern Pennsylvania is projected to be 13,600 feet.\nAs a result of replacing $1.3 billion of Rice senior notes with lower coupon investment grade debt, EQT expects to realize $45 million in annual interest savings.\nThrough the Rice Merger, EQT also acquired a controlling interest in Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP), for which EQT will now report additional segments for RMP Gathering and RMP Water. A discussion of the results of those segments has been omitted from this release as EQT only reports the results of RMP from the acquisition date of November 13, 2017 and there is no comparable period.\n2017 Reserves Report\nIn a separate news release issued today, EQT reported total proved reserves at December 31, 2017, of 21.4 Tcfe, a 59% increase over 2016. Proved developed reserves increased 65% over 2016 to 11.3 Tcfe.\nMountain Valley Pipeline\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the Mountain Valley Pipeline project in October 2017. As of December 2017, Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP JV) had received all of the necessary federal permits required for the project. In early January 2018, the MVP JV began filing requests for partial Notices to Proceed with the FERC, and subsequently has received permission to begin construction activities in certain areas along the route. The 303-mile pipeline is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, with EQM funding its proportional share, or approximately $1.6 billion. The MVP JV has secured a total of 2 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms and continues to target a late 2018 in-service date.\nNotes Issuance\nOn October 4, 2017, the Company completed the public offering of Senior Notes and Floating Rate Notes totaling $3.0 billion. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes were primarily used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for, to refinance assumed indebtedness in, and to pay expenses related to the Rice Merger. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes were also used to redeem Company Senior Notes due in 2018.\nTax Reform Impact\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter to revalue its existing net deferred tax liabilities to the lower rate.\nThis legislation also repealed the alternative minimum tax (AMT) and provides that existing AMT credit carryforwards can be utilized to offset current federal taxes owed in tax years 2018 through 2020. In addition, 50% of any unused AMT credit carryforwards can be refunded during these years with any remaining AMT credit carryforward being fully refunded in 2021. The Company expects a refund of $200 million related to 2018. The Company had approximately $435 million of AMT credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2017.\nLastly, this legislation preserved the deductibility of intangible drilling costs for federal income tax purposes and provides bonus depreciation which allows the Company to deduct 100% of its unregulated tangible capital deployed between 2018 and 2020. After 2022, the bonus percentage is reduced by 20% each year until it expires in 2027. None of the other provisions are expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.\nMarcellus Acreage Acquisitions\nDuring 2017, the Company acquired approximately 110,000 net Marcellus acres, with drilling rights on approximately 55,000 net Utica acres, in the Company’s liquids-rich West Virginia core development area. The Company paid net cash of $740.1 million during the year-ended December 31, 2017, for these acquisitions, which exclude Rice.\nEQT Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: EQM) / EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP) / Rice Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: RMP)\nOn January 18, 2018, EQM announced a cash distribution to its unitholders of $1.025 per unit for the fourth quarter. EQGP announced a cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.244 per unit for the fourth quarter 2017. RMP also announced a cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.2917 per unit for the fourth quarter 2017.\nThe 2017 financial results for EQM and EQGP were released today and provide operational results, as well as updates on significant midstream projects under development by EQM. This news release is available at www.eqtmidstreampartners.com .\nCalculation of Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest (NCI)\nThe results of EQGP, EQM, RMP and Strike Force Midstream LLC (Strike Force) are consolidated in EQT’s results. For the year ended December 31, 2017, EQT’s results reflected earnings of $349.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, attributable to the publicly held partnership interests and the minority interest in Strike Force.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Unitholder interest in net Public / minority NCI interest in (thousands) income (a)\nownership EQT earnings EQM $ 428,373 71.65 % $ 306,927 EQGP $ 261,993 9.94 % $ 26,042 RMP $ 22,131 71.89 % $ 15,910 Strike Force $ 2,936 25.00 % $ 734 Total $ 349,613 Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Unitholder interest in net Public / minority NCI interest in (thousands) income (a)\nownership EQT earnings EQM $ 105,553 71.65 % $ 75,628 EQGP $ 70,344 9.94 % $ 6,992 RMP $ 22,131 71.89 % $ 15,910 Strike Force $ 2,936 25.00 % $ 734 Total $ 99,264 (a) Excludes incentive distribution rights\nHedging\nAs of January 31, 2018, the approximate volumes and prices of the Company’s derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2018 through 2020 were:\n2018 (a)\n2019 2020 NYMEX Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 541 234 234 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 3.14 $ 3.03 $ 3.05 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 117 66 − Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 3.28 $ 3.15 $ − Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 3.78 $ 3.68 $ − Puts (Long) Total Volume (Bcf) 10 7 − Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 2.91 $ 2.94 $ − (a) Full year 2018\nThe Company also sold calendar year 2018 and 2019 calls for approximately 64 Bcf and 45 Bcf, respectively, at strike prices of $3.49 per Mcf and $3.69 per Mcf, respectively For 2018, the Company also sold puts for approximately 3 Bcf, at a strike price of $2.63 per Mcf The average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf\nOperating Income (Loss)\nThe Company reports operating income (loss) by segment in this news release. Interest, income taxes, and unallocated expense are controlled on a consolidated, corporate-wide basis and are not allocated to the segments.\nThe following table reconciles operating income (loss) by segment, as reported in this news release, to the consolidated operating income reported in the Company’s financial statements:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating income (loss): EQT Production $ 267,439 $ (251,053 ) $ 589,716 $ (719,731 ) EQM Gathering 90,847 70,753 333,563 289,027 EQM Transmission 58,150 63,837 247,145 237,922 RMP Gathering 21,800 − 21,800 − RMP Water 4,145 − 4,145 − Unallocated expense (227,532 ) (73,003 ) (263,388 ) (85,518 ) Operating income (loss) $ 214,849 $ (189,466 ) $ 932,981 $ (278,300 ) Unallocated expenses generally include incentive compensation costs and administrative expenses.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to EQT and adjusted EPS should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) attributable to EQT or earnings per diluted share (EPS) presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to EQT as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement, Rice Merger-related expenses, and certain other items that impact comparability between periods. Management utilizes adjusted net income (loss) attributable to EQT to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts; thus, the income from natural gas sales is not impacted by the often-volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. The measure also excludes other items that affect the comparability of results. Management believes that adjusted net income (loss) attributable to EQT as presented provides useful information for investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings.\nThe table below reconciles adjusted net income (loss) attributable to EQT and adjusted EPS with net income (loss) attributable to EQT and EPS as derived from the statements of consolidated operations to be included in EQT’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (thousands, except per share information)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) attributable to EQT, as reported $ 1,280,071 $ (191,958 ) $ 1,508,529 $ (452,983 ) Add back / (deduct): Asset and Lease Impairments 15,274 69,935 20,327 75,434 Rice Merger-related costs 222,634 – 245,281 – (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges (167,328 ) 216,649 (390,021 ) 248,991 Net cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges 47,565 56,909 40,728 279,425 Premiums received (paid) for derivatives that settled during the period 537 (558 ) 2,132 (2,132 ) Loss on debt extinguishment 12,641 – 12,641 – Huron Restructuring Charges – – – 4,360 Pension Settlement Charge – – – 9,403 Gain on sale / exchange of assets – (8,025 ) – (8,025 ) Tax impact of non-GAAP items* (49,199 ) (134,634 ) 31,296 (244,197 ) Subtotal 1,362,195 8,318 1,470,913 (89,724 ) Tax benefit related to federal tax law change** (1,205,140 ) – (1,205,140 ) – Tax expense related to regulatory liability 10,488 – 10,488 – Tax expense related to regulatory asset – 35,438 – 35,438 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to EQT $ 167,543 $ 43,756 $ 276,261 $ (54,286 ) Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 219,712 173,688 187,727 166,978 Diluted EPS, as adjusted $ 0.76 $ 0.25 $ 1.47 $ (0.33 ) * Blended tax rates of 37.46% and 45.41% were applied to the items under the caption “Add back (deduct)” for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. A tax rate of 40.2% was applied to the items under the caption “Add back (deduct)” for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. This represents the incremental deferred tax (expense) benefit that would have been incurred had these items been excluded from net income (loss) attributable to EQT.\n** The income tax benefit of $1.2 billion for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities to the lower corporate tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nOperating Cash Flow, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Attributable to EQT and Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Attributable to EQT Production\nOperating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that are presented as indicators of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. EQT includes this information because management believes that changes in operating relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements and therefore may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT is EQT’s net cash provided by operating activities, less changes in other , adjusted to exclude EQM and RMP adjusted EBITDA, plus EQM and RMP interest expense plus the EQGP and RMP cash distributions payable to EQT. Prior to EQT’s 2018 operational forecast announcement in December 2017, the Company’s calculation of adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT did not include the addition of EQM’s and RMP’s interest expense. The Company believes it is preferable to present this non-GAAP supplemental financial measure with this adjustment as it better reflects EQT’s cash flows by excluding the cost of debt for EQM and RMP. EQT has recast all periods presented to be consistent with this change in the definition of adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT. Management believes that removing the impact on operating cash flows of the public unitholders of EQGP, EQM and RMP that is otherwise required to be consolidated in EQT’s results provides useful information to an EQT investor. As used in this news release, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production means the EQT Production segment’s total operating revenues less the EQT Production segment’s cash operating expense, less gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges, plus net cash settlements received (paid) on derivatives not designated as hedges, plus premiums received (paid) for derivatives that settled during the period, plus EQT Production asset impairments (if applicable). Operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production should not be considered as alternatives to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP. The table below reconciles operating cash flow and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT with net cash provided by operating activities, as derived from the statements of consolidated cash flows to be included in EQT’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, thousands 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 426,326 $ 296,621 $ 1,637,698 $ 1,064,320 Add back / (deduct) Changes in other 116,921 144,764 10,664 174,272 Operating cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) 543,247 441,385 1,648,362 1,238,592 (Deduct) / add back: EQM adjusted EBITDA (1) (185,098 ) (156,868 ) (689,498 ) (572,611 ) RMP adjusted EBITDA (1) (33,457 ) – (33,457 ) – EQM net interest expense 10,167 5,318 36,181 16,766 RMP net interest expense 826 – 826 – Cash distribution payable to EQT from EQGP (2) 58,490 42,430 209,271 150,062 Cash distribution payable to EQT from RMP (3) 21,432 – 21,432 – Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT $ 415,607\n$ 332,265 $ 1,193,117 $ 832,809 (1) EQM adjusted EBITDA and RMP adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures reconciled in this section. (2) Cash distribution payable to EQT for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, represents the distribution payable from EQGP to EQT related to the respective period. (3) Cash distribution payable to EQT for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 represents the distribution payable from RMP to EQT related to the respective period, as well as a cash distribution received by EQT from RMP following the Rice Merger in respect of the third quarter of 2017 distribution which was payable November 16, 2017.\nEQT has not provided projected net cash provided by operating activities or reconciliations of projected adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT or EQT Production to projected net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. EQT is unable to project net cash provided by operating activities because this metric includes the impact of changes in operating related to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements that may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. EQT is unable to project these timing differences with any reasonable degree of accuracy without unreasonable efforts such as predicting the timing of its and customers’ payments, with accuracy to a specific day, three or more months in advance. Furthermore, EQT does not provide guidance with respect to its average realized price or income taxes, among other items, that are reconciling items between net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production, as applicable. Natural gas prices are volatile and out of EQT’s control, and the timing of transactions and the income tax effects of future transactions and other items are difficult to accurately predict. Therefore, EQT is unable to provide projected net cash provided by operating activities, or the related reconciliations of projected adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and EQT Production to projected net cash provided by operating activities, without unreasonable effort.\nEQT Production Adjusted Operating Revenue\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production total operating revenue, as reported in the EQT Production Results of Operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the Financial Information by Business Segment footnote to be included in EQT’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for a reconciliation of EQT Production total operating revenue to EQT Corporation total operating revenue, as reported.\nEQT Production adjusted operating revenue (also referred to as total natural gas & liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company’s management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenue as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating revenue to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. EQT Production adjusted operating revenue also excludes \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" because management considers this revenue to be unrelated to the revenue for its natural gas and liquids production. EQT Production \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" includes revenue for gathering services provided to third-parties, as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third-party pipeline capacity not used for EQT Production sales volume. Management further believes that EQT Production adjusted operating revenue, as presented, provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings trends.\nCalculation of EQT Production Adjusted\nThree Months Ended Year Ended Operating Revenue\nDecember 31, December 31, $ in thousands (unless noted) 2017 2016 2017 2016 EQT Production total operating revenue, as reported on segment page $ 1,048,856 $ 318,302 $ 3,106,337 $ 1,387,054 (Deduct) / add back: (Gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges (167,328 ) 216,649 (390,021 ) 248,991 Net cash settlements received on derivatives not designated as hedges 47,565 56,909 40,728 279,425 Premiums received (paid) for derivatives that settled during the period 537 (558 ) 2,132 (2,132 ) Pipeline and net marketing services (33,342 ) (12,852 ) (64,998 ) (41,048 ) EQT Production adjusted operating revenue, a non-GAAP measure $ 896,288 $ 578,450 $ 2,694,178 $ 1,872,290\nTotal sales volumes (MMcfe) 294,439 198,399 887,520 758,967 Average realized price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.04 $ 2.92 $ 3.04 $ 2.47 EQT Production Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production operating income (loss), as reported in the EQT Production Results of Operations. Refer to the Operating Income (Loss) section in this news release for a reconciliation of EQT Production total operating income (loss) to EQT Corporation total operating income (loss), as reported.\nEQT Production adjusted operating income (loss) is presented because it is an important measure used by EQT’s management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating income (loss) should not be considered as an alternative to EQT Corporation operating income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP. EQT Production adjusted operating income (loss) as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement, asset impairments and drilling expenses, pension settlement charges and restructuring charges. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating income (loss) to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus the income from natural gas sales is not impacted by the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. The measure also excludes certain other items that affect the comparability of results.

EQM adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to EQM’s net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EQM adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect EQM's net income. Additionally, because EQM adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in EQT's or EQM's industries, the definition of EQM adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measure.

We use certain terms, such as “EUR” (estimated ultimate recovery) and “3P” (proved, probable and possible), that the SEC’s guidelines prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These measures are by their nature more speculative than estimates of reserves prepared in accordance with SEC definitions and guidelines and accordingly are less certain.\nTotal sales volume per day (or daily production) is an operational estimate of the daily production or sales volume on a typical day (excluding curtailments).\nDisclosures in this news release contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts are forward-looking. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this news release specifically include the expectations of plans, strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance of the Company and its subsidiaries, including guidance regarding the Company’s strategy to develop its reserves; drilling plans and programs (including the number, type, average length-of-pay or lateral length and location of wells to be drilled and number and type of drilling rigs); projected natural gas prices, basis and average differential; total resource potential, reserves and EUR; projected Company and third party production sales volume and growth rates (including liquids sales volume and growth rates); projected unit costs and well costs; projected pipeline and net marketing services revenues; projected gathering and transmission volume and growth rates; infrastructure programs (including the timing, cost and capacity of the transmission and gathering expansion projects); the cost, capacity, timing of regulatory approvals and anticipated in-service date of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project; the ultimate terms, partners and structure of the MVP joint venture; technology (including drilling and completion techniques); acquisition transactions; the projected general and administrative savings, capital efficiency savings and other operating efficiencies and synergies resulting from the Rice Merger, and the Company’s ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and efficiencies; monetization transactions, including asset sales, joint ventures or other transactions involving the Company’s assets; whether the Company will sell its Ohio midstream assets to EQM and the timing of such transaction or transactions; the timing of the Company’s announcement of a decision for addressing its sum-of-the-parts discount, and the impact of the results of such review; the projected cash flows resulting from the Company’s partnership interests in EQGP and RMP; internal rate of return (IRR) and returns per well; projected capital contributions and expenditures; potential future impairments of the Company’s assets; liquidity and financing requirements, including funding sources and availability; changes in the Company’s or EQM’s credit ratings; projected net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production, EBITDA, revenues and cash-on-hand; hedging strategy; the effects of government regulation and litigation; projected dividend and distribution amounts and rates; and tax position, projected effective tax rate and the impact of changes in tax laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events. While the Company considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control.
