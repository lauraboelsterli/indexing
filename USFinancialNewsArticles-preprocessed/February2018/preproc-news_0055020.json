    "text": "Zylstra Joined Colorado Senator Cory Gardner and Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton in Receiving This Prestigious Technology Leadership Award\nPHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Arizona Technology Council is pleased to announce that its President and CEO, Steven G. Zylstra, has been named a 2018 Tech Champion by the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), the world’s leading technology association. Zylstra was recognized for his leadership in championing technology policy in Arizona and his commitment to the Council its members, and his civic and community affairs. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., also were named 2018 Tech Champions.\n“This is a tremendous honor for the Arizona Technology Council and myself,” said Zylstra. “The work that the Council does is critical to the continued growth of Arizona’s technology sector. I am very thankful for this recognition of our success, as well as the impact that CompTIA has on technology at the international, national and state levels.”\nThe Tech Champion awards recognize leaders and legislators who are outstanding advocates for the technology industry and have shown consistent support for this vital economic sector. The award was presented during CompTIA's annual DC Fly-In , which brings together more than 100 solution providers, vendors and other IT professionals to discuss industry trends, issues and legislation in both state houses and the nation's capital.\n“Under Steve’s leadership, the Arizona Technology Council has made the Grand Canyon State a top destination in the country for technology companies and cutting-edge innovation,” said Elizabeth Hyman, executive vice president, public advocacy, CompTIA. “His work pushing for R&D tax credits, increased workforce training and substantive tax cuts are just a few of the reasons tech companies are flocking to Arizona. CompTIA has worked with Steve for nearly a decade, and we are honored to present him with the Tech Champion Award.”\nIn 2017, Zylstra was instrumental in getting lawmakers to pass pro-business and pro-growth legislative initiatives, including the extension and continued expansion of the R&D Tax Credit program until 2021 to give Arizona the top R&D tax credit in the entire nation. Zylstra also rallied Arizona’s technology community to lobby for the recapitalization of the Angel Investor Tax Credit, which resulted in $10 million being put back into the program with the goal of boosting state investments.\nFor more information on the Arizona Technology Council and the 2018 DC Fly-in, please visit www.aztechcouncil.org .\nAbout the Arizona Technology Council\nThe Arizona Technology Council is Arizona’s premier trade association for science and technology companies.
