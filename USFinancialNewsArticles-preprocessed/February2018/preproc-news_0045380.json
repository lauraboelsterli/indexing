    "text": "(Adds details on shares, background, Lotte no comment)\nSEOUL, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The head of South Korea’s Lotte Group has offered to quit as chairman at Japan-based holding firm Lotte Holdings, following his arrest for bribery earlier this month, cable news network YTN said on Wednesday.\nThe report comes as Lotte Holdings plans to hold a board meeting later Wednesday which is expected to discuss Chairman Shin Dong-bin’s situation.\nLotte Holdings is at the heart of Lotte Group’s complicated ownership structure and indirectly controls the group’s South Korean-based holding company Lotte Corp.\nLotte Holdings is a top shareholder of Lotte Hotel and Lotte Chemical, both of which own major stakes in Lotte Aluminum, which in turn is the largest shareholder of Lotte Corp.\nShin’s resignation could reignite a family dispute at the conglomerate, South Korea’s fifth-largest business group, and slow its efforts to streamline.\nIn 2016, Shin’s older brother sought to remove him from the board of Lotte Holdings, which was rejected by its shareholders. The older brother remains vice-chairman of Lotte Holdings.\nThe latest development comes after Shin was sentenced last week to two years and six months in prison over an influence-peddling scandal that has rocked the country’s business and political elite.\nHis detention is expected to hamper Lotte’s investment plans and seek new business avenues to stem losses in China.\nShares in its flagship retailer, Lotte Shopping, fell 0.7 percent on Wednesday versus the wider market’s 0.4 percent rise, amid concerns of a leadership vacuum.\nLotte Group declined to comment about the report.
