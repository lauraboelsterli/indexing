    "text": "STOCKHOLM, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Telecoms operator TDC has agreed to buy Swedish Modern Times Group’s Nordic Entertainment and Studios units in a cash and share deal valuing the acquired business at 19.55 billion Swedish crowns ($2.48 billion).\nAfter the deal, TDC said it will have close to 3 million TV subscribers and access to 10 million households in the Nordic regions. The valuation of the two acquired units was on a cash- and debt-free basis.\nKinnevik, which owns 20.0 percent of the capital and 47.6 percent of the votes in MTG, said in a separate statement it supported the merger.\nSome analysts had said a split of MTG into two separate companies was on the cards, as there were no obvious synergies between the firm’s Nordic entertainment operations and its digital arm.
