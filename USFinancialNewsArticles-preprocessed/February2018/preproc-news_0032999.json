France, with €83.8m in revenue, recorded negative growth of -11%, due to a fall in licenses across the zone despite growth in Cloud operations in excess of 40%. Rest of Europe recorded 4.3% growth, in particular the Germany and Benelux Zone with characteristic digital transformation projects. Asia-Pacific posted total growth of 1.8% thanks to demand from clients in particular for API offerings and projects to speed up Digital Business Enablement.\nRevenue by activity (in €m)\nYear Total 2017 2016\nPublished\n2016\nRestated 1\nTotal\nGrowth\nOrganic\nGrowth 1\nLicenses 65.3 81.3 80.3 -19.6% -18.7% Cloud 37.5 - 32.8 - 14.4% Maintenance 145.4 143.0 141.4 1.7% 2.8% Services 51.6 76.8 57.1 -32.9% -9.6% Axway 299.8 301.1 311.6 -0.4% -3.8% (1) at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation\nLicenses , with revenue of €65.3m representing organic growth of -18.7%, recovered in the 4 th quarter with +8% growth. Cloud operations recorded 14.4% organic growth for the first full year, underlining the continued successful implementation of the new Axway product strategy providing a License and private or public Cloud hybrid offering. This 2017 figure should be associated with the amount of the contracts signed during the year -ACV- which stood at €7.3m in a full year of subscription, recognizable in 2018 in particular. Maintenance revenue continued to increase significantly, generating organic growth of 2.8% in spite of the lower demand for licenses. Lastly, Services revenue fell by -9.6% across all zones, except for Asia and Germany where growth in services exceeded 10%.\nFinancial position\nAs at December 31, 2017, Axway's financial position was extremely solid with cash and cash equivalents amounting to €28.1 million, a bank debt of €47.8 million and shareholders' equity of €344.1 million.\nAs at December 31, 2017, net cash and cash equivalents amounted to €20.6 million, enabling the Group to achieve financial ratios that comfortably meet the values required by banking covenants.\nThe operating margin (13.5% for the fiscal year) exceeded the objective (13%) announced mid-year, confirming the solidity of the Axway business model and enabling the company to go ahead with the investments required for its development project.\nNet profit, as at December 31, 2017, stood at €4.4 million (1.5% of revenue) and was impacted in particular by the implementation of the new tax rules in the United States, which led Axway to proceed with an adjustment of €10 million in respect of the reversal of provisioned tax deferrals.\nThe audit process on the annual consolidated financial statements is currently being finalized.\nWorkforce\nAs at December 31, 2017, Axway employed 1,839 persons (518 in France and 1,321 in other countries), down by 91 employees compared with December 31, 2016 (1,930).\nCash dividend\nAxway's Board of Directors intend, at the next General Shareholders' Meeting, to propose the distribution of a dividend of € 0.20 per share in respect of the 2017 fiscal year.\nStrategy & Outlook\n2017 saw Axway undertake several major initiatives of its new Digital Business Enablement Strategy including: integration of the Syncplicity human to human teams and solutions, putting in place the new Cloud operations and its method of contractual agreements by subscription, transformation of offerings, and new proximity to client business objectives. In this framework, the Company decided to implement an additional investment of €15m for the year ahead. Enriching the AMPLIFY digital integration platform also represents a major and discriminating investment for Axway in the years ahead.\nWhile the technologies and services market as a whole experienced a major transformation impacting profitability and strategies, Axway started 2018 with the same conviction as to its positioning as a developer of digital transformation software. Axway has solid \"assets\": 11,000 clients located throughout the world, its widely-recognized Syncplicity MFT and B2B, API and EFSS human to human offerings, an innovative strategy toward the AMPLIFY digital integration platform which provides the flexibility and services companies have come to expect.\nBuoyed by its transformation plan, cost and investment management, a fully-committed management team, good financial health and low financial debt, the company in 2018 is looking forward to growth in Cloud business of over 20% thereby securing the stability of global income.\nRevenue by region and by quarter (in €m)\n1st Quarter 2017 2016\nReported\n2016 Restated 1\nTotal Growth Organic Growth 1 France 19.5 20.1 20.1 -2.6% -2.6% Rest of Europe 15.8 14.6 14.1 8.5% 11.8% America's 29.5 27.5 30.3 7.6% -2.4% Asia/Pacific 3.6 3.3 3.4 11.6% 6.6% Axway 68.5 65.3 67.9 4.9% 0.9% 2nd Quarter 2017 2016 Reported\n2016 Restated 1\nTotal Growth Organic Growth 1 France 19.1 23.8 23.8 -19.7% -19.8% Rest of Europe 17.9 17.3 16.9 3.3% 6.1% America's 33.2 34.1 39.1 -2.7% -15.2% Asia/Pacific 4.1 4.2 4.3 -2.1% -3.7% Axway 74.3 79.4 84.1 -6.5% -11.7% 3rd Quarter 2017 2016 Reported 2016 Restated 1 Total Growth\nOrganic Growth 1\nFrance 17.3 19.3 19.3 -10.4% -10.4% Rest of Europe 16.4 17.6 17.3 -6.7% -4.9% America's 32.8 31.7 34.2 3.4% -4.1% Asia/Pacific 4.1 3.3 3.2 22.1% 27.4% Axway 70.5 71.9 73.9 -1.9% -4.6% 4th Quarter 2017 2016 Reported 2016 Restated 1 Total Growth\nOrganic Growth 1\nFrance 27.8 31.0 31.0 -10.2% -10.2% Rest of Europe 21.7 19.3 19.1 12.1% 13.1% America's 33.3 29.6 31.3 12.3% 6.2% Asia/Pacific 3.8 4.5 4.3 -16.9% -12.5% Axway 86.5 84.5 85.8 2.4% 0.9% (1) at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation\nRevenue by activity and by quarter (in €m)\n1st Quarter 2017 2016 Reported\n2016 Restated 1\nTotal Growth\nOrganic Growth 1 Licenses 9.6 12.4 12.6 -22.8% -24.2% Cloud 7.3 -
