    "text": "MIAMI, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Raquel \"Rocky\" Rodriguez , managing member of McDonald Hopkins' Miami office, has been elected to the national board of directors for Warriors at Ease .\n\"It is truly a privilege to be a part of such a remarkable organization like Warriors at Ease. I am honored to have the ability to give back to our military and their families for all they have done for us,\" said Rodriguez. \"I look forward to continuing and spreading the Warriors at Ease mission of supporting the health and healing of service members, veterans and their families through yoga and meditation.\"\nWarriors at Ease, which was founded in 2009 by Robin Carnes, Molly Birkholm, Karen Soltes and Colonel Patricia Lillis, is a 501c3 with a mission to bring the healing power of yoga and meditation to military communities around the world, especially those affected by combat stress, trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In 2016, Carnes served as the primary instructor for a study funded by the Department of Defense on meditation for PTSD symptoms, and served on the clinical team of an acute PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury treatment program at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\nRodriguez has counseled clients on a wide variety of government, business, and litigation matters for over 30 years, providing unique insights and solutions to the legal, business, political, and public relations challenges that private and public companies face. From 2002 through 2006, she was general counsel to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, where she worked on some of the most complex and urgent issues facing the state. This included conceiving and co-drafting the legislation for and negotiating the largest economic development project in state history, a $310 million economic incentive grant to The Scripps Research Institute. She also counseled Governor Bush with respect to over 200 judicial appointments at all levels of the Florida judiciary.\nAbout McDonald Hopkins\nFounded in 1930, McDonald Hopkins is a business advisory and advocacy law firm with locations in Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Miami, and West Palm Beach.
