(NASDAQ:MRLN) (“Marlin” or the “Company”) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $15.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings included an impact of a net tax benefit resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding the impact of this and other non-recurring items, fourth quarter net income on an adjusted basis was $5.9 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared with $4.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share a year ago.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $25.3 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, up from $17.3 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted net income was $18.9 million, or $1.50 per diluted share.\nCommenting on the Company’s results, Jeffrey A. Hilzinger, Marlin’s President and CEO, said, “Marlin wrapped-up 2017 with a strong fourth quarter highlighted by record origination volume, improved portfolio performance and excellent earnings growth. Total fourth quarter sourced origination volume of $186.5 million was an all-time record for a single quarter and increased 16% from the prior quarter and 23% from the fourth quarter last year. The growth was primarily driven by strong customer demand in our Equipment Finance business. In addition, our working capital loan product, Funding Stream, continued to make a meaningful contribution with fourth quarter origination volume of $16.5 million, or nearly 9% of total sourced originations. This is up from $11.3 million, or 7%, of total sourced originations a year ago. We have now originated over $100 million of Funding Stream loans since the product was introduced in 2015, and we are very pleased with both the growing demand for this product and Funding Stream’s portfolio performance, which continues to exceed our expectations. I am also pleased with the early success of our Direct origination initiative, which identifies additional financing opportunities within our existing customer base. During the quarter, direct origination volume increased to $26.9 million, an increase of 63% over last quarter and 42% over the fourth quarter last year. Also in the quarter, we referred or sold a combined $42.5 million of leases and loans as part of Marlin’s ongoing capital markets activities. As a combined result of these origination and capital markets activities, our Investment in Leases and Loans grew to a record $911.2 million, up more than 3% compared to the previous quarter and up 15% from a year ago.”\nMr. Hilzinger continued, “During the quarter, we took swift action to proactively address trends that were beginning to impact the performance of our portfolio. These efforts included a strategic pivot within our Transportation channel to focus on financing transportation equipment used by small businesses rather than equipment used by transportation companies. Fourth quarter 30+ and 60+ day delinquencies improved sequentially for the first time in six quarters due primarily to an increase in our collection resources. Excluding charge-offs from the Transportation channel, the portfolio in 2017 continued to perform in a range that was consistent with what we have seen over the past four years and, in the near term, we expect our portfolio performance to continue to be stable and remain within our targeted range.”\nMr. Hilzinger concluded, “The tax reform legislation recently passed by Congress has resulted in greater economic optimism among our small business customers, which we expect will result in an increasing demand for equipment and working capital in the future. At the same time, the lower tax rate will significantly improve our earnings power and create a more rapid accumulation of capital which will broaden our strategic options, potentially including enhanced organic growth, M&A opportunities and the return of additional capital to shareholders. Moving forward, our momentum continues to build, and I am very confident in our ability to continue driving profitable growth as we look ahead to 2018 and beyond.”\nResults of Operations\nCombined Equipment Finance, Funding Stream and referral origination volume for the fourth quarter of $186.5 million was up 23.1% from a year ago. Equipment Finance origination volume of $163.6 million in the fourth quarter was up 21.3% from $134.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Funding Stream origination volume in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $16.5 million, up from $11.3 million in the same period a year ago. Referral volume totaled $6.5 million, up from $5.4 million in the fourth quarter last year.\nNet interest and fee margin as a percentage of average finance receivables was 10.57% for the fourth quarter, down 16 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and down 87 basis points from a year ago. The decrease in margin percentage was primarily a result of a decline in late fees and end-of-lease revenue based on certain updated servicing practices, growth in lower yielding Equipment Finance channels and an increase in the Company’s cost of funds, partially offset by an increase of 9 basis points in new origination loan and lease yield over last year. The Company’s cost of funds increased to 145 basis points compared to 139 basis points for the previous quarter and 114 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of the rising interest rate environment.\nOn an absolute basis, net interest and fee income was $23.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $23.1 million for the prior quarter and $21.8 million for the fourth quarter last year. The increase continues to reflect the strong growth in the portfolio and the underlying earnings power of the business.\nOther income was $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.6 million in the prior quarter. The increase is mostly due to a $1.7 million increase in gains-on-sale from the Company’s capital market activity and a $0.1 million increase in Insurance related income. Other income for the fourth quarter last year was $3.0 million. The year-over-year increase in other income is primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in gains-on-sale, $0.3 million increase in Insurance related income, $0.2 million increase in referral fee income, and a $0.1 million increase in servicing fee income.\nOther expenses were $15.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $15.7 million in the prior quarter and $13.5 million in the fourth quarter last year. The decrease from the prior quarter was primarily due to the reversal of $0.4 million of hurricane insurance claims reserves recorded in the prior quarter. The increase from the fourth quarter last year was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the Horizon Keystone acquisition, including intangibles amortization expense, higher salaries and benefits and higher sales commissions. Expenses also increased due to investments in the Direct origination initiative and expenses associated with building-out Marlin’s senior leadership team.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.3%. The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 51.8%, compared to 57.1% on an adjusted basis for the prior quarter and 54.6% in the fourth quarter last year. Marlin expects its efficiency ratio to continue to improve as the Company leverages its fixed costs through continued portfolio growth and from continued operational efficiencies generated by its various process renewal initiatives.\nDue to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted on December 22, 2017 that reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates on these deferred amounts. During the fourth quarter, Marlin recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $10.2 million primarily related to the revaluation of these deferred tax items. As a result, Marlin recorded an income tax benefit of $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, Marlin recorded an income tax provision of $3.3 million, representing an effective tax rate of 37.0%, compared with $2.0 million or 38.3% for the preceding quarter and $2.9 million or 37.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPortfolio Performance\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of total finance receivables was 1.63% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.64% at September 30, 2017 and 1.38% at December 31, 2016, with the year-over-year increase driven by generally higher portfolio delinquency and net charge-offs. Coverage of total 60+ day delinquencies was 263.0% at December 31, 2017 versus 264.4% at December 31, 2016.\nFinance receivables over 30 days delinquent were 1.02% of the Company’s total finance receivables portfolio as of December 31, 2017, an improvement of 11 basis points from the prior quarter but up 22 basis points from December 31, 2016. Finance receivables over 60 days delinquent were 0.55% of the Company’s total finance receivables portfolio as of December 31, 2017, an improvement of 6 basis points from the prior quarter but up 9 basis point from December 31, 2016. Annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs were 1.87% of average total finance receivables versus 1.73% in the third quarter and 1.40% a year ago. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $4.2 million, an increase of $0.4 million from the previous quarter and $1.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, and were largely driven by a return to a more normalized credit environment and higher than expected charge-offs in the Transportation channel.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s consolidated equity to assets ratio was 17.27% and 18.19%, respectively.\nCorporate Developments\nThe Board of Directors of Marlin Business Services Corp. today declared a $0.14 per share quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable February 22, 2018, to shareholders of record on February 12, 2017.

The Company defines net income on an adjusted basis as net income excluding an after-tax charge related to a reserve for restitution in connection with certain payment processing practices in effect prior to February 2016 and charges for associated legal and consulting fees, the after-tax hurricane credit and insurance loss reserves, the after-tax executive severance (Chief Operating Officer), and the net tax benefit from the tax cut and jobs act. The Company defines diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis, return on average assets on an adjusted basis, and return on average equity on an adjusted basis as the calculation used for the “as reported” number substituting net income as reported with the net income on an adjusted basis while using the same denominator in the “as reported” number, where appropriate. The Company defines efficiency ratio on an adjusted basis as the calculation used for the “as reported” ratio adjusting the numerator for the reserve for restitution in connection with certain payment processing practices in effect prior to February 2016, Hurricane insurance loss reserves, and executive severance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful performance metrics for management, investors and lenders, because it means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of the Company's financial performance without the effects of certain adjustments in accordance with GAAP that may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP financial measures. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestor Contacts:\nTaylor Kamp\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\n856-505-4108\nLasse Glassen,\nAddo Investor Relations\nlglassen@addoir.com\n424-238-6249\nMARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per-share data) ASSETS Cash and due from banks $ 3,544 $ 4,055 Interest-earning deposits with banks 63,602 57,702 Total cash and cash equivalents 67,146 61,757 Time deposits with banks 8,110 9,605 Securities available for sale (amortized cost of $11.7 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively) 11,533 5,880 Net investment in leases and loans: Net investment in leases and loans, excluding allowance for credit losses 929,271 807,654 Allowance for credit losses (14,851 ) (10,937 ) Total net investment in leases and loans 914,420 796,717 Intangible assets 1,128 — Goodwill 1,160 — Property and equipment, net 4,204 3,495 Property tax receivables 6,292 5,296 Other assets 26,167 9,408 Total assets $ 1,040,160 $ 892,158 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Deposits $ 809,315 $ 697,357 Other liabilities: Sales and property taxes payable 2,963 2,586 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 31,492 14,809 Net deferred income tax liability 16,741 15,117 Total liabilities 860,511 729,869 Stockholders’ equity: Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value; 5,000,000 shares authorized; none issued — — Common Stock, $0.01 par value; 75,000,000 shares authorized; 12,449,458 and 12,572,114 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively 124 126 Additional paid-in capital 82,588 83,505 Stock subscription receivable (2 ) (2 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (96 ) (138 ) Retained earnings 97,035 78,798 Total stockholders’ equity 179,649 162,289 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 1,040,160 $ 892,158\nMARLIN BUSINESS SERVICES CORP.
