    "text": "Source: Nvidia Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. \nNvidia shares jumped more than 10 percent on Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal earnings for the fourth quarter. \nThe after-market rally more than made up for Nvidia's 4.9 percent drop in regular trading, as the broad market swoon brought down 97 percent of stocks in the S&P 500. \nNvidia will hold a conference call to go over results with analysts at 5 p.m. Eastern time. Earnings: $1.78 per share, vs. $1.17 per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $2.91 billion, vs. $2.69 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. \nRevenue for the quarter jumped 34 percent from a year earlier, and Nvidia's revenue of the full fiscal year of $9.71 billion was up 41 percent, according to a statement . \nNvidia exceeded analysts' expectations in four of its five markets. The biggest category, gaming, produced $1.74 billion in revenue, above the FactSet estimate of $1.54 billion, according to StreetAccount. The second largest area, data center, came up with $606 million in revenue, above the consensus estimate of $552.1 million. \nCryptocurrency demand contributed to sales growth for Nvidia's Pascal-generation graphics processing units for gaming, the company said. \nNvidia said it's expecting $2.9 billion in revenue, plus or minus 2 percent, for the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year. Analysts were expecting guidance of $2.46 billion in revenue for the quarter. \nNvidia said it had a charge of $133 million in the quarter as a result of recently enacted U.S. tax reform. The company expects to have a tax rate of 12 percent, plus or minus 1 percentage point, for the quarter. \nIn the fourth quarter Nvidia introduced the Titan V graphics processing unit for desktop PCs, and it also changed the licensing terms for some of its GPUs. \nThis is breaking news.
