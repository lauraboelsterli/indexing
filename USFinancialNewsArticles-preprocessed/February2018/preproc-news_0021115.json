    "text": "BOGOTA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Colombia’s central bank could continue to lower its benchmark interest rate if it sees inflation of 3 percent in March, bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria said on Wednesday.\nHis comments come a day after he said he saw no more room to lower borrowing costs for now.\nThe seven-member board unexpectedly lowered the benchmark lending rate in January by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent, calling it the last cut in its current cycle, in a bid to boost a still-sluggish economy even as inflation remains above target.\n“We’re not tied, if next month we see very good news in inflation we will continue to lower (rates),” Echavarria said during a presentation at an economic conference in Bogota.\n“I don’t think it will happen, but if inflation is 3 percent in March, clearly we’ll lower rates,” he said.\nAnalysts have criticized what they consider confusing messages from Echavarria.\nHe also said that the bank expects inflation to be close to 3 percent toward the end of the year.\nTwelve-month inflation in January was 3.68 percent, just within the bank’s long-term 2 to 4 percent target range.
