His complaint named Facebook founder and chief executive Zuckerberg and nine other managers, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.\nFacebook could not immediately be reached for comment.\nGermany has some of the world’s toughest laws covering defamation, public incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. But few online cases are prosecuted.\nThe Munich prosecutors’ office said in a statement that, while the posting of certain content on Facebook might breach German law, the failure to delete those posts was not a crime.\nA new German law that could impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($61.5 million) on sites that failed to remove hate speech promptly did not change the situation, it said, as that law did not mean executives committed a crime when their company failed to delete posts.\n“If the individual Facebook users committed crimes in these 442 cases, then the appropriate investigations will be initiated,” it said.\n$1 = 0.8135 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Michelle Martin\n ",
