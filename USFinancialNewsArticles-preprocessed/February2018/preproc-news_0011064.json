    "text": "February 5, 2018 / 11:35 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Olympics: Bach hails North, South Korea for harnessing Olympic spirit Peter Rutherford 3 Min Read \nGANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - North and South Korea will send a “powerful message of peace” to the world when they march together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said on Monday. \nBach, speaking at the opening of the IOC’s 132nd Session in the South Korean coastal city of Gangneung which will host the sliding and skating events at the Feb. 9-25 Games, praised both governments for choosing to harness the Olympic spirit. \n“The Olympic spirit has brought two sides together that for too long were divided by mistrust and animosity. The Olympic spirit has brought real hope for a brighter future for everyone on the Korean Peninsula,” Bach said. \nWhile the Olympics had opened the door to opportunity for talks between the two Koreas, Bach said it was important to see the process through. \n“This initiative gives all parties the chance to reflect on what the future could look like, if we were all guided by this Olympic spirit,” he added. \n“But Korea’s journey does not end here. The political tensions will not disappear overnight. Sport cannot create peace, but the Olympic Games can open the way with powerful symbols.” \nThe talks between Koreas on the Olympics have brought some respite from the standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nNorth Korea are sending 22 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, including 12 ice hockey players who will form a joint team with the South. \nIt will mark the first time the two Koreas will compete as a unified team at the Olympics but the decision has been met with anger from some South Korean athletes, while an online petition against the move garnered tens of thousands of signatories. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the atmosphere on the peninsula had brightened significantly thanks to the approaching Olympic festival of sport.
