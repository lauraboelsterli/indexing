    "text": "WESTPORT, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terex Corporation (NYSE: TEX) today announced fourth quarter 2017 loss from continuing operations of $31.7 million, or ($0.37) per share, on net sales of $1.1 billion. The fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include a one-time $50.4 million charge associated with the new U.S. tax law. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Terex reported a net loss from continuing operations of $313.9 million, or ($2.96) per share, on net sales of $1.0 billion. Income from continuing operations, as adjusted, for was $28.3 million, or $0.33 per share. This compares with income from continuing operations, as adjusted, of $10.7 million or $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Glossary at the end of this press release contains further details regarding these non-GAAP measures.\nFor the full year 2017, Terex reported income from continuing operations of $60.0 million, or $0.63 per share, on net sales of $4.4 billion, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $193.0 million, or ($1.79) per share, on net sales of $4.4 billion for the full year 2016. Income from continuing operations, as adjusted, for the full year 2017 was $128.4 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with $95.3 million, or $0.88 per share, in 2016.\n“The fourth quarter marked an excellent finish to an important year for Terex,” remarked John L. Garrison, Terex President and CEO. “We increased operating margins, bookings and backlog in every segment and significantly improved earnings per share.”\n“We delivered on our commitments in 2017. The sales of MHPS and the remaining Construction businesses concluded the Focus element of our strategy and created substantial value for our shareholders,” continued Mr. Garrison. “We continued to Simplify the company by executing our footprint rationalization plan, exiting 12 manufacturing locations totaling 2.6 million square feet. We reduced administrative expenses while increasing investment in innovation, strategic sourcing, and commercial excellence. We fundamentally improved our capital structure by executing our disciplined capital allocation strategy, reducing debt by $583 million, refinancing at the lowest interest rates in the Company’s history, and returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing $924 million of Terex stock.”\nMr. Garrison concluded, “By implementing our strategy, strengthening the Company, and increasing backlog by 56%, we are well positioned for what we expect to be an improving global market environment in 2018. We expect to increase revenue and improve operating margins in every business segment. We will continue to implement the Simplify and Execute to Win elements of our strategy, and follow our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We expect to deliver 2018 earnings per share of between $2.35 and $2.65, excluding restructuring, transformation investments, and other unusual items, on net sales approximately 10% higher than 2017.”\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Items\nResults of operations reflect continuing operations. All per share amounts are on a fully diluted basis. A comprehensive review of the quarterly financial performance is contained in the presentation that will accompany the Company’s earnings conference call.\nIn this press release, Terex refers to various GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. Terex believes that this non-GAAP information is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses. Terex now calculates its quarterly adjusted effective tax rate by multiplying the adjusted forecast full year effective tax rate by the adjusted pre-tax income. Terex believes this more closely aligns with how its investors analyze quarterly results. 2016 results have been adjusted using the same approach.\nThe Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the timing and magnitude of future charges that would be included in the reported GAAP results.\nThe Glossary at the end of this press release contains further details about this subject.\nConference call\nThe Company has scheduled a one hour conference call to review the financial results on Wednesday, February 14 th , 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET. John L. Garrison, President and CEO, will host the call. A simultaneous webcast of this call will be available from the Investor Relations section of www.terex.com , under Latest Events & Presentations. Participants are encouraged to access the call 10 minutes prior to the starting time. The call will also be archived on the Company’s website, Investor Relations section, in the Event Archive.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking information regarding future events or the Company’s future financial performance based on the current expectations of Terex Corporation.

accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures which management believes provides useful information to investors. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Terex believes that this non-GAAP information is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses. Management of Terex uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to establish internal budgets and targets and to evaluate the Company’s financial performance against such budgets and targets.\nThe amounts described below are unaudited, are reported in millions of U.S. dollars (except share data and percentages), and are as of or for the period ended December, 2017, unless otherwise indicated.\n2018 Outlook: The Company’s 2018 outlook for earnings per share and 2018 full year adjusted forecasted tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude items such as restructuring and other related charges, transformation costs, the impact of the release of tax valuation allowances, gains and losses on divestitures and other unusual items. The Company is not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and impact of such items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s full-year 2018 GAAP financial results.\nAfter-tax gains or losses and per share amounts are calculated using pre-tax amounts, applying a tax rate based on jurisdictional rates to arrive at an after-tax amount. This number is divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding to provide the impact on earnings per share. The Company highlights the impact of these items because when discussing earnings per share, the Company adjusts for items it believes are not reflective of ongoing operating activities in the periods. Restructuring and related charges are a recurring item as Terex’s restructuring programs usually require more than one year to fully implement and the Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency. Although recurring, these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur.\nQ4 2017 Income (loss) from\nContinuing Operations\nbefore Taxes\n(Provision for)\nbenefit from\nIncome Taxes (1)\nIncome (loss)\nfrom Continuing\nOperations\nEarnings (loss)\nper share (2) As Reported (GAAP) $ 25.4 (57.1 ) (31.7) $ (0.37 ) Restructuring & Related (7.8 ) 0.3 (7.5 ) (0.09 ) Deal Related 7.2 (0.2 ) 7.0 0.08 Transformation 9.8 (2.5 ) 7.3 0.09 2017 Tax Act — 50.4 50.4 0.59 Tax & Interim Period (3) — 2.8 2.8 0.03 As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 34.6 (6.3 ) 28.3 $ 0.33 (1) Tax effect on adjustments is calculated using the applicable jurisdictional blended tax rate (2) Based on diluted average shares outstanding of 85.0 million (3) Includes adjustments without related pre-tax amounts and the tax amount necessary to align quarterly tax expense\n(benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate\nYTD 2017 Income (loss) from\nContinuing Operations\nbefore Taxes\n(Provision for)\nbenefit from\nIncome Taxes (1)\nIncome (loss)\nfrom Continuing\nOperations\nEarnings (loss)\nper share (2)\nAs Reported (GAAP) $ 112.0 (52.0 ) 60.0 $ 0.63 Restructuring & Related (12.2 ) (0.5 ) (12.7 ) (0.13 ) Deal Related (20.9 ) (11.3 ) (32.2 ) (0.34 ) Transformation 45.2 (10.1 ) 35.1 0.37 Extinguishment of Debt 53.1 (19.0 ) 34.1 0.36 Asset Impairment (1.6 ) 0.6 (1.0 ) (0.01 ) 2017 Tax Act — 50.4 50.4 0.53 Tax Related (3) — (5.3 ) (5.3 ) (0.06 ) As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 175.6 (47.2 ) 128.4 $ 1.35 (1) Tax effect on adjustments is calculated using the applicable jurisdictional blended tax rate (2) Based on diluted average shares outstanding of 94.9 million (3) Includes adjustments without related pre-tax amounts and the tax amount necessary to align quarterly tax expense (benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate Q4 2016 Income (loss) from\nContinuing Operations\nbefore Taxes\n(Provision for)\nbenefit from\nIncome Taxes (1)\nIncome (loss)\nfrom Continuing\nOperations (2)\nEarnings (loss)\nper share (3) As Reported (GAAP) $ (309.0 ) (5.1 ) (313.9 ) $ (2.96 ) Deal Related (9.0 ) 3.0 (6.0 ) (0.06 ) Restructuring & Related 89.2 (5.5 ) 83.7 0.79\nTransformation 9.3 (2.6 ) 6.7 0.06 Goodwill/Asset Impairment 219.6 (16.6 ) 203.0 1.92 Tax & Interim Period (4) — 37.2 37.2 0.35 As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 0.1 10.4 10.7 $ 0.10 (1) Tax effect on adjustments is calculated using the applicable jurisdictional blended tax rate (2) Excludes $0.2 million net loss attributable to non-controlling interest (3) Based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 105.9 million (4) Includes adjustments without related pre-tax amounts and the tax amount necessary to align quarterly tax expense (benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate (benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate YTD 2016 Income (loss) from\nContinuing Operations\nbefore Taxes\n(Provision for)\nbenefit from\nIncome Taxes (1)\nIncome (loss)\nfrom Continuing\nOperations (2)\nEarnings (loss)\nper share (3) As Reported (GAAP) $ (270.7 ) 77.4 (193.0 ) $ (1.79 ) Deal Related 20.5 (3.4 ) 17.1 0.16 Restructuring & Related 137.2 (19.9 ) 117.3 1.09 Transformation 9.3 (2.6 ) 6.7 0.06 Goodwill/Asset Impairment 219.6 (16.6 ) 203.0 1.88 Tax Related (4) — (55.8 ) (55.8 ) (0.52 ) As Adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 115.9 (20.9 ) 95.3 $ 0.88 (1) Tax effect on adjustments is calculate d using the applicable jurisdictional blended tax rate (2) Excludes $0.3 million net loss attributable to non-controlling interest (3) Based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 107.9 million (4) Includes adjustments without related pre-tax amounts and the tax amount necessary to align quarterly tax expense (benefit) with the forecasted full year as adjusted effective tax rate\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213006489/en/\nTerex Corporation\nBrian Henry, 203-222-5954\nSenior Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations\nbrian.henry@terex.com\nSource: Terex Corporation",
