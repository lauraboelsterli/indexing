    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorney Advertising -- Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Bellicum\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: BLCM) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Bellicum securities between May 8, 2017, and January 30, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/blcm .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nBellicum operates as a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on discovering and developing novel cellular immunotherapies for various forms of cancer. The Company's lead clinical product candidate, BPX-501, is an adjunct T-cell therapy administered after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Bellicum has represented that BPX-501 is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 1/2 clinical trials.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) a substantial undisclosed risk of encephalopathy was associated with the Company's lead product candidate BPX-501; and (2) as a result of the foregoing, Bellicum's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn January 30, 2018, post-market, Bellicum issued a press release announcing, \"that the Company has received notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that U.S. studies of BPX-501\", the Company's lead product candidate, \"have been placed on a clinical hold following three cases of encephalopathy deemed as possibly related to BPX-501.\" On this news, Bellicum's share price has fallen sharply during intraday trading on January 31, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
