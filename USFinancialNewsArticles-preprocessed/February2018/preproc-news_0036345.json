    "text": "February 20, 2018 / 12:12 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Asda sales growth slows in Christmas quarter Reuters Staff 2 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of Walmart ( WMT.N ), the world’s largest retailer, reported a slowdown in underlying sales growth for its latest quarter despite industry inflation and weak comparative numbers with the previous year. Asda, the UK’s third largest grocer after market leader Tesco ( TSCO.L ) and No. 2 Sainsbury’s ( SBRY.L ), said like-for-like sales rose 0.5 percent in the three months to Dec. 31, its fiscal fourth quarter. That compared to a rise of 1.1 percent in the previous quarter but did mark a third straight quarter of underlying sales growth. Prior to that it had endured three years of sales falls. Asda was up against weak comparative numbers as fourth quarter 2016 sales had fallen 2.9 percent. The supermarket also benefited from food price inflation across the industry. According to market researcher Kantar Worldpanel grocery inflation was 3.7 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 31. In January Roger Burnley succeeded Walmart veteran Sean Clarke as Asda’s chief executive, having joined the grocer as head of operations in October 2016. He is a former executive of Sainsbury‘s. “We know we have more work to do in the UK, however we are encouraged by recent results in key areas of our business,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.
