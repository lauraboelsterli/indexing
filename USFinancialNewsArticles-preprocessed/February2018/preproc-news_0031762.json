    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Integrated Ventures Inc. (OTCQB: INTV)(\"Company\") today reported the filing with the SEC, of its Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q), for its Second Quarter, ended December 31, 2017, with an official release scheduled for 10AM.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenues totaling $105,088, consisting of $59,498 in mining fees and $45,590 in mining equipment sales. The cost of revenues was $46,818, resulting in a gross profit of $58,270 and profit margins of 55%.\n\"The Company had successfully launched operations and received revenues from sales of mining equipment and from operating two cryptocurrency mining locations in Pennsylvania. As we have entered 2018 with a solid cash position, zero convertible debt, over 500k in mining assets while generating revenues of $105,088, in only 39 days of operations with outstanding margins,\" commented Steve Rubakh, Chief Executive Officer.\nHe also added: \"Note that included in our net non-cash loss for six months ended December 31, 2017, was a non-cash preferred restricted stock-based executive compensation of $409,000, which resulted in large part from valuation of shares issued at increased stock prices. Excluding this non-cash expense, we would have reported a net income of $164,039, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\"\nSecond Quarter Financial Highlights:\nAchieved gross margin of $58,270 on total revenues of $105,088, or approximately 55% Accumulated cryptocurrency assets with market value of $43,786 and cash reserves of $17,730 resulting from sales of mining rigs at December 31, 2017 Net cash proceeds from the sale of investments of $579,460 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 Investment in cryptocurrency mining equipment and supporting assets in excess of $310,000 Increase in total assets from $296,280 at June 30, 2017 to $508,105 at December 31, 2017, or an increase of approximately 71% Decrease in total liabilities from $504,210 at June 30, 2017 to $214,946 at December 31, 2017, or a decrease of approximately 57% Positive stockholders' equity of $293,159 at December 31, 2017 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company had retired and highly dilutive warrants, previously issued to convertible debt holders Eliminated remainder of the convertible debt through share exchange, using OTTV shares and conversion to the common stock Completed an equity based capital raise in the amount of $160,000 by selling a preferred restricted stock Received $720,000 in net proceeds from sale of 462,900 restricted common shares of the Company at $1.62 per share and a three-year warrants for the purchase of 347,175 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of $2.16 per share.\nThe Company had purchased or assembled in excess of $288,000 of mining rigs and the number of installed miners had reached 125. The total number of connected units is directly related to the availability of electric power, which had reached its maximum utilization capacity at our first two locations. In 2018, the Company had purchased an additional 255 mining rigs and plans to install them in our third mining location.\nThe previously planned real estate purchase of the third location has been canceled due to the power limitations. The Company is in process of signing a 2 year lease agreement for the facility, equipped with a 4000 amps heavy power service, capable of hosting of up to 1,500+ mining rigs.\nAbout Integrated Ventures Inc: The Company is focused on operating subsidiaries in the digital currency sector.
