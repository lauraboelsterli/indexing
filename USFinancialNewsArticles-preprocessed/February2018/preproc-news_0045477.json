Investment activity in 2017, including hotel acquisitions, development, and debt investments, totaled a record of $624.9 million for the Company. The investments were funded in part by net proceeds of $318.5 million from common and preferred equity offerings completed during the year and $120.2 million from disposition proceeds as a continuation of the Company's capital recycling efforts.\nCapital Investment\nThe Company invested $11.9 million and $37.2 million in capital improvements during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The scope of work ranged from common space improvements to complete guestroom renovations, as well as revamped bar areas and fitness centers to enhance guest experience. Notably, the Marriott Boulder is currently undergoing a $6.7 million comprehensive guestroom renovation where the Company has taken advantage of a significant value-add opportunity by converting underutilized meeting space into eight additional guestrooms. The project is expected to be complete during the second quarter of 2018.\nCapital Markets & Balance Sheet\nDuring the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end, the Company completed the following capital markets transactions:\nOn October 2, 2017, the Company entered into two separate $100 million interest rate swap agreements that became effective on January 29, 2018, to fix the interest rate on a portion of its variable interest rate unsecured indebtedness. The swaps convert LIBOR to an average fixed rate of 1.98% through January 31, 2023, and as a result, approximately 67% of the Company's total indebtedness carries a fixed interest rate. On November 13, 2017, the Company closed on a public offering of 6,400,000 shares of its 6.25% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $160.0 million. The Company contributed the net proceeds to its operating partnership to repay the outstanding balance on its revolving line of credit and other general corporate purposes. On December 11, 2017, the Company redeemed all 3,000,000 shares of its 7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Stock for $75.2 million at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On February 5, 2018, the Company announced its intent to redeem all 3,400,000 shares of the Company's 7.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Stock on March 20, 2018, for an estimated $85.3 million at a redemption price of $25 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. On February 15, 2018, the Company closed on a new seven-year $225 million unsecured term loan. The term loan includes an accordion feature that, subject to certain conditions, allows the Company to request an increase in lender commitments up to an aggregate of $375 million. The unsecured term loan matures on February 14, 2025, carries an interest rate based on an improved pricing grid ranging from 180 basis points to 255 basis points plus LIBOR depending upon the Company's leverage ratio, and includes a delayed draw feature. At closing, the Company received an initial loan advance of $140 million and used the proceeds to replace its existing seven-year $140 million unsecured term loan.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had the following:\nTotal outstanding debt of $873.1 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.89 percent. Undrawn capacity on its senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $285.0 million. Total net debt, which the Company defines as total outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents, to trailing twelve month pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 4.1x.\nAt February 15, 2018, the Company had the following:\nTotal outstanding debt of $866.8 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.98 percent. Undrawn capacity on its senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $290.0 million.\nCommon Dividend Increase\nOn February 5, 2018, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per share on its common stock and per common unit of limited partnership interest in Summit Hotel OP, LP. The increase represents a 5.9 percent increase over the Company's previous common dividend of $0.17 per share and an annualized yield of 5.1 percent based on the February 20, 2018 closing stock price.\nIn addition, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of:\n$0.4453125 per share on its 7.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. $0.403125 per share on its 6.45% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. $0.390625 per share on its 6.25% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.\nThe common and preferred dividends are payable on February 28, 2018 to holders of record as of February 16, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is providing its outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018 based on its 83 hotels owned as of February 21, 2017. Also included in the Company's 2018 outlook is the redemption of its 7.125% Series C Preferred Stock in March 2018 for an estimated $85.3 million, which includes accrued and unpaid dividends, and the opening of the 168-guestroom Hyatt House Orlando Universal development scheduled for mid-year 2018.

Unless otherwise indicated, we present FFO applicable to our common shares and common units. We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operational performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. Our computation of FFO differs slightly from the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO related to the reporting of corporate depreciation and amortization expense. Our computation may also differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. References to FFO are based on our computation of FFO and not the computation of NAREIT-defined FFO unless otherwise noted.\nWe further adjust FFO for certain additional items that are not included in the definition of FFO, such as hotel transaction and pursuit costs, equity-based compensation, loan transaction costs, prepayment penalties and certain other expenses, which we refer to as AFFO. We believe that AFFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.\nWe caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. FFO and AFFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income (loss) as a measure of our operating performance. FFO and AFFO may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, debt service obligations and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that FFO and AFFO can enhance the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss). Above we have included a quantitative reconciliation of FFO and AFFO to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income (loss). Dollar amounts in such reconciliation are in thousands.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income or loss, excluding (i) interest, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures, and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Our management also uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions. We further adjust EBITDA by adding back hotel transaction and pursuit costs, equity-based compensation, impairment losses, and certain other nonrecurring expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs.\nWith respect to hotel EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. We believe the property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis.\nWe caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and hotel EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and hotel EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative measure of our net income (loss) or operating performance. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and hotel EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties. Although we believe that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and hotel EBITDA can enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily a better indicator of any trend as compared to a comparable GAAP measure such as net income (loss). Above, we include a quantitative reconciliation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and hotel EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net income (loss) and operating income (loss).\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/summit-hotel-properties-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300602241.html\nSOURCE Summit Hotel Properties, Inc.",
