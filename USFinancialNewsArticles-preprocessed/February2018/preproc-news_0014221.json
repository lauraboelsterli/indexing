    "text": "By David Z. Morris 12:48 PM EST \nAfter a long slump punctuated by a sharp Friday selloff, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies began recovering some losses Saturday morning. Bitcoin’s price had risen 15% to $9,279 at press time, from a Friday low of just over $8,064, according to Coindesk’s index . Cryptocurrencies including Ether and Bitcoin Cash saw parallel recoveries. \nIt’s too early to say whether that means the cryptocurrency market has found a bottom, after a mania-inflated bubble popped in mid-December at a peak Bitcoin price just short of $20,000 . Bitcoin is still off more than 50% from that high – but also up nearly 800% from one year ago. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe crash of the last six weeks can be broadly interpreted as profit-taking by traders who sensed peak mania, followed by panic selling from late entrants who thought cryptocurrency was a get-rich-quick guarantee but had little underlying faith in the sector. In that atmosphere, superficial negative news (a.k.a. ‘headline risk’), such as Facebook’s ban on crypto advertising , the collapse of bad actors , and misplaced rumors that India would ban Bitcoin likely fed into Friday’s rout . \nLooking at the broader pattern of boom and bust in the highly speculative cryptocurrency market, it seems unlikely that today’s rebound will continue into new highs soon, or even a big recovery. For instance, after a near-50% Bitcoin crash in early 2014, the price gradually slumped for more than a year before investor interest began warming up again in late 2016. And while work continues on infrastructure development and fundamental innovations such as Bitcoin’s Lightning Network , cryptocurrency’s promise of frictionless global payments is still likely years away from becoming mainstream reality.
