Sophomore guard Rawle Alkins had 16 points on 6-of-8 shooting, and senior center Dusan Ristic contributed 12 points and nine rebounds.\nTrier and Alkins each made all four of their 3-point attempts. Alkins missed three of the previous four games due to foot soreness.\nJunior forward Robert Franks scored 25 points and made 5 of 7 3-point attempts for Washington State, which lost to the Wildcats for the 13th consecutive time. Sophomore guard Malachi Flynn had 11 points and a career-high 11 assists, and junior guard Viontâ€˜e Daniels scored 10 points.\nThe Cougars (9-12, 1-8) were outrebounded 42-23 while losing their fourth straight game and falling for the eighth time in the past nine.\nArizona shot 60.9 percent from the field and was 10 of 17 from 3-point range. Washington State shot 40.7 percent and was 9 of 24 from long range.\nThe Wildcats shot a blistering 66.7 percent from the field while rolling up a 19-point halftime lead, and they continued to pile on in the second half.\nThe Cougars scored four of the first six points in the second half before the Wildcats responded with a 20-2 spurt. A basket by Alkins culminated the run and gave Arizona a 75-40 edge with 12:58 left in the game.\nThe closest Washington State got over the remainder of the contest was 23 points at 80-57 with 8:36 remaining.\nThe Wildcats reached 100 points for the third time this season.\nTrier (15 points on 5-of-6 shooting), Ayton (14 on 7-of-8) and Alkins (11, 4-of-5) combined for 40 points on 16-of-19 shooting in the first half. Ayton had 10 rebounds as the Wildcats had a 22-9 edge on the boards while taking a 53-34 lead into the break.\nThe lead reached 20 for the first time when Trier drained a 3-pointer with 4:05 remaining before halftime.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
