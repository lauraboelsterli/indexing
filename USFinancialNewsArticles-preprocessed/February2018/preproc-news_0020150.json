    "text": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, LLC (\"SIRE\" or the \"Company\") announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nResults for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2018 (Amounts in $ and 000's, except Book Value per Unit)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet Income\n1,181\n5,632\nGross Margin\n2,708\n7,183\nModified EBITDA\n4,165\n8,197\nTotal Debt\n12,534\n20,566\nBook Value (Members' Equity)\n106,508\n108,709\nBook Value per basic unit *\n7,992\n8,157\n* net of distributions\nSIRE reported net income of $1.2 million, or $88.62 per unit, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net income of $5.6 million, or $422.60 per unit, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nSIRE revenue from operations was $50.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $52.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nModified EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and unrealized hedging gains and losses was $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company's debt continues to shrink, as we were able to reduce our total debt outstanding by $8.0 million dollars compared to December 31, 2016. This reduction included a $1.5 million prepayment of our term loan for March 2018.\nSIRE's book value was lower at December 31, 2017 by $2.2 million compared to December 31, 2016. However, the book value is net of $11.2 million paid in member distributions in February 2017, and accrued at December 31, 2017 for payment in January 2018. The aggregate amount of distributions made to our members totaled $840 per unit.\nSIRE had $2.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $36.0 million available under revolving loan agreements, for a total cash and available borrowings of $38.5 million at December 31, 2017. The cash flow provided by operating activities was $8.5 million compared to $9.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nBrian Cahill, SIRE's President and CEO stated, \"this first quarter of Fiscal 2018, we saw very tight margins, continuing the trends of the previous quarter. Corn prices are down slightly per bushel as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. However, ethanol prices in the U.S. have been trending downwards over the past twelve months. Demand for ethanol has been strong with the lower prices, both in the U.S. and abroad. The industry has continued to adjust and we expect margins to remain positive but are becoming more dependent on continued good export demand. Our distiller grains have also seen increased demand offset by reduced prices, and a shift to a heavier weighting of wet distiller grains.\"\nDuring the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, SIRE produced 31.7 million gallons of ethanol, compared to 29.9 million gallons during the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. Cahill commented - \"we continue to evaluate and implement new production technology. We will continue to focus on running the plant efficiently, increasing our ethanol yield, with a balance of optimizing the yield and profit.\"\nAbout Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, LLC:\nSIRE is located on 275 acres in Council Bluffs, Iowa, operating a 140 million gallon per year ethanol plant. SIRE began producing ethanol in February, 2009 and sells its ethanol, distillers grains, corn syrup, and corn oil in the continental United States, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"1995 Act\").

Management believes that Modified EBITDA provides useful information to investors as a measure of comparison with peer and other companies.

Modified EBITDA calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our computation of Modified EBITDA may not be comparable with a similarly-titled measure of another company.\nModified EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, unrealized hedging gains and losses, and other significant noncash expenses was $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 , compared to $8.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.
