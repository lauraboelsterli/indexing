    "text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is accusing 's former campaign chairman of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.\nThe new allegation against Paul Manafort comes in a newly unsealed indictment made public Friday. The indictment followed a guilty plea by Manafort's longtime business associate, Rick Gates.\nThe indictment accuses Manafort of paying the former politicians, informally known as the \"Hapsburg group,\" to appear to be \"independent\" analysts when in fact they were paid lobbyists. Some of the covert lobbying took place in the U.S.\nThe indictment says the group was managed by a former European chancellor. Court papers accuse Manafort of using offshore accounts to pay the group more than 2 million euros.\nWATCH: Mueller investigating whether Manafort offered banker a job in WH show chapters Mueller investigating whether Paul Manafort offered banker a job in Trump White House in exchange for loans 5:44 PM ET Wed, 21 Feb 2018 | 00:54",
