This was primarily the result of a decrease in political advertising revenue of approximately $34.5 million due to 2017 being the \"off-year\" of the two-year election cycle. This decrease was partially offset by increases in national advertising revenue of $1.8 million and retransmission consent revenue of approximately $7.9 million, primarily due to higher retransmission consent rates.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses .\nBroadcast operating expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased $22.2 million, or 17%, to $150.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions collectively accounted for approximately $40.5 million of our broadcast operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the 2016 Acquisitions accounted for approximately $22.0 million of our broadcast operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016. Including the impact of the 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions, total retransmission expense increased $9.3 million, or 35%, to $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, consistent with increases in retransmission consent revenue.\nExcluding the impact of the 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions, in the fourth quarter of 2017:\nTotal non-compensation expenses increased $1.8 million, or 3%, primarily due to retransmission expense (reverse network compensation) increases of $3.6 million, partially offset by decreases in professional fees of $1.2 million. Total compensation expenses increased $1.8 million, or 3%. Non-cash share-based compensation expenses were $2.8 million and $0.3 million in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCorporate and Administrative Operating Expenses .\nCorporate and administrative expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) decreased $1.8 million, or 20%, to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects the following:\nNon-compensation expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 24%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to decreases of $0.7 million in legal and other professional fees related to the acquisitions completed in 2017 compared to those completed in 2016. Compensation expenses decreased $0.8 million, or 17%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to decreases in incentive compensation. Non-cash share-based compensation expenses were $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTaxes.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we made aggregate federal and state income tax payments of $0.8 million. We did not make any federal or state income tax payments in the fourth quarter of 2016. The TCJA, that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, reduced the value of our deferred tax liabilities, with a credit to earnings for a reduction of those liabilities. Accordingly, we recorded a tax benefit of $134.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a tax expense of $24.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, the TCJA is expected to materially affect our income tax obligations in 2018 and subsequent years. Among other things, the new law should result in a positive effect on our net earnings and earnings per share. It will also limit or eliminate certain deductions, to which we have been entitled in past years, likely increasing our federal and state income tax payment obligations beginning in 2018.\nResults of Operations for the Fourth Quarter of 2017 on Combined Historical Basis:\nRevenue (Less Agency Commissions).\nOn a Combined Historical Basis, total revenue decreased $41.9 million, or 15%, to $233.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The changes in Combined Historical Basis revenue were approximately as follows:\nLocal advertising revenue (including internet/digital/mobile) was unchanged. National advertising revenue increased $2.5 million, or 8%, to $32.0 million. Political advertising revenue decreased $55.9 million, or 88%, to $7.5 million. Retransmission consent revenue increased $11.5 million, or 20%, to $69.5 million. Other revenue increased $0.1 million, or 2%, to $3.9 million.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses .\nOn a Combined Historical Basis, broadcast operating expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased $4.2 million, or 3%, to $150.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The net increase was primarily the result of:\nRetransmission expense (reverse network compensation) increased $6.0 million, or 20%, to $35.6 million, consistent with increases in retransmission consent revenue. Compensation expense decreased by approximately $0.5 million, or 1%, to $76.9 million.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 on As-Reported Basis:\nRevenue (Less Agency Commissions).\nThe table below presents our revenue (less agency commissions) by type for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nAmount\nPercent\nPercent\nPercent\nIncrease\nIncrease\nAmount\nof Total\nAmount\nof Total\n(Decrease)\n(Decrease)\nRevenue (less agency commissions):\nLocal (including internet/digital/mobile)\n$ 451,261\n51.1%\n$ 403,336\n49.6%\n$ 47,925\n12 %\nNational\n118,817\n13.5%\n98,351\n12.1%\n20,466\n21 %\nPolitical\n16,498\n1.9%\n90,095\n11.1%\n(73,597)\n(82)%\nRetransmission consent\n276,603\n31.3%\n200,879\n24.7%\n75,724\n38 %\nOther\n19,549\n2.2%\n19,804\n2.5%\n(255)\n(1)%\nTotal\n$ 882,728\n100.0%\n$ 812,465\n100.0%\n$ 70,263\n9 %\nThe 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions collectively accounted for approximately $232.2 million of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017, and the 2016 Acquisitions accounted for approximately $130.4 million of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExcluding the revenue contributed by the 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions, our total revenue decreased by $31.6 million. This was primarily the result of a decrease in political advertising revenue of approximately $63.4 million, due to 2017 being the \"off-year\" of the two-year election cycle. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in retransmission consent revenue of approximately $36.8 million primarily due to higher retransmission consent rates.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses.\nBroadcast operating expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased $82.0 million, or 17%, to $557.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions collectively accounted for approximately $135.6 million of our broadcast operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2017, and the 2016 Acquisitions accounted for approximately $74.6 million of our broadcast operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Including the impact of the 2017 Acquisitions and 2016 Acquisitions, total retransmission expense increased $38.7 million, or 40%, to $136.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, consistent with increases in retransmission consent revenue.\nExcluding the impact of the 2017 Acquisitions and the 2016 Acquisitions, in the year ended December 31, 2017:\nNon-compensation expenses increased by $20.3 million, or 9%, primarily due to retransmission expense (reverse network compensation) increases of $19.3 million and professional fee increases of $2.7 million. Compensation expenses increased $0.7 million, or less than 1%.\nCorporate and Administrative Operating Expenses .\nCorporate and administrative expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) decreased $8.8 million, or 22%, to $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease reflects in part the following:\nNon-compensation expense decreased $7.3 million, or 31%, due primarily to decreases of $8.5 million of legal and other professional fees related to the acquisitions completed in 2017 compared to those completed in 2016. Compensation expenses decreased $1.5 million, or 9%, primarily as a result of decreases in incentive compensation. Non-cash share-based compensation expenses were $4.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGain or Loss on Disposal of Assets, net.\nWe recorded a gain on disposal of assets of $74.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and a loss on disposal of assets of $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On May 30, 2017, we tendered two of our broadcast licenses and made other modifications to our broadcast spectrum related to our participation in the FCC's reverse auction for broadcast spectrum. Proceeds from this auction, which we received on August 7, 2017, were $90.8 million while the combined cost of the assets disposed of was $13.1 million. Due to planning in connection with this transaction and our recently completed acquisitions, we have been able to defer any related income tax obligations on a long-term basis.\nLoss from Early Extinguishment of Debt.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.9 million, or approximately $1.7 million after tax, related to the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $32.0 million, or approximately $19.5 million after tax, related to the tender offer and redemption of our 7½% senior notes due 2020.\nTaxes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we made aggregate federal and state income tax payments totaling $2.0 million compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Primarily as a result of the enactment of the TCJA, in the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded a tax benefit of $68.7 million, compared a tax provision of $43.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 on Combined Historical Basis:\nRevenue (Less Agency Commissions).\nOn a Combined Historical Basis, revenue decreased $50.9 million, or 5%, to $895.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The changes in Combined Historical Basis revenue were approximately as follows:\nLocal advertising revenue (including internet/digital/mobile) decreased $6.0 million, or 1%, to $459.6 million. National advertising revenue increased $2.6 million, or 2%, to $122.1 million. Political advertising revenue decreased $101.0 million, or 86%, to $16.5 million. Retransmission consent revenue increased $53.3 million, or 24%, to $279.8 million. Other revenue increased $0.1 million, or less than 1%, to $17.1 million.\nLocal and national advertising revenue decreased $3.4 million, or 1%, in part, as a result of the impact of the broadcast of the 2017 Super Bowl on our FOX-affiliated stations generating approximately $0.6 million of local and national advertising revenue, compared to $2.1 million that we earned from the broadcast of the 2016 Super Bowl on our CBS-affiliated stations, and the lack of revenue from Olympic Games in 2017 compared with $8.2 million of revenue from the Olympic Games in 2016.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses .\nOn a Combined Historical Basis, broadcast operating expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased $17.0 million, or 3%, to $570.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects, in part:\nRetransmission expense (reverse network compensation) increased $26.9 million, or 24%, to $138.8 million, consistent with increases in retransmission consent revenue.

Our estimates for the first quarter of 2018 include approximately $9.8 million of revenues and $6.8 million of broadcast operating expenses estimated to be contributed by the stations acquired after the first quarter of 2017.\nLow End\n% Change\nHigh End\n% Change\nGuidance for\nFrom\nGuidance for\nFrom\nAs-Reported\nthe First\nAs-Reported\nthe First\nAs-Reported\nFirst\nQuarter of\nFirst Quarter of\nQuarter of\nFirst Quarter of\nQuarter of\nSelected operating data:\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\n2017\n(dollars in thousands)\nOPERATING REVENUE:\nRevenue (less agency commissions)\n$ 223,000\n10 %\n$ 228,000\n12 %\n$ ��203,461\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\n(before depreciation, amortization and\nloss (gain) on disposals of assets):\nBroadcast\n$ 152,000\n14 %\n$ 156,000\n17 %\n$ 133,471\nCorporate and administrative\n$ 8,750\n14 %\n$ 9,500\n23 %\n$ 7,709\nOTHER SELECTED DATA:\nPolitical advertising revenue\n(less agency commissions)\n$ 5,000\n279 %\n$ 5,500\n316 %\n$ 1,321\nComments on First Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nWe are currently negotiating two large MVPD agreement renewals and, while we cannot assure the outcome of the negotiations, we currently anticipate that the renewals will be retroactive to January 1, 2018.\nRevenue.\nBased on our current forecasts for the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate changes from the first quarter of 2017 as outlined below:\nWe believe our first quarter of 2018 local advertising revenue (including internet/digital/mobile) will increase by 1% to 2%. We expect our first quarter of 2018 national advertising revenue will change by -3% to +1%. We believe our first quarter of 2018 political advertising revenue will range between approximately $5.0 to $5.5 million, reflecting 2018 being an on-year of the political advertising revenue cycle. We believe our first quarter of 2018 retransmission consent revenue will range between $85 million and $87.5 million, an increase of 26% to 29%.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate our revenue will reflect a $13.2 million incremental increase from the 2017 Acquisitions.\nIncluded in our forecast of local and national advertising revenue above, we anticipate that the revenue from the broadcast of the 2018 Super Bowl on our NBC-affiliated stations will be approximately $2.3 million, compared to $0.6 million that we earned from the broadcast of the 2017 Super Bowl on our FOX-affiliated stations. Our portfolio of NBC-affiliated stations is much larger and these NBC-affiliated stations serve larger television markets than our portfolio of FOX-affiliated stations. In addition, we anticipate that our revenue from the broadcast of the Winter Olympic Games on our NBC-affiliated stations will approximate $5.0 million to $5.8 million; there were no Olympic broadcasts in the first quarter of 2017.\nBroadcast Operating Expenses (before depreciation, amortization and loss (gain) on disposal of assets).\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate our broadcast operating expenses will reflect a $8.4 million incremental increase from the 2017 Acquisitions, as well as the anticipated increases in payroll and related employee benefits. Included in our first quarter 2018 broadcast operating expenses are network programming fees currently estimated to range between $42.5 million and $43.7 million, compared to $32.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-cash stock based compensation expenses expected to be included in broadcast operating expenses are $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCorporate and Administrative Operating Expenses (before depreciation, amortization and loss (gain) on disposal of assets).\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate our corporate and administrative operating expenses will increase to within a range of approximately $8.8 million to $9.5 million, reflecting an anticipated increase from the first quarter of 2017 of approximately $1.1 million to $1.8 million as a result of routine compensation increases and higher legal and other professional fees in 2018 related to potential acquisitions. Non-cash stock based compensation expenses expected to be included in expenses are $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, unchanged from the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company\nWe are a television broadcast company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, that owns and operates over 100 television stations across 57 television markets that collectively broadcast over 200 program streams including over 100 channels affiliated with the CBS Network, the NBC Network, the ABC Network and the FOX Network. Our portfolio includes the number-one or number-two ranked television station for both overall audience and news audience in all 57 of our 57 markets, which collectively cover approximately 10.4 percent of total United States television households.\nCautionary Statements for Purposes of the \"Safe Harbor\" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nThis press release contains statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the federal securities laws. These \"forward-looking statements\" are not statements of historical facts, and may include, among other things, statements regarding our current expectations and beliefs of operating results for the first quarter of 2018 or other periods, the impact of recently completed transactions, future operating expenses, future income tax payments and other future events. Actual results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from the current expectations and beliefs discussed in this press release. All information set forth in this release is as of the date hereof. We do not intend, and undertake no duty, to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. Information about certain potential factors that could affect our business and financial results and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements are included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and may be contained in reports subsequently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nConference Call Information\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter operating results on February 27, 2018. The call will begin at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The live dial-in number is 1 (800) 946-0716 and the confirmation code is 6165505. The call will be webcast live and available for replay at www.gray.tv . The taped replay of the conference call will be available at 1 (888) 203-1112, Confirmation Code: 6165505 until March 29, 2018.\nEffects of Acquisitions and Divestitures on Our Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Terms\nFrom October 31, 2013 through December 31, 2017, we completed 23 acquisition transactions and three divestiture transactions. As more fully described in our Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today and in our prior disclosures, these transactions added a net total of 51 television stations in 31 television markets, including 26 new television markets, to our operations.\nWe refer to the eight stations we acquired (excluding the stations acquired in the Clarksburg Acquisition) during 2017 and the stations we commenced operating under an LMA during that period as the \"2017 Acquisitions.\" We refer to the 13 stations acquired in 2016, and that we retained in those transactions, as well as the stations in the Clarksburg Acquisition that we commenced operating under an LMA on June 1, 2016, as the \"2016 Acquisitions.\" During 2015, we completed six acquisitions, which collectively added seven television stations in six markets (four new markets) to our operations, and we refer to those stations as the \"2015 Acquisitions.\" Unless the context of the following discussion requires otherwise, we refer to the stations acquired in the 2017 Acquisitions, the 2016 Acquisitions and the 2015 Acquisitions, collectively, as the \"Acquisitions.\"\nDue to the significant effect that our acquisitions and divestitures have had on our results of operations, and in order to provide more meaningful period over period comparisons, we present herein certain financial information on a \"Combined Historical Basis.\" Unless otherwise defined, Combined Historical Basis reflects financial results that have been compiled by adding Gray's historical revenue and broadcast expenses to the historical revenue and broadcast expenses of the Acquisitions and subtracting the historical revenues and broadcast expenses of divested stations as if they had been acquired or divested, respectively, on January 1, 2015 (the beginning of the earliest period presented) (the \"Completed Transactions\").\nCombined Historical Basis financial information does not include any adjustments for other events attributable to the Completed Transactions except \"Broadcast Cash Flow,\" \"Broadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses,\" \"Operating Cash Flow as Defined in the Senior Credit Agreement\" and \"Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash\" each give effect to expected synergies, and \"Free Cash Flow\" on a Combined Historical Basis gives effect to the financings and certain expected operating synergies related to the Completed Transactions. \"Operating Cash Flow as Defined in the Senior Credit Agreement\" and \"Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash\" on a Combined Historical Basis also reflect the add-back of legal and other professional fees incurred in completing acquisitions. Certain of the Combined Historical Basis financial information has been derived from, and adjusted based on, unaudited, unreviewed financial information prepared by other entities, which Gray cannot independently verify. We cannot assure you that such financial information would not be materially different if such information were audited or reviewed and no assurances can be provided as to the accuracy of such information, or that our actual results would not differ materially from the Combined Historical Basis financial information if the Completed Transactions had been completed at the stated date. In addition, the presentation of Combined Historical Basis, \"Broadcast Cash Flow,\" \"Broadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses,\" \"Operating Cash Flow as Defined in the Senior Credit Agreement,\" \"Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash\" and \"Free Cash Flow,\" and the adjustments to such information, including expected synergies resulting from such transactions, may not comply with GAAP or the requirements for pro forma financial information under Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.\nFrom time to time, Gray supplements its financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") by disclosing the non-GAAP financial measures Broadcast Cash Flow, Broadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses, Operating Cash Flow as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement, Free Cash Flow and Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash. These non-GAAP amounts are used by us to approximate the amount used to calculate key financial performance covenants contained in our debt agreements and are used with our GAAP data to evaluate our results and liquidity. These non-GAAP amounts may be provided on an As-Reported Basis as well as a Combined Historical Basis.\nWe define Broadcast Cash Flow as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, corporate and administrative expenses, broadcast non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any gain or loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, interest expense, any income tax expense, non-cash 401(k) expense less any gain on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program broadcast obligations and network compensation revenue.\nWe define Broadcast Cash Flow Less Cash Corporate Expenses as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any gain or loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, interest expense, any income tax expense, and non-cash 401(k) expense, less any gain on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program broadcast obligations and network compensation revenue.\nWe define Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement as Combined Historical Basis net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, interest expense, any income tax expense, non-cash 401(k) expense and pension expenses less any gain or loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program broadcast obligations, network compensation revenue and cash contributions to pension plans.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net income plus loss from early extinguishment of debt, non-cash stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of intangible assets and program broadcast rights), any loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, any income tax expense, non-cash 401(k) expense and pension expense, less any gain or loss on disposal of assets, any miscellaneous income, any income tax benefits, payments for program broadcast obligations, network compensation revenue, contributions to pension plans, amortization of original issue discount on our debt, capital expenditures (net of any insurance proceeds) and the payment of income taxes (net of any refunds received).\nOur Total Leverage Ratio, Net of All Cash is the total outstanding principal of our long-term debt and certain other obligations as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement less all cash divided by our average Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement for the preceding eight quarters. This average is calculated by dividing the sum of our Operating Cash Flow as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement for the preceding eight quarters by two.\nThese non-GAAP terms are not defined in GAAP and our definitions may differ from, and therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness. Such terms are used by management in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation on As-Reported Basis, in thousands:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2015\nNet income\n$ 165,570\n$ 35,834\n$
