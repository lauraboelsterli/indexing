    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ankura announced today the appointment of Robert J. Frezza as Senior Managing Director. A recognized restructuring advisor with more than 33 years of experience, he has provided a broad range of consulting services to clients in numerous industries. Over the past 19 years, he has specialized in leading creditors through complex restructuring engagements in both out-of-court and in-court chapter 11 proceedings. Mr. Frezza is based in New York.\nMr. Frezza will concentrate his efforts in helping to lead and expand the firm's world-class lender advisory practice. Mr. Frezza also brings M&A and refinancing due diligence expertise working on behalf of hedge funds, private equity-backed portfolio companies, lenders, and acquisitive private and publicly held enterprises. In addition, he has acted as both a fact and expert witness in several jurisdictions, including the Southern District of New York.\nBefore joining Ankura, Mr. Frezza was a managing director in Deloitte's Corporate Restructuring Group. Prior to that, he spent 14 years at Capstone Advisory Group advising creditors through some of the most high-profile bankruptcy cases between 2001 and 2014, including W.R. Grace, Polaroid, Sun Beam, and many others. Earlier in his career he led buy-side engagements in E&Y's Transaction Services group after having spent eight years establishing and growing the US division of Mazars International, a Paris-based global accounting and consulting firm.\nAnkura Co-President Kevin Lavin stated, \"Bob is a great professional and person. He understands the lender advisory space extremely well, has a tremendous reputation in the industry, and believes in the strong culture of collaboration that resides within our firm. I am incredibly pleased that he has joined Ankura.\"\nMr. Frezza said, \"I'm looking forward to joining Kevin and his market leading turnaround and restructuring team to help expand Ankura's lender advisory services. Despite the firm's short history, it is already a force to be reckoned with in the industry. I'm excited to be working among such top-notch professionals who are driven by creativity, collaboration, and a dedication to superior client service.\"\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/robert-j-frezza-joins-ankura-as-senior-managing-director-300595201.html\nSOURCE Ankura",
