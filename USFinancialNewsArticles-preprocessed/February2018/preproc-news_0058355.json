    "text": "February 27, 2018 / 2:35 PM / in 16 minutes Comcast will ask Brussels to examine proposed offer for Sky Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp will ask regulators in Brussels to look at its proposed $31 billion offer for Sky after it made an approach to the British company, a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday. The U.S. cable group confirmed its interest in Sky earlier on Tuesday and said the move, which did not constitute a firm offer, was designed to start the regulatory process because it sees a narrow window in which it can secure a takeover, before Rupert Murdochâ€™s Fox seals its bid for Sky.
