    "text": "LISBON (Reuters) - Portugalâ€™s business confidence was flat at 1.9 in February compared to the previous month, but rose from 1.4 a year earlier, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said on Tuesday.\nThe economic climate indicator, which measures business confidence, last year hit its highest level since 2002, at 2.2 in September, amid strong economic growth.\nThe consumer confidence indicator, which had reached an all-time high of 2.5 last July, stood at 1.3 this month, the same as in January, but sharply higher than a negative reading of 4.4 a year ago.\nReporting By Andrei Khalip\n ",
