    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 12:11 AM / Updated 3 hours ago UK to consult on employment status after gig economy concerns Costas Pitas 3 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday it would launch a consultation into workplace rights after mounting criticism from some unions and lawmakers that those in the “gig economy” are being exploited. \nThe self-employed in Britain are entitled to only basic protections such as health and safety whilst workers receive the minimum wage, holiday pay and rest breaks and employees are also guaranteed rights such as maternity leave and sick pay. \nRapidly expanding tech firms such as Uber and food courier Deliveroo hire their drivers on a self-employed basis and say they enjoy the flexibility of the gig economy, where people tend to work for multiple firms without fixed contracts. \nUnions say those practices are exploitative and have taken court action against Uber and others, arguing drivers deserve workers’ rights, winning a high-profile case against Uber in 2016 which the taxi app is appealing. \nPrime Minister Theresa May is keen to show she is tackling problems faced particularly by younger Britons, who deprived her ruling Conservatives of a majority in a snap election last year by overwhelmingly backing the left-wing Labour Party.
