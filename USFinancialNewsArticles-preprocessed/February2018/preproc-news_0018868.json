    "text": " 27 PM / in 4 minutes Amazon hires NBC exec to run its studio Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 9 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has hired Jennifer Salke, president of NBC Entertainment, to run its video studio, the online retailer’s interim studio chief Albert Cheng said in a Twitter post on Friday. \nThe move ended months of limbo for Amazon’s entertainment division. Amazon Studios has been working to shake up its programming lineup in the absence of a permanent chief since October, when Roy Price resigned after a sexual harassment allegation. Price has contested the claim. Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco, Jessica Toonkel in New York and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Bill Trott and Andrew Hay",
