    "text": "DENVER, Mercer Advisors Inc. (\"Mercer Advisors\"), a national Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) announced today strong business results over the past two calendar years and the opening of a new \"Central Hub\" headquarters in Denver, CO.\nWith two pending acquisitions that will close shortly, Mercer Advisors will oversee $12 billion in assets for over 8,000 individual clients, representing a doubling of assets in just the past two years. In order to support this strong growth and expansion, Mercer is opening a new, full-service Central Hub in Denver, which will house multiple teams and functions to better support the dozens of Mercer regional offices.\n\"As part of our vision for an integrated business model, we will continue to invest in our central functions to provide a consistent and superior client and advisor service experience,\" said Dave Welling, CEO of Mercer Advisors. \"Denver is geographically central to our business and will be a great location for our new headquarters and employees, offering a high quality of life, affordability, and access to premium cultural and recreational activities.\"\nFueling Mercer Advisors' growth has been a successful combination of strong organic growth through new clients as well as a successful mergers and acquisitions strategy, netting the firm 13 RIA firms adding $4 billion in AUM over the past 24 months. In 2017 alone, Mercer acquired eight firms and $1.2 billion in new AUM through inorganic growth activities.\n\"The current macro trends impacting the wealth management industry point to a growing consolidation of RIAs looking to partner with a well-resourced and strategic firm so that they can access a broader set of family office and investment management services,\" said Welling. \"We have a robust pipeline of new acquisitions from like-minded firms looking to enhance their service offering in order to truly deliver a fiduciary experience to their clients, while providing their advisors with broader career paths.\"\nIn addition to the powerful business momentum, Mercer also recently launched a new investor education portal, \"The Science of Economic Freedom.\" Built upon time tested philosophies and the latest academic approaches, the Science of Economic Freedom educational portal is led by well-known personal finance guru and radio personality, Doug Fabian. The Science of Economic Freedom educational portal consists of a regular podcast hosted by Fabian on timely investing and personal finance topics, along with a regular newsletter, research tools, special reports and access to Wealth Coaching from Mercer Advisors. ( https://www.scienceofeconomicfreedom.com )\n\"We developed this resource specifically to help raise the knowledge and sophistication of the investing public,\" said Dave Welling, CEO of Mercer Advisors. \"Our work with thousands of investors around the country has shown us that there is a clear need for user-friendly, multi-channel educational resources and support to ensure their long-term financial hopes and dreams.\"\nTo learn more about Mercer Advisors, log onto www.MercerAdvisors.com .\nAbout Mercer Advisors\nEstablished in 1985, Mercer Advisors Inc. is a total wealth management firm that provides comprehensive, fee-only investment management, financial planning, family office services, retirement benefits and distribution planning, estate and tax planning, asset protection expertise, and corporate trustee and trust administration services.
