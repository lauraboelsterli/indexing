Although it is not possible to identify all of these risks and factors, they include, among others, the following: changes in or to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “GSEs”), whether through Federal legislation, restructurings or a shift in business practices; failure to continue to meet the mortgage insurer eligibility requirements of the GSEs; competition for customers; lenders or investors seeking alternatives to private mortgage insurance; an increase in the number of loans insured through Federal government mortgage insurance programs, including those offered by the Federal Housing Administration; decline in new insurance written and franchise value due to loss of a significant customer; decline in the volume of low down payment mortgage originations; the definition of \"Qualified Mortgage\" reducing the size of the mortgage origination market or creating incentives to use government mortgage insurance programs; the definition of \"Qualified Residential Mortgage\" reducing the number of low down payment loans or lenders and investors seeking alternatives to private mortgage insurance; the implementation of the Basel III Capital Accord discouraging the use of private mortgage insurance; a decrease in the length of time that insurance policies are in force; uncertainty of loss reserve estimates; deteriorating economic conditions; our non-U.S. operations becoming subject to U.S. Federal income taxation; becoming considered a passive foreign investment company for U.S. Federal income tax purposes; and other risks and factors described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2017.

(\"Essent Re\") in connection with Freddie Mac's Agency Credit Insurance Structure (\"ACIS\") program that were accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, these contracts were amended and are now accounted for as insurance contracts. The change in fair values of these policies was $2,012, ($755) and $677 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. (2) Income tax expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was reduced by $3,023 of excess tax benefits associated with the vesting of common shares and common share units during the quarter. Prior to January 1, 2017, excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in-capital. (3) Income tax expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was reduced by $85,091 of income tax benefit due to the one-time impact of the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate on the company's net deferred tax liability position.

Exhibit L Essent Group Ltd. and Subsidiaries Supplemental Information Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Book Value per Share We believe that long-term growth in Adjusted Book Value per Share is an important measure of our financial performance and is a measure used to determine vesting on certain restricted stock granted to senior management under the Company’s long-term incentive plan. Adjusted Book Value per Share is a financial measure that is not calculated under standards or rules that comprise accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and is referred to as a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted Book Value per Share may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Adjusted Book Value per Share is one measure used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Book Value per Share is calculated by dividing Adjusted Book Value by Common Shares and Share Units Outstanding. Adjusted Book Value is defined as consolidated stockholders’ equity of the Company, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) plus the proceeds, if any, from the assumed exercise of all \"in-the-money\" options, warrants and similar instruments. Common Shares and Share Units Outstanding is defined as total common shares outstanding plus all equity instruments (including restricted share units) issued to management and the Board of Directors and any \"in-the-money\" options, warrants and similar instruments. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses that arise from changes in the market value of the Company’s investments that are classified as available for sale. The Company does not view these unrealized gains and losses to be indicative of our fundamental operating performance. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company does not have any options, warrants and similar instruments outstanding.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of Adjusted Book Value to the most comparable GAAP amount as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 in accordance with Regulation G:\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Numerator: Total Stockholders' Equity (Book Value) $ 1,940,436 $ 1,343,773 Subtract: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (3,252 ) (12,255 ) Adjusted Book Value $ 1,943,688 $ 1,356,028 Denominator: Total Common Shares Outstanding 98,434 93,105 Add: Restricted Share Units Outstanding 536 493 Total Common Shares and Share Units Outstanding 98,970 93,598 Adjusted Book Value per Share $ 19.64 $ 14.49\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180209005061/en/\nEssent Group Ltd.\nMedia Contact\n610-230-0556\nmedia@essentgroup.com\nor\nInvestor Relations Contact\nChristopher G.
