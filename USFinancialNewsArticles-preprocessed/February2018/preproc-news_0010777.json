    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Doppio Group, a global Infor M3 advisory firm, announced today that its Board has unanimously elected William Charles Kragie to serve as CEO. Kragie replaces Erik Kiser, founder, who will be leading a new venture, Orderful. Both Erik and William will sit on Doppio's board. In addition, two new directors have been hired to execute firm wide strategic initiatives â€“ Shikhar Das in San Francisco and Pranav Sharad in Bangalore will direct growth and partnerships as well as consulting services, respectively.\nThese executive appointments will carry Doppio Group into the future. \"I've seen firsthand how Kiser's execution of customer-centric M3 services is valued by the Infor community. With the support of Shikhar and Pranav, we are strongly positioned to serve Infor customers around the world. This new operating model will allow Doppio to focus entirely on consulting services and enable Erik to pursue his vision of frictionless enterprise communication and integration through his new venture, Orderful.\" Kragie explained.\nKragie has served Doppio Group since 2015 as the Director of Business Development where he was solely responsible for customer acquisition and strategic partnerships. Since joining, firm wide revenues have grown over 100% and operations have extended across three continents.\nKiser expressed confidence in the Board's choice, stating, \"I'm very excited to see William take the organization forward. During his time at Doppio, he's proven his ability to understand complexities and generate creative solutions. He is a servant leader who encourages the best qualities in each member of the Doppio family to deliver the best results for our clients.\"\nReporting to the CEO, Das will be instrumental in managing existing accounts as well as strategic partnerships, including Infor. Previously, he directed business development and partnerships for the US subsidiary of Swedish consulting firm, Assistera AB.\nAlso reporting to the CEO, Sharad will be the keystone in Doppio's delivery organization. Before joining Doppio, he was a senior manager within Chanel's IT organization and leverages deep business consulting experience from a tenure at PwC.\nAbout Doppio Group\nDoppio Group is a global Infor M3 advisory firm focused on implementing, upgrading and building software to solve the critical challenges of running M3 on-premise and in the cloud.
