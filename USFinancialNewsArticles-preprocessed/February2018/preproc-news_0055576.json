    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, EKC PR client Paul Chambers, aka Biff Bugatti, has launched a game changing experience in the car buying industry. Rolling out a new business model light years ahead of his competition, Biff's digital dealership, Silicon Auto Group of Austin Texas , is a first of its kind, allowing consumers from all over the world to complete a purchase of a pre-owned vehicle that they can fully customize and have delivered straight to their front door.\n\"We are a real-time auto dealer where you can buy a car online without ever setting foot in a showroom,\" explains Biff Bugatti, Founder & Chief Technology Officer. \"A customer's first impression must be captivating and so I fully stand behind my products, as well as my strong user interface.\"\nSilicon Auto Group clearly lends itself in a different direction than the traditional brick and mortar companies. In fact, Biff felt Austin was the perfect area to maximize resources and set up headquarters, considering it was named the world's top tech city in 2017.\n\"We are definitely a technology company. My sales managers answer phones and emails 24/7 and deal direct in real time in order to make the car buying experience quick and easy for all,\" says Biff. \"No longer will a person need to spend an entire afternoon test driving vehicles and running numbers. Best yet, we offer a 100% buyback guarantee to any customer who feels their car has been misrepresented by us.\"\nThose looking to purchase a pre-owned vehicle will find Silicon Auto Group's process very simple. Customers begin their journey by visiting the dealership's online inventory (through eBay Motors) filled of all types of makes and models from lower-end (Toyota) to higher-end (Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW), and even exotic cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Bugatti, and more. To finalize the deal, two payment options are given: 1) Finance the vehicle or 2) Pay cash. Delivery options are then based on the required time to complete customizations.\nAll of Silicon Auto Group's offerings come with a clean CarFax report and have a remaining factory warranty. Be sure to follow Silicon Auto Group on Instagram to keep up with their latest stock and newest arrivals.\nFor more information or to interview Biff Bugatti, please contact Eileen Koch of EKC PR, a full service Branding, Digital Marketing, and Public Relations firm at 310-441-1000 or email Eileen@ekcpr.com .\nAbout Biff Bugatti\nFormer reality TV star Paul \"Biff\" Chambers, better known now as Biff Bugatti, is a full-time single father to his young daughter, and has been in the technology and e-commerce side of exotic and luxury cars for the past 13 years.\nAn automobile enthusiast since the age of 8, Biff was inspired to launch a technological advanced business model of selling cars with a great customer service platform. His primary goal is to make people's car buying experience fun and user-friendly.\nAside from the motor vehicle industry, Biff also owns and runs his creative web development company Genius Protocol , which he launched in 2005.\n releases/ekc-pr-client-biff-bugatti-creates-vehicle-buying-game-changer-300604796.html\nSOURCE EKC PR",
