    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said on Saturday the downing of an Israeli F-16 jet by the Syrian army marked the “start of a new strategic phase” which would limit Israeli exploitation of Syrian airspace.\n“Today’s developments mean the old equations have categorically ended,” the heavily-armed Shi‘ite Muslim movement said in a statement. Hezbollah is part of a military alliance supporting President Bashar al-Assad.\nReporting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ",
