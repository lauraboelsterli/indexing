    "text": "Stefan Noesen scored a tie-breaking goal early in the third period, and the New Jersey Devils defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-2 Tuesday night in Pittsburgh.\nThe goal was the New Jersey right winger’s ninth this season and came 5:01 into the third period with the teams deadlocked at two.\nNoesen tipped the puck past Pittsburgh goalie Casey DeSmith (35 saves) -- in for starter Matt Murray (concussion in Monday’s practice) -- for a 3-2 lead.\nNoesen was positioned just outside the crease to the goalie’s right.\nAndy Greene and Travis Zajac got assists on the play. That was Zajac’s second assist of the game, but the Devils were led on offense by Taylor Hall (one goal, one assist).\nHall increased his point streak to 22 games thanks to the goal and assist and now has 15 goals and 17 assists during that run.\nDevils goalie Keith Kinkaid got the victory with 36 saves as New Jersey improved to 6-2-0 in its last eight games.\nDamon Severson added two New Jersey assists in the victory.\nDerick Brassard played his first game for the Penguins after being acquired from Ottawa as part of a three-team trade Feb. 23 but didn’t score a point.\nThe Penguins started the scoring when Sidney Crosby banged in a loose puck from the doorstep 8:17 into the game.\nKyle Palmieri tied the game at one for New Jersey with 7:41 left in the first period. He snapped a wrist shot past DeSmith from the edge of the left circle.\nHall’s been productive during his hot streak and did more of the same in the second period, scoring a power-play goal 4:25 in that gave New Jersey a 2-1 lead.\nHall grabbed the rebound of a shot that banged off the cross-bar and fired it in from a sharp angle. That was Hall’s 27th goal, which tied a career best for him.\nMatt Hunwick tied it for the Penguins by redirecting a shot from in front with 2:58 left in the second period. Jake Guentzel assisted on this and the first goal.\nThe loss left Pittsburgh in third (76 points) in the crowded Metropolitan Division. Washington’s victory over Ottawa put the Capitals in first with 79, and the idle Flyers (78) are in second.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
