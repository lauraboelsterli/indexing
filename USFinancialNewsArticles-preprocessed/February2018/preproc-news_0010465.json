Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net MORNING CALL: AFTER 7 DAYS OF RED, EUROPEAN SHARES SEEN UP (0614 GMT) Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. After seven days of pain that pushed the STOXX 600 7.7 percent below the two-year peak hit in January, shares in Europe are finally set to rise back following a rebound at Wall Street in the previous session, although there could still be turbulent sessions ahead. Asian share markets took back some of their earlier gains as investors were unnerved by a drop in U.S. stock futures, underscoring lingering anxiety following steep losses in global equities over the past few days. \"Yesterday's recovery in US markets is likely to result in a decent rebound for stock markets in Europe this morning after yesterday's weak session, however it remains too early for the moment to suggest that this might be the end to this particular bout of weakness, given that we still remain below the levels of where we closed Mondayâ€™s trading session,\" say Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK. Here are your opening calls: FTSE100 is expected to open 44 points higher at 7,185 DAX is expected to open 138 points higher at 12,530 CAC40 is expected to open 69 points higher at 5,230 (Danilo Masoni)",
