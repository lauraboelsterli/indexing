    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- enSilo, the company that protects endpoints pre- and post-infection to stop data breaches and disruptions, invites media and the public to attend a webinar hosted by the SANS Institute on countering ransomware and other advanced malicious malware threats evading traditional layered cybersecurity defenses.\nWebinar details:\nTitle: \"Stop Really Nasty Malware, Pre- and Post-Execution: A SANS Review of the enSilo Endpoint Security Platform\"\nWhen: Thursday, March 22, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern U.S. Time.\nRegistration (free) and further details: https://www.sans.org/webcasts/107030\nHost: Dave Shackleford, analyst, instructor and course author at SANS, the world's largest and most trusted information security training provider. Shackleford is founder and principal consultant at Voodoo Security, a member of the SANS Technology Institute's board of directors and a GIAC technical director.\nenSilo engaged SANS to independently review and test the enSilo endpoint security platform's performance against the current state of malware threats impacting businesses by compromising endpoint devices through file attachments, Web browsers, USB media and other vectors.\nShackleford will provide an overview of enSilo's single, lightweight agent fortifying endpoint devices with integrated pre- and post-infection endpoint protection combining Next Generation AntiVirus (NGAV) with automated, blocking enabled Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). This multi-layered defense in a single integrated product offers superior protection by blocking, containing and automatically responding to malicious code at different stages of arrival, execution and post-execution, upending attackers' typical methods of bypassing disparate security point products with novel exploits and basic evasions.\nAccording to the White House Council of Economic Advisers , malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016. Stolen intellectual property, dips in stock prices, costly forensic teardowns, ransomware disruptions and mounting legal and regulatory consequences are some of the cyber risk factors increasingly hitting companies' bottom lines. In the last year alone, rapidly proliferating ransomware attacks including \"WannaCry\" and \"NotPetya\" caused widespread digital and physical disruptions across service providers, hospitals, port facilities and logistics services.\nBy replacing unmanageable stacks of layered security products with a holistic, automated, data-centric defense platform, security teams restore proactive control over endpoint fleets, empower employee productivity and constrain the reach of costly threats across IT assets and priceless data.\nAbout enSilo\nenSilo delivers the first complete endpoint security platform providing pre- and post-infection protection in real-time, defending endpoint devices from data tampering and breaches caused by advanced malware. enSilo provides security operators with an intuitive way to manage, orchestrate and automate prevention, detection, response and remediation tasks. A single lightweight agent combines enSilo's Next Generation AntiVirus (NGAV) and automated Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) with real-time blocking to deliver a multi-layered defense strategy that can be managed from the cloud. enSilo strives to make self-defending endpoint security cost-effective so virtually any enterprise can ensure business continuity.
