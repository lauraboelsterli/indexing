    "text": "143 COMMENTS Democrats are having their Tea Party moment, if that isn’t unfair to the Tea Party. The Democratic Party is moving sharply left in response to President Trump, as activists look to purge politicians they don’t think are partisan or progressive enough.\nThe latest evidence arrived Saturday at the California Democratic Party convention, which refused to endorse five-term Senator Dianne Feinstein for re-election. The 84-year-old center-left stalwart received only 37% of the endorsement ballots, compared to 54% for Kevin de León, the 51-year-old state Senate leader who is breaking protocol to challenge an incumbent in a primary. Candidates need 60% to win an official party endorsement, but the snub of the incumbent was a victory for the challenger. \n“I’m running for the United States Senate because the days of Democrats biding our time, biting our tongue, and triangulating at the margins are over,” Mr. de León told the delegates, hitting Ms. Feinstein for saying once that Mr. Trump deserved some “patience.”\nMr. de León is massaging every progressive erogenous zone, endorsing single-payer health care and immediate legalization for Dreamer immigrants without any restrictions or compromise with Republicans. He criticized Ms. Feinstein for using undocumented immigrants—don’t call them “illegal”—as “bargaining chips” with Mr. Trump. He’s also hitting Senator Feinstein for voting for the Iraq War way back in 2002, supporting school vouchers for poor children in Washington, D.C., and for continuing to support antiterror surveillance.\nThe leftward mood of Democrats was also on display in other California races, as 56% preferred insurance commissioner Dave Jones for Attorney General to 42% for incumbent Xavier Becerra. Mr. Jones was one of the first state Democrats to endorse single-payer. \nNotably too, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa won only 9% of the Democratic vote for Governor, trailing three others. Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom led with 39%. Mr. Newsom has also moved left in office and favors single-payer, while Mr. Villaraigosa is out of favor with the public unions that dominate the party after he supported charter schools and education reform. \nMs. Feinstein is leading in the polls and has raised far more money than Mr. de León, but he can’t be counted out in a low-turnout race. His challenge has already had an impact on Washington, as Ms. Feinstein moves left to deflect his attacks. California Democrats are the party’s leftward vanguard, and where they go the presidential candidates in 2020 will follow.",
