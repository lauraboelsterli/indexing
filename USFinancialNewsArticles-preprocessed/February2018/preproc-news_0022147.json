As a result of the acquisition of KCG, beginning in the third quarter of 2017 the Company has three operating segments: (i) Market Making; (ii) Execution Services; and (iii) Corporate.\nMarket Making principally consists of market making in the cash, futures and options markets across global equities, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. As a market maker, the Company commits capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions.\nExecution Services comprises agency-based trading and trading venues, offering execution services in global equities, options, futures and fixed income on behalf of institutions, banks and broker dealers.\nCorporate contains the Company's investments, principally in strategic trading-related opportunities, and maintains corporate overhead expenses.\nThe following tables show the total revenues and Adjusted Net Trading Income by operating segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nTotal Revenues by operating segment\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Market Execution Making Services Corporate Total Trading income, net $ 287,275 $ (2,052 ) $ 1,160 $ 286,383 Commissions, net and technology services 7,108 55,140 -

NM (2 ) - NM Adjusted Net Trading Income $ 3,765 $ 1,616 133.0 % $ 2,216 $ 1,685 31.5 % 1 Under our methodology for recording ‘‘trading income, net’’ in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, we recognize revenues based on the exit price of assets in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP rules, and when we calculate Adjusted Net Trading Income for corresponding reporting periods, we start with trading income, net. By contrast, when we calculate Adjusted Net Trading Income by category, we recognize revenues on a daily basis, and as a result prices used in recognizing revenues may differ. Because we provide liquidity on a global basis, across asset classes and time zones, the timing of any particular Adjusted Net Trading Income calculation can defer or accelerate the amount in a particular asset class from one day to another, and, at the end of a reporting period, from one reporting period to another. The purpose of the Unallocated category is to ensure that Adjusted Net Trading Income by category sums to total Adjusted Net Trading Income, which can be reconciled to Trading Income, Net, calculated in accordance with GAAP. We do not allocate any resulting differences based on the timing of revenue recognition. BondPoint Sale Update\nOn January 2, 2018, the Company completed the sale of BondPoint to Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) for $400 million in cash.\n“We are thrilled with this outcome and think ICE is the perfect home for BondPoint and its employees,” said Douglas Cifu, Chief Executive Officer of Virtu Financial.\nOn January 8, 2018, the Company completed a repricing transaction of its 1 st Lien Senior Secured Term Loan along with a principal repayment of $276 million from the proceeds from the sale of BondPoint to ICE. The repriced term loan bears interest at LIBOR + 325 bps, reflecting a reduction of 50 bps compared to its prior rate.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%. The fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results reflect the estimated impact of the enactment. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company recorded a reduction of its tax receivable agreement obligation by approximately $84.9 million, which was included within Other, net on the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also recorded approximately $75.0 million in tax provision from remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets at the lower enacted corporate income tax rate. The aforementioned guidance incorporates assumptions based on the Company’s current interpretation of the Tax Act, and impact of the Tax Act recognized this quarter may change as it receives additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, Virtu had $532.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and total long-term debt outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $1.431 billion.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\nTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we use the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance:\n\"Adjusted Net Trading Income\", which is the amount of revenue we generate from our market making activities, or trading income, net, plus commissions, net and technology services, plus interest and dividends income and expense, net, less direct costs associated with those revenues, including brokerage, exchange and clearance fees, net and payments for order flow. Management believes that this measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Although we use Adjusted Net Trading Income as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of Adjusted Net Trading Income is limited because it does not include certain material costs that are necessary to operate our business. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by revenues or expenses that are not directly associated with our market making activities. \"EBITDA\", which measures our operating performance by adjusting Net Income to exclude financing interest expense on our long-term borrowings, debt issue cost related to debt refinancing, depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired capitalized software, and income tax expense, and \"Adjusted EBITDA\", which measures our operating performance by further adjusting EBITDA to exclude severance, reserve for legal matter, transaction advisory fees and expenses, termination of office leases, acquisition related retention bonus, trading related settlement income, other, net, equipment write-off, share based compensation, charges related to share based compensation at IPO, 2015 Management Incentive Plan, and charges related to share based compensation at IPO. “Normalized Adjusted Net Income”, “Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes”, “Normalized provision for income taxes”, and “Normalized Adjusted EPS”, which we calculate by adjusting Net Income to exclude certain items including IPO-related adjustments and other non-cash items, assuming that all vested and unvested Virtu Financial LLC units have been exchanged for Class A Common Stock, and applying a corporate tax rate between 35.5% and 37%. As a result of the Tax Act, our corporate tax rate is estimated to be approximately 23% beginning January 1, 2018 due to the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\nTotal Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures used by management in evaluating operating performance and in making strategic decisions. Additional information provided regarding the breakdown of Total Adjusted Net Trading Income by category is also a non-GAAP financial measure but is not used by the Company in evaluating operating performance and in making strategic decisions. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures or similar non-GAAP measures are used by research analysts, investment bankers and lenders to assess our operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Furthermore, our credit agreement contains covenants and other tests based on metrics similar to Adjusted EBITDA. Other companies may define Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS differently, and as a result our measures of Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Although we use these non-GAAP financial measures as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business.\nAdjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted Net Income should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Net Income in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Adjusted Net Trading Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Normalized Adjusted EPS and our EBITDA-based measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthey do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and they do not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted Net Income are not intended as alternatives to Net Income as indicators of our operating performance and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted Net Trading Income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized Adjusted Net Income along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.
