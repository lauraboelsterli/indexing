    "text": "MALVERN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vishay Precision Group, Inc. (NYSE: VPG), a leading producer of precision sensors and systems, today announced its results for its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and twelve fiscal months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nGrowth in revenues to $69.4 million, up 24.4% year-over-year Earnings increased to $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $0.22 reported last year Adjusted diluted EPS* increased 50% to $0.39 compared to prior year $0.26 Operating margin for the quarter is 10.0%, adjusted operating margin* for the quarter is 11.1% Cash from operations was $7.9 million with free cash flow* of $5.4 million Book-to-bill remains strong at 1.18, continues to reflect broadly improving end-markets Enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impact, while provisional, of $1.5 million expense\nZiv Shoshani, Chief Executive Officer of VPG, commented, “Our operating performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 continues to demonstrate our ability to capitalize on an improved business climate across our end markets. We had good operating margins, solid cash generation and continued to capture opportunity, reflected in our steady, strong book-to-bill. 2017 was a successful year for VPG, and as we progress through next year, we believe we have an opportunity to further leverage our end markets and deliver value to our shareholders.”\nThe Company grew fourth fiscal quarter 2017 net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders to $4.5 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $3.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. This growth was achieved despite a foreign currency exchange rates headwind that reduced net income by $0.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share relative to the fourth quarter of last year.\nIn the twelve fiscal months ended December 31, 2017, net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders grew to $14.3 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, in the twelve fiscal months ended 2016. This growth was achieved despite a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $2.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to the prior year’s twelve-month period.\nIncluded within Other income (expense) and in cash from operations, for the twelve fiscal months ended December 31, 2017, are net proceeds of $1.5 million related to a one time lease termination payment at the Company’s Tianjin, People's Republic of China location. The relocation of operations in Tianjin has been completed.\nFourth fiscal quarter 2017 adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders grew 55% to $5.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders of $3.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period.\nTwelve fiscal months ended December 31, 2017 adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders grew by 54% to $15.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders of $9.9 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period.\nThe reconciliation table within this release reconciles the Company's non-GAAP measures, which are provided for comparison with other results, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nSegments\nFoil Technology Products segment revenues grew 17.6% to $29.9 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, up from $25.4 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016; sequential revenue increased 2.0% up from $29.3 million in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in revenues was attributable to precision resistors growth in all regions for the test and measurement and AMS markets, in addition to an increase mainly in the advance sensors products for the force measurement market mainly in Asia. The sequential increase in revenues was attributable to the advanced sensors products for the force measurement market in Asia.\nGross profit margin for the segment was 39.3% for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, a decrease compared to 40.6% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 and 41.7% in the third fiscal quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decline in gross margin reflects a negative exchange rate impact and inventory adjustments. The sequential decline in gross margins primarily reflects inventory adjustments, an increase in wages and repair and maintenance, and a negative exchange rate impact.\nForce Sensors segment revenues grew 20.0% to $17.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, up from $14.8 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016; sequential revenue increased 6.8% up from $16.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in revenues was attributable to OEM customers in the force measurement market, mainly in the Americas and Europe. The increase in sequential revenue was attributable to OEM customers in the force measurement market in the Americas.\nGross profit margin for Force Sensors was 29.5% for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, an increase compared to 25.3% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 and 28.6% in the third fiscal quarter of 2017. Gross margins were up compared to the prior year period and sequentially directly due to the volume increase experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.\nWeighing and Control Systems segment revenues grew by 39.6% to $21.8 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, up from $15.6 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016; sequential revenue increased 29.2% from $16.9 million in the third fiscal quarter of 2017. The increased year-over-year revenues and sequential revenues are primarily attributable to the steel market in Europe and Asia in addition to on-board weighing products in Europe and the Americas. Additionally, the year-over-year revenues were positively impacted by exchange rates.\nFourth fiscal quarter 2017 gross profit margin for the segment was 44.8%, a decline from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 of 46.5% and up from the third fiscal quarter of 2017 of 43.1%. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in fixed manufacturing costs. The sequential gross margin improvement mainly reflects higher volumes.\nNear-Term Outlook\n“In light of an improved business environment, excluding the cyclical nature of the project-driven end user steel market, and at constant fourth fiscal quarter 2017 exchange rates, we expect net revenues in the range of $65 million to $70 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2018,” concluded Mr. Shoshani.\n*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nWe define “adjusted net earnings” as net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders before acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition costs, strategic alternative evaluation costs, gain on sale of building, restructuring costs, net proceeds from lease termination, tax rebate and associated tax effects, including the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. “Adjusted gross margin” is defined as gross margin before acquisition purchase accounting adjustments. “Adjusted operating margin” is defined as operating margin before acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition costs, strategic alternative evaluation costs, gain on sale of building and restructuring costs. “Free cash flow” is defined as the amount of cash generated from operations ($7.9 million for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017), in excess of our capital expenditures ($2.6 million for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017) net of proceeds, if any, for the sale of assets ($0.1 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017).
