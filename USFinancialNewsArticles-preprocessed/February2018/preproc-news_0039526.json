    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Calgon Carbon Corporation (NYSE: CCC) (Calgon Carbon or the Company) has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock payable on March 15, 2018, to stockholders of record as of March 5, 2018.\nIf the previously announced merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuraray Co., Ltd. (TYO:3405) (Kuraray) becomes effective prior to March 5, 2018, the dividend will not be paid.\nPure Water. Clean Air. Better World.\nCalgon Carbon Corporation (NYSE:CCC) is a global leader in innovative solutions, high quality products and reliable services designed to protect human health and the environment from harmful contaminants in water and air. As a leading manufacturer of activated carbon, with broad capabilities in ultraviolet light disinfection, the Company provides purification solutions for drinking water, wastewater, pollution abatement, and a variety of industrial and commercial manufacturing processes.\nCalgon Carbon is the world’s largest producer of granular activated carbon and supplies more than 100 types of activated carbon products – in granular, powdered, pelletized and cloth form – for more than 700 distinct applications.\nWith the recent acquisition of complementary wood-based activated carbon and filtration media capabilities located in Europe, Calgon Carbon becomes an even more global and diverse industry leader in activated carbon, reactivation, and filtration media in the form of diatomaceous earth and perlites.\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Company employs approximately 1,300 people at 20 manufacturing, reactivation, and equipment fabrication facilities in the U.S., Asia, and in Europe, where Calgon Carbon is known as Chemviron.\nFor more information about Calgon Carbon’s leading activated carbon, filtration media, and ultraviolet technology solutions, visit www.calgoncarbon.com .\n“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis communication contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, known as the PSLRA. These statements, as they relate to Calgon Carbon, its management or the proposed merger between Calgon Carbon and Kuraray, involve risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ set forth in these statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ projected. Calgon Carbon does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about the business and future financial results, and other legal, regulatory and economic developments. Statements that use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “projects,” “future,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “guidance,” and similar expressions identify these that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. Actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these due to a number of factors, including: the failure to obtain governmental approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule, and any conditions imposed on Calgon Carbon, Kuraray or the combined company in connection with consummation of the merger; the failure to satisfy various other conditions to the closing of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement; restrictions imposed by outstanding indebtedness; worldwide and regional economic, business, and political conditions; changes in customer demand and requirements; business cycles and other industry conditions; the timing of new services or facilities; the ability to compete with others in the industries in which Calgon Carbon operates; the effects of compliance with laws; fluctuations in the value of currencies and of interest rates in major areas where operations are located; matters relating to operating facilities; the effect and costs of claims (known or unknown) relating to litigation and environmental remediation; the ability to develop and further enhance technology and proprietary know-how; the ability to attract and retain key personnel; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; changes in the economic climate in the markets in which Calgon Carbon owns and operates its businesses; the overall level of economic activity; the availability of consumer credit and mortgage financing, unemployment rates and other factors; Calgon Carbon’s ability to successfully integrate the New Business and achieve the expected results of the acquisition, including any expected synergies and the expected future accretion to earnings; changes in, or delays in the implementation of, regulations that cause a market for Calgon Carbon’s products; Calgon Carbon’s ability to successfully type approve or qualify its products to meet customer and end market requirements; changes in competitor prices for products similar to Calgon Carbon’s; higher energy and raw material costs; costs of imports and related tariffs; unfavorable weather conditions and changes in market prices of natural gas relative to prices of coal; changes in corporate income and cross-border tax policies and laws of the United States and other countries, and the Company’s estimates of the impacts of such policies and laws; labor relations; the availability of capital and environmental requirements as they relate to Calgon Carbon’s operations and to those of Calgon Carbon’s customers; borrowing restrictions; the validity of and licensing restrictions on the use of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property; pension costs; the results of litigation involving Calgon Carbon, including any litigation in connection with the proposed merger; information security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise Calgon Carbon’s information and expose Calgon Carbon to business interruption, increased costs, liability and reputational damage; and additional risks associated with the conduct of Calgon Carbon’s business, such as failure to achieve expected results and the risks described from time to time in Calgon Carbon’s reports filed with the SEC, including in its most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180216005078/en/\nCalgon Carbon Corporation\nDan Crookshank, 412-787-6795\nDirector – Investor Relations & Treasurer\ndcrookshank@calgoncarbon.com\nwww.calgoncarbon.com\nSource: Calgon Carbon Corporation",
