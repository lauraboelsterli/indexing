The Dow had a more than 1,100-point difference between its high and low on Tuesday.\nThe sharp declines in recent days marked a pullback that had been long awaited by investors after the market minted record high after record high in a relatively calm ascent.\n“Despite violent moves in the last couple days in the market, fundamentals in the economy are very strong and it’s not just the U.S., it’s throughout the global economy,” said Alicia Levine, head of global investment strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 567.02 points, or 2.33 percent, to 24,912.77, the S&P 500 gained 46.2 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,695.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 148.36 points, or 2.13 percent, to 7,115.88.\nTechnology, materials and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors on Tuesday. Defensive sectors utilities and real estate were the only major S&P groups to end negative.\nAdditional reporting by Kate Duguid and Chuck Mikolajczak in New York; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and James Dalgleish\n ",
