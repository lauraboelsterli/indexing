The words \"expect,\" \"estimate,\" \"anticipate,\" \"predict\" and similar expressions, and the negatives thereof, often identify which are not limited to historical facts. Forward-looking statements include, among other things: guidance for 2018 results; statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results or margins, the ability to generate sales and income or cash flow; and Benchmark's business and growth strategies and expected growth and performance. Although Benchmark believes these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they involve risks and uncertainties relating to operations, markets and the business environment generally. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materializes, or underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated. Readers are advised to consult further disclosures on these risks and uncertainties, particularly in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\", of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in its subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All included in this document are based upon information available to the Company as of the date of this document, and it assumes no obligation to update them.\nAll included in this release are based upon information available to Benchmark as of the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update them.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document includes certain financial measures that exclude items and therefore are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). A detailed reconciliation between GAAP results and results excluding special items (\"non-GAAP\") is included in the Appendix of this document. Management discloses non‐GAAP information to provide investors with additional information to analyze the Company's performance and underlying trends. Management uses non‐GAAP measures that exclude certain items in order to better assess operating performance and help investors compare results with our previous guidance. This document also references \"free cash flow\", which the Company defines as cash flow from operations less additions to property, plant and equipment and purchased software. The Company's non‐GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to the non‐GAAP information used by other companies. Non‐GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. Readers should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made.\nBenchmark Electronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial
