    "text": "Tesla Tesla Pushes Deeper Into Home Depot Tesla is expanding its footprint in Home Depot stores in 2018 with plans to set up kiosks in more than 800 locations. Courtesy of Tesla By Kirsten Korosec 1:27 PM EST \nTesla is expanding its footprint in Home Depot retail stores. The company, which makes and sells electric vehicles, solar panels, and energy storage products, is setting up Tesla-branded kiosks in more than 600 Home Depot stores and plans to expand even further. \nTesla confirmed to Fortune that it’s now selling its residential rooftop solar panels and Powerwall, a battery it designed for homes that store the energy generated by solar panels , in Home Depot. The company will expand to more Home Depot stores with plans to be in more than 800 this year. Home Depot has 2,200 locations in the U.S. \nThe Tesla-branded kiosks are already in Home Depot stores throughout Southern California, including in Hawthorne, where Tesla CEO Elon Musk runs his other companies SpaceX and The Boring Company. Other Tesla-branded kiosks are opening in next week in Home Depots stores in Las Vegas and Orlando, Florida. \nThe news was first reported by Bloomberg . \nThe move builds on a relationship that SolarCity, the solar panel installation company acquired by Tesla in 2016, already had with Home Depot. In 2013, SolarCity began marketing to consumers from within Home Depot stores . \nTesla is taking that concept and pushing it further in an aim to reach customers that might not be familiar with their products. The Tesla-branded kiosks will staff its own employees to demonstrate real-time rooftop solar and Powerwall storage recommendations to customers by using a home address and satellite imagery to estimate sunlight, shading, and other rooftop factors. Customers can then request a customized quote and schedule an on-site energy consultation from a Tesla operations representative. \nThe consultation is free. Tesla trained professionals will perform all consultation and installation services. \nSolar panel installers abound these days. Tesla aiming to woo customers by touting the “one-stop shop” convenience of working with the company, which provides financing, installation, warranty, and support for its energy products. \nThere is one Tesla energy product that won’t be sold in Home Depot stores. The company’s solar roof tiles —not to be mistaken with its solar panels—are only available via its website. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
