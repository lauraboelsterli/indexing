    "text": " 42 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Liverpool canter to 2-0 victory at Southampton Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Liverpool closed to within two points of second-placed Manchester United with a comfortable 2-0 victory at relegation-haunted Southampton on Sunday. \nRoberto Firmino fired Liverpool ahead after seven minutes after being set up by Mohamed Salah and Salah struck shortly before halftime as the visitors eased to the three points. Slideshow (8 Images) \nLiverpool, who featured three former Southampton players in their starting lineup and also brought on former Saints Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren late on, could have added more in the second half as the hosts offered precious little. \nLiverpool have 54 points to Unitedâ€™s 56 with Tottenham Hotspur on 52 and champions Chelsea, who play bottom club West Bromwich Albion on Monday, on 50 as the battle for Champions League spots hots up. \nSouthampton are third from bottom, a point behind 17th-placed Huddersfield Town who won earlier on Sunday.
