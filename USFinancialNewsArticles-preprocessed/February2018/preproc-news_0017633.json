    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 2:18 PM / in 8 minutes Deals of the day-Mergers and acquisitions Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nFeb 7 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1415 GMT on Wednesday: \n** Tronc Inc said it would sell some newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune, to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong for $500 million in cash. \n** TerraForm Power, controlled by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, has launched a 995 million euro ($1.2 billion) takeover bid for Spanish renewable energy firm Saeta Yield to expand its presence in Western Europe. \n** Finnish utility Fortum fell short of gaining majority control of German peer Uniper with its 8.05 billion euro ($10 billion) takeover offer, after Uniper’s management advised shareholders not to tender their shares. \n** A deal to sell National Bank of Greece’s insurance unit to U.S. and Dutch investors looked as though it might unravel after a legal row erupted between the two buyers. \n** Perry Ellis International Inc’s former chairman, George Feldenkreis, offered to buy the clothing company for $430 million with a plan to take the company private.
