Eligible holders of the CalAtlantic Notes who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw such notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date are eligible to receive the Exchange Consideration as set forth in the table above.\nThe Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations were made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement dated January 19, 2018.\nDocuments relating to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations were only distributed to eligible holders of CalAtlantic Notes who completed and returned an eligibility form confirming that they were either a \"qualified institutional buyer\" under Rule 144A or not a \"U.S. person\" and outside the United States under Regulation S for purposes of applicable securities laws. The complete terms and conditions of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are described in the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement and related letter of transmittal and consent, copies of which may be obtained by contacting Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the exchange agent and information agent in connection with the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, at (866) 794-2200 (U.S. toll-free) or (212) 430-3774 (banks and brokers).\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell or purchase, or the solicitation of tenders or consents with respect to, any security. No offer, solicitation, purchase or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations were made solely pursuant to the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement and letter of transmittal and consent and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as are permitted under applicable law.\nThe Lennar Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. Therefore, the Lennar Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state securities laws.\nAbout Lennar\nLennar Corporation, founded in 1954, is one of the nation's largest builders of quality homes for all generations.

Forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"outlook,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"would,\" \"target,\" or other similar words, phrases or expressions and variations or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements regarding the expected Settlement Date of the Exchange Offers and other statements that are not historical facts. These statements are based on the current expectations of Lennar management and are not predictions of actual performance.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be evaluated with consideration given to the many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the risk that the offering of the Lennar Notes cannot be successfully completed and including those risks detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC, including the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017. It is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risks on our business. Additional information concerning these and other important factors can be found within the Company's filings with the SEC. Statements in this press release should be evaluated in light of these important factors. Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any such obligation to, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release speak only as of the date of this announcement. Lennar and CalAtlantic undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except as required by applicable laws or regulations.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lennar-announces-expiration-and-final-results-of-exchange-offers-for-calatlantic-notes-and-related-consent-solicitations-300600203.html\nSOURCE Lennar Corporation",
