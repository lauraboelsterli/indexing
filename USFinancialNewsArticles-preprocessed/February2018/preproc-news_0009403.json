    "text": " 41 PM / in 11 minutes U.S. House sets Tuesday vote on bill to avoid government shutdown Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on Tuesday on legislation to keep federal agencies operating beyond Feb. 8, when existing funds expire, a senior House Republican aide said on Friday. \nThe aide did not provide details, however, on the duration of this latest-in-a-series of temporary funding measures. Congressional negotiators are fighting over defence and non-defence spending levels for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30, as well as other unrelated matters.
