    "text": "DRAPER, Utah, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- StorageCraft ®, whose mission is to protect all data and ensure its constant availability, today announced that CRN ® , a brand of The Channel Company , has named Lee Schor, vice president of sales – Americas, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs for the second year in a row. In addition, CRN honored Schor as one of the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs.\nThe executives on the \"50 Most Influential\" list are part of an elite group drawn from the larger pool of Channel Chief honorees each year and represent the cream of the IT channel crop—leaders who drive the channel agenda and evangelize the importance of channel partnerships. CRN recognizes this distinguished group for its outstanding achievement in driving growth and revenue in organizations, as well as for extraordinary leadership in the channel as a whole.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN's editorial staff based on their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nA longtime leader in the industry, Schor joined StorageCraft in 2016, following TA Associates' investment in the company. Immediately upon joining, Schor drove key enhancements to the partner program that help partners capture more market share and see more profits. Since then, he restructured the sales team to better meet partners' needs.\n\"I've worked with many vendors during the last 20 years, and in terms of channel partner engagement, StorageCraft is one of the top few vendors that we have ever partnered with,\" said Scott Wegner, partner in charge for IT Solutions, at Sikich, LLP. \"Over the past year we have doubled our StorageCraft revenue, and we are confident we will do the same or better in 2018. I attribute much of our success to the partnership activities we have been engaged in, including sales enablement, lead-generation activities and exceptional engineering training and support.\"\nContinues Wegner: \"In all of our interactions, we can see that excellence in partner channel enablement runs deep in the DNA of StorageCraft's leadership. Lee and the rest of the StorageCraft team have listened to our needs as we run into competition, and they routinely answer our needs with excellent pricing programs and new offerings for partners.\"\nSpecifically, Schor has invested in initiatives and programs to drive new high-margin business to partners. For example, after the 2017 acquisition of Exablox, Schor and his team created an incentive program for partners with a customer base in need of top-tier scale-out storage solutions.\n\"Lee is an innovator and an advocate for our partners, and we're lucky to have him on board,\" said Marvin Blough, vice president of worldwide sales. \"He is deeply invested in both our partners' success and that of his team. He is the right person to carry the Americas sales team forward into a new year of providing data protection, storage and management solutions for the channel. Congratulations to Lee on being named among the '50 Most Influential.' It's a well-deserved honor.\"\n\"The executives on CRN's 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,\" said Robert Faletra, executive chairman of The Channel Company. \"These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief's impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.\"\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nFollow StorageCraft: Twitter , LinkedIn and Facebook\nTweet This:\n@TheChannelCo names Lee Schor @StorageCraft to @CRN 2018 Channel Chiefs list #CRNChannelChiefs www.crn.com/channelchiefs\nAbout StorageCraft\nThe StorageCraft family of companies, founded in 2003, provides award-winning backup, disaster recovery, system migration and data protection solutions for servers, desktops, laptops and SaaS applications in addition to powerful data analytics.
