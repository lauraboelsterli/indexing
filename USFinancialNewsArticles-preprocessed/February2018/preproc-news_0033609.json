    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday, quickly recovering from losses sparked by stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data, as solid company and economic updates kept investors confident.\nThe STOXX 600 index rose 1.1 percent, having earlier lost as much as 0.3 percent following the release of figures showing U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January, bolstering expectations for faster interest rate hikes.\nSimilar expectations sparked a heavy sell-off last week but the pan-European index managed to reverse course and hit a four-day high on Wednesday, as Wall Street showed a muted reaction to the U.S. figures. The European index however remains down 3.8 percent so far this year.\nData out of Germany earlier in the day showed Europeâ€™s biggest economy was set to power ahead in 2018, while a Thomson Reuters study said fourth-quarter European earnings growth expectations were revised upwards after 15 weeks of downgrades.\nOne Milan-based trader said barring a major stock market correction, he was confident European equities could outperform Wall Street given monetary policy in the euro zone was still expansionary.\nOther investors however appear to be betting on a heavy pullback in equities after years of strong gains. Bridgewater Associates was reported to have taken short bets against major German companies Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Allianz ( ALVG.DE ), and BASF ( BASFn.DE ).\nThose three stocks all ended higher.\nTop gainer on the STOXX was silicon wafer group Siltronic ( WAFGn.DE ), up 7.9 after a positive note from Credit Suisse.\nSecond was French electrical parts distributor Rexel ( RXL.PA ), which rose after a trading update.\nFood packaging group Huhtamaki ( HUH1V.HE ) rose 3.5 percent after it released fourth-quarter results, and Dutch food supplement maker DSM ( DSMN.AS ) jumped 2.9 percent after giving an upbeat outlook for 2018.\nIn the banking sector, Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) was a clear leader, up 3.7 percent after posting a third straight annual loss which was smaller than expected.\nInvestment bank Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) added 0.1 percent after reporting an unexpected rise in quarterly net profit..\nIts French peer Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) was down 2.8 percent after results.\nOther French stocks were among the top performers, with retirement home operator Orpea ( ORP.PA ) up 5.1 percent after reporting a solid outlook.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni and Julien Ponthus; Editing by David Holmes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
