    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers said on Tuesday they had published in full a report by British regulators into how Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) allegedly mistreated small businesses.\nThe Treasury Select Committee said in a statement it had agreed to publish the final, unredacted report immediately.\n“The findings in the report are disgraceful,” TSC Chair Nicky Morgan said.\nThe report was compiled for the Financial Conduct Authority on RBS’s Global Restructuring Group (GRG).\n“The overarching priority at all levels of GRG was not the health and strength of customers, but the generation of income for RBS, through made-up fees, high interest rates, and the acquisition of equity and property,” Morgan said.\nThe FCA, which is still completing an enforcement investigation into RBS, refused lawmaker requests to publish the report before those named in it had an opportunity to challenge findings that related to them.\n“The committee has not taken the decision to publish lightly,” Morgan said.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Louise Heavens and Edmund Blair\n ",
