For marketers, agencies and advertisers, the new Interconnect will provide an enhanced way to strategically reach audiences across TV and digital platforms.\nNetwork Investments to Enhance Broadband Speeds and Reliability\nAltice USA’s fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) deployment continues to progress well with construction to connect several hundred thousand homes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut underway. The fiber network build is expected to accelerate in 2018 with the first commercialization of FTTH services later this year. Altice USA’s FTTH network will benefit customers by enabling for a more connected home, and by delivering faster speeds and a high-quality service experience.\nAltice USA also continues to roll out enhanced data services to its customers on its existing hybrid fiber coax (DOCSIS) cable network and an increasing number of consumers are selecting increased broadband speeds:\nUp to 400Mbps broadband speeds were available for 86% of Altice USA residential/business customers by the end of 2017 including 95% of the Optimum footprint (increased significantly from a maximum speed for Optimum customers of 101Mbps when Altice took over the business); Altice USA continues to see an increasing number of customers upgrading their speed tiers with 90% of residential broadband gross additions taking download speed tiers of 100Mbps or higher at the end of Q4 2017 (61% of the residential customer base now take speeds of 100Mbps or higher, increased from just 21% at the end of Q4 2016); Up to 1 Gigabit speeds were available for 29% of Altice USA’s customers by the end of 2017, representing 72% of the Suddenlink footprint where the Company continues to expand the availability of this service (increased from c.40% prior to the Suddenlink acquisition); These upgrades have allowed us to meet customer demand for higher broadband speeds with the average broadband speed taken by Altice USA’s customer base more than doubling to 128Mbps at the end of Q4 2017 (from 64Mbps at the end of Q4 2016) with average data usage per customer reaching over 200GB as of the end of 2017 as customers are using our broadband services more and more.\nProgramming\nAltice USA is focused on providing the highest quality video and service experience to our customers at a great value, and these arrangements ensure that Altice USA’s customers will continue to receive the programming they want at a competitive cost.\nMost recently on February 13, 2018, Altice USA and Starz announced a new multi-year affiliation agreement, securing rights for Altice USA to offer the full suite of STARZ and STARZ ENCORE premium linear and HD channels, On-Demand, HD On-Demand and online services across the Optimum and Suddenlink cable systems. The agreement also allows for Altice USA to sell the STARZ App to their customers on the new Altice One entertainment service, as well as broader digital rights including TV Everywhere.\nThis agreement with Starz follows the recent comprehensive distribution agreement to deliver Disney’s lineup of sports, news and entertainment content to Optimum video customers across television and streaming devices reached on October 5, 2017.\nAltice USA Spin-Off\nOn January 8, 2018 Altice N.V. (“Altice NV”, Euronext: ATC, ATCB), the majority shareholder of Altice USA, announced that its Board of Directors had approved plans for the separation of Altice USA from Altice NV (which will be renamed “Altice Europe”). The separation will enable each business to focus more on the distinct opportunities for value creation in their respective markets and ensure greater transparency for investors. The proposed transaction is designed to create simplified, independent and more focused US and European operations to the benefit of their respective customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. The separation also further clarifies the prioritization of capital allocation between the US and European operations and ensures that US capital structure and capital allocation decisions are independent of any Europe-related considerations.\nThe separation is to be effected by a spin-off of Altice NV’s 67.2% interest in Altice USA through a distribution in kind to Altice NV shareholders 5 . Altice NV aims to complete the proposed transaction by the end of the second quarter 2018 following regulatory and Altice NV shareholder approvals.\nFollowing this proposed transaction, the two companies will be led by separate management teams. Dexter Goei will continue to serve as CEO and a Director of Altice USA. Patrick Drahi, founder of Altice, will retain control of both companies and is committed to long-term ownership. Post-separation, Mr. Drahi will serve as Chairman of the Board of Altice USA.\nSimultaneously, the Board of Directors of Altice USA approved in principle the payment of a $1.5 billion cash dividend to all shareholders immediately prior to completion of the separation. Formal approval of the dividend and setting of a record date are expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018. The payment of the dividend will be funded with new financing at Optimum which was raised in January 2018 and available Optimum revolving facility capacity. In addition, the Board of Directors of Altice USA has authorized a share repurchase program of $2 billion, effective following completion of the separation.\nFollowing the announcement of the spin-off of Altice USA, Altice NV’s ownership of Altice Technical Services US has been transferred to Altice USA for a nominal consideration as previously announced.\nFinancial and Operational Review\nFor quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to quarter ended December 31, 2016\nReported revenue growth for Altice USA of +2.6% YoY in Q4 2017 to $2,365m: Optimum revenue growth+2.8% YoY Suddenlink revenue growth +2.4% YoY Adjusted EBITDA for Altice USA grew +12.2% YoY in Q4 2017 to $1,043m; Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 3.8 percentage points YoY to 44.1% (vs. 40.3% in Q4 2016): Optimum Adjusted EBITDA growth of +17.8% YoY; Adjusted EBITDA margin increased +5.5 percentage points YoY to 43.2% due to realisation of efficiency savings (vs. 37.7% in Q4 2016); Suddenlink Adjusted EBITDA growth +1.1% YoY; Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased -0.6 percentage points YoY to 46.1% mainly due to higher content expense from adding back Viacom content in Q4 2017 (vs. 46.7% in Q4 2016). Cash capex for Altice USA was $228m in Q4 2017 representing 9.6% of revenue. OpFCF for Altice USA grew +19.6% YoY in Q4 2017 to $815m: Optimum OpFCF growth +20.4% YoY; Suddenlink OpFCF growth +17.8% YoY. Altice USA saw total unique residential B2C customer relationship net additions of +6k in Q4 2017, including broadband RGU additions of +25k, -25k pay TV RGU losses and +10k telephony RGU additions (vs. +18k, +36k, -21k, -4k in Q4 2016 respectively). Altice USA ARPU per unique customer grew +1.5% in Q4 2017 to $140.2: Optimum’s base of unique residential B2C customer relationships grew +6k net additions in Q4, in line with last year, including broadband RGU additions of +17k, -19k pay TV RGU losses and +6k telephony RGU additions (compared to Q4 2016 with +6k unique customer additions, +15k broadband RGUs additions, -15k pay TV RGU losses and -7k telephony RGU losses). Altice USA continues to have a strong competitive position in the Optimum footprint, enhanced with the recent full commercial launch of Altice One. Increased demand for higher speed broadband tiers at Optimum continues to drive growth in residential ARPU per unique customer (+0.9% YoY). Suddenlink unique residential B2C customer relationship net losses of -1k in Q4 2017 compared to +13k additions in Q4 2016, mainly due to the slowdown in broadband RGU growth observed since Q3 with similar quarterly additions of +8k in Q4 2017 (vs. broadband RGUs of 9k in Q3 2017 and +20k in Q4 2016). Suddenlink’s bundle offerings have been rationalized and streamlined, as well as introducing more localized pricing and adding back Viacom content by the end of 2017. Together with the full commercial launch of Altice One at Suddenlink expected across Q2 / Q3 2018, these new offers are expected to contribute to improved customer metrics later this year. Pay TV RGU losses of -6k and telephony RGU additions of +4k were in line YoY (vs. -6k and +3k in Q4 2016 respectively). Increased demand for higher speed broadband tiers at Suddenlink continues to drive growth in residential ARPU per unique customer (+3.0% YoY). Altice USA’s Business Services (B2B) revenue increased 5.1% YoY in Q4 mainly due to growth in SMB +6.0% YoY with Enterprise & Carrier revenue increasing +3.5% YoY. Optimum had 263k and Suddenlink had 109k SMB customers as of the end of 2017. Altice USA’s advertising revenue increased 9.9% YoY in Q4 primarily due to an increase in digital advertising revenue and an increase in data and analytics revenue, partially offset by a decrease in political advertising. During Q4, Altice USA’s internal and customer-facing marketing capabilities have been reorganized into a single unit within its advertising business to drive synergies (Altice Media and Data Solutions). Following the acquisitions of Audience Partners and Place Media, Altice USA can now reach all US internet households with targeted digital advertising and 100m+ TV households with targeted video advertising. Altice USA’s programming costs increased +4.7% YoY in Q4 2017 (+3.3% in FY 2017) due primarily to an increase in contractual programming rates, partially offset by the decrease in video customers. Since the acquisitions of Suddenlink and Optimum, Altice USA has now successfully renewed programming contracts representing over 70% of its annual programming expense. We continue to expect programming costs per customer to increase by high single digits going forward: Optimum’s programming costs increased +3.3% YoY in Q4 2017 to $476m; Suddenlink’s programming costs increased +8.8% YoY in Q4 2017 to $160m. Altice USA has seen significant and rapid deleveraging at both Optimum and Suddenlink since the completion of their respective acquisitions as a result of underlying growth and improved cash flow generation. Altice USA reduced its target leverage range of 4.5-5.0x net debt to EBITDA in conjunction with the announcement of the spin-off from Altice NV. Net debt for Altice USA at the end of the fourth quarter was $20,743m, a reduction of $447m from the end of the third quarter 6 . This represents consolidated LTM net leverage for Altice USA of 5.1x on a reported basis at the end of December 2017. Net leverage for Optimum was 5.1x and for Suddenlink was 5.3x at the end of December 2017 on LTM basis. Pro forma for the new financing at Optimum to fund the special cash dividend that is expected to be paid prior to completion of the spin-off of Altice USA from Altice NV and other refinancing in January 2018, Altice USA’s blended weighted average cost of debt was 6.2% (6.6% for Optimum, 5.5% for Suddenlink) and the blended weighted average life was 6.3 years at the end of December 2017.\nAltice USA Consolidated Operating Results\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 2016 Actual Actual Actual Pro Forma 1 Actual Revenue: Pay TV $ 1,029,135 $ 1,058,930 $ 4,214,745 $ 4,227,221 $ 2,759,216 Broadband 676,493 597,960 2,563,772 2,290,040 1,617,029 Telephony 199,904 214,836 823,981 872,115 529,973 Business services and wholesale 330,526 314,578 1,298,817 1,230,643 819,541 Advertising 121,712 110,764 391,866 377,468 257,741 Other 7,608 8,833 33,389 157,329 33,712 Total revenue 2,365,378 2,305,901 9,326,570 9,154,816 6,017,212 Operating expenses: Programming and other direct costs 763,508 733,422 3,035,655 2,999,785 1,911,230 Other operating expenses 575,031 655,569 2,342,655 2,842,585 1,705,615 Restructuring and other expense 9,636 85,309 152,401 229,774 240,395 Depreciation and amortization 791,699 614,377 2,930,475 2,484,284 1,700,306 Operating income 225,504 217,224 865,384 598,388 459,666 Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (369,854) (439,651) (1,601,211) (1,760,421) (1,442,730) Gain on investments, net 67,466 58,429 237,354 271,886 141,896 Loss on derivative contracts, net (82,060) (27,124) (236,330) (89,979) (53,696) Gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts (7,057) (97,341) 5,482 (72,961) (72,961) Loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs - (107,701) (600,240) (127,649) (127,649) Other income (expense), net (2,620) 1,781 (1,788) 9,184 4,329 Loss before income taxes (168,621) (394,383) (1,331,349) (1,171,552) (1,091,145) Income tax benefit 2,423,303 158,334 2,852,967 450,295 259,666 Net income (loss) 2,254,682 (236,049) 1,521,618 (721,257) (831,479) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (850) (659) (1,587) (315) (551) Net income (loss) attributable to Altice USA stockholders $ 2,253,832 $ (236,708) $ 1,520,031 $ (721,572) $ (832,030) Basic net income (loss) per share $ 3.06 $ (0.36) $ 2.18 $ (1.11) $ (1.28) Basic weighted average common shares 737,069 649,525 696,055 649,525 649,525 Diluted net income (loss) per share $ 3.06 $ (0.36) $ 2.18 $ (1.11) $ (1.28) Diluted weighted average common shares 737,069 649,525 696,055 649,525 649,525 Note: Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2016 amounts to conform to the 2017 presentation including Altice USA’s data analytics revenue being reported within Advertising.\nReconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less Cash Capital Expenditures:\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) excluding income taxes, income (loss) from discontinued operations, other non-operating income or expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on interest rate swap contracts, gain (loss) on derivative contracts, gain (loss) on investments, interest expense (including cash interest expense), interest income, depreciation and amortization (including impairments), share-based compensation expense or benefit, restructuring expense or credits and transaction expenses.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use revenue and Adjusted EBITDA measures as important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business and operating results by excluding items that are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company's ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies.\nWe also use Adjusted EBITDA less cash Capital Expenditures, or Operating Free Cash Flow, as an indicator of the Company's financial performance. We believe this measure is one of several benchmarks used by investors, analysts and peers for comparison of performance in the Company's industry, although it may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.\nAltice USA (Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nAltice USA Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016

Homes passed represents the estimated number of single residence homes, apartments and condominium units passed by the cable distribution network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines. In addition, it includes commercial establishments that have connected to our cable distribution network. For Cequel, broadband services were not available to approximately 100 homes passed and telephony services were not available to approximately 500 homes passed. 2. Customers represent each customer account (set up and segregated by customer name and address), weighted equally and counted as one customer, regardless of size, revenue generated, or number of boxes, units, or outlets. In calculating the number of customers, we count all customers other than inactive/disconnected customers. Free accounts are included in the customer counts along with all active accounts, but they are limited to a prescribed group. Most of these accounts are also not entirely free, as they typically generate revenue through pay-per-view or other pay services and certain equipment fees. Free status is not granted to regular customers as a promotion. In counting bulk residential customers, such as an apartment building, we count each subscribing family unit within the building as one customer, but do not count the master account for the entire building as a customer. We count a bulk commercial customer, such as a hotel, as one customer, and do not count individual room units at that hotel. 3. ARPU calculated by dividing the average monthly revenue for the respective quarter or annual periods derived from the sale of broadband, pay television and telephony services to residential customers for the respective quarter by the average number of total residential customers for the same period.
