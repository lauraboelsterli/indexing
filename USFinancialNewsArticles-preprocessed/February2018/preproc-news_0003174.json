Forward-looking statements are based on FTSI’s current expectations and assumptions regarding capital market conditions, FTSI’s business, the economy and other future conditions.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions, including risks regarding when FTSI can complete the offering, FTSI’s competitive environment and other factors set forth under “Risk Factors” in the registration statement on Form S-1.
