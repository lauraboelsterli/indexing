The majority of fixed rate loans are associated with NEF and are short in duration with average hold periods of 2.5 years. Additionally, NEF seeks to match-fund its fixed rate assets with fixed rate liabilities.\n(6) Excludes the impact of success fees and/or warrants.\nThe Comprehensive Investment Portfolio is diversified across over 203 unique issuers across 93 industries and with an average exposure of $8.2 million or 0.5% per issuer.\nAt 12/31/17, 98.2% of the Company’s Comprehensive Investment Portfolio was invested in senior secured loans of which approximately 76.8% is in first lien senior secured loans and approximately 21.4% is in senior secured second lien loans. Year over year, second lien loan exposure of the Comprehensive Investment Portfolio declined by approximately 40%, as the Company has focused its origination efforts on underwriting first lien and stretch first lien loans to upper middle market sponsor-owned companies as well as commercial finance investments.\nSolar Capital Ltd. Portfolio\nWeighted Average Yield\nAt December 31, 2017, the weighted average yield on our income-producing investments, inclusive of our equity interests in Crystal Financial, NEF, SSLP and SSLP II, was 10.1% measured at fair value, and 10.6%, measured at amortized cost, consistent with the weighted average yield at December 31, 2016.\nAsset Quality\n 100% of SLRC’s portfolio was performing.\nThe Company puts its largest emphasis on risk control and credit performance. On a quarterly basis, or more frequently if deemed necessary, the Company formally rates each portfolio investment on a scale of one to four, with one representing the least amount of risk.\n the composition of our portfolio, on a risk ratings basis, was as follows:\nInternal Investment Rating Investments at Fair Value % of Total Portfolio 1 $138.6 9.5% 2 $1,272.7 87.1% 3 $48.9 3.3% 4 $1.0 0.1% Investment Income\nFor the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross investment income totaled $38.9 million and $36.6 million, respectively. The increase in gross investment income for the year over year three month periods was primarily due to an increase in the size of the income-producing portfolio. Our gross investment income by business unit for the quarterly period ended 12/31/17 is broken out below.\nInvestment Income Contribution by Business Unit\nBusiness Unit Contribution to Gross Investment Income (1)\nQ4 2017\n(in millions) For the\nPeriod: Cash Flow\nLending Asset-based\nLending /\nCrystal\nFinancial Equipment\nFinancing /\nNEF Life Science\nLending Total Q4 2017 $14.6 $10.8 $5.3 $8.2 $ 38.9 % Contribution 37.4% 27.9% 13.6% 21.1% 100.0 %\n(1) Includes income/fees from cash flow loans on balance sheet and distributions from the SSLP’s, income/fees from asset based loans on balance sheet and distributions from Crystal Financial, income/fees from equipment financings and distributions from NEF, and income/fees from life science loans.\nSolar Capital Ltd.’s Results of Operations for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016.\nInvestment Income\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, gross investment income totaled $143.3 million and $151.8 million, respectively. The decrease in gross investment income from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of prepayments and other exits, which reduced the average size of the income-producing portfolio.\nExpenses\nNet expenses totaled $75.0 million and $80.7 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in expenses from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to fewer one-time credit facility costs associated with amendments and new debt issuances, as well as lower general and administrative expenses.\nNet Investment Income\nSLRC’s net investment income totaled $68.4 million and $71.1 million, or $1.62 and $1.68, per average share, respectively, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nNet realized and unrealized gains for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled approximately $2.1 million and $35.7 million, respectively. The net realized and unrealized gain for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to unrealized appreciation in the value of select investments and a reversal of unrealized depreciation on an investment exited, partially offset by a realized loss on an exited investment, a realized loss incurred in the extinguishment of debt, and unrealized depreciation in the value of select investments.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, SLRC had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $70.4 million and $106.8 million, respectively. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, earnings per average share were $1.67 and $2.53, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n we had a total of $149.4 million of unused borrowing capacity under SLRC’s revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base limits.\nIn Q4 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding amount of its $100 million of 6.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2042. The Company refinanced the notes with a combination of an offering of $75 million of 4.5% publicly-registered unsecured senior notes due in January 2023 and the private placement of $21 million of 4.5% unsecured tranche c notes due in December 2022.\nFinancial Statements and Tables\nSOLAR CAPITAL LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n(in thousands, except share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Assets Investments at fair value: Companies less than 5% owned (cost: $835,041 and $815,955, respectively) $ 834,410 $ 804,783 Companies 5% to 25% owned (cost: $0 and $8,511, respectively) — 777 Companies more than 25% owned (cost: $609,226 and $477,491, respectively) 626,760 499,218 Cash 5,963 2,152 Cash equivalents (cost: $144,826 and $309,894, respectively) 144,826 309,894 Receivable for investments sold 6,160 13,602 Interest receivable 7,336 8,079 Dividends receivable 15,013 10,952 Other receivable 58 54 Prepaid expenses and other assets 1,039 1,036 Total assets $ 1,641,565 $ 1,650,547 Liabilities Revolving credit facility $ 245,600 $ 115,200 Unsecured senior notes due 2022 150,000 50,000 Unsecured tranche c senior notes due 2022 ($21,000 and $0 face amounts, respectively, reported net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $316 and $0, respectively.) 20,684 — Unsecured senior notes due 2023 ($75,000 and $0 face amounts, respectively, reported net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1,813 and $0, respectively.) 73,187 — Unsecured senior notes due 2042 ($0 and $100,000 face amounts, respectively, reported net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $0 and $2,886, respectively.) — 97,114 Senior secured notes — 75,000 Term loan 50,000 50,000 Distributions payable 16,904 16,899 Payable for investments and cash equivalents purchased 145,118 309,894 Management fee payable 7,373 6,870 Performance-based incentive fee payable 4,660 4,412 Interest payable 2,485 2,225 Administrative services expense payable 2,756 3,289 Other liabilities and accrued expenses 1,193 1,137 Total liabilities $ 719,960 $ 732,040 Net Assets Common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 200,000,000 and 200,000,000 common shares authorized, respectively, and 42,260,826 and 42,248,525 shares issued and outstanding, respectively $ 423 $ 422 Paid-in capital in excess of par 991,340 989,732 Distributions in excess of net investment income (13,319 ) (11,847 ) Accumulated net realized loss (73,742 ) (62,621 ) Net unrealized appreciation 16,903 2,821 Total net assets $ 921,605 $ 918,507 Net Asset Value Per Share $ 21.81 $ 21.74 SOLAR CAPITAL LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except share amounts)\nYear ended December 31, 2017 2016 INVESTMENT INCOME: Interest: Companies less than 5% owned $ 88,014 $ 108,386 Companies more than 25% owned 1,222 1,835 Dividends: Companies less than 5% owned 26 11 Companies more than 25% owned 52,496 40,649 Other income: Companies less than 5% owned 1,334 828 Companies more than 25% owned 246 130 Total investment income 143,338 151,839 EXPENSES: Management fees 27,409 28,115 Performance-based incentive fees 17,055 17,775 Interest and other credit facility expenses 21,666 24,571 Administrative services expense 5,215 5,990 Other general and administrative expenses 3,630 4,287 Total Expenses 74,975 80,738 Performance-based incentive fees waived — — Net expenses 74,975 80,738 Net investment income $ 68,363 $ 71,101 REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON INVESTMENTS, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Net realized gain (loss) on investments and cash equivalents: Companies less than 5% owned $ 310 $ 609 Companies 5% to 25% owned (8,104 ) 197 Companies more than 25% owned (6 ) (30 ) Net realized gain (loss) on investments and cash equivalents (7,800 ) 776 Net realized loss on extinguishment of debt: (2,782 ) — Net realized gain (loss) on foreign currencies: (1,433 ) — Net realized gain (loss) (12,015 ) 776 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and cash equivalents: Companies less than 5% owned 10,541 28,093 Companies 5% to 25% owned 7,734 (456 ) Companies more than 25% owned (4,193 ) 7,301 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and cash equivalents 14,082 34,938 Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currencies — — Net change in unrealized gain (loss) 14,082 34,938 Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments, cash equivalents and foreign currencies 2,067 35,714 NET INCREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS $ 70,430 $ 106,815 EARNINGS PER SHARE $ 1.67 $ 2.53 About Solar Capital Ltd.\nSolar Capital Ltd. is a closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
