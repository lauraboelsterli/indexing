    "text": "ABUJA (Reuters) - OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Monday the organization registered 133 percent compliance with agreed output reduction targets in January across all participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries.\nBarkindo said compliance last year stood at 107 percent and that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would hold a technical meeting in June.\nThe OPEC Secretary-General made the comments while speaking at a conference in Nigeria’s capital Abuja.\nCommercial oil stocks for the OECD rose in January 2018 and were about 74 million barrels over the latest five-year average, he said.\nGlobal oil demand for 2018 is estimated to grow 1.6 million barrels per day due to an “encouraging environment”, Barkindo added.\nReporting by Paul Carsten; writing by Chijioke Ohuocha; editing by Jason Neely and Jane Merriman\n ",
