    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 8:19 AM / Updated an hour ago Cambodia deports seven foreigners held over 'pornographic' dance party Prak Chan Thul 2 Min Read \nPHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia has deported seven out of a group of 10 foreigners who were charged with producing pornography in connection with a party in the tourist town of Siem Reap, a court said on Monday. \nThe 10 were arrested on Jan. 25, along with 77 other foreigners, in a raid on an event called the “Pub Crawl or Let’s Get Wet” in Siem Reap province, home to the ancient Angkor Wat ruins. \nThe Siem Reap Provincial Court, which granted bail to the seven last week, had also ordered them to leave Cambodia, Yin Srang, the court’s spokesman, told Reuters. \n“A judge said that they must leave the country, that they must not return, and that they must not gather in a group and party,” he said. \nCambodia, a conservative Buddhist country, is a popular destination for tourists back-packing through Southeast Asia. \nThe court charged the 10 foreigners, among them citizens of Britain, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand and Norway, on Jan. 29 with producing pornography for their roles in organising the party. \nAll 10 denied the charges. \nDefense lawyer Ouch Sopheaktra said the three remaining foreigners still in detention - from Britain, the Netherlands and Norway, would soon be put on trial. \nThe seven released on bail and ordered out of the country had all left, Ouch Sopheaktra said, adding that the charges still stood against them in Cambodia. \nThe other 77 foreigners arrested were freed after being “educated” over their unacceptable behaviour, police said.
