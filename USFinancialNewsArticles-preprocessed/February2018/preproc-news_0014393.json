Full details of our results may be found within our 2017 Annual Financial Review, which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on our website at www.mullen-group.com .\nKey financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 with comparison to 2016 are as follows:\nHIGHLIGHTS (unaudited)\n($ millions) Three month periods ended\nDecember 31 2017 2016 Change $ $ % Revenue Trucking/Logistics 206.6 173.0 19.4 Oilfield Services 89.4 84.4 5.9 Corporate and intersegment eliminations 0.1 0.4 - Total Revenue 296.1 257.8 14.9 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (1) Trucking/Logistics 31.2 26.3 18.6 Oilfield Services 15.4 15.0 2.7 Corporate (0.6 ) 1.2 - Total Operating income before depreciation and amortization (1) 46.0 42.5 8.2 Operating income before depreciation and amortization - adjusted (1) 45.9 40.2 14.2 (1) Refer to notes section of Summary Mullen Group operates a diversified business model combined with a highly adaptable and variable cost structure. The financial results for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, are as follows:\ngenerated consolidated revenue of $296.1 million, an increase of $38.3 million, or 14.9 percent, as compared to $257.8 million in 2016 due to:\n• record revenue in the Trucking/Logistics (\" T/L \") segment, a $33.6 million increase to $206.6 million\n• a $5.0 million increase in the Oilfield Services (\" OFS \") segment to $89.4 million\nearned consolidated operating income before depreciation and amortization (\" OIBDA \") of $46.0 million, an increase of $3.5 million, or 8.2 percent, as compared to $42.5 million in 2016 due to:\n• record fourth quarter OIBDA in the T/L segment of $31.2 million, an increase of $4.9 million or 18.6 percent\n• a $0.4 million increase in the OFS segment\n• a $1.8 million increase in Corporate Office costs due to a $2.2 million negative variance in foreign exchange\nadjusting for the impact of foreign exchange at Corporate Office, operating income before depreciation and amortization (\" OIBDA - adjusted \") was $45.9 million, or 15.5 percent of revenue, as compared to $40.2 million, or 15.6 percent of revenue, in 2016. These results more accurately reflect our operating performance.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue increased by $38.3 million, or 14.9 percent, to $296.1 million and is summarized as follows :\nT/L segment grew by $33.6 million, or 19.4 percent, to $206.6 million - a record compared to any previous quarterly period. Incremental revenue from acquisitions was $14.5 million while fuel surcharge revenue rose by $3.0 million. Growth resulted from a stronger Canadian economy, market share gains and increased demand for freight services in western Canada which was mainly due to the recovery in the Alberta economy.\nOFS segment grew by $5.0 million, or 5.9 percent - acquisitions accounted for $2.6 million. Growth was due to improved demand for fluid hauling being somewhat offset by lower revenue from our pipe and tubular Business Units and a decline in demand for large diameter pipeline hauling and stringing services.\nOIBDA increased by $3.5 million, or 8.2 percent, to $46.0 million and is summarized as follows :\nT/L segment grew by $4.9 million, or 18.6 percent, to $31.2 million - a record compared to any previous fourth quarter period. As a percentage of revenue, operating margin remained relatively stable at 15.1 percent as compared to 15.2 percent in 2016.\nOFS segment up by $0.4 million to $15.4 million - increases from Business Units providing drilling and drilling related services was somewhat offset by a decline from those involved in the transportation of fluids and servicing of wells. Operating margin decreased to 17.2 percent compared to 17.8 percent in 2016 due to higher direct operating expenses (\" DOE \") as a percentage of segment revenue resulting primarily from increased pump sales at Canadian Dewatering L.P.\nCorporate Office costs up $1.8 million due to a $2.2 million negative variance in foreign exchange.\nNet income increased by $6.1 million to $5.4 million, or $0.05 per Common Share due to :\nA $10.1 million positive variance in net foreign exchange, a $3.5 million increase in OIBDA and a $2.4 million decrease in finance costs.\nThe above was partially offset by a $7.8 million increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment and a $1.4 million increase in the loss on sale of property, plant and equipment.\n\"The changes we had expected in the trucking and logistics industry intensified as the year unfolded due to a combination of increased demand for freight services and a tight labour market, which has now reached a point where adding industry supply is not viable. This is a trend we had been anticipating for some time and I believe will validate our strategy of pursuing acquisitions in the trucking and logistics sector. Our fourth quarter revenue in our Trucking/Logistics segment set new records, which we hope to build upon as we enter 2018. In our Oilfield Services segment our results were stronger than last year, primarily due to increased drilling activity in western Canada year over year. However, we saw a definite slowdown in early December as our customers reduced spending, a clear sign that lower natural gas prices for western Canadian producers impacted cash flows, and tightened their balance sheets. Overall I am pleased with our fourth quarter performance but more importantly I believe we can continue to grow and improve the bottom line in 2018,\" commented Mr. Murray K. Mullen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nA summary of Mullen Group's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, are as follows:\nSUMMARY (unaudited)\n($ millions, except per share amounts) Three month periods ended\nDecember 31 Twelve month periods ended\nDecember 31 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change $ $ % $ $ % Revenue 296.1 257.8 14.9 1,138.5 1,035.1 10.0 Operating income before depreciation and amortization (1) 46.0 42.5 8.2 172.2 181.0 (4.9 ) Operating income before depreciation and amortization - adjusted (2) 45.9 40.2 14.2 180.1 184.4 (2.3 ) Net foreign exchange loss (gain) 1.3 11.4 (88.6 ) (21.7 ) (5.8 ) 274.1 Decrease (increase) in fair value of investments (0.6 ) (1.6 ) (62.5 ) 0.7 (1.7 ) (141.2 ) Net income (loss) 5.4 (0.7 ) (871.4 ) 65.5 52.0 26.0 Net Income - adjusted (3) 7.7 10.7 (28.0 ) 42.2 46.9 (10.0 ) Earnings (loss) per share (4) 0.05 (0.01 ) (600.0 ) 0.63 0.52 21.2 Earnings per share - adjusted (3) 0.08 0.10 (20.0 ) 0.41 0.47 (12.8 ) Net cash from operating activities 58.3 46.5 25.4 142.1 174.3 (18.5 ) Net cash from operating activities per share (4) 0.56 0.45 24.4 1.37 1.76 (22.2 ) Cash dividends declared per Common Share 0.09 0.09 - 0.36 0.56 (35.7 ) Notes:\n(1) Operating income before depreciation and amortization (\" OIBDA \") is defined as net income before depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, finance costs, net foreign exchange gains and losses, other (income) expense and income taxes.\n(2) Operating income before depreciation and amortization - adjusted (\" OIBDA - adjusted \") is defined as net income before depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, finance costs, net foreign exchange gains and losses, other (income) expense, income taxes and foreign exchange gains and losses recognized within the Corporate office.\n(3) Net income - adjusted and earnings per share - adjusted are calculated by adjusting net income and basic earnings per share by the amount of any net foreign exchange gains and losses, the change in fair value of investments, the gain on contingent consideration and the gain on fair value of equity investment.\n(4) Earnings per share and net cash from operating activities per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding for the period.\nNon-GAAP and Additional GAAP Terms - Mullen Group reports on certain financial performance measures that are described and presented in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional measures to evaluate Mullen Group's ability to fund its operations and information regarding its liquidity. In addition, these measures are used by management in its evaluation of performance. These financial performance measures (\" Non-GAAP and Additional GAAP Terms \") are not recognized financial terms under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\" Canadian GAAP \"). For publicly accountable enterprises, such as Mullen Group, Canadian GAAP is governed by principles based on IFRS and interpretations of IFRIC. Management believes these Non-GAAP and Additional GAAP Terms are useful supplemental measures. These Non-GAAP and Additional GAAP Terms do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Specifically, OIBDA, operating margin, OIBDA - adjusted, operating margin - adjusted, net income - adjusted and earnings per share - adjusted are not recognized terms under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. Management believes these measures are useful supplemental measures. Investors should be cautioned that these indicators should not replace net income and earnings per share as an indicator of performance. Year End Financial Results\nRevenue increased by $103.4 million, or 10.0 percent, to $1,138.5 million and is summarized as follows :\nT/L segment grew by $71.9 million, or 10.4 percent, to a record of $761.4 million. Incremental revenue from acquisitions was $45.3 million while fuel surcharge revenue rose by $12.4 million. Experienced growth in our regional less-than-truckload business due to market share gains and the recovery in the Alberta economy. Truckload services excluding acquisitions - down due to the completion of various major capital projects in western Canada in 2016, most notable the Suncor Fort Hills oil sands and North West Upgrader projects.\nOFS segment grew by $27.9 million, or 8.0 percent - acquisitions accounting for $7.6 million. Growth was due to improved drilling activity which benefitted those Business Units most directly tied to oil and natural gas drilling activity as well as from greater demand for pumps and related dewatering services. These increases were partially offset by a decline in demand for pipeline hauling and stringing services due to the timing and regulatory hurdles of various projects.\nOIBDA decreased by $8.8 million, or 4.9 percent, to $172.2 million and is summarized as follows :\nT/L segment decreased by $7.0 million, or 6.0 percent, to $109.7 million due to the completion of major capital projects that have not been replaced being partially offset by incremental OIBDA from acquisitions, market share gains and the recovery in the Alberta economy. As a percentage of revenue, operating margin decreased to 14.4 percent from 16.9 percent in 2016 due to the change in revenue mix, competitive pricing and from the acquisition of asset light businesses which have lower margin but higher return on invested capital.\nOFS segment up by $1.8 million to $74.2 million due to improved drilling activity and from the acquisition of Envolve Energy Services Corp. Specifically, increases from Business Units providing drilling and drilling related services was mostly offset by a decline from those leveraged to the oil sands and pipeline construction projects. Operating margin decreased to 19.6 percent compared to 20.7 percent in 2016 due to a change in revenue mix and higher DOE as a percentage of segment revenue from increased pump sales at Canadian Dewatering L.P.\nCorporate Office costs up $3.6 million due to a $4.5 million negative variance in foreign exchange.\nNet income increased by $13.5 million to $65.5 million, or $0.63 per Common Share due to :\nA $15.9 million positive variance in net foreign exchange, a $5.0 million decrease in finance costs, a $2.9 million decrease in income tax expense, a $2.8 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets and a $2.0 million gain on contingent consideration.\nThe above was partially offset by an $8.8 million decrease in OIBDA, a $4.1 million increase in depreciation of property, plant and equipment and a $2.4 million negative variance in the fair value of investments.\nFinancial Position\nThe following summarizes our financial position as at December 31, 2017, along with some of the key changes that occurred during 2017:\nRepaid U.S. $85.0 million (5.90 percent Series E Notes) and $20.0 million (5.47 percent Series F Notes) of debt reducing our annual interest obligation by approximately $7.5 million.\nReduced the weighted average interest rate on our debt to 4.21 percent.\nExited 2017 with working capital of $181.6 million that included $134.5 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nTotal net debt ($421.8 million) to operating cash flow ($175.8 million) of 2.40:1 as defined per our Private Placement Debt agreement.\nNet book value of property, plant and equipment of $916.1 million consisting of $467.6 million of real property (carrying cost of $527.7 million).\nCross-currency swaps valued at $25.6 million that swaps the principal portion of our U.S. $229.0 million debt to a Canadian currency equivalent of $254.1 million.\nSeries D ($70.0 million) Notes and $12.4 million of Debentures (conversion price of $10.73) mature on June 30, 2018 and July 1, 2018, respectively.\nThis news release may contain forward-looking information that is subject to risk factors associated with the oil and natural gas business and the overall economy.
