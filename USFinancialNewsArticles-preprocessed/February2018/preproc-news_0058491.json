Management also uses certain non-GAAP measures which are intended to exclude the impact of foreign exchange currency fluctuations. The measure constant currency is the use of an exchange rate that eliminates fluctuations when calculating financial performance numbers.\nThe Company also uses measures such as free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less cash used in the acquisition and disposition of capital. Additionally, the Company uses an adjusted EBITDA measure which represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, leasehold related charges, integration related expenses associated with acquired businesses, CEO transition related costs, certain litigation liabilities, acquisition related items and other significant one-time items. Management calculates the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this earnings release excluding these costs and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to enable it to further and more consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of its core business operations. Management believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measures gives them additional information to enable them to assess, in the same way management assesses, the Company's current and future continuing operations. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measure.\nReconciliation of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nGAAP Net Income per Share to Non-GAAP Earnings per Share\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nAdjustments\nDiluted Earnings Per\nShare\nGAAP net income\n$ 23,960\n$ 0.46\nBusiness transition costs 1\n2,518\nNon-cash purchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions 2\n404\nLitigation liability 3\n3,750\nNon-cash interest expense on convertible notes\n4,046\nAmortization of intangible assets 4\n12,677\nTax effect of adjustments 5\n(18,273)\nAdjustments to GAAP net income\n5,122\nNon-GAAP earnings\n$ 29,082\n$ 0.56\nGAAP weighted shares outstanding - diluted\n51,857\nNon-GAAP weighted shares outstanding - diluted 6\n51,857\n1 Costs related to acquisition, integration and business transition activities which include severance, relocation, consulting, leasehold exit costs, third party merger and acquisitions costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and other costs directly associated with such activities.\n2 Represents costs associated with non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, such as acquired inventory fair market value adjustments, which are amortized over the period in which underlying products are sold.\n3 Represents the settlement of fees associated with the outcome of the Medtronic litigation matter.\n4 Excludes the amortization associated with non-controlling interest.\n5 The impact on results from taxes include tax effecting the adjustments above at the statutory rate, taking into account discrete items and including those discrete items in the annual effective tax rate calculation, as well as the one-time impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
