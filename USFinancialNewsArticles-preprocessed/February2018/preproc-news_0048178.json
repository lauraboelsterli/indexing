    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Navigant (NYSE: NCI) today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 financial summary:\nRevenues and revenues before reimbursements (RBR) of $255.4 million and $230.7 million, respectively, were both down 4% compared to fourth quarter 2016 Net income was $43.1 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to $13.5 million, or $0.28 per share, for fourth quarter 2016, reflecting a $29.7 million, or $0.63 per share, after-tax benefit from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) of $0.29 decreased $0.01 compared to fourth quarter 2016 Repurchased $15.0 million of common stock compared to $6.3 million in the prior year period\nFull year 2017 financial summary and 2018 Outlook:\nRevenues and RBR of $1,032.3 million and $939.6 million, respectively, were comparable to full year 2016 Net income was up $16.9 million, or $0.36 per share, to $75.0 million, or $1.55 per share, reflecting the impact of Tax Reform Adjusted EPS of $1.09 decreased $0.18 from the prior year Repurchased $43.0 million of common stock in 2017, an increase of 72% compared to the prior year Management provides full year 2018 financial outlook including RBR guidance of between $940 million and $975 million and Adjusted EPS range of between $1.26 and $1.44. The company also anticipates allocating a minimum $50 million toward share repurchases in 2018.\n“While we are disappointed by our 2017 financial results, which reflect a myriad of demand-side factors that impacted performance in each of our segments, we have taken actions to improve our operating performance by managing our cost structure and repositioning certain services to better align with emerging client needs,” said Julie Howard, Chairman and CEO of Navigant. “We continue to make progress in executing our long-term strategy while working to pivot our resources to address the short-term challenges impacting our business. With this backdrop, we expect moderate top-line growth in 2018, but anticipate that margin expansion and the benefit of Tax Reform will meaningfully improve our profitability and free cash flow. We continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects of our business and remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver value to our clients and to our shareholders.”\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nThree months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, (Dollars in millions, excluding per share data) 2017 2016 Increase / (Decrease)\n2017 2016 Increase / (Decrease) Revenue $ 255.4 $ 266.1 $ (10.7 ) $ 1,032.3 $ 1,034.5 $ (2.2 ) RBR $ 230.7 $ 239.7 $ (9.0 ) $ 939.6 $ 938.7 $ 0.9 Net Income $ 43.1 $ 13.5 $ 29.6 $ 75.0 $ 58.1 $ 16.9 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 32.3 $ 34.8 $ (2.5 ) $ 125.8 $ 142.3 $ (16.5 ) Adjusted EPS (1) $ 0.29 $ 0.30 ($0.01 ) $ 1.09 $ 1.27 ($0.18 ) (1) See definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures elsewhere in this release. Navigant reported fourth quarter 2017 revenues and RBR of $255.4 million and $230.7 million, respectively, down 4% compared to the fourth quarter 2016, reflecting lower revenue across each of our segments, including lower-than-anticipated results in our Healthcare segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $32.3 million, down $2.5 million from the same prior year period as lower revenue was partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation and general and administrative expense.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income of $43.1 million was up $29.6 million compared to fourth quarter 2016, largely due to the $29.7 million net impact of Tax Reform. This was primarily driven by the re-valuation of our deferred tax obligations to reflect the lower corporate tax rate, as well as other provisional adjustments resulting from Tax Reform. Adjusted EPS was $0.29 for fourth quarter 2017, $0.01 lower than the prior year period.\nFull year 2017 revenues and RBR of $1,032.3 million and $939.6 million, respectively, were both comparable to the prior year period. Results reflect the full year contribution from the Ecofys acquisition and growth in the Healthcare segment, primarily due to increased life science and managed services engagements. These contributions were offset by lower revenue from U.S. Federal Government engagements in the Energy segment, as well as decreased activity from regulatory uncertainty in the Financial Services Advisory and Compliance and Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segments. Full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $125.8, down $16.5 million from full year 2016 driven by higher cost of service including absorbed costs from the Ecofys acquisition.\nFull year 2017 net income of $75.0 million was up $16.9 million compared to full year 2016 as the impact of Tax Reform more than offset higher operating costs. Adjusted EPS was $1.09 for full year 2017, $0.18 lower than the prior year.\nCASH FLOW\nFourth quarter 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was $70.7 million compared to $54.4 million for fourth quarter 2016, driven by higher income, net of deferred taxes and lower working capital in the fourth quarter 2017. Free Cash Flow increased to $24.6 million for fourth quarter 2017 compared to $7.9 million for the same period in 2016, due to higher operating cash flow as discussed above, and lower capital expenditures.\nFull year 2017 net cash provided by operating activities was $104.2 million compared to $110.0 million for full year 2016, driven primarily by increased working capital requirements in the current year period. Free Cash Flow decreased to $65.7 million for full year 2017 compared to $78.8 million for the same period in 2016, due to lower operating cash flow as discussed above, and higher capital expenditures.\nDays Sales Outstanding on Dec. 31, 2017 was 85 days, a 9-day improvement compared to Sept. 30, 2017, but was 4 days higher compared to Dec. 31, 2016. Bank debt outstanding on Dec. 31, 2017 was $132.9 million, down slightly compared to $135.0 million at year end 2016. Leverage (bank debt divided by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA) was 1.06 times at Dec. 31, 2017.\nNavigant continued executing its share repurchase program with an additional 838 thousand shares of common stock repurchased during the fourth quarter 2017 at an aggregate cost of $15.0 million and an average price of $17.89 per share. For the full year 2017, Navigant repurchased over 2.3 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $43.0 million and an average price of $18.52 per share. As of Dec. 31, 2017, the company had $63.6 million remaining under its stock repurchase authorization which expires on Dec. 31, 2019.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 SEGMENT RESULTS\nThree months ended December 31, Increase / (Dollars in millions, numbers may not foot due to rounding) 2017 2016 (Decrease) RBR Healthcare $ 89.7 $ 91.7 $ (2.0 ) Energy 30.7 31.3 (0.6 ) Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 35.7 38.3 (2.6 ) Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology 74.6 78.4 (3.8 ) Total Company $ 230.7 $ 239.7 $ (9.0 ) Total Revenues Healthcare $ 98.2 $ 100.7 $ (2.5 ) Energy 37.0 37.4 (0.4 ) Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 40.7 44.7 (4.0 ) Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology 79.4 83.3 (3.9 ) Total Company $ 255.4 $ 266.1 $ (10.7 ) Segment Operating Profit Healthcare $ 25.8 $ 30.1 $ (4.3 ) Energy 8.3 9.2 (0.9 ) Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 13.9 14.8 (0.9 ) Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology 25.3 24.9 0.4 Total Company $ 73.3 $ 79.0 $ (5.7 ) Segment Operating Margin (% of RBR) Healthcare 28.8 % 32.8 % -4.0 % Energy 27.0 % 29.4 % -2.4 % Financial Services Advisory and Compliance 38.9 % 38.6 % 0.3 % Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology 33.9 % 31.8 % 2.1 % Total Company 31.8 % 33.0 % -1.2 % Healthcare segment RBR of $89.7 million decreased 2%, or 3% on an organic basis, for fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same prior year period. Unanticipated delays in the timing of certain engagements and the smaller scope of new project work impacted results. Segment operating profit of $25.8 million declined 15% in fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower revenue and increased headcount in revenue cycle managed services.\nEnergy segment RBR for fourth quarter 2017 was in line with expectations, but decreased 2% to $30.7 million compared to fourth quarter 2016. RBR was up 4% sequentially versus third quarter 2017. Contributions from the November 2016 Ecofys acquisition helped offset continued depressed demand from U.S. Federal Government engagements. Segment operating profit was down slightly compared to fourth quarter 2016 due to lower revenue.\nFinancial Services Advisory and Compliance segment RBR for fourth quarter 2017 was $35.7 million, a 7% decrease compared to fourth quarter 2016. RBR was driven by short-term delays with certain engagements which more than offset improving demand from financial services clients for non-regulatory related engagements. Segment operating profit was down $0.9 million as lower revenue was mostly offset by lower personnel costs.\nDisputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segment RBR for fourth quarter 2017 was in line with expectations, but decreased $3.8 million to $74.6 million compared to the prior year period. Reduced processing activities in the legal technology solutions business and lower mass tort claims volume were only partially offset by strong performance in the global construction disputes practice. Segment operating profit was up $0.4 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016, as lower revenue was more than offset by lower personnel costs.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nManagement provides its full year 2018 financial outlook:\nTotal revenues estimated to be between $1.030 billion and $1.065 billion RBR expected to range between $940 million and $975 million Adjusted EBITDA expected to range between $125 million and $137 million Adjusted EPS estimated to be between $1.26 and $1.44 Capital expenditures estimated to be approximately $25 million Free Cash Flow expected to range between $75 million and $90 million\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are included in the financial schedules attached to this press release. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNavigant has provided guidance regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, both of which exclude the impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit). Navigant is not able to accurately forecast the excluded items at the level of precision that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nNavigant will host a conference call to discuss the company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (9 a.m. Central Time) on Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018. The conference call may be accessed via the Navigant website ( investors.navigant.com ) or by dialing 888.455.9733 (630.395.0358 for international callers) and referencing pass code “NCI.” An archived version of the webcast will also be available via the Navigant website. A report of financial and related supplemental information is also available via the Navigant website.\nDEFINITIONS\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS) Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA – earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization – excluding the impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit). Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share exclude the net income and per share net income impact of severance expense, other operating costs (benefit), and the benefit recognized in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Severance expense and other operating costs (benefit) are not considered to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual to our business. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with enhanced comparability of Navigant’s results of operations across periods. Free Cash Flow is calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operations excluding the change in asset, liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts less cash payment for property, equipment and deferred acquisition liabilities. Free Cash Flow does not represent cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayment. However, management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with an indicator of cash available for on-going business operations and long-term value creation.\nABOUT NAVIGANT\nNavigant Consulting, Inc.

Below are the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial measures to assess the Company's operations and financial results and believes they are useful indicators of operating performance and the Company's ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for interest, debt service, taxes and capital expenditures. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.

(2) EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of severance expense and other operating costs (benefit). Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share exclude net income and per share net income impact of severance expense, other operating costs (benefit), and the benefit recognized in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Severance expense and other operating costs (benefit) are not considered to be non-recurring, infrequent or unusual to our business. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with enhanced comparability of Navigant's results of operations across periods. (3) Effective income tax expense (benefit) has been determined based on specific tax jurisdiction. (4) In Q4 2017, we recorded adjustments to our deferred income tax liabilities related to the impact of 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act m that resulted in an income tax benefit. (5) Free Cash Flow is calculated as net cash provided from operations excluding changes in assets and liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable less cash payments for property and equipment and deferred acquisition related payments. Free cash flow does not represent discretionary cash available for spending as it excludes certain contractual obligations such as debt repayment. However, management believes that it provides investors with an indicator of cash flows available for on-going business operations and long term value creation. (6) Leverage ratio is calculated as bank debt at the end of the period divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the prior twelve-month period. Management believes that leverage ratio provides investors with an indicator of the cash flows available to repay the Company's debt obligations. (7) Organic growth represents revenues before reimbursements adjusted to include the impact of our acquisitions as if we owned them from the beginning of each comparable period and adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that organic growth reflects the growth of our existing business and is, therefore, useful in analyzing the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005533/en/\nNavigant\nKyle Bland, 312.573.5624\nNavigant Investor Relations\nkyle.bland@navigant.com\nor\nBelia Ortega, 312.583.2640\nNavigant Corporate Communications\nbelia.ortega@navigant.com\nSource: Navigant",
