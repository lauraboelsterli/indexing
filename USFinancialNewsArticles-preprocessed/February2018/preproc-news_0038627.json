View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180216005433/en/\nHelios and Matheson acquires more MoviePass™ (Photo: Business Wire)\nThe increase in ownership stems from cash advances provided by HMNY to MoviePass, from time to time, from December 19, 2017 through February 15, 2018. These cash advances to MoviePass were used to support MoviePass’ working capital and operational requirements, as well as to support the expansion of MoviePass’ business plans and objectives. The total amount advanced by Helios to MoviePass during this period totaled $45,525,000.\nHMNY has also announced that, following its previously announced public offering of Series A-1 and Series B-1 Units, as of February 15, 2018, HMNY has 37,889,587 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding.\n“Helios’ capital investment has fueled our growth to approximately 2 million subscribers and enabled us to move closer to our vision of transforming the movie industry,” said MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe. “Our goal has always been to drive more people to the movies, while reinvigorating the entire ecosystem that includes theaters, studios and distributors.
