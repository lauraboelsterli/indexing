    "text": "VACAVILLE, Calif., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- U-Haul® is putting its stamp on a modern self-storage building at 1000 Aviator Drive in Vacaville thanks to the acquisition of a former Superior Self Storage® facility. U-Haul acquired the 92,782-square-foot property on Jan. 29.\nU-Haul Moving & Storage of Vaca Valley is now offering 640 self-storage units with high-tech security features and indoor climate-control options at affordable price points. Customers can also take advantage of truck and trailer sharing, moving supplies, towing equipment, the Take A Box, Leave A Box® program, U-Haul Remote 24/7® access for self-storage, and more.\n\"This two-story building was built in 2017,\" said Chris Trudell, U-Haul Company of West Sacramento president. \"We have individually alarmed self-storage units, bright lighting and other security features to enhance customer and property safety.\"\nContact U-Haul Moving & Storage of Vaca Valley at (707) 474-4387 or stop by to visit general manager Jerome Link and his team. Hours of operation are 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Saturday and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. Reserve equipment at uhaul.com or contact Reservations at 1-800-GO-UHAUL.\nThe recent acquisition of the Vacaville facility was driven by U-Haul Company's Corporate Sustainability initiatives: U-Haul supports infill developments to help local communities lower their carbon footprint. Our adaptive reuse of existing buildings reduces the amount of energy and resources required for new-building materials and helps cities reduce their unwanted inventory of unused buildings.\n\"We're adding a trusted name to the self-storage options in the Vaca Valley,\" Trudell said. \"It's our privilege to be part of this community and offer our new neighbors top-of-the-line moving and self-storage services.\"\nTrudell expects to hire a staff of 10 or more Team Members when the facility is fully operational. U-Haul will look to hire locally to promote job growth within the Vacaville community.\nThe arrival of U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 is revolutionizing the moving industry through its more convenient, more secure way to pick up and return a truck. U-Haul live verification technology allows rental transactions to be carried out entirely on a smartphone at any hour – day or night. There are no membership fees.
