The fund earned a return of 13.7 percent in 2017, up from 6.9 percent in 2016. “The fund’s cumulative return since inception has passed 4,000 billion Norwegian crowns ($511.18 billion). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,” CEO Yngve Slyngstad said in a statement. “Again, our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent.” ($1 = 7.8250 Norwegian crowns) (Reporting by Gwladys Fouche, editing by Terje Solsvik)",
