    "text": "AMITYVILLE, N.Y., Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NAPCO Security Technologies, Inc. (NasdaqGS: NSSC), one of the world's leading solutions providers and manufacturers of high tech electronic intrusion security, Internet of Things (IoT) connected home, video and fire systems, as well as enterprise-class access control and door locking products, today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights:\nNet sales for the quarter were $21.1 million as compared to $20.7 million the same quarter last year. Net sales for the six months were $42.3 million as compared to $40.9 million for the same period last year. Recurring revenue for the quarter (which are included in net sales) increased 52% and now has a prospective annual run rate of $11.7 million based on December 2017 recurring revenue.** Net income for the quarter increased 44% to $1,233,000 from $857,000 a year ago. Net income for the six months increased 49% to $2,123,000 from $1,425,000 a year ago. Earnings per share (diluted) for the quarter was $0.07, as compared to $0.05 for the same period a year ago. Earnings per share (diluted) for the six months was $0.11, as compared to $0.08 for the same period a year ago. Management re-activated Napco's stock buyback program at the end of the December 2017, repurchasing 22,600 shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $8.53 per share. As of December 31, 2017 the Company may repurchase up to 331,585 more shares under this program.\nRichard Soloway, Chairman and President stated, \"Our new product expansion into diverse market opportunities is positioning our Company well for the future. Investments in new wireless cellular alarm communication and IoT product solutions, as well as entries in wireless access control locking and specialized school security products have considerably expanded NAPCO's vision for growth.\n\"We have continued our unrelenting focus on launching new products that expand our RMR (recurring monthly revenue), subscription-based income. StarLink® Intrusion and StarLink Fire cellular alarm communicators, powered by AT&T and Verizon, have generated impressive sales growth. With the launch of our advanced StarLink Dual-Path Fire Communicator, that communicates both IP and cellular signals, StarLink Fire has become a market leader with the most extensive, feature-rich fire communicator line in the industry. The need for cellular fire alarm communicators will increase substantially over the next several years as copper landlines, which connect millions of fire alarms to central stations now, are decommissioned and are upgraded to a wireless solution.\"\nMr. Soloway added, \"Another recent addition to our RMR building initiative is the StarLink Connect® IoT cellular communicator. Growing nicely in sales volume, this award-winning product solution, enables alarm dealers to easily and cost-effectively upgrade any of the millions of existing, regular alarm systems currently in use, to provide consumers with a variety of IoT, Smart Home, RMR-generating services. With the easy installation of a StarLink Connect communicator, any alarm dealer can now grow their RMR income stream by providing their customers with a service that lets them use any app-drive remote device to operate their security systems, lighting, locks, thermostats, and video cameras.\n\"With the increased need to protect public venues, such as schools and universities, office buildings, malls and other facilities, our unique, integrated suite of enterprise access control and wireless access control locking solutions continues to show vibrant sales growth. Our Continental Enterprise Access Control Division's integration with the Alarm Lock Division's Networx® and ArchiTech® wireless access control locks enables our Company to provide a host of advanced, cost-effective, customized solutions to protect any facility from an intruder event.\n\"The Marks Architectural Hardware Division has exhibited considerable innovative, cost-effective locking solutions, that help vertical market customers address specific needs. The Marks LocDown® product is utilized by schools and universities across the country, to enable teachers and administrative personnel to quickly lockdown a door, from inside the classroom and out of harms way from a potential intruder. Marks' LifeSaver ® Anti-ligature lock is used in behavioral centers, hospitals and law enforcement interrogation rooms to keep patients and detainees from harming themselves.\"\nMr. Soloway concluded, \" Fiscal 2018 is progressing well and we will continue our path of consistent growth. Importantly, our Company continues to put the building blocks in place for a portfolio of market opportunities and initiatives which will provide perpetual growth for the future.\"**\nFinancial Results\nNet sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased to a record second quarter revenue of $21.1 million, as compared to $20.7 million for the same period one year ago.
