    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday it has removed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on U.S. white-feathered broiler poultry products effective on Tuesday.\nThe tariffs were first imposed in 2010 and were extended for a further five years in 2016.\nThe move comes after a World Trade Organization ruling in January that obliged Beijing to lower the tariffs unless it appealed within 20 days the decision in a long-running trade case.
