    "text": "(Adds LCL comment, updates with details)\nPARIS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Credit Agricole will inject 1.2 billion euros ($1.48 billion) in its French retail unit LCL as part of a 1.5 billion euros recapitalisation required by the European Central Bank, LCL said on Friday.\nLCL said this move would not have any impact on the group’s solvency and that the move was aimed at being able to comply with new capital rules later this year that it was not previously subject to.\n“There will be transfer of capital from Credit Agricole group (Credit Agricole SA). LCL is doing well, this (last) year net profit is more than 500 million euros,” a spokeswoman for LCL said.\n“There are no economic problems. It is a technical process of capital increase”.\nCredit Agricole said earlier in February that its French retail bank unit had reached a turning point and that revenues should grow from the levels seen in the fourth quarter last year, as it reported higher overall profits.\n$1 = 0.8133 euros Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou and Maya Nikolaeva, Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ",
