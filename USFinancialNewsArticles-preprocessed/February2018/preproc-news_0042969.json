A hearing in the case of Alexander Krushelnitsky, who tested positive for the banned substance meldonium, has yet to be scheduled at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). “Let’s keep up hope that this investigation will help rehabilitate him. For now, a fact is a fact,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a call with reporters.
