    "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stamps.com® (Nasdaq: STMP), the leading provider of postage online and shipping software solutions to over 725 thousand customers, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue was $132.5 million, up 25% compared to $105.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net income was $40.2 million, up 38% compared to $29.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net income per fully diluted share was $2.15, up 34% compared to $1.61 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $64.1 million, up 15% compared to $55.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share was $4.68, up 71% compared to $2.73 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We are pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial performance,” said Ken McBride, Stamps.com's Chairman and CEO. “We achieved strong financial results driven by exceptional performance in our shipping business. We believe we are well positioned for 2018 and we remain excited about our long-term business opportunities.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Detailed Results\nFourth quarter 2017 total revenue was $132.5 million, up 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 Mailing and Shipping revenue (which includes service, product and insurance revenue but excludes Customized Postage and Other revenue) was $128.5 million, up 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 Customized Postage revenue was $3.9 million, up 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 GAAP income from operations was $51.5 million, GAAP net income was $40.2 million and GAAP net income per share was $2.15 based on 18.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. This compares to fourth quarter 2016 GAAP income from operations of $41.4 million, GAAP net income of $29.0 million and GAAP net income per share of $1.61 based on 18.0 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP income from operations, GAAP net income and GAAP income per fully diluted share increased by 24%, 38% and 34% year-over-year, respectively.\nFourth quarter 2017 GAAP income from operations included $7.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $4.0 million of non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income also included $93 thousand of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP income tax expense was $10.5 million and non-GAAP income tax benefit was $25.5 million resulting in a $36.0 million non-GAAP tax benefit adjustment. The non-GAAP tax benefit adjustment primarily reflects the tax impact from reconciling the projected 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rates used for the prior three quarters of 2017 to the actual non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017. See the section later in this press release entitled “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on how non-GAAP taxes are calculated. Excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense and non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP income from operations was $62.7 million. Also excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and including the non-GAAP tax benefit adjustment, fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP adjusted income was $87.5 million or $4.68 per share based on 18.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nFourth quarter 2016 GAAP income from operations included $9.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $4.0 million of non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles. Fourth quarter 2016 GAAP net income also included $93 thousand of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and $6.9 million of non-cash income tax expense. Excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense and non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, fourth quarter 2016 non-GAAP income from operations was $54.6 million. Also excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and non-cash income tax expense, fourth quarter 2016 non-GAAP adjusted income was $49.2 million or $2.73 per share based on 18.0 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nTherefore, fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income and non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share increased by 15%, 78% and 71% year-over-year, respectively.\nNon-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income and non-GAAP adjusted income per share are described further in the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following tables (unaudited):\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures (Fourth Quarter 2017)\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Stock-Based Intangible Debt All amounts in millions except GAAP\nCompensation Amortization Amortization Income Tax Non-GAAP per share data: Amounts Expense Expense Expense Adjustments Amounts Cost of Revenues $ 20.87 0.34 $ - $ - $ - $ 20.53 Research & Development 12.02 1.98 - - - 10.04 Sales & Marketing 25.20 1.09 - - - 24.11 General & Administrative 22.87 3.75 4.00 - - 15.12 Total Expenses 80.96 7.16 4.00 - - 69.81 Income (Loss) from Operations 51.50 (7.16 ) (4.00 ) - - 62.66 Interest and Other Income (Loss) (0.79 ) - - (0.09 ) - (0.69 ) Benefit (Expense) for Income Taxes (10.52 ) - - - (36.00 ) 25.48 Adjusted Income (Loss) 40.20 (7.16 ) (4.00 ) (0.09 ) (36.00 ) 87.45 On a diluted per share basis $ 2.15 $ (0.38 ) $ (0.21 ) $ (0.00 ) $ (1.93 ) $ 4.68 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures (Fourth Quarter 2016)\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Stock-Based Intangible Debt Income Tax All amounts in millions except GAAP Compensation Amortization Amortization Benefit Non-GAAP per share data: Amounts Expense Expense Expense (Expense) Amounts Cost of Revenues $ 17.90 $ 0.48 $ - $ - $ - $ 17.43 Research & Development 9.58 1.94 - - - 7.64 Sales & Marketing 19.12 1.87 - - - 17.25 General & Administrative 17.85 4.91 4.01 - - 8.93 Total Expenses 64.45 9.19 4.01 - - 51.25 Income (Loss) from Operations 41.44 (9.19 ) (4.01 ) - - 54.64 Interest and Other Income (Loss) (0.70 ) - - (0.09 ) - (0.60 ) Benefit (Expense) for Income Taxes* (11.72 ) - - - (6.90 ) (4.82 ) Adjusted Income (Loss) 29.03 (9.19 ) (4.01 ) (0.09 ) (6.90 ) 49.22 On a diluted per share basis $ 1.61 $ (0.51 ) $ (0.22 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.38 ) $ 2.73 * For the fourth quarter 2016, the Company incurred approximately $6.9 million in deferred income tax expense based on its GAAP income measures. In addition, the Company would have incurred an additional approximately $2 million of deferred income tax expense based on its non-GAAP income measures.\nFourth Quarter GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nFourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $40.2 million, up 38% compared to $29.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $64.1 million, up 15% compared to $55.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is described further in the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release and is reconciled to GAAP net income in the following table (unaudited):\nFourth Quarter Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income\nFourth Quarter Three Months ended All amounts in millions December 31, 2017 2016 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $40.20 $29.03 Depreciation and Amortization expense $5.39 $5.23 Interest & Other Expense (Income), net $0.79 $0.70 Income Tax Expense (Benefit), net $10.52 $11.72 Stock-based Compensation Expense $7.16 $9.19 Adjusted EBITDA $64.05 $55.87 2017 Detailed Results\n2017 total revenue was $468.7 million, up 29% compared to 2016. 2017 Mailing and Shipping revenue (which includes service, product and insurance revenue but excludes Customized Postage and Other revenue) was $449.4 million, up 28% versus 2016. 2017 Customized Postage revenue was $19.2 million, up 41% versus 2016.\n2017 GAAP income from operations was $163.5 million, GAAP net income was $150.6 million and GAAP net income per share was $8.19 based on 18.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding. This compares to a 2016 GAAP income from operations of $120.2 million, GAAP net income of $75.2 million and GAAP net income per share of $4.12 based on fully diluted shares outstanding of 18.3 million. 2017 GAAP income from operations, GAAP net income and GAAP income per fully diluted share increased by 36%, 100%, and 99% year-over-year, respectively.\n2017 GAAP income from operations included $40.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $16.0 million of non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, $6.0 million of executive consulting expense, and $1.9 million of one-time insurance proceeds relating to a prior legal settlement. 2017 GAAP net income also included $374 thousand of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. 2017 GAAP income tax expense was $9.6 million and non-GAAP income tax expense was $13.3 million resulting in a non-GAAP tax expense adjustment of $3.7 million. The non-GAAP tax expense adjustment primarily reflects the tax impact from higher non-GAAP income as compared to GAAP income at the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017. See the sections later in this press release entitled “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on how non-GAAP taxes are calculated. Excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, executive consulting expense, and one-time insurance proceeds, 2017 non-GAAP income from operations was $224.5 million. Also excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and including the non-GAAP tax expense adjustment, 2017 non-GAAP adjusted income was $208.2 million or $11.33 per share based on 18.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\n2016 GAAP income from operations included $33.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $14.6 million of non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, and $1.1 million of expenses related to the ShippingEasy acquisition. 2016 GAAP net income also included $374 thousand of non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and $33.6 million of non-cash income tax expense. Excluding the non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, and acquisition related expenses, 2016 non-GAAP income from operations was $169.8 million. Also excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and non-cash income tax expense, 2016 non-GAAP adjusted income was $158.8 million or $8.70 per share based on 18.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\nTherefore, 2017 non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income and non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share increased by 32%, 31% and 30% year-over-year, respectively.\nNon-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income and non-GAAP adjusted income per share are described further in the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this press release and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the following tables (unaudited):\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures (2017)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Stock-Based Intangible Executive One-time Debt All amounts in millions except GAAP Compensation Amortization Consulting Insurance Amortization Income Tax Non-GAAP per share data: Amounts Expense Expense Expenses Proceeds Expense Adjustments Amounts Cost of Revenues $ 79.23 $ 1.77 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 77.45 Research & Development 46.21 9.03 - - - - - 37.17 Sales & Marketing 91.22 7.29 - - - - - 83.93 General & Administrative 88.55 22.73 15.99 6.00 (1.86 ) - - 45.68 Total Expenses 305.21 40.83 15.99 6.00 (1.86 ) - - 244.24 Income (Loss) from Operations 163.50 (40.83 ) (15.99 ) (6.00 ) 1.86 - - 224.46 Interest and Other Income (Loss) (3.26 ) - - - - (0.37 ) - (2.88 ) Benefit (Expense) for Income Taxes (9.65 ) - - - - - 3.69 (13.34 ) Adjusted Income (Loss) 150.60 (40.83 ) (15.99 ) (6.00 ) 1.86 (0.37 ) 3.69 208.24 On a diluted per share basis $ 8.19 $ (2.22 ) $ (0.87 ) $ (0.33 ) $ 0.10 $ (0.02 ) $ 0.20 $ 11.33 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures (2016)\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Stock-Based Intangible Acquisition Debt Income Tax All amounts in millions except GAAP Compensation Amortization Related Amortization Benefit Non-GAAP per share data: Amounts Expense Expense Expenses Expense (Expense) Amounts Cost of Revenues $ 62.97 $ 1.83 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 61.14 Research & Development 35.16 6.63 - - - - 28.52 Sales & Marketing 78.83 7.19 - - - - 71.64 General & Administrative 67.12 18.29 14.56 1.08 - - 33.20 Total Expenses 244.08 33.95 14.56 1.08 - - 194.50 Income (Loss) from Operations 120.22 (33.95 ) (14.56 ) (1.08 ) - - 169.80 Interest and Other Income (Loss) (3.25 ) - - - (0.37 ) - (2.87 ) Benefit (Expense) for Income Taxes* (41.74 ) - - - - (33.62 ) (8.12 ) Adjusted Income (Loss) 75.23 (33.95 ) (14.56 ) (1.08 ) (0.37 ) (33.62 ) 158.81 On a diluted per share basis $ 4.12 $ (1.86 ) $ (0.80 ) $ (0.06 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (1.84 ) $ 8.70 * For the 2016, the Company incurred approximately $33.6 million in deferred income tax expense based on its GAAP income measures. In addition, the Company would have incurred an additional approximately $14 million of deferred income tax expense based on its non-GAAP income measures.\n2017 GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n2017 GAAP net income was $150.6 million, up 100% compared to $75.2 million in 2016.\n2017 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $229.9 million, up 32% compared to $174.4 million in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is described further in the “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this release and is reconciled to GAAP net income in the following table (unaudited):\nFiscal Year 2017 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income\nFiscal Twelve Months ended All amounts in millions December 31, 2017 2016 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $150.60 $75.23 Depreciation and Amortization expense $21.44 $19.17 Interest & Other Expense (Income), net $3.26 $3.25 Income Tax Expense (Benefit), net $9.65 $41.74 Stock-based Compensation Expense $40.83 $33.95 Executive Consulting Expense $6.00 $ -- One-time Insurance Expense (Proceeds) ($1.86) $ -- Acquisition Related Expenses $ -- $1.08 Adjusted EBITDA $229.92 $174.41 Taxes\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which requires us, among other items, to record excess tax benefits as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the income statements, whereas they were previously recognized in equity. The impact of adoption has been reflected in our income statement for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFor 2017, the Company reported a GAAP income tax expense of $9.6 million representing an effective tax rate of 6.0%. For 2016, the Company reported a GAAP income tax expense of $41.7 million representing an effective tax rate of 35.7%. The lower effective GAAP tax rate in 2017 was primarily related to the tax benefits resulting from higher employee stock option exercises in 2017 and the associated change in accounting treatment under ASU 2016-09. Our fiscal year 2017 GAAP net income should also be understood to have been positively impacted by the lower effective tax rate resulting primarily from employee stock option exercises and the associated change in accounting treatment under ASU 2016-09. The 2017 GAAP effective tax rate of 6.0% should not be assumed to apply for 2018 as employee stock option exercises are inherently unpredictable and actual 2018 employee stock option exercises could differ materially from those in 2017 which could have a material impact on our 2018 effective tax rate as compared to 2017.\nShare Repurchase and Debt Repayment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 169 thousand shares at a total cost of approximately $30.6 million. During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 988 thousand shares at a total cost of approximately $133.7 million.\nOn October 24, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, which became effective on November 10, 2017 and authorized the Company to repurchase up to $90 million of stock over the six months following its effective date.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a required principal repayment of $2.1 million and an optional principal repayment of $62.0 million against the borrowings under the Company’s existing credit agreement related to the Endicia acquisition. As of December 31, 2017, total debt under the credit agreement excluding debt issuance costs was $70.1 million.\nSummary of our Business Outlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company currently expects its GAAP financial outlook to be as follows:\nWe expect total 2018 revenue to be in a range of approximately $530 million to $560 million. We expect GAAP net income to be in the range of approximately $138 million to $153 million. We expect GAAP net income per fully diluted share to be in a range of approximately $7.09 to $8.04.\nThe above GAAP numbers adjusted as detailed below result in the following non-GAAP financial outlook:\nWe expect non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of approximately $245 million to $265 million. We expect non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share to be in a range of $8.80 to $9.80.\nDetailed Discussion of our Business Outlook\nAs noted above, for 2018, the Company currently expects total revenue to be in a range of approximately $530 million to $560 million.\nAlso, for 2018, the Company currently expects GAAP net income to be in a range of approximately $138 million to $153 million.\nThe expected GAAP net income range includes depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $21 million, stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million, interest expense and other income, net of approximately $2 million and income tax expense of approximately $54 million to $59 million. Excluding the depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, interest expense and other income, net and income tax expense, we expect non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of approximately $245 million to $265 million.\nThe following table is provided to facilitate a reconciliation of 2018 expected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to expected GAAP net income:\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance All amounts in millions Low End of Range High End of Range GAAP net income $138.3 $152.7 Adjustments to reconcile adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income:\nDepreciation and amortization expense $21.0 $21.0 Stock-based compensation expense $30.0 $30.0 Interest expense and other income, net $1.9 $1.9 Income tax expense\n$53.8\n$59.4\nTotal adjustments excluded from adjusted EBITDA $106.7 $112.3 Adjusted EBITDA $245.0 $265.0 As noted above, for 2018, the Company currently expects GAAP net income per fully diluted share to be in a range of approximately $7.09 to $8.04. The expected GAAP net income per fully diluted share range includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles expense of approximately $16 million and non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately $0.4 million. Excluding the stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles expense, and amortization of debt issuance costs, and including higher expected non-GAAP income taxes of approximately $13 million from the expected tax effects of these adjustments at an assumed 28.0% effective tax rate, non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share is expected to be in a range of $8.80 to $9.80.\nThe following table is provided to facilitate a reconciliation of fiscal year 2018 expected non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share to expected GAAP net income per fully diluted share:\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance All amounts in millions except per share data Low End of Range High End of Range GAAP net income per fully diluted share $7.09 $8.04 Adjustments to reconcile non-GAAP to GAAP:\nStock-based compensation expense $30.0 $30.0 Amortization of acquired intangibles $16.0 $16.0 Amortization of debt issuance costs\n$0.4\n$0.4\nTotal adjustments excluded from non-GAAP\n$46.4 $46.4 Effective tax rate 28% 28% Increased tax expense from non-GAAP adjustments\n$13.0\n$13.0\nTotal tax affected adjustments excluded from non-GAAP $33.4 $33.4 Fully diluted shares 19.5 19.0 Total adjustments excluded from non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share $1.71 $1.76 Non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share $8.80 $9.80 This business outlook does not include the impact from potential future acquisitions, including acquisition costs or related financings, or unanticipated events. This business outlook and the related assumptions are forward-looking statements subject to the safe harbor statement contained at the end of this press release, and reflect our views of current and future market conditions. Ranges represent a set of likely assumptions, but actual results could fall outside the range presented. Only a few of our assumptions underlying our guidance are disclosed above, and our actual results will be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control or ability to predict. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our guidance are reasonable, they are not guarantees of future performance and some of them will inevitably prove to be incorrect.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP adjusted income, non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share and adjusted EBITDA.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and prospects for the future and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures that: (1) exclude certain non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, contingent consideration charges; (2) exclude certain expenses and gains such as acquisition related expenses, litigation settlement expenses, executive consulting expenses, insurance proceeds; and (3) includes income tax adjustments provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be reflective of our underlying operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted income is calculated as GAAP net income plus the cumulative impact of the adjustments outlined above. Non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP adjusted income divided by fully diluted shares. Prior to the third quarter 2016, the Company referred to non-GAAP adjusted income as non-GAAP net income.\nNon-GAAP income tax expense for the first, second and third quarters of our fiscal year are calculated by multiplying the projected annual effective tax rate in that quarter by the non-GAAP adjusted income before taxes for the quarter. The projected annual effective tax rate does not reflect potential future employee option exercises in the remaining quarters of the fiscal year due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting employee option exercises. The projected annual effective tax rate also considers other factors including the Company’s tax structure and its tax positions in various jurisdictions where the Company operates. The actual annual effective tax rate realized for the fiscal year could differ materially from our projected annual effective tax rate used in the first, second and third quarters.\nNon-GAAP income tax expense for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year is calculated by multiplying the actual effective tax rate for the fiscal year by the non-GAAP adjusted income before taxes for the fiscal year and subtracting the non-GAAP income tax expense or benefit reported in the first, second and third quarters. As a result, the fourth quarter reflects the tax impact of reconciling the first, second and third quarter projected annual effective rates to the actual effective tax rate for the fiscal year.\nThe calculations described above reflect the methodology used for calculating non-GAAP income tax expenses in reported results for 2017. For 2016 reported results, the Company used a different methodology for calculating non-GAAP income tax expense that reflected the Company’s ability to use its remaining tax assets such as net operating losses and other tax credits. The reason for the change in methodology was that the Company had utilized substantially all of its net operating losses and other tax credits by the end of 2016. In order to help investors better understand the impact of the change in methodology, the Company previously provided recast non-GAAP income tax expense for 2016 showing what the non-GAAP income tax expense would have been under the 2017 methodology. The Company expects that the non-GAAP income tax expense methodology for 2018 will be consistent with the 2017 methodology. As a result, the Company believes it is no longer necessary to provide recast non-GAAP income tax expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA as calculated in this earnings release represents earnings before interest and other expense, net, interest and other income, net, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and excludes certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense, described in this release used to reconcile GAAP to non-GAAP income from operations.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the financial tables of this earnings release.\nThe Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, enhance the comparability of operating results against prior periods and allow for greater transparency of operating results. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions. The Company believes non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management and investors in comparing the Company’s financial performance to that of prior periods as well as in performing trend analysis over time.\nShare Repurchase Timing\nThe timing of share repurchases, if any, and the number of shares to be bought at any one time will depend on factors including market conditions and the Company’s compliance with the covenants in its Credit Agreement. Share repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions at the Company's discretion in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company's purchase of any of its shares may be subject to limitations imposed on such purchases by applicable securities laws and regulations and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, and may relate to future events or the company’s anticipated results, business strategies or capital requirements, among other things, all of which involve risks and uncertainties.

Important factors, including the Company's ability to successfully integrate and realize the benefits of its past or future strategic acquisitions or investments, to complete and ship its products and to maintain desirable economics for its products, as well as the timing of when the Company will utilize its deferred tax assets, and obtain or maintain regulatory approval, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, are detailed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission made from time to time by Stamps.com, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K.
