    "text": "ROSEVILLE, Calif., Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adventist Health —a faith-based, nonprofit integrated health system serving more than 75 communities in California, Oregon and Hawaii— today announced the planned retirement of its senior vice president and chief financial officer (CFO), Jack Wagner, after four years of service to the company. Joe Reppert, a recent internal hire will succeed Mr. Wagner as CFO.\nWagner joined Adventist Health as CFO in 2014 and has played an instrumental role in the health system’s growth and development. During his tenure, Wagner accomplished the funding of major acquisitions in the markets Adventist Health serves, improved the system’s balance sheet and brought in exceptional talent to lead finance in regional markets. In addition he laid the foundation for groundbreaking partnerships for the system through its affiliation program. He also assisted in the construction of the first offices in Roseville and has been a major part of designing the system’s new Roseville headquarters which are currently under construction.\n\"Four years ago, Jack Wagner agreed to return to Adventist Health as CFO to help us strengthen our financial performance and set us up for continued strength, growth and success,\" said Adventist Health CEO Scott Reiner. \"I’d say he’s done just that and set our organization on the path for future success under new leadership.\"\nPrior to Adventist Health, Wagner served in key executive and CFO roles in many organizations including Adventist HealthCare in Rockville, Md. and Legacy Health Systems in Portland, Ore. He was well-acquainted with Adventist Health, having served as its CFO in its early days of development as Adventist Health System/West, and also helped with the Northern California network.\n“When I came to Adventist Health, my focus and game plan was to expedite improved system financial performance, assess the status of and need for improvement in the financial systems, help increase partnerships and acquisitions and develop a finance/audit committee for the board,” Wagner added. “Four years have passed way more quickly than anticipated and while the priorities mentioned remain a work in progress, it was time that I help transition the CFO role to someone like Joe Reppert with an eye toward a longer-term horizon.”\nWagner’s final day with the organization will be March 2, 2018. Reppert, who started this February, will be responsible for articulating and ensuring the healthcare organization’s financial leadership to leverage its goals into the communities it serves. Reppert is a highly-experienced financial leader who spent the majority of his career as a CFO with several different health organizations including Adventist Health’s Northern California region. For more information about Reppert's hire, see his hiring announcement .\nABOUT ADVENTIST HEALTH: Adventist Health is a faith-based, non-profit integrated health system serving more than 75 communities on the West Coast and Hawaii.
