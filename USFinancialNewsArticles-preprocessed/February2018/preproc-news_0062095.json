    "text": "Combined company to service 1.9 million loans on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2017\nAccelerates Ocwen’s transition to an industry-leading servicing platform\nExpected to achieve meaningful operational and corporate overhead cost synergies\nContinue to be an industry leader in helping borrowers and improving loan portfolio performance through innovative loss mitigation programs\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocwen Financial Corporation (NYSE:OCN) (“Ocwen” or the “Company”), a leading financial services holding company, today announced a definitive agreement under which Ocwen will acquire all of the outstanding shares of PHH Corporation (NYSE:PHH) (“PHH”), a mortgage platform with established servicing and origination recapture capabilities, for approximately $360 million in cash or $11 per diluted common share. The purchase price represents a 35 percent discount to PHH’s GAAP book equity at December 31, 2017.\nOn a combined basis, as of December 31, 2017, the company would service 1.9 million loans with an unpaid principal balance of $328 billion and originate over $3 billion of residential mortgage loans, including reverse mortgages, annually. Ocwen projects that the increased size and scale of the combined company should create various strategic and financial benefits, including:\nAccelerating Ocwen’s transition to an industry-leading servicing platform, Improving servicing and origination margins through improved economies of scale, Reducing fixed costs (on a combined basis) by eliminating redundant corporate overhead and public company-related costs, and Providing a superior foundation to eventually enable the combined servicing platform to resume new business and growth activities to offset portfolio runoff.\nIt is anticipated that at closing, which is expected to occur during the second half of 2018 following various required approvals, there will be sufficient available cash on PHH’s balance sheet to enable $260 million of the $360 million purchase price to be funded out of PHH’s available cash, while providing for sufficient additional liquidity to fund its operations going forward. Ocwen will also assume $119 million of PHH’s outstanding corporate debt.\nRon Faris, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocwen, stated, “We are very pleased to announce the proposed acquisition of PHH, a leading non-bank servicer. PHH is a high-quality servicer with complementary capabilities and business lines to Ocwen, making it a great strategic match for us. In addition to providing significant scale benefits, this transaction gives us the opportunity to migrate to their existing BlackKnight LoanSphere MSP® servicing platform more quickly and with less risk than had we just implemented the system ourselves. We are also excited by the opportunity to welcome the PHH employees to the Ocwen family and by the opportunity to bring our industry-leading and innovative loss mitigation capabilities to existing PHH servicing customers currently struggling with their mortgage payments.”\nRobert B. Crowl, President and Chief Executive Officer of PHH, said, “We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Ocwen, and we look forward to working with them to bring this transaction to a successful close. We are excited by the opportunity to build a stronger combined company for our servicing and subservicing clients, our borrowers, and our employees.”\nThe acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including PHH shareholder approval and regulatory and other approvals, and is targeted to close in the second half of 2018.\nBarclays is serving as lead financial advisor to Ocwen and Sullivan and Cromwell LLP is serving as its legal counsel.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nOcwen will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, to discuss the transaction during the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 and year-end 2017 financial results call.

We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements as a number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in such These factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the proposed transaction does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory, shareholder or other approvals are not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or that the anticipated benefits of the transaction are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the strength of the economy and competitive factors in the areas where Ocwen and PHH do business; the impact of changes in the laws and regulations regulating financial services and enforcement thereof; the effects of competition in the markets in which Ocwen and PHH operate; judicial or regulatory judgments and legal proceedings; Ocwen’s ability to complete the acquisition and integration of PHH successfully; the effect of the announcement of the proposed transaction on Ocwen’s relationships with its contractual counterparties, regulators and other stakeholders, operating results and business generally; and other factors that may affect future results of Ocwen and PHH, including timely development and introduction of new products and services and technological changes.\nWe caution that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive.
