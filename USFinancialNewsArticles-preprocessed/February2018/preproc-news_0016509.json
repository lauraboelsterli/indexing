People will queue between metal fences under the gaze of the army and police as they wait in line to fill up their containers.\nAuthorities say each person will be allocated 25 litres of water per day, and have been urging residents of the city to “save water or queue for water” in the run-up to Day Zero.\nFrom the beginning of February, residents and visitors will be allocated only 50 litres a day, 7 times less than the average U.S. citizen, according to the World Water Council.\n“I am extremely worried because of all the negative things that could happen,” said Sharon O‘Connor, a 63-year-old financial assistant as she waited her turn.\nClose to the brewery spring at Newlands, city officials stepped in after an altercation to access another spring in the area turned violent. One person was arrested, officials said.\nWorried about diseases spreading, the city has warned residents about drinking water from unsafe sources across the city.\nAt another popular collection site where water flows in the surburb of Woodstock that lies at the foot of Table Mountain, pick-up trucks with empty containers pull over under a bridge as people bend down on the pavement to access the water source.\n“Desperate times call for desperate measures,” said one business man, who only identified himself as Amien.
