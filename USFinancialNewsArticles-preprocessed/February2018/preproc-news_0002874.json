    "text": "STAINES-UPON-THAMES, United Kingdom, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE: MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that Mark Casey has been appointed General Counsel, effective immediately. Mr. Casey will join Mallinckrodt's Executive Committee, the company's senior most leadership group, and report directly to MNK President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Trudeau.\nMr. Casey, 54, has over ten years of experience as a healthcare industry General Counsel and comes to Mallinckrodt with extensive background in international business; litigation management across a range of matters; acquisitions and divestitures; and deep experience in intellectual property, regulatory and legal strategy. Beginning his 20-year legal career as a patent attorney for the Digital Equipment Corporation and for EMC Corporation, he then progressed through roles of increasing responsibility at publicly traded life sciences companies including serving as Senior Patent Counsel at Boston Scientific and Chief Patent Counsel and Deputy General Counsel at Cytyc Corporation. He then served as General Counsel at Hologic, Inc. and, most recently, at Idera Pharmaceuticals. A graduate of Syracuse University with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Mr. Casey holds a Juris Doctor from Suffolk University Law School. His primary office will be located in the Bedminster, NJ facility housing Mallinckrodt's Specialty Brands business and related research and development staffs.\n\"Mallinckrodt is continuing the strategic transformation of our company and portfolio,\" said Mark Trudeau, President and Chief Executive Officer . \"In the last six months alone we completed three transactions, and announced an additional acquisition and divestiture â€“ making significant strides in creating a company in which Specialty Brands will comprise the lion's share of our net sales. But the environment in which we operate is increasingly complex, and we believe Mark Casey's background and industry experience as General Counsel will help us meet the needs of our continually growing business.\"\n\"I'm very excited to be joining Mallinckrodt at this pivotal time in the company's transformation,\" commented Mr. Casey. \"Mallinckrodt's strategy to become an innovation-driven specialty pharmaceutical growth company and its focus on improving patient outcomes in areas of high, unmet medical need present an exciting opportunity. I look forward to joining Mallinckrodt's proven leadership team to make this vision a reality.\"\nABOUT MALLINCKRODT\nMallinckrodt is a global business that develops, manufactures, markets and distributes specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies.
