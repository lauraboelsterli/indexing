AWS continued to expand its infrastructure in 2017 to best serve customers, launching a new region in France and a second AWS Region in China during the quarter. AWS plans to open 12 more Availability Zones across four regions (Bahrain, Hong Kong, Sweden, and a second GovCloud Region in the U.S.) between now and early 2019. AWS now operates 52 Availability Zones across 18 infrastructure regions globally. AWS continues to accelerate its pace of innovation with the release of 497 significant new services and features in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of launches in 2017 to 1,430. AWS announced Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that removes the heavy lifting, complexity, and guesswork from each step of the machine learning process, empowering everyday developers and scientists to use machine learning much more expansively and successfully. Amazon SageMaker makes model building and training easier by providing prebuilt development notebooks, popular machine learning algorithms optimized for petabyte-scale datasets, and automatic model tuning, enabling developers to build, train, and deploy models in a single click. Since its launch two months ago, Amazon SageMaker is already helping thousands of developers to easily get started and become competent in building, training, and deploying models. AWS launched EC2 P3 instances which are optimized for machine learning and high performance computing — providing up to six times better performance than any other GPU instances available in the cloud today. P3 instances significantly reduce the time it takes to train machine learning models, providing a substantial boost in agility for developers experimenting and optimizing machine learning applications. The combination of EC2 P3 instances and Amazon SageMaker provide developers and data scientists access to the industry’s most powerful and easy-to-use solution for building machine learning applications. AWS introduced four Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that allow developers to build applications that emulate human-like cognition: Amazon Transcribe for converting speech to text; Amazon Translate for translating text between languages; Amazon Comprehend for understanding relationships and finding insights within text; and Amazon Rekognition Video, a deep-learning powered video analysis service that tracks people, detects activities, and recognizes objects, celebrities, and inappropriate content. AWS launched AWS DeepLens, a deep-learning enabled wireless video camera that pairs an HD camera developer kit with a set of sample projects to help developers learn machine learning concepts, including computer vision and deep learning. AWS introduced several services and capabilities for connected devices at the edge: AWS IoT 1-Click makes it easy for simple devices to trigger AWS Lambda functions that execute a specific action; AWS IoT Device Management helps to securely onboard, organize, monitor, and remotely manage customers’ IoT devices at scale throughout their lifecycle; AWS IoT Device Defender allows customers to secure their fleet of IoT devices on an ongoing basis; AWS IoT Analytics enables customers to cleanse, process, enrich, store, and analyze IoT device data at scale; Amazon FreeRTOS is an IoT operating system for microcontrollers that makes small, low-powered edge devices easy to program, deploy, secure, connect, and maintain; and AWS Greengrass Machine Learning (ML) Inference makes it easy to perform ML inference locally on AWS Greengrass devices even when they are not connected to the cloud. In its second year of availability, the number of databases migrated to AWS in 2017 using the AWS Database Migration Service is accelerating — growing more than 100% over 2016 to a total of more than 54,000 databases migrated since the introduction of the service. AWS launched the Amazon ML Solutions Lab, a program that connects machine learning experts from across Amazon with AWS customers to help identify practical uses of machine learning inside customers’ businesses, and guide them in developing new machine learning-enabled features, products, and processes. The Amazon ML Solutions Lab combines hands-on educational workshops with brainstorming sessions to help customers “work backwards” from business challenges, and understand the step-by-step processes for developing machine learning-based solutions. AWS introduced several new database capabilities: Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora that saves customers time and money by automatically adjusting database capacity to match application needs; Amazon DynamoDB with Global Tables is the first fully managed database service that provides true multi-master, multi-region read and writes, offering high-performance and low-latency for globally distributed applications and users; and Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy for developers to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. AWS announced two new container capabilities that make it easier to deploy, manage, and scale container workloads on AWS. Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) brings Kubernetes to AWS as a fully managed service, enabling customers to run Kubernetes applications on AWS without the need to become experts in operating Kubernetes clusters. AWS also introduced AWS Fargate that allows customers to launch and run containers without provisioning or managing servers or clusters. AWS launched three new Amazon EC2 instances: the I3 High I/O family introduces a brand new capability with Amazon EC2 Bare Metal instances that enable customers to run workloads directly on AWS hardware, or bring their own hypervisor or virtualization stack; H1 is a new family of Storage Optimized instances designed for applications that require low cost, high disk throughput and high sequential disk I/O access to very large data sets; and M5, the next generation of General Purpose instances, provides higher performance and lower prices for general purpose workloads, delivering even better compute, memory, and networking performance, powered by the latest 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series processors. AWS announced Amazon GuardDuty, a fully managed intelligent threat detection service that helps customers protect their AWS accounts and workloads by continuously monitoring and analyzing account activity for malicious or unauthorized behavior. Amazon GuardDuty applies machine learning to identify anomalies and alert customers. AWS introduced the preview of Amazon S3 Select, which lets customers pull out only the data they need from an S3 object instead of retrieving the entire object, dramatically improving the performance and reducing the cost of applications that need to access data in Amazon S3. AWS also announced Amazon Glacier Select, which allows companies in highly regulated industries to easily query cold, archived data in Amazon Glacier, and unlock new business value for archived data. AWS launched Amazon Sumerian, a new service that makes it easy for any developer to quickly and easily build virtual reality, augmented reality, and 3D applications to run on mobile devices, head-mounted displays, digital signage, or web browsers. Apps created in Amazon Sumerian will run in any browser that supports WebGL or WebVR graphics rendering, including Daydream, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and iOS mobile devices. AWS announced AWS Media Services, a family of five integrated broadcast-quality media services that make it easy for video providers of all kinds to create reliable, flexible, and scalable video offerings in the cloud. These five services enable customers to build end-to-end workflows for both live and on-demand video with the professional features, image quality, and reliability needed to deliver premium video experiences to viewers across a multitude of devices. By combining the proven video solutions from AWS Elemental with the security, durability, availability, and scalability of AWS, video providers can focus on innovating and making great content instead of spending time building and maintaining on-premises video infrastructure. AWS launched Alexa for Business, a new service that brings Alexa into the workplace to help employees be more productive and organized on both personal and shared Echo devices by simply using their voice. Employees can use Alexa for Business to find an open conference room, make phone calls, check calendars, schedule and start meetings, manage to-do lists, set reminders, and even find information in popular business applications like Salesforce, Concur, or Splunk. At re:Invent, AWS and VMware Inc. announced that VMware Cloud on AWS is expanding availability from the U.S. West (Oregon) region to include the AWS U.S. East (N. Virginia) region. AWS also announced additional VMware capabilities and support for more AWS services, making it even easier for customers to move, run, and protect mission-critical applications at scale.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 1, 2018, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance\nNet sales are expected to be between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion, or to grow between 34% and 42% compared with first quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately $1.2 billion or 330 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $300 million and $1.0 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in first quarter 2017. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir . This call will contain and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is www.amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases and social media postings, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

The amount of the adjustment was $401 million for TTM Q3 2016 and $829 million for TTM Q4 2016. (2) Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities.\n(3) Free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. (4) Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. (5) Average Total Assets minus Current Liabilities (excluding current portion of Long-Term Debt and current portion of capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations) over five quarter ends.
