    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 2:10 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago U.S. bans export of weapons, defence services to South Sudan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday banned the export of weapons and defence services to South Sudan, stepping up pressure against President Salva Kiir to end the country’s four-year conflict. \n“The Department of State today announces that it is implementing restrictions on the export of defence articles and defence services into South Sudan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. \nWhile the United States government does not conduct arms sales to South Sudan, the move prevents any American company or citizen from sending military equipment or services to the country’s warring factions. \nThe unilateral embargo is another signal by Washington that it is losing patience with Kiir after ceasefires have been repeatedly violated.
