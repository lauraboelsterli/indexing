    "text": "0 COMMENTS Macy’s Inc. M 4.34% reported a surprise increase in same-store sales during its latest quarter as the retailer came off a positive couple of months from the holiday season.\nThe department-store operator led the S&P 500 Tuesday morning as the stock rose 12%. \nComparable-store sales rose 1.3% on an owned basis, beating estimates from analysts polled by Consensus Metrix who were expecting the metric to fall by 0.3%. On an owned and licensed basis, comparable-store sales increased by 1.4%, while analysts were expecting a decline of 0.6%. \nThe company said total sales were $8.67 billion, up 1.8% from the same period a year ago. That was slightly below the $8.68 billion analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were anticipating. \nMacy’s also released its guidance for 2018 and said it expects comparable-store sales to fall within the range of flat to up 1%, while it expects total sales to fall between 0.5% and 2%. The company guided adjusted per-share earnings between $3.55 and $3.75, while analysts are expecting adjusted earnings of $3.04 a share for the year. \nThe company earned a profit of $1.33 billion, or $4.31 a share, up from $475 million, or $1.54 per share, for the same period a year ago. Macy’s had a noncash tax benefit of $571 million, in line with the company’s expectations.\nExcluding one-time items Macy’s reported an adjusted profit of $2.82 a share, compared with $2.02 a share a year ago. Analysts were expecting the company to earn $2.71 a share on an adjusted basis.\nWrite to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com",
