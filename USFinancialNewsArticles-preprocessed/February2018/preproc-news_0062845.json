    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc. (NASDAQ:XOG) (“Extraction” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Highlights\nFourth quarter average net sales volumes of 66,134 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) including 33,674 barrels per day (Bbl/d) of crude oil and full-year 2017 average net sales volumes of 51,764 BOE/d including 26,284 Bbl/d of crude oil;\nFor the fourth quarter, Extraction reported a net loss of $30.6 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share 1 , compared to a net loss of $245.6 million for the same period in 2016 and net loss of $29.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged 2 was $147.3 million for the fourth quarter, up 153% year-over-year and up 17% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDAX was $134.7 million for the fourth quarter, up 148% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially;\nFull-year 2017 net loss of $44.4 million, or $0.35 per basic and diluted share, compares favorably to the Company’s full-year 2016 net loss of $456.0 million. Full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged was $399.1 million, up 144% year-over-year while Adjusted EBITDAX was $380.5 million, up 98%; and\nDrilling and completion (D&C) capital expenditures for the full-year 2017 were $865 million.\nCommenting on fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, Extraction's Chairman and CEO Mark Erickson said: “We entered 2017 with very high expectations we set for ourselves. Looking back on the year, we doubled our first quarter equivalent production during the fourth quarter, coming in above the midpoint of our growth guidance. Oil production increased two and a half times during the fourth quarter over the first quarter, again coming in near the high end of our guidance. Our full-year D&C capital expenditures came in at the bottom of our recently revised guidance range and was only two percent above our original guidance. Looking forward, we expect to achieve full cash flow neutrality in the second half of 2018. We remain focused on maintaining our low cost structure which has experienced little to no cost inflation, while improving our capital efficiency as we employ our operational learnings from the past few years.”\n1 For further information on the earnings per share, refer to the Consolidated Statement of Operations\n2 Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, read “-Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged.”\nFinancial Results\nFourth quarter average net sales volumes were 66,134 BOE/d, an increase of 73% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Fourth quarter crude oil volumes of 33,674 Bbl/d increased 109% year-over-year and decreased 3% sequentially. Full-year 2017 average net sales volumes were 51,764 BOE/d, an increase of 73% year-over-year while full-year 2017 crude oil volumes increased 82% year-over-year to 26,284 BOE/d. Crude oil accounted for approximately 70% and 69% of the Company’s total revenues recorded during the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.\nFor the fourth quarter, Extraction reported oil, natural gas and NGL sales revenue of $214.0 million, as compared to $94.7 million during the same period in 2016, representing an increase of 126%. Revenue increased 18% sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in average daily production. For the full year, Extraction’s oil, natural gas and NGL sales revenues increased 117% over the prior year to $604.3 million.\nExtraction reported a net loss of $30.6 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter, compared to net loss of $245.6 million for the same period in 2016 and net loss of $29.8 million for the third quarter. This net loss was driven predominately by a $70.1 million unrealized loss on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged was $147.3 million for the fourth quarter, up 153% year-over-year and up 17% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDAX was $134.7 million for the fourth quarter, up 148% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Full-year 2017 net loss of $44.4 million compares favorably to the Company’s full-year 2016 net loss of $456.0 million. Full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged was $399.1 million, up 144% year-over-year while Adjusted EBITDAX was $380.5 million, up 98%.\nThe following table provides a summary of our sales volumes, average sales prices and certain operating expenses on a per BOE basis for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales (MBoe) (1) : 6,084 3,511 18,894 10,940 Oil sales (MBbl) 3,098 1,479 9,594 5,287 Natural gas sales (MMcf) 10,682 7,360 32,395 20,212 NGL sales (MBbl) 1,206 805 3,901 2,284 Sales (BOE/d) (1) : 66,134 38,161 51,764 29,891 Oil sales (Bbl/d) 33,674 16,076 26,284 14,446 Natural gas sales (Mcf/d) 116,108 80,004 88,754 55,223 NGL sales (Bbl/d) 13,109 8,751 10,687 6,240 Average sales prices (2) : Oil sales (per Bbl) $ 48.52 $ 39.33 $ 43.77 $ 36.70 Oil sales with derivative settlements (per Bbl) 43.90 37.16 41.67 40.59 Differential ($/Bbl) to Average NYMEX WTI (6.78 ) (9.96 ) (7.08 ) (6.77 ) Natural gas sales (per Mcf) 2.74 2.84 2.85 2.41 Natural gas sales with derivative settlements (per Mcf) 2.89 2.76 2.90 2.81 Differential ($/Mcf) to Average NYMEX Henry Hub (0.47 ) (0.65 ) (0.47 ) (0.40 ) NGL sales (per Bbl) 28.60 19.38 23.60 15.49 Average price per BOE 35.18 26.97 31.98 25.42 Average price per BOE with derivative settlements 33.10 25.88 31.00 28.04 Expense per BOE: Lease operating expenses $ 5.84 $ 6.04 $ 5.89 $ 5.67 Operating expenses 3.08 3.13 3.19 3.36 Transportation and gathering 2.76 2.91 2.70 2.31 General and administrative expenses 5.30 56.17 5.83 21.24 Cash general and administrative expenses 2.19 3.37 2.36 2.93 Unit and stock-based compensation 3.11 52.80 3.47 18.31 Production taxes as a % of Revenue 8.46 % 4.01 % 8.50 % 7.45 % (1) One BOE is equal to six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas or one barrel (“Bbl”) of oil or NGL based on an approximate energy equivalency. This is an energy content correlation and does not reflect a value or price relationship between the commodities.\n(2) Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of our settlements of our commodity derivative contracts. Our calculation of such effects includes both gains and losses on settlements for commodity derivatives and amortization of premiums paid or received on options that settled during the period.\nOperational Results\nFor the full-year 2017, the Company’s aggregate drilling, completion, leasehold and midstream capital expenditures totaled approximately $949 million, $865 million of which was for drilling and completion, $73 million on leasehold and $11 million on midstream.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Extraction reached total depth on 45 gross (37 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 feet, completed 42 gross (26 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 7,500 feet and turned to sales 75 gross (53 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 8,500 feet. For the full year, Extraction reached total depth on 186 gross (137 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 8,300 feet, completed 198 gross (159 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 8,000 feet and turned to sales 198 gross (168 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 7,800 feet.\nExtraction turned to sales its second operated well in the Hawkeye Area late in the fourth quarter. The well was a two-mile lateral and produced at a peak 30-day rate of 819 BOE/d (69% oil), similar to the Company’s first operated well in the Hawkeye area which produced at a peak 30-day rate of 774 BOE/d (73% oil) from a 1.5 mile lateral.\nUpdate on Asset Sale Program\n﻿To date, Extraction has received multiple agreements to divest various properties for approximately $70 million. These sales are not expected to have a material impact to the Company’s previously announced 2018 guidance and are projected to close during the second quarter of 2018.\nDebt and Liquidity\nPro forma for the November 2017 borrowing base increase which closed in January 2018 as well the January 2018 Senior Notes offering, Extraction’s liquidity was approximately $740 million.\nCommenting on the Company’s current liquidity position, Extraction CFO Rusty Kelley said, “We remain committed to delivering robust production and cash flow growth that will result in our capital expenditure program being entirely self-funded with operating cash flow beginning sometime in the second half of this year. While commodity prices have moved up since we went through the budgeting process, we expect any increases in cash flow to help us get to cash flow neutrality sooner. If commodity prices hold, we expect to find ourselves in the enviable position of achieving excess free cash flow and are currently discussing internally options for the use of this cash flow, which may include strengthening our balance and return of capital to shareholders.”\nProved Reserves at December 31, 2017\nExtraction’s estimated 2017 year-end proved reserves are 293 MMBoe, a 23% increase when compared to year-end 2016 proved reserves of 238 MMBoe. The Company’s estimated proved developed reserves at year-end 2017 were 102 MMBOE, an increase of 110% year-over-year. Year-end 2017 reserves are comprised of approximately 111 MMBbl of oil and 77 MMBbl of NGLs.\nIn accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidelines, Extraction’s proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were computed using SEC pricing of $51.34 per barrel of crude oil and $2.98 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas, before adjustments for energy content, quality, midstream fees, and basis differentials. Prices adhere to the SEC requirement to use the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. Reserve estimates for 2017 were prepared by Extraction’s independent reservoir engineering consultant, Ryder Scott Company, L.P.\nThe table below reconciles the components driving the 2017 proved reserves increase:\nBalance, December 31, 2016 (MMBoe) 238.1 Purchases of reserves 14.1 Extensions and discoveries 56.5 Revisions of previous estimates 2.9 Production (18.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2017 (MMBoe) 292.7 Updated Investor Presentation\nExtraction has posted an updated investor presentation to its website.

Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) adjusted for certain cash and non-cash items, including depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairment of long lived assets, exploration expenses, rig termination fees, acquisition transaction expenses, commodity derivative (gain) loss, settlements on commodity derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the period, unit and stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, interest expense, income taxes, and non-recurring charges. We define Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged as Adjusted EBITDAX adjusted for settlements on commodity derivative instruments and premiums paid for derivative that settled during the period.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital, hedging strategy and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are widely followed measures of operating performance. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged and net income (loss) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table above. Additionally, our management team believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are useful to an investor in evaluating our financial performance because these measures (i) are widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term, among other factors; (ii) help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and (iii) are used by our management team for various purposes, including as a measure of operating performance, in presentations to our board of directors, as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nInvestor Contact: Louis Baltimore, ir@extractionog.com , 720-974-7773\nMedia Contact: Brian Cain, info@extractionog.com , 720-974-7782\nSource:Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc.",
