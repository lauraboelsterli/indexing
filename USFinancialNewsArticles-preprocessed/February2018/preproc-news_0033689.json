    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: WYN) today announced results for the fourth quarter and 2017. The Company's adjusted results exceeded its most recent projections, published in October, and its reported results were further increased by the favorable impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on fourth quarter earnings.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company classified its European vacation rentals business, for which it is exploring strategic alternatives, as a discontinued operation. As a result of this reclassification, the Company's results from continuing operations are not comparable to its previously reported results or its prior projections. The following table highlights results from continuing and discontinued operations:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nContinuing\nOperations\nDiscontinued\nOperations\nCombined\nContinuing\nOperations\nDiscontinued\nOperations\nCombined\nRevenues\n$\n1,246\n$\n148\n$\n1,394\n$\n5,076\n$\n745\n$\n5,821\nNet Income/(Loss)*\n$\n462\n$\n(13)\n$\n449\n$\n818\n$\n53\n$\n871\nAdjusted Net Income/(Loss)*\n$\n152\n$\n(2)\n$\n150\n$\n570\n$\n68\n$\n639\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n320\n$\n14\n$\n334\n$\n1,256\n$\n141\n$\n1,397\nDiluted EPS\n$\n4.54\n$\n(0.13)\n$\n4.41\n$\n7.89\n$\n0.51\n$\n8.40\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\n$\n1.49\n$\n(0.02)\n$\n1.47\n$\n5.50\n$\n0.66\n$\n6.16\n*Includes non-controlling interests.\nFull-year adjusted EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations of $1,397 million compares to the Company's October projection of $1,380 million to $1,395 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Table 9 of this release provides additional information regarding continuing and discontinued operations for both 2017 and 2016. Full reconciliations of GAAP results to non-GAAP measures for all reported periods appear in the tables to this press release.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 OPERATING RESULTS\nFourth quarter revenues from continuing operations were $1.2 billion, up 4% compared with the prior-year period.\nNet income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $462 million compared with $164 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations was $4.54, versus $1.53 in the prior-year period. Net income from continuing operations was impacted by $426 million ($4.18 per share) of tax benefit recorded primarily as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $4 million after-tax expense ($0.04 per share) from the Act's impact on long-term incentive awards, $87 million ($0.86 per share) of after-tax impairment expense, $22 million ($0.22 per share) of after-tax separation costs and $2 million ($0.02 per share) of after-tax acquisition costs.\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $152 million or $1.49 per diluted share, compared with $147 million or $1.36 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted results exclude separation costs, the initial impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, impairment expense and other items as detailed in Tables 7 and 8 of this press release. The growth in earnings primarily reflects higher revenues in all three of the Company's operating segments, partially offset by increased interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS also reflects the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program.\n\"As we continue the process of separating into two publicly traded companies, our business momentum remains strong,\" said Stephen P. Holmes, chairman and CEO. \"Our teams have continued to execute against our strategic and operating plans; we continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and we have positioned our businesses for future growth.\"\nFourth quarter EBITDA from continuing operations was $174 million, compared with $308 million in the prior-year period, reflecting asset impairments and separation costs recorded in fourth quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $320 million, compared with $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 5%. Results primarily reflect the growth in revenues along with cost containment efforts, partially offset by $16 million of hurricane impacts. The Company's results have been adjusted to reflect the classification of the European vacation rentals business as a discontinued operation.\nAs previously reported, weather events in the third quarter had an unusually pronounced effect on fourth quarter operating results. The Company estimates that the third quarter hurricanes reduced fourth quarter revenues, net income and EBITDA by $15 million, $10 million, and $16 million, respectively. The reductions primarily reflect the temporary closure of vacation ownership sales centers, particularly in the Caribbean, and remediation efforts at the Company's Wyndham Rio Mar hotel in Puerto Rico.\nFULL-YEAR 2017 OPERATING RESULTS\nFull-year revenues from continuing operations were $5.1 billion, up 3% compared with the prior year.\nFull-year net income from continuing operations was $819 million compared with $545 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $7.89, versus $4.93 in the prior year. The growth in earnings is primarily due to the tax benefit recorded as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partially offset by impairment expenses and separation costs.\nFull-year adjusted net income from continuing operations was $570 million or $5.50 per diluted share, compared with $569 million or $5.15 per diluted share in 2016. Adjusted results exclude items as detailed in Tables 7 and 8 of this press release. The growth in revenues was offset by higher year-over-year interest, depreciation and variable compensation expenses along with the impact of the third quarter hurricanes. The growth in adjusted diluted EPS primarily reflects the Company's repurchase of 6% of its outstanding shares in 2017.\nFull-year 2017 EBITDA from continuing operations was $952 million, compared with $1,197 million in 2016, primarily reflecting asset impairments and separation costs. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $1,256 million, compared with $1,239 million in the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA primarily reflects the growth in revenues, partially offset by $26 million of hurricane impacts.\nThe Company estimates that the third quarter weather events reduced full-year revenues, net income and EBITDA by $28 million, $17 million and $26 million, respectively. The reductions primarily reflect the temporary closure of vacation ownership sales centers, particularly in the Caribbean, and remediation efforts at Company's Wyndham Rio Mar hotel in Puerto Rico.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $880 million, compared with $846 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflects higher net income.\nFree cash flow from continuing operations was $727 million in 2017, compared with $686 million for the prior year, primarily reflecting the changes in net cash provided by operating activities. Total free cash flow (from continuing and discontinued operations) was $799 million in 2017, compared with $782 million in 2016. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS\nHotel Group\nRevenues increased 5% to $332 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $316 million in fourth quarter 2016. Results reflect higher royalties and franchise fees as well as higher pass-through marketing, reservation and Wyndham Rewards revenues.\nEBITDA was $55 million in the fourth quarter compared with $99 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to $41 million of impairment expense related to a hotel management contract and the write-down of other intangible assets in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million compared with $99 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the revenue increases, partially offset by the adverse impact of Hurricane Maria on the Company's owned hotel in Puerto Rico.\nFourth quarter domestic RevPAR increased 4.5% compared with fourth quarter 2016. In constant currency, global RevPAR increased 4.6%.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's hotel system consisted of over 8,400 properties and approximately 728,200 rooms, a 4% increase compared with a year earlier, including almost 12,000 rooms we added to the system with the acquisition of AmericInn in October. The development pipeline increased to nearly 1,160 hotels and 148,200 rooms, a 7% year-over-year room increase, of which 58% are international and 68% are new construction.\nDestination Network\nThis segment no longer includes the Company's European vacation rentals business, which is now classified as a discontinued operation. Revenues were $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 5%. Exchange revenue per member increased 7%, driven by favorable pricing, while the average number of members declined 1%.\nEBITDA was $40 million compared with $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting $8 million of separation costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $48 million compared with $39 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 23%, primarily reflecting favorable pricing as well as cost-saving initiatives.\nVacation Ownership\nRevenues were $734 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $705 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 4%. The increase reflects a 7% increase in gross VOI sales, despite the negative impact of the hurricanes on VOI sales, as well as higher consumer financing revenues.\nTour flow increased 7%, driven by increased tours to new owners. Volume per guest (VPG) increased 2%.\nEBITDA was $133 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $182 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting a $65 million asset impairment directly attributable to the recent hurricanes and their continuing effects on the Caribbean. Adjusted EBITDA was $200 million compared with $191 million in the prior-year quarter. Results reflect higher gross VOI sales and consumer financing revenue, partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses.\nOTHER ITEMS\nLa Quinta Acquisition - The Company recently announced its intention to purchase La Quinta Holdings' hotel franchising and hotel management operations for $1.95 billion in cash. The transaction will add nearly 900 managed and franchised hotels to our Hotel Group's portfolio and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. Corporate Tax Reform - The Company recorded a one-time, net tax benefit of $426 million, primarily driven by a reduction in its net deferred tax liability due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Impairment Charges - Non-cash impairment charges totaled $106 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The charges are for the write-down of VOI inventory along with property and equipment at our Vacation Ownership business due to the impact of the third quarter hurricanes, the write-down of a guarantee asset and a note receivable related to a hotel management agreement, and the write-down of certain intangible assets in our Hotel Group business. Share Repurchases - The Company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $150 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 at an average price of $110.06. Over the course of 2017, the Company repurchased 6.3 million shares of stock, or 6% of shares outstanding, at a cost of $601 million. From January 1 through February 13, 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 0.2 million shares for $21 million. Dividend Increase - The Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.66 from $0.58 per share, beginning with the dividend that is expected to be declared in the first quarter of 2018. Upcoming Separation - As previously announced, the Company plans to become two publicly traded hospitality companies through the spin-off of the Company's Hotel Group to shareholders. The process is proceeding as planned, and the Company expects to complete the separation in the second quarter of 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nNote to Editors: The Company has classified its European vacation rentals business, for which it is exploring strategic alternatives, as a discontinued operation and is therefore excluded from the outlook below. In addition, the outlook excludes possible future share repurchases. Current analysts' estimates include projections of the European vacation rentals business and often include projected share repurchases. These factors result in discrepancies between the Company's projections and database consensus forecasts.\nThe Company projects the following results for full-year 2018:\nRevenues of $5.26 billion to $5.40 billion, an increase of 4% to 6%. An effective tax rate applicable to adjusted pretax earnings of approximately 25%. Adjusted net income from continuing operations of $702 million to $722 million, an increase of 23% to 27%, approximately 19 points of which is due to a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.330 billion to $1.355 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 6% to 8% and is comprised of: Hotel Group adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% Destination Network adjusted EBITDA growth of 1% to 5% Vacation Ownership adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% to 8% Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $6.90 to $7.05, which is an increase of 25% to 28% and is based on a diluted share count of 101.7 million.\nThese projections exclude the impact of the La Quinta acquisition and the financing thereof, exclude any impact from our European vacation rentals business, which is treated as a discontinued operation, exclude costs associated with the Company's planned separation into two separate publicly-traded companies and are consistent with our historical recognition of revenues, without adjustment for the required 2018 change in revenue recognition accounting. See Table 12 for detailed projections.\nIn determining adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, the Company excludes certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measures. A description of the adjustments that have been applicable for the reported periods in determining adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are reflected in Tables 7 and 8 of this press release. The Company is providing an outlook for net income, EBITDA and EPS only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments or other potential adjustments that may arise in the future during the outlook period, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the Company's results and outlook on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These non-GAAP measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons and are helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding and assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance.

The Company also uses adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure of its operating performance. The Company believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of assessing performance of the Company and for the Company's segments which, when considered with GAAP measures, give a more complete understanding of its operating performance and assist its investors in evaluating its ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or nonrecurring and which in the Company's view do not necessarily reflect ongoing operating performance. The Company also internally uses these measures to assess its operating performance, both in absolute terms and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures. The Company's presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, as well as reconcile Net Income to EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nNet Revenues\nEBITDA\nNet

Comparable RevPAR represents RevPAR of hotels which are included in both periods.\nDestination Network\nAverage Number of Members: Represents members in the Company's vacation exchange programs who paid annual membership dues as of the end of the period or who are within the allowed grace period. For additional fees, such participants are entitled to exchange intervals for intervals at other properties affiliated with the Company's vacation exchange business. In addition, certain participants may exchange intervals for other leisure-related services and products.\nExchange Revenue Per Member: Represents total annualized revenues generated from fees associated with memberships, exchange transactions, member-related rentals and other servicing for the period divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the period.\nVacation Ownership\nGross Vacation Ownership Interest Sales: Represents sales of vacation ownership interest (VOIs), including WAAM sales, before the net effect of percentage-of-completion accounting and loan loss provisions. The Company believes gross VOI sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of its vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period. See Table 11 for a reconciliation of Gross VOI sales to vacation ownership interest sales.\nTours: Represents the number of tours taken by guests in the Company's efforts to sell VOIs.\nVolume per Guest (VPG): Represents Gross VOI sales (excluding tele-sales upgrades, which are non-tour upgrade sales) divided by the number of tours. The Company has excluded non-tour upgrade sales in the calculation of VPG because non-tour upgrade sales are generated by a different marketing channel. See Table 11 for a detail of tele-sales upgrades for 2014-2017.\nGeneral\nConstant Currency: Represents a comparison eliminating the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between periods (foreign currency translation).\nCurrency-Neutral: Represents a comparison eliminating the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between periods (foreign currency translation) and the impact caused by any foreign exchange related activities (i.e., hedges, balance sheet remeasurements and/or adjustments).\nTable 4\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND RECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities - Continuing Operations\n$\n880\n$\n846\nNet cash provided by operating activities - Discontinued Operations\n107\n127\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n987\n973\nNet cash used in investing activities - Continuing Operations\n(362)\n(259)\nNet cash used in investing activities - Discontinued Operations\n(32)\n(94)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(394)\n(353)\nNet cash used in financing activities - Continuing Operations\n(538)\n(576)\nNet cash used in financing activities - Discontinued Operations\n(21)\n(10)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(559)\n(586)\nEffect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n14\n(20)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n48\n$\n14\nFree Cash Flow:\nThe Company defines free cash flow to be net cash provided by operating activities less property and equipment additions which the Company also refers to as capital expenditures. The Company believes free cash flow to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of its operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, its ability to grow its business through acquisitions, development advances and equity investments, as well as its ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measures of net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities as a means for evaluating Wyndham Worldwide is that free cash flow does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nThe following table provides more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure and the related reconciliation between these financial measures:\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities - Continuing Operations\n$\n880\n$\n846\nLess: Property and equipment additions-Continuing Operations\n(153)\n(160)\nFree cash flow - Continuing Operations\n$\n727\n$\n686\nNet cash provided by operating activities - Discontinued Operations\n$\n107\n$\n127\nLess: Property and equipment additions-Discontinued Operations\n(35)\n(31)\nFree cash flow - Discontinued Operations\n$\n72\n$\n96\nTotal free cash flow\n$\n799\n$\n782\nTable 5\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nREVENUE DETAIL BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT\n(In millions)\n2017\n2016\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nHotel Group\nRoyalties and Franchise Fees\n$\n79\n$\n98\n$\n114\n$\n100\n$\n391\n$\n74\n$\n94\n$\n105\n$\n94\n$\n367\nMarketing, Reservation and Wyndham Rewards Revenues (a)\n83\n106\n120\n98\n407\n83\n103\n125\n92\n405\nHotel Management Reimbursable Revenues (b)\n66\n69\n64\n64\n264\n67\n71\n67\n65\n271\nIntersegment Trademark Fees\n13\n15\n16\n14\n59\n13\n15\n16\n14\n56\nOwned Hotel Revenues\n23\n21\n16\n18\n78\n27\n19\n17\n17\n81\nAncillary Revenues (c)\n34\n36\n38\n38\n144\n31\n32\n34\n34\n129\nTotal Hotel Group\n298\n345\n368\n332\n1,343\n295\n334\n364\n316\n1,309\nDestination Network\nExchange Revenues\n183\n159\n158\n154\n654\n182\n159\n159\n145\n645\nRental Revenues North America\n38\n46\n63\n25\n172\n39\n44\n62\n25\n169\nAncillary Revenues (d)\n19\n23\n22\n21\n86\n19\n22\n22\n20\n84\nTotal Destination Network\n240\n228\n243\n200\n912\n240\n225\n243\n190\n898\nVacation Ownership\nVacation Ownership Interest Sales\n351\n448\n467\n423\n1,689\n342\n409\n441\n415\n1,606\nConsumer Financing\n111\n114\n119\n120\n463\n107\n108\n112\n113\n440\nProperty Management Fees and Reimbursable Revenues\n175\n175\n171\n172\n692\n164\n161\n168\n168\n660\nWAAM Fee-for-Service Commissions\n2\n4\n8\n10\n24\n17\n16\n13\n-\n46\nAncillary Revenues (e)\n9\n9\n8\n9\n37\n11\n11\n10\n9\n42\nTotal Vacation Ownership\n648\n750\n773\n734\n2,905\n641\n705\n744\n705\n2,794\nTotal Reportable Segments\n$\n1,186\n$\n1,323\n$\n1,384\n$\n1,266\n$\n5,160\n$\n1,176\n$\n1,264\n$\n1,351\n$\n1,211\n$\n5,001\n2015\n2014\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYear\nHotel Group\nRoyalties and Franchise Fees\n$\n74\n$\n96\n$\n103\n$\n87\n$\n361\n$\n68\n$\n88\n$\n100\n$\n83\n$\n339\nMarketing, Reservation and Wyndham Rewards Revenues (a)\n96\n108\n112\n92\n407\n76\n101\n117\n91\n385\nHotel Management Reimbursable Revenues (b)\n61\n71\n73\n68\n273\n37\n39\n39\n39\n154\nIntersegment Trademark Fees\n12\n15\n16\n15\n57\n9\n11\n11\n10\n41\nOwned Hotel Revenues\n25\n20\n16\n19\n79\n24\n20\n18\n20\n81\nAncillary Revenues (c)\n24\n24\n37\n33\n120\n23\n24\n30\n24\n101\nTotal Hotel Group\n292\n334\n357\n314\n1,297\n237\n283\n315\n267\n1,101\nDestination Network\nExchange Revenues\n185\n161\n157\n146\n649\n187\n168\n162\n150\n667\nRental Revenues North America\n31\n40\n58\n24\n152\n28\n36\n49\n18\n130\nAncillary Revenues (d)\n17\n21\n22\n19\n79\n15\n17\n18\n16\n67\nTotal Destination Network\n233\n222\n237\n189\n880\n230\n221\n229\n184\n864\nVacation Ownership\nVacation Ownership Interest Sales\n336\n417\n448\n403\n1,604\n303\n382\n415\n385\n1,485\nConsumer Financing\n104\n105\n108\n109\n427\n105\n106\n108\n108\n427\nProperty Management Fees and Reimbursable Revenues\n153\n149\n159\n155\n615\n143\n145\n150\n142\n581\nWAAM Fee-for-Service Commissions\n12\n19\n23\n28\n83\n33\n30\n18\n16\n98\nAncillary Revenues (e)\n12\n9\n12\n11\n43\n9\n10\n13\n17\n47\nTotal Vacation Ownership\n617\n699\n750\n706\n2,772\n593\n673\n704\n668\n2,638\nTotal Reportable Segments\n$\n1,142\n$\n1,255\n$\n1,344\n$\n1,209\n$\n4,949\n$\n1,060\n$\n1,177\n$\n1,248\n$\n1,119\n$\n4,603\nNote: Full year amounts may not add across due to rounding.\n(a)\nMarketing and reservation revenues represent fees the Company receives from franchised and managed hotels that are to be expended for marketing purposes or the operation of a centralized,\nbrand-specific reservation system.

The presentation of these adjustments is intended to permit the comparison of particular adjustments as they appear in the income statement in order to assist investors' understanding of the overall impact of such adjustments. In addition to GAAP financial measures, the Company provides adjusted net income and adjusted EPS financial measures to assist its investors in evaluating its ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or non-recurring and which in the Company's view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. The Company also internally uses these measures to assess its operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures. This non-GAAP reconciliation table should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 11\nWyndham Worldwide Corporation\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION OF GROSS VOI SALES\n(In millions)\nGROSS VOI SALES\nThe Company believes gross vacation ownership sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of its vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Gross VOI sales (see Table 3) to vacation ownership interest sales (see Table 5):\nYear\n2017\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nFull Year\nGross VOI sales\n$\n439\n$\n563\n$\n602\n$\n539\n$\n2,144\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(3)\n(5)\n(11)\n(15)\n(35)\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n436\n558\n590\n524\n2,108\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(85)\n(110)\n(123)\n(101)\n(420)\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n351\n$\n448\n$\n467\n$\n423\n$\n1,689\n2016\nGross VOI sales\n$\n428\n$\n518\n$\n564\n$\n502\n$\n2,012\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(23)\n(20)\n(20)\n(1)\n(64)\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n405\n498\n544\n501\n1,948\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(63)\n(90)\n(104)\n(86)\n(342)\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n342\n$\n409\n$\n441\n$\n415\n$\n1,606\n2015\nGross VOI sales\n$\n390\n$\n502\n$\n565\n$\n507\n$\n1,965\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(21)\n(26)\n(37)\n(42)\n(126)\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n369\n477\n528\n464\n1,838\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(46)\n(60)\n(78)\n(64)\n(248)\nLess: Impact of percentage-of-completion accounting\n13\n-\n(2)\n2\n13\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n336\n$\n417\n$\n448\n$\n403\n$\n1,604\n2014\nGross VOI sales\n$\n410\n$\n496\n$\n513\n$\n470\n$\n1,889\nLess: Sales under WAAM Fee-for-Service\n(44)\n(40)\n(27)\n(21)\n(132)\nGross VOI sales, net of WAAM Fee-for-Service sales\n366\n456\n486\n449\n1,757\nLess: Loan loss provision\n(60)\n(70)\n(70)\n(60)\n(260)\nLess: Impact of percentage-of-completion accounting\n(3)\n(4)\n(1)\n(4)\n(12)\nVacation ownership interest sales\n$\n303\n$\n382\n$\n415\n$\n385\n$\n1,485",
