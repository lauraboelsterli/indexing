    "text": "10 COMMENTS Puerto Rico’s hurricane-battered electric utility is seeking court approval of $300 million in emergency financing after a federal judge rejected a request for a larger loan opposed by the utility’s bondholders.\n“Time is of the essence,” lawyers for the U.S. territory’s power provider, known as Prepa, said in court papers filed Friday. “Prepa’s operations are in jeopardy.”\nWithout a cash infusion by Tuesday, the utility said emergency conservation measures will begin to push many of its residential, commercial and industrial customers into darkness.\nOn Thursday, Judge Laura Taylor Swain turned down a request to tap $550 million of a proposed $1 billion financing package from Puerto Rico’s central government. Siding with bondholders, the judge said negotiations on the loan between Prepa and the island’s government had been too cozy and should have involved more third parties.\nPrepa, which is already carrying $9 billion in debt, said in Friday’s court papers that the ruling “exacerbated the risk to an already fragile system” and leaves it vulnerable to outages and brownouts.\nA representative for Prepa’s bondholders declined to comment Friday. In court Thursday, lawyers for bondholders and bond insurers said the originally proposed intergovernmental loan would unfairly take priority over their own debt.\nJudge Swain made it clear that a $300 million so-called superpriority unsecured loan was likely to win her blessing. But even with the $300 million, Prepa said it would be able to continue normal operations only until late March and will soon have to return to the court for approval of additional financing.\nAnother hearing on the matter hasn’t been scheduled yet. Judge Swain is based in New York, but hearings on Prepa are also broadcast in a courtroom in Puerto Rico.\nPrepa, which controls what amounts to a monopoly on electricity in Puerto Rico, is in desperate need of new financing. The utility’s cash balances have dwindled as hundreds of thousands of customers remain without service months after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. Offline customers aren’t paying electric bills, eating into Prepa’s revenues while construction bills pile up.\nPuerto Rico was already struggling with a $73 billion debt load and a decade of economic stagnation when Maria struck in September.\nThe federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s finances placed the central government under what amounts to bankruptcy in May and two months later voted to move Prepa under court protection as well.\nWrite to Tom Corrigan at tom.corrigan@wsj.com",
