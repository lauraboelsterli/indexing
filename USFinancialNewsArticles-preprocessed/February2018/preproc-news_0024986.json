( bit.ly/2BqzmuJ ) \nScotiabank said the latest deal would C$40 billion in Jarislowsky’s assets under management and add to earnings by 2020. \nScotiabank said it intends to buy back some shares to offset the dilution expected by the deal. $1 = 1.2577 Canadian dollars Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr",
