    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MassRoots, Inc. (\"MassRoots\" or the \"Company\") (OTCQB: MSRT), one of the leading technology platforms for the regulated cannabis industry, today announced it appointed Mr. Graham Farrar, Founder and Owner of Mission Health Associates (d.b.a. Glass House Farms), to its Board of Directors on February 21, 2018. Prior to entering the cannabis industry, Mr. Farrar was an original member of Software.com (now OpenWave Systems), helping scale the business from a start-up through its initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq in 1999.\nMr. Farrar has held key product development positions at Sonos, a leading home audio product, and iStoryTime, a media app company focused on children's books. Mr. Farrar is Founder and Partner at Elite Garden Wholesale, a supplier of cannabis production equipment, and Chief Executive Officer of Glass House Farms, a leading cannabis production company in California.\n\"I'm excited to apply my experience in both developing great software products and building a leading California cannabis producer to the MassRoots platform,\" stated MassRoots Director, Graham Farrar. \"With the proper execution, I believe MassRoots has the potential to be a pre-eminent platform for cannabis consumers and businesses. I look forward to helping drive the Company's growth going forward.\"\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Graham Farrar to MassRoots' Board of Directors and believe the caliber of his relevant experience will be a valuable addition to our team,\" stated MassRoots Founder and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Isaac Dietrich. \"This appointment also adds an important voice that's been missing from our Boardroom â€“ that of an influential California cannabis producer. The feedback from this community will be instrumental in helping develop new features that address the needs of California businesses as we continue to grow our market-share.\"\nMr. Farrar is the successor to Mr. Nathan Shelton, who resigned from the Company's Board of Directors on February 21, 2018.\n\"It's been a privilege to serve MassRoots' shareholders over the past several months as we recapitalized the Company with $4.75 million in equity offerings, installed a seasoned management team led by its founder, and put MassRoots in a prime position to benefit from numerous cannabis markets coming online,\" stated outgoing MassRoots Director Nathan Shelton. \"At the ripe age of 79, I'm excited to spend more time with my family and know I am leaving MassRoots and its shareholders in good hands.\"\nFor more information, please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2018.\nAbout MassRoots\nMassRoots, Inc. is one of the leading technology platforms for the regulated cannabis industry. Powered by more than one million registered users, the Company's mobile apps empower consumers to make educated cannabis purchasing decisions through community-driven reviews.
