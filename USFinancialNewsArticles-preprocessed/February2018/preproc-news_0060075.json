Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFrank Harrison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “2017 was once again a year of transformation.

The increase in net sales in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by acquisitions and an increase in comparable net sales of 6.7%. The increase in comparable net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 was driven by an increase in comparable equivalent unit case volume of 1.5%.\nConsolidated net sales increased $1.16 billion, or 37.0%, to $4.32 billion in fiscal 2017, compared to $3.16 billion in fiscal 2016. The increases in net sales in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by acquisitions and an increase in comparable net sales of 3.1%. The increase in comparable net sales in fiscal 2017 was driven by an increase in comparable equivalent unit case volume of 1.6%.\nConsolidated income from operations decreased $21.8 million to a $0.9 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 from income of $20.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Consolidated income from operations decreased $31.7 million, or 24.8%, to $96.2 million in fiscal 2017, from $127.9 million in fiscal 2016. Comparable income from operations, which represents the same geographic territories in all periods presented, increased $8.3 million to $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable income from operations increased $2.8 million, or 2.4%, to $120.8 million in fiscal 2017, from $118.0 million in fiscal 2016.\nConsolidated income from operations was impacted by a challenging retail sales environment. We also incurred $8.1 million and $17.3 million of additional System Transformation transaction expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 and fiscal 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and fiscal 2016, respectively. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017 and fiscal 2017 we incurred $2.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to the conversion of distribution rights from indefinite lived intangible assets to long lived intangible assets during the first quarter of 2017.\nOther income (expense) was comprised of three categories of transactions in 2017: (i) the quarterly mark-to-market fair value adjustment for the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability for territories acquired from Coca‑Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company, which resulted in a benefit of $19.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an expense of $3.2 million in fiscal 2017, (ii) income of $6.0 million related to an increase in the Company’s investment in Southeastern Container, a manufacturing cooperative, following CCR’s redistribution of a portion of its investment in Southeastern Container in December 2017 and (iii) net working capital and other fair value adjustments related to acquisitions and divestitures that were made beyond one year from the transaction closing date, which provided a benefit of $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an expense of $7.0 million in fiscal 2017.\nGain on exchange transactions was $12.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which resulted from a $0.5 million gain on the exchange transactions that closed on October 2 (the “October 2017 Exchange Transactions”) and from recognition of $12.4 million of an aggregate $43.0 million one-time legacy facilities credit provided to the Company by The Coca‑Cola Company to compensate for the net economic impact of changes made by The Coca‑Cola Company to the authorized pricing on sales of covered beverages produced at the Company’s legacy facilities prior to implementation of new pricing mechanisms under the Company’s regional manufacturing agreement (the “Legacy Facilities Credit”). The $12.4 million immediately recognized by the Company represents the portion of the Legacy Facilities Credit related to a facility in Mobile, Alabama, which the Company transferred to CCR on October 2. The remaining $30.6 million balance of the Legacy Facilities Credit will be recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over a period of 40 years.\nConsolidated basic net income per share was $8.35 in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $2.31 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable basic net income per share was $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to comparable basic net loss per share of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, there were estimated benefits to basic net income per share of $7.14 due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) and $0.92 for the quarterly mark-to-market fair value adjustment for the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability.\nConsolidated basic net income per share was $10.35 in fiscal 2017, as compared to consolidated basic net income per share of $5.39 in fiscal 2016. Comparable basic net income per share was $4.11 in fiscal 2017, as compared to $4.64 in fiscal 2016.\nCash flows provided by operating activities were $307.8 million in fiscal 2017, which was an increase of $145.8 million compared to fiscal 2016. In addition to the cash generated from the distribution territories acquired in the System Transformation transactions, the increase was driven by (i) a one-time fee of $91.5 million received from CCR in the first quarter of 2017 for the conversion of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ then-existing bottling agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company or CCR to a new and final form comprehensive beverage agreement and (ii) the $30.6 million portion of the Legacy Facilities Credit which was not immediately recognized by the Company.\nAbout Coca‑Cola Bottling Co.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company’s ongoing performance. Further, given the signing of the Tax Act in December 2017 and the transformation of the Company’s business through System Transformation transactions with The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures allow users to better appreciate the impact of these transactions on the Company’s performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.\nThe following tables reconcile reported GAAP results to comparable results (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016:\nFourth Quarter 2017 (in thousands, except per share data) Net\nsales Income (loss)\nfrom operations Income before\nincome taxes Net\nincome Basic net income\nper share Reported results (GAAP) $ 1,126,149 $ (872 ) $ 29,131 $ 77,922 $ 8.35 Acquisitions results of operations A (536,070 ) 415 415 179 0.02 System Transformation transactions settlements B -

Concurrent with entering into the CBA, the Company converted its franchise rights for the Company’s legacy territories to distribution rights, to be amortized over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Adjustment reflects the net amortization expense associated with the conversion of the Company's franchise rights.\nThe Company enters into derivative instruments from time to time to hedge some or all of its projected purchases of aluminum, PET resin, diesel fuel and unleaded gasoline in order to mitigate commodity risk. The Company accounts for commodity hedges on a mark-to-market basis.\nThe Tax Act, which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and changed the deductibility of certain expenses, had an estimated impact of $66.6 million in 2017, primarily as a result of the Company revaluing its net deferred tax liabilities. The changes included within the Tax Act are broad and complex and the impact of the Tax Act recorded by the Company is an estimate. Any final impacts of the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions, changes in IRS interpretations, issuance of new guidance, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretation in response to the Tax Act and future actions by states within the U.S.\nAdjustment reflects a post-closing adjustment completed in the second quarter of 2016 relating to an asset exchange transaction the Company completed in 2015 for its Lexington, Kentucky territory.\nAdjustment reflects the gross profit on sales to other Coca‑Cola bottlers prior to the adoption of the Regional Manufacturing Agreement (as amended, the “RMA”) on March 31, 2017. Under the terms of the RMA, The Coca‑Cola Company implemented a standardized pricing methodology, which reduced the gross profit on the Company’s net sales to other Coca‑Cola bottlers. To compensate the Company for its reduction of gross profit under the RMA, The Coca‑Cola Company agreed to provide the Company an aggregate valuation adjustment through a payment or credit.\nA special charitable contribution was made during the first quarter of 2016.\nMedia Contact: Kimberly Kuo Senior Vice President, Public Affairs, Communications and Communities 704-557-4584 Investor Contact: David M.
