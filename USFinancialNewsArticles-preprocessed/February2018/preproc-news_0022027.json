    "text": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced results from the XGEVA ® (denosumab) Phase 3 '482 study, the largest international multiple myeloma trial for the prevention of skeletal-related events ever conducted (n=1,718), were published in The Lancet Oncology. In this study, XGEVA successfully met the primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first on-study skeletal-related event in patients with multiple myeloma (HR=0.98, 95 percent CI: 0.85-1.14).\n\"Osteolytic bone disease and renal dysfunction are the most frequent complications of multiple myeloma, affecting up to 90 and 60 percent of patients respectively,\" said Noopur Raje, M.D., director, Center for Multiple Myeloma, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston. \"Until recently, treatment options for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma were limited to bisphosphonates, which are cleared through the kidneys and can be associated with increased renal impairment. Denosumab, which is not cleared through the kidneys, provides a new treatment option for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma.\"\n\"Preventing bone complications is critical for patients with multiple myeloma,\" said David M. Reese, M.D., senior vice president of Translational Sciences and Oncology at Amgen. \"The bone-specific effects combined with the renal safety profile demonstrate that XGEVA is an important new alternative to the current standard of care for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma.\"\nThe median time to first on-study skeletal-related event was 22.8 months for XGEVA and 24 months for zoledronic acid. Approximately 60 percent of all first skeletal-related events occurred within the first three months, and 81 percent occurred within the first six months. Overall survival, a secondary endpoint of the study, was similar between the XGEVA and zoledronic acid arms, with a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95 percent CI: 0.70-1.16). Progression-free survival, an exploratory endpoint not powered for statistical significance, was 46.1 months (95 percent CI: 34.3 months-not estimable [NE], n=219) for XGEVA and 35.4 months (95 percent CI: 30.2 months-NE, n=260) for zoledronic acid on top of standard of care anti-myeloma therapy.\nThe safety profile was consistent with known adverse events of both XGEVA and zoledronic acid. There were fewer renal treatment-emergent adverse events in the XGEVA arm compared to the zoledronic acid arm (10 percent versus 17 percent, respectively). Hypocalcaemia events were higher in the XGEVA arm compared to the zoledronic acid arm (17 percent versus 12 percent, respectively). Osteonecrosis of the jaw was observed in 4 percent of the XGEVA-treated patients versus 3 percent of the zoledronic acid-treated patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (greater than 25 percent) were diarrhea and nausea.\nXGEVA is the first fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes RANK ligand (RANKL) – a protein essential for the formation, function and survival of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone – thereby inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. XGEVA is not cleared by the kidneys. On Jan. 5, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for XGEVA to expand the currently approved indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma. The approval was based on data from the '482 study. Additional regulatory applications for XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma are underway and have been submitted to health authorities worldwide.\nAbout '482 Study (NCT01345019)\nThe '482 study was an international, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of XGEVA compared with zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal-related events in adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and bone disease. In the study, a total of 1,718 patients (859 on each arm) were randomized to receive either subcutaneous XGEVA 120 mg and intravenous placebo every four weeks, or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg (adjusted for renal function at baseline) and subcutaneous placebo every four weeks, plus investigators' choice first-line antimyeloma therapy. Skeletal surveys using conventional radiography were obtained every 12 to 24 weeks per protocol. The primary endpoint of the study was non-inferiority of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid with respect to time to first on-study skeletal-related event (pathologic fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression). Secondary endpoints included superiority of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid with respect to time to first on-study skeletal-related event and first-and-subsequent on-study skeletal-related event and evaluation of overall survival. Progression-free survival was a prespecified, exploratory endpoint and was not powered for statistical significance. The safety and tolerability of XGEVA were also compared with zoledronic acid. An open-label extension of the study is ongoing.\nAbout Multiple Myeloma and Bone Complications\nMultiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer, and it develops in plasma cells located in the bone marrow microenvironment. 1,2 It is typically characterized by osteolytic bone lesions as well as renal failure, which are both part of diagnosis (CRAB criteria). 3,4 Each year an estimated 114,000 new cases of multiple myeloma are diagnosed worldwide, resulting in more than 80,000 deaths per year. 1\nMore than 90 percent of patients develop osteolytic lesions during the course of the disease. 3 Preventing bone complications is a critical aspect of caring for patients with multiple myeloma, because these events can result in significant morbidity. 5 Current treatment options for fractures and other bone complications are limited to bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, which are cleared through the kidneys. 6 Approximately 60 percent of all multiple myeloma patients have or will develop renal impairment over the course of the disease. 7\nAbout XGEVA ® (denosumab)\nXGEVA targets the RANKL pathway to prevent the formation, function and survival of osteoclasts, which break down bone. XGEVA is indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. XGEVA is also indicated for treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. Additionally, XGEVA is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy.\nU.S. Important Safety Information\nHypocalcemia\nPre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with XGEVA ® . XGEVA ® can cause severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported. Monitor calcium levels, especially in the first weeks of initiating therapy, and administer calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D as necessary. Monitor levels more frequently when XGEVA ® is administered with other drugs that can also lower calcium levels. Advise patients to contact a healthcare professional for symptoms of hypocalcemia.\nAn increased risk of hypocalcemia has been observed in clinical trials of patients with increasing renal dysfunction, most commonly with severe dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute and/or on dialysis), and with inadequate/no calcium supplementation. Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake.\nHypersensitivity\nXGEVA ® is contraindicated in patients with known clinically significant hypersensitivity to XGEVA ® , including anaphylaxis that has been reported with use of XGEVA ® . Reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, upper airway edema, lip swelling, rash, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue XGEVA ® therapy permanently.\nDrug Products with Same Active Ingredient\nPatients receiving XGEVA ® should not take Prolia ® (denosumab).\nOsteonecrosis of the Jaw\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving XGEVA ®, manifesting as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration, or gingival erosion. Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be manifestations of ONJ. In clinical trials in patients with osseous metastasis, the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure.\nPatients with a history of tooth extraction, poor oral hygiene, or use of a dental appliance are at a greater risk to develop ONJ. Other risk factors for the development of ONJ include immunosuppressive therapy, treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, diabetes, and gingival infections.\nPerform an oral examination and appropriate preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of XGEVA ® and periodically during XGEVA ® therapy. Advise patients regarding oral hygiene practices. Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with XGEVA ® . Consider temporarily interrupting XGEVA ® therapy if an invasive dental procedure must be performed.\nPatients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on XGEVA ® should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition.\nAtypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture\nAtypical femoral fracture has been reported with XGEVA ® . These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.\nAtypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture. During XGEVA ® treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of XGEVA ® therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.\nHypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Growing Skeletons\nClinically significant hypercalcemia has been reported in XGEVA ® treated patients with growing skeletons, weeks to months following treatment discontinuation. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and treat appropriately.\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity\nXGEVA ® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on findings in animals, XGEVA ® is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects.\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5 months after the last dose of XGEVA ® . Apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus if XGEVA ® is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while patients are exposed to XGEVA ® .\nAdverse Reactions\nThe most common adverse reactions in patients receiving XGEVA ® with bone metastasis from solid tumors were fatigue/asthenia, hypophosphatemia, and nausea. The most common serious adverse reaction was dyspnea. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation were osteonecrosis and hypocalcemia.\nFor multiple myeloma patients receiving XGEVA ® , the most common adverse reactions were diarrhea, nausea, anemia, back pain, thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, hypocalcemia, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, and headache. The most common serious adverse reaction was pneumonia. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of XGEVA ® was osteonecrosis of the jaw.\nThe most common adverse reactions in patients receiving XGEVA ® for giant cell tumor of bone were arthralgia, headache, nausea, back pain, fatigue, and pain in extremity. The most common serious adverse reactions were osteonecrosis of the jaw and osteomyelitis. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of XGEVA ® were osteonecrosis of the jaw and tooth abscess or tooth infection.\nThe most common adverse reactions in patients receiving XGEVA ® for hypercalcemia of malignancy were nausea, dyspnea, decreased appetite, headache, peripheral edema, vomiting, anemia, constipation, and diarrhea.\nDenosumab is also marketed as Prolia ® in other indications.\nPlease visit www.amgen.com or www.xgeva.com for Full U.S. Prescribing Information.\nAbout Amgen's Commitment to Oncology\nAmgen Oncology is committed to helping patients take on some of the toughest cancers, such as those that have been resistant to drugs, those that progress rapidly through the body and those where limited treatment options exist.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems, including our devices, with our products after they are on the market.\nOur results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.\nThe scientific information discussed in this news release related to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these products.
