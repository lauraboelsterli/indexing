There were 254 selling days for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. 2 Non-GAAP measures used in this release that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America are each defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the attached schedules.\nLINCOLNSHIRE, Ill., CDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW), a leading multi-brand technology solutions provider to business, government, education and healthcare in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, today announced fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results. The company also announced the approval by its Board of Directors of a quarterly cash dividend to be paid in March 2018.\n\"As we have throughout the year, we delivered strong topline growth with solid profitability in the fourth quarter, once again highlighting the combined power of our nimble business model, broad product portfolio and balanced customer end-markets,\" said Thomas E. Richards, chairman and chief executive officer of CDW. \"Our 2017 results continue to prove out the success of investments we’ve made in our three-part strategy.\"\n\"Strong operating results throughout the year drove excellent cash flows and enabled us to return nearly $650 million to our shareholders in 2017 through share repurchases and dividends,\" said Collin B. Kebo, CDW's chief financial officer. \"With our free cash flow bolstered by the reduction in our effective tax rate, we have increased our 'rule of thumb' for free cash flow as a percentage of sales by 75 basis points.\"\n“For 2018, we expect to continue to outpace US IT market growth by 200 to 300 basis points on a constant currency basis. Operating results will be amplified by the reduction in our corporate tax rate from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we expect to deliver non-GAAP net income per share growth in the low to mid-20% range. We intend to re-invest a portion of the incremental cash flow into our coworkers and our strategic initiatives, as well as continue to execute against our capital allocation priorities,\" concluded Richards.\nA quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share, which is 31 percent higher than the prior year period, will be paid on March 12, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 26, 2018.\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Highlights:\nTotal net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $3,839 million, compared to $3,492 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 9.9 percent. There were 63 and 62 selling days for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On an average daily sales basis, net sales growth versus the fourth quarter of 2016 was 8.2 percent and on a constant currency basis was 7.5 percent. Currency impact to net sales growth was driven by favorable translation of the Canadian to US dollar and favorable translation of the British pound to US dollar. Effective January 1, 2017, the CDW Small Business channel is reported separately as an operating segment, and prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. Fourth quarter reported net sales and average daily sales growth included:\nTotal Corporate segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1,641 million, 6.4 percent higher on an average daily sales basis than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal Small Business segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $315 million, 6.1 percent higher on an average daily sales basis than the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal Public segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1,454 million, 7.4 percent higher on an average daily sales basis than the fourth quarter of 2016. Public results were led by sales to both Government and Education customers, which increased 17.1 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. Sales to Healthcare customers decreased 4.6 percent.\nNet sales for CDW's Canadian and UK operations, combined as “Other” for financial reporting purposes, were $428 million, 20.3 percent higher on an average daily sales basis than the fourth quarter of 2016. Both Canada and UK results were also up double digits in local currency.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $614 million, compared to $578 million for the same period in 2016, representing an increase of 6.3 percent. Gross profit margin was 16.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus 16.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin decline was primarily driven by increased hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace.\nTotal selling and administrative expenses and advertising expense were $393 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $381 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 3.2 percent. This increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, partially offset by lower senior management incentive compensation.\nInterest expense was $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $34 million in the comparable period in 2016 driven by mark-to-market gains recognized in 2016 on interest rate caps with no comparable activity in 2017 due to the election of hedge accounting.\nThe effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was (5.7) percent, which resulted in a tax benefit of $11 million, compared to a 36.6 percent tax rate and tax expense of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The reduction in effective tax rate primarily reflected items relating to tax reform including the one-time benefit of reducing the net deferred tax balance to reflect a new lower tax rate, partially offset by a one-time expense related to the foreign income transition tax.\nNet income was $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 89.1 percent. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes, among other things, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, integration expenses, equity-based compensation and the associated tax benefits, and certain non-recurring items such as the fourth quarter's one-time changes related to the tax rate, was $153 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 9.0 percent.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes expenses related to equity-based compensation, income from equity investments, integration expenses, and certain other items, was $297 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $274 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 8.7 percent. For the fourth quarter of 2017 the Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.7 percent compared to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding were 155 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 163 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.26, compared to $0.63 for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 99.0 percent. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.99, compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of 2016 representing an increase of 14.7 percent.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nTotal net sales in 2017 were $15,192 million, compared to $13,982 million in 2016, an increase of 8.7 percent. There were 254 selling days in both 2017 and 2016. On an average daily sales basis, net sales growth versus 2016 was 8.7 percent and on a constant currency basis was 8.9 percent. Currency impact to net sales was driven by unfavorable translation of the British Pound to US Dollar, partially offset by favorable translation of the Canadian to US Dollar. Effective January 1, 2017, the CDW Small Business channel is reported separately as an operating segment, and prior periods have been recast to reflect this change. The full year's net sales performance included:\nTotal Corporate segment net sales in 2017 were $6,347 million, or 7.8 percent higher than 2016.\nTotal Small Business segment net sales in 2017 were $1,246 million. This reflects a 9.3 percent increase over 2016.\nTotal Public segment net sales in 2017 were $6,038 million, 8.0 percent higher than 2016. Public results were led by sales to both Government and Education customers which increased 16.3 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively. Sales to Healthcare customers decreased 2.9 percent.\nNet sales for CDW's Canadian and UK operations, combined as “Other” for financial reporting purposes, were $1,560 million, 14.5 percent higher than 2016. Both Canada and UK results were also up double digits in local currency.\nGross profit for 2017 was $2,450 million, compared to $2,327 million in 2016, representing an increase of 5.3 percent. Gross profit margin was 16.1 percent in 2017 versus 16.6 percent in 2016. Gross margin decline was driven by increased hardware sales and an ongoing competitive marketplace.\nTotal selling and administrative expenses and advertising expense were $1,584 million in 2017, compared to $1,508 million in 2016, representing an increase of 5.0 percent. This increase was primarily driven by sales compensation, partially offset by lower senior management incentive compensation. Coworker count was 8,726 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 8,516 as of December 31, 2016.\nTotal debt of $3.2 billion, net of cash of $144 million, resulted in net debt of $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, which was $120 million higher compared to December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, the company amended its prior senior secured term loan with a repricing agreement, completed the issuance of $600 million 5.0% Senior Notes due 2025 and redeemed the remaining amount of the $600 million 6.0% Senior Notes due 2022, and amended, extended and increased the size of its senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility from $1,250 million to $1,450 million. As a result of these transactions, 2017 net income included total debt extinguishment charges of $57 million.\nInterest expense was $151 million in 2017, compared to $147 million in 2016. The effective tax rate in 2017 was 20.8 percent, which resulted in a tax expense of $137 million, compared to a 36.9 percent tax rate and tax expense of $248 million in 2016. The reduction in effective tax rate primarily reflected items relating to tax reform including the one-time benefit of reducing the net deferred tax balance to reflect a new lower tax rate, as well as tax benefits from equity-based compensation.\nNet income was $523 million in 2017, compared to $424 million in 2016, representing an increase of 23.2 percent. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes, among other things, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, integration expenses, equity-based compensation and the associated tax benefits, debt refinancing costs, and certain non-recurring items such as the fourth quarter's one-time changes related to the tax rate, was $606 million in 2017, compared to $569 million in 2016, representing an increase of 6.5 percent.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes expenses related to equity-based compensation, income from equity investments, integration expenses, and certain other items including debt refinancing costs, was $1,186 million in 2017, compared to $1,117 million in 2016, representing an increase of 6.1 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2017 and 2016 was 7.8 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding were 158 million in 2017, compared to 166 million in 2016. Net income per diluted share in 2017 was $3.31, compared to $2.56 in 2016, representing an increase of 29.3 percent. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share in 2017 was $3.83, compared to $3.43 in 2016, representing an increase of 11.7 percent.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this release that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation statements regarding the future financial performance of CDW. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, global and regional economic conditions; decreases in spending on technology products; CDW's relationships with vendor partners and availability of their products; continued innovations in hardware, software and services offerings by CDW's vendor partners; substantial competition that could reduce CDW's market share; CDW's substantial indebtedness and ability to generate sufficient cash to service such indebtedness; restrictions imposed by agreements relating to CDW's indebtedness on its operations and liquidity; changes in, or the discontinuation of, CDW's share repurchase program or dividend payments; the continuing development, maintenance and operation of CDW's information technology systems; potential breaches of data security; potential failures to comply with Public segment contracts or applicable laws and regulations; potential failures to provide high-quality services to CDW's customers; potential losses of any key personnel; potential interruptions of the flow of products from suppliers; potential adverse occurrences at one of CDW's primary facilities or customer data centers; CDW's dependence on commercial delivery services; CDW's exposure to accounts receivable and inventory risks; fluctuations in foreign currency; future acquisitions or alliances; fluctuations in CDW's operating results; current and future legal proceedings and audits; changes in laws, including the recent U.S. tax legislation, regulations or interpretations thereof; and other risk factors or uncertainties identified from time to time in CDW's filings with the SEC. Although CDW believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Reference is made to a more complete discussion of forward-looking statements and applicable risks contained under the captions \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" in CDW's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent filings with the SEC. CDW undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nEBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in the Company’s credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items which are described in the financial statement tables that accompany this press release. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales. Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated tax benefits, integration expenses, and gains and losses from the extinguishment of long-term debt. Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company believes these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of the Company’s business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. The Company uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure in the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (“Term Loan”) used to evaluate the Company’s ability to make certain investments, incur additional debt and make restricted payments, such as dividends and share repurchases, as well as whether the Company is required to make additional principal prepayments on the Term Loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments.\nOur annual targets are provided on a non-GAAP basis because certain reconciling items are dependent on future events that either cannot be controlled, such as currency impacts or interest rates, or reliably predicted because they are not part of the Company's routine activities, such as refinancing activities or acquisition and integration expenses.\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable most comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nAbout CDW\nCDW is a leading multi-brand technology solutions provider to business, government, education and healthcare organizations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
