    "text": "BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) (the “Partnership” or “we”) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nHighlights:\nGenerated net income of $7.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $31.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 Generated net revenue of $543.2 million and net income of $14.4 million for the full year of 2017, after giving effect to the recast for the Wilmington Drop-Down Generated net income of $20.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $105.4 million for the full year of 2017, excluding the impact of the recast for the Wilmington Drop-Down Provided full-year 2018 guidance for net income in a range of $28.5 million to $32.5 million and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $118.0 million to $122.0 million, excluding the impact of any drop-downs or third-party acquisitions, and expect to distribute at least $2.53 per common and subordinated unit for full-year 2018\n“Consistent with our previously provided guidance, the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was the strongest in our history,” said John Keppler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enviva. “In addition to this solid financial performance, we continued to diversify our customer base significantly, and now are contracted to more than a dozen major utilities and trading houses in our rapidly growing core markets of Europe and Asia.”\nPresentation of Recast Financial Results\nOn October 2, 2017 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Partnership completed the acquisition of Enviva Port of Wilmington, LLC (“Wilmington”) from its sponsor’s joint venture (the “First Hancock JV”) with affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) (“John Hancock”). This transaction, which we refer to as the Wilmington Drop-Down, included a deep-water marine terminal in Wilmington, North Carolina (the “Wilmington terminal”).\nBecause the Wilmington Drop-Down was a transfer between entities under common control, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) require that we recast our financial results to include the results of the Wilmington Drop-Down since the date Wilmington was originally organized. In addition, certain intercompany transactions between us and Wilmington during such periods have been eliminated and Wilmington’s results are presented as if the assets included in the Wilmington Drop-Down had been the Partnership’s assets since Wilmington was initially organized. As a result, Wilmington’s results are now included in our results presented in accordance with GAAP. The effect of this recast is to present our financial statements as if the Partnership had developed Wilmington when in fact it is our sponsor’s strategy to develop new projects outside of the Partnership. Unless otherwise indicated, the financial results presented in this release are recast on this basis.\nAnnual Financial Results\nFor full-year 2017, we generated net revenue of $543.2 million, an increase of 17.0 percent, or $78.9 million, from 2016. Included in net revenue were product sales of $522.3 million on a volume of 2.72 million metric tons of wood pellets during 2017, as compared to $444.5 million on a volume of 2.35 million metric tons in 2016. The increase was attributable to greater sales volumes, primarily relating to tons sold under the off-take contract acquired as part of our acquisition (the “Sampson Drop-Down”) of Enviva Pellets Sampson, LLC (“Sampson”).\nGross margin was $78.8 million for full-year 2017, as compared to $76.8 million for the corresponding period in 2016, an increase of $2.0 million. Gross margin increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and lower production costs, partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to the Sampson plant and Wilmington terminal and higher disposal costs. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton was $45.38 for full-year 2017, as compared to $45.55 for full-year 2016. We generated net income of $14.4 million in 2017 compared to $13.5 million last year.\nExcluding the impact of the recast of the Wilmington Drop-Down for the period prior to the Acquisition Date, net income for full-year 2017 would have been $20.6 million and adjusted EBITDA would have been $105.4 million, an increase of 26.2 percent, or $21.9 million, from 2016. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by increased product sales and lower production costs as mentioned above. Distributable cash flow, prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to our general partner, would have been $70.8 million.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated net revenue of $161.0 million, an increase of 27.3 percent, or $34.5 million, from the corresponding quarter of 2016. Included in net revenue were product sales of $156.1 million on a volume of 805,000 metric tons of wood pellets during the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $121.2 million on a volume of 632,000 metric tons of wood pellets during the corresponding quarter of 2016. The increase was attributable to increased sales under our off-take contracts.\nGross margin was $25.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $19.2 million for the corresponding period in 2016, an increase of $6.6 million. Gross margin increased primarily due to higher sales volumes and lower production and raw material costs, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton was $47.43 for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $42.95 for the corresponding quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.9 million compared to net loss of $9.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $17.5 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.9 million. Distributable cash flow, prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to our general partner, was $22.1 million for the quarter.\nDue to the fact that the Partnership owned Wilmington in the fourth quarter of 2017, the financial results, excluding the impact of the recast for the Wilmington Drop-Down, are the same as the recast results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nDistribution\nAs announced January 31, 2018, the board of directors of our general partner declared a distribution of $0.62 per common and subordinated unit for the fourth quarter of 2017. This distribution is 15.9 percent higher than the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Partnership’s distributable cash flow of $20.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, net of amounts attributable to incentive distribution rights, covers the distribution for the fourth quarter of 2017 at 1.28 times. The quarterly distribution will be paid on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, to unitholders of record as of the close of business on Thursday, February 15, 2018.\nOutlook and Guidance\nThe Partnership expects full-year 2018 net income to be in the range of $28.5 million to $32.5 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $118.0 million to $122.0 million. The Partnership expects to incur maintenance capital expenditures of $5.0 million and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $33.5 million in 2018. As a result, the Partnership expects full-year distributable cash flow to be in the range of $79.5 million to $83.5 million, prior to any distributions attributable to incentive distribution rights paid to our general partner. For full-year 2018, we expect to distribute at least $2.53 per common and subordinated unit. The guidance amounts provided above do not include the impact of any additional acquisitions by the Partnership from the sponsor’s joint ventures or third parties. Although deliveries to our customers are generally ratable over the year, the Partnership’s quarterly income and cash flow are subject to seasonality and the mix of customer shipments made, which vary from period to period. As such, the board of directors of the Partnership’s general partner evaluates the Partnership’s distribution coverage ratio on an annual basis when determining the distribution for a quarter.\nMarket and Contracting Update\nOur sales strategy is to fully contract the production capacity of the Partnership. Our current capacity is matched with a portfolio of off-take contracts that has a weighted-average remaining term of 9.5 years from February 15, 2018.\nThe Partnership and Enviva JV Development Company, LLC, our sponsor’s new joint venture with affiliates of John Hancock (the “Second Hancock JV”), have successfully converted the previously announced memorandum of understanding into long-term take-or-pay off-take contracts for the supply of 630,000 metric tons per year (“MTPY”) of wood pellets. The Partnership and the Second Hancock JV entered into contracts to supply 180,000 MTPY of wood pellets and 450,000 MTPY of wood pellets, respectively. Both contracts are U.S. Dollar denominated and are expected to commence in 2022 and continue for at least fifteen years, subject to certain conditions precedent.\nThe Partnership also entered into a firm long-term take-or-pay off-take contract with Marubeni Corporation to supply 100,000 MTPY of wood pellets for ten years commencing in 2022 to a new power plant in Japan.\nThe Partnership recently entered into two additional agreements with ENGIE to sell 90,000 metric tons (“MT”) in 2018 and 585,000 MT in the aggregate from 2019 to 2023. In addition, the Partnership previously announced it has entered into an agreement with Ørsted (formerly Dong Energy Thermal Power A/S) for the supply of an additional 200,000 MT in the aggregate from late 2018 through mid-2021, incremental to the volumes under the existing off-take contract.\nSeveral recent developments in Europe and Asia continue to demonstrate the significant long-term demand growth expected for wood pellets:\nAs the European Union’s proposed policy framework for further emissions reductions and increased renewable energy generation progresses, the European Parliament recently voted to increase the share of renewable energy generation to 35% by 2030, which is substantially higher than the 20% mandate for 2020 and includes a significant role for sustainably sourced biomass heat and power projects. The European Union is expected to finalize this framework over the course of the next year. In Japan, long-term demand for imported wood pellets continues to grow as the government targets 6.0 to 7.5 gigawatts (“GWs”) of biomass-fired capacity, which represents demand for 15 to 20 million MTPY of biomass, as part of its expected power source mix for 2030. Demand for the 2017 feed-in tariff (FiT) program for projects fueled by imported biomass significantly exceeded expectations, and the Japanese government has approved 13 GWs of biomass-fired capacity. In Germany, the coalition government has announced it will pursue a policy to reduce coal-fired generation in order to reach the country’s now legally binding 2030 carbon emissions target. An action plan is expected to be released by the end of this year. Certain current coal-fired combined heat and power facilities are electrical transmission system-relevant assets and important sources of thermal energy for German industrial activity. The conversion of coal-fired power plants to biomass-fired generation has proven to be an effective complement to intermittent sources of renewable power. In the Netherlands, the government has allocated 6.0 billion euros in available funding for the spring 2018 round of the renewable incentive program, with applications due in March. This round offers further potential allocation of funding to industrial steam projects fired with wood pellets which is anticipated to drive further market growth.\nSponsor Activity\nOur sponsor announced in December 2017 that its development subsidiary entered into the Second Hancock JV to acquire, develop and construct wood pellet production plants and deep-water marine terminals in the Southeastern United States. The new joint venture will be managed by the sponsor. As previously announced, the Second Hancock JV completed the acquisition of a wood pellet production plant in Greenwood, South Carolina (the “Greenwood plant”), and is expected to invest incremental capital to improve the operational efficiency and increase the production of the facility. The production of the Greenwood plant initially will be sold to the Partnership under a take-or-pay off-take contract and will continue to be exported from the Wilmington terminal. In addition, our sponsor and John Hancock is expected to provide the Second Hancock JV with the capital needed to fund the planned development of a deep-water marine terminal at the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi and at least two additional wood pellet production facilities, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nThe First Hancock JV, the existing joint venture between affiliates of our sponsor and John Hancock, will retain ownership of Enviva Pellets Hamlet, LLC, the entity constructing a 600,000 MTPY production plant in Hamlet, North Carolina (the “Hamlet plant”). Our sponsor expects the Hamlet plant will be operational in the first quarter of 2019. Production from the Hamlet plant is contracted to supply MGT Teesside Ltd.’s Tees Renewable Energy Plant, which currently is under construction in the United Kingdom.\n“Hamlet and Greenwood represent just the most recent plants in a series of investments we and our sponsor, through the Hancock JVs, are making to meet the long-term demand of our customers in Europe and Asia,” said Keppler. “With demand continuing to outstrip available supply, we expect to add significant drop-down inventory for the Partnership in addition to the two plants and port already under operation and construction.”\nConference Call\nWe will host a conference call with executive management related to our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results, our outlook and guidance, and a more detailed market update at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Thursday, February 22, 2018. Information on how interested parties may listen to the conference call is available on the Investor Relations page of our website ( www.envivabiomass.com ). A replay of the conference call will be available on our website after the live call concludes.\nRequests for Audited Financial Statements\nThe Partnership filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 22, 2018. The Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K is available through its website at http://ir.envivapartners.com/sec-filings as well as on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . The Partnership’s security holders are entitled to receive, free of charge, copies of its complete audited financial statements by sending a request to Investor Relations, Enviva Partners, LP, 7200 Wisconsin Ave., Suite 1000, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, or by telephone at (240) 482-3856.\nAbout Enviva Partners, LP\nEnviva Partners, LP (NYSE: EVA) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that aggregates a natural resource, wood fiber, and processes it into a transportable form, wood pellets. The Partnership sells a significant majority of its wood pellets through long-term, take-or-pay agreements with creditworthy customers in the United Kingdom and Europe. The Partnership owns and operates six plants with a combined production capacity of nearly three million metric tons of wood pellets per year in Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida. In addition, the Partnership exports wood pellets through its owned marine terminal assets at the Port of Chesapeake, Virginia, and the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina and from third-party marine terminals in Mobile, Alabama and Panama City, Florida.\nTo learn more about Enviva Partners, LP, please visit our website at www.envivabiomass.com .\nNotice\nThis press release is intended to be a qualified notice under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Brokers and nominees should treat 100 percent of the Partnership’s distributions to non-U.S. investors as being attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, the Partnership’s distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow to measure our financial performance.\nAdjusted Gross Margin per Metric Ton\nWe define adjusted gross margin as gross margin excluding asset disposals and depreciation and amortization included in cost of goods sold. We believe adjusted gross margin per metric ton is a meaningful measure because it compares our revenue-generating activities to our operating costs for a view of profitability and performance on a per metric ton basis. Adjusted gross margin per metric ton will primarily be affected by our ability to meet targeted production volumes and to control direct and indirect costs associated with procurement and delivery of wood fiber to our production plants and the production and distribution of wood pellets.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, early retirement of debt obligations, non-cash unit compensation expense, asset impairments and disposals, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, and certain items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by our management and other users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods or capital structure.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nWe define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense net of amortization of debt issuance costs, debt premium and original issue discounts. We use distributable cash flow as a performance metric to compare the cash-generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash-generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to our unitholders. We do not rely on distributable cash flow as a liquidity measure.\nAdjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, or distributable cash flow in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin per metric ton, adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as applicable, for each of the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 (Recast) 2017 2016 (Recast) (in thousands, except per metric ton) Reconciliation of gross margin to adjusted gross\nmargin per metric ton:\nMetric tons sold 805 632 2,724 2,346 Gross margin $ 25,721 $ 19,169 $ 78,802 $ 76,772 Loss on disposal of assets 1,657 707 4,899 2,386 Depreciation and amortization 10,800 7,271 39,904 27,700 Adjusted gross margin $ 38,178 $ 27,147 $ 123,605 $ 106,858 Adjusted gross margin per metric ton $ 47.43 $ 42.95 $ 45.38 $ 45.55 Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 (Recast) 2017 2016 (Recast) (in thousands) Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and\ndistributable cash flow to net income (loss):\nNet income (loss) $ 7,898 $ (9,642 ) $ 14,373 $ 13,463 Add: Depreciation and amortization 11,246 7,279 40,361 27,735 Interest expense 8,674 6,123 31,744 16,221 Early retirement of debt obligation — 4,438 — 4,438 Non-cash unit compensation expense (99 ) 1,568 5,014 4,230 Asset impairments and disposals 2,484 10,698 5,726 12,377 Change in the fair value of derivative instruments 1,565 — 1,565 — Transaction expenses 171 720 3,598 827 Adjusted EBITDA 31,939 21,184 102,381 79,291 Less: Interest expense net of amortization of debt\nissuance costs, debt premium and original\nissue discount\n8,388 5,570 30,297 14,329 Maintenance capital expenditures 1,483 2,429 4,353 5,187 Distributable cash flow attributable to Enviva\nPartners, LP\n22,068 13,185 67,731 59,775 Less: Distributable cash flow attributable to\nincentive distribution rights\n1,129 361 3,398 1,077 Distributable cash flow attributable to Enviva\nPartners, LP limited partners\n$ 20,939 $ 12,824 $ 64,333 $ 58,698 Cash distributions declared attributable to Enviva\nPartners, LP limited partners\n$\n16,337\n$\n62,129\nDistribution coverage ratio\n1.28\n1.04\nThe following tables present, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nour recast results prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Wilmington’s results for periods we did not own Wilmington and elimination of certain intercompany transactions;

These forward-looking statements are based on the Partnership’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on the Partnership. Although management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Partnership will be those that it anticipates. The forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control) and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Partnership’s historical experience and its present expectations or projections. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) the volume and quality of products that we are able to produce or source and sell; which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or technical difficulties at our plants or deep-water marine terminals; (ii) the prices at which we are able to sell our products; (iii) failure of the Partnership’s customers, vendors, and shipping partners to pay or perform their contractual obligations to the Partnership; (iv) the creditworthiness of our contract counterparties; (v) the amount of low-cost wood fiber that we are able to procure and process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or financial difficulties suffered by our suppliers; (vi) changes in the price and availability of natural gas, coal, or other sources of energy; (vii) changes in prevailing economic conditions; (viii) our inability to complete acquisitions, including acquisitions from our sponsor, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions; (ix) inclement or hazardous environmental hazards, including extreme precipitation and flooding; (x) fires, explosions, or other accidents; (xi) changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) related to renewable or low-carbon energy, the forestry products industry, the international shipping industry or power generators; (xii) changes in the regulatory treatment of biomass in core and emerging markets; (xiii) our inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or rights for our production, transportation or terminaling operations; (xiv) changes in price and availability of transportation; (xv) changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates, and the failure of our hedging arrangements to effectively reduce our exposure to the risks related thereto; (xvi) risks related to our indebtedness; (xvii) our failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production plants and deep-water marine terminals, which could lead to the rejection of our products by our customers; (xviii) changes in the quality specifications for our products that are required by our customers; (xix) labor disputes; (xx) the effects of the anticipated exit of the United Kingdom (“Brexit”) from the European Union on our and our customers’ businesses; and (xxi) our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets.\nFor additional information regarding known material factors that could cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ from projected results, please read its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q most recently filed with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The Partnership undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nFinancial Statements\nENVIVA PARTNERS, LP AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016\n(In thousands, except number of units)\n2017 2016\n(Recast)\nAssets
