    "text": "17 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Top House Republicans have embraced far-reaching legislation aimed at making it easier for underage victims or prosecutors to hold websites and online services accountable for sex trafficking.\nThe House on Tuesday is set to take up the proposed changes, which would give victims a stronger chance of winning civil lawsuits against websites by limiting the broad federal immunity online businesses now enjoy under a 1990s law. Trafficking suits against these businesses have usually been tossed out of court because of that immunity. \nMajor internet companies including Facebook Inc. have publicly supported the bill. But many in the industry have also been concerned about the potential for big liability judgments, particularly for cases brought by underage victims of online sex trafficking. Startups would suffer particular harm, they say. \nSome tech-industry advocates also have worried the bill would further erode the 1990s immunity law that shields them from lawsuits over their users’ actions and that many view as one of the legal pillars of the internet protecting and encouraging free speech. Many industry advocates have called for a delay in Tuesday’s vote. \nThe legislation is set to be considered as an amendment to a narrower bill that was approved in the House Judiciary Committee. That bill largely focused on giving prosecutors more power to go after websites that facilitate sex trafficking, although it also aided victims in some ways. House leaders have scheduled votes for Tuesday on both that bill and on the amendment incorporating the more far-reaching provisions. \nHouse adoption of the broader language would represent a victory for Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), who along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn..), has pushed the more-ambitious approach for much of the past year. Sponsors are hoping for Senate consideration of the measure sometime in the coming weeks, though the legislation faces potential obstacles there. Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said he was “deeply troubled” by the bill’s approach when he announced late last year he would seek to block it.\nTech companies and their allies also appeared to be caught off guard by the House’s move—an approach that is both broader and more accelerated than they had expected. \nThe Consumer Technology Association, a major tech trade group, criticized the House effort on Friday, saying in a statement that moving forward with the planned vote would be “ill-advised.” It added that “CTA is concerned that this needlessly rushed and unorthodox process will result in unintended language gravely harming legitimate businesses and the internet economy.”\nActivists cheered the planned vote. Linda Smith, a former member of Congress from Washington state who is now president of Shared Hope International, a victim advocacy group, said she was told a couple of years ago that the group’s legislative goal of expanding online services’ legal liability “was not likely to succeed in the face of opposition from the tech industry lobby.” \nBut now, she said, the “unified voices of survivors and advocates have been heard.”\nThe bill seeks to address an issue that has become increasingly troublesome—the explosion of online prostitution on sites such as Backpage.com that have allowed their users to advertise adult services. Law-enforcement officials say these advertisements are often thinly disguised solicitations for prostitution. Minor victims also are often trafficked on the sites, according to victim advocates. Backpage has said that it goes to great lengths to try to keep minors off its site and that it works closely with police in criminal investigations.\nNewsletter Sign-up Many big online companies such as Alphabet Inc. unit Google long resisted changes to the 1990s immunity law, fearing they could open the door to costly lawsuits as well as further erode their immunity. The broader bill would only apply to the facilitation of sex trafficking.\nMany of the companies ramped up their efforts to battle trafficking in recent years, while also supporting nonprofits. But political pressure over online trafficking has continued to grow, particularly given the rise of Backpage and its frequent legal clashes with authorities.\n“Online trafficking is flourishing because there are no serious legal consequences for the websites that profit,” said Rep. Ann Wagner (R., Mo.), a sponsor of the House measure. “This…package will finally give prosecutors the tools they need” to protect communities and help victims obtain justice, she said. \nSome big firms including Facebook say they support the recent legislative efforts to help empower victims.\n“We applaud the House’s efforts to reach consensus on this important legislation,” said Erin Egan, Facebook vice president of U.S. public policy. She added that the company “will continue working with committed legislators” as the process moves forward.\nWrite to John D. McKinnon at john.mckinnon@wsj.com",
