    "text": " American Tommy Biesemeyer has been ruled out of the Olympic downhill after suffering an ankle injury during training, the U.S Ski and Snowboard Federation said in a statement on Wednesday.\nBiesemeyer, ranked 40th in the world, was taken by team medical staff to a local clinic where he was treated and released but he will not be able to ski in Thursday’s rescheduled downhill.\nFeb 5, 2018; PyeongChang, KOR; Teammates Bryce Bennett, left, and Tommy Biesemeyer, of the USA men's alpine speed team, laugh during a press conference in the Gangwon Room of the Main Press Center in PyeongChang, South Korea. Mandatory Credit: Eric Seals-USA TODAY Sports The 29-year-old, at his first Olympics, said it was hard to keep a positive outlook.\n“I wonder why this happens. It is hard to not think if there is a deeper meaning to it all. You are supposed to be optimistic in times like these and say something like, ‘I will come back stronger than ever’. But I just can’t bring myself to do it,” he said.\n“I am honored to have been named to Team USA and walking in the Opening Ceremony is a moment I’ll never forget,” he added.\nBiesemeyer’s place in the American downhill team will be taken by Ryan Cochran-Siegle.\nReporting by Simon Evans, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
