    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cars.com Inc. (NYSE: CARS) (\"Cars.com\" or the \"Company\"), a leading online automotive marketplace, today confirmed that Starboard Value LP (\"Starboard\") submitted to the Company a notice of nomination of four director candidates to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors (\"the Board\") at the Cars.com 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was previously publicly announced for May 18, 2018.\nOn behalf of the Cars.com Board of Directors, Scott Forbes, Chairman, said:\nSince becoming an independent publicly traded company in June 2017, we have kept an active and open dialogue with our shareholders, and consider their ideas in an open-minded and collaborative manner with the best interest of all Cars.com shareholders as a priority. Members of the Cars.com Board of Directors and management team have recently held discussions with representatives of Starboard, and those discussions remain ongoing. Cars.com's Board will carefully review and consider Starboard's candidates as it would any other potential directors to assess their ability to add value to the Board and Company for the benefit of all shareholders.\nCars.com has developed and pursued a strategic plan intended to position itself as the leading online automotive marketplace for buyers and sellers and an enabler of car dealers with innovative digital solutions. We have invested in opportunities to convert affiliate territories representing nearly 60% of the total affiliate (wholesale) revenue to markets serviced directly by Cars.com, as well as to accelerate the Company's progress as a digital solutions provider to its automobile dealer customers through the acquisitions of Dealer Inspire and Launch Digital Marketing, among other initiatives. The Company has made rapid progress against significant strategic priorities. While the Cars.com Board recognizes there is more to achieve, we are confident that these actions have positioned the Company to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value.\nCars.com shareholders are not required to take any action at this time. The Cars.com Board will carefully review and consider Starboard's director candidates and make a formal recommendation regarding director nominations.\nAbout Cars.com\nCars.com™ is a leading two-sided digital automotive marketplace that creates meaningful connections between buyers and sellers.
