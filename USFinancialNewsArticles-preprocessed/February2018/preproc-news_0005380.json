    "text": "HOUSTON, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kirby Corporation (\"Kirby\") (NYSE: KEX) today announced net earnings attributable to Kirby for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $231.3 million, or $3.87 per share, compared with $32.4 million, or $0.60 per share, for the 2016 fourth quarter. Consolidated revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter were $708.1 million compared with $435.7 million reported for the 2016 fourth quarter. Kirby reported net earnings attributable to Kirby for full year 2017 of $313.2 million, or $5.62 per share, compared with $141.4 million, or $2.62 per share, for 2016. Consolidated revenues for 2017 were $2.21 billion compared with $1.77 billion for 2016.\nThe 2017 fourth quarter and full year results include the following after-tax benefit and charges to pre and after-tax earnings and diluted earnings per share:\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFull Year 2017\nPre-Tax\nAfter-\nTax\nPer\nShare\nPre-Tax\nAfter-\nTax\nPer\nShare\n(unaudited, $ in thousands except per share amounts)\nGAAP earnings (loss)\n$ (58,860)\n$ 231,319\n$ 3.87\n$ 73,014\n$ 313,187\n$ 5.62\nUS tax reform and deferred tax liability remeasurement\n(40)\n269,432\n4.51\n(40)\n269,432\n4.83\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n(105,712)\n(66,975)\n(1.12)\n(105,712)\n(66,975)\n(1.20)\nSeverance and early retirements\n(5,449)\n(3,389)\n(0.06)\n(5,449)\n(3,389)\n(0.06)\nDavid Grzebinski, Kirby's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"During the fourth quarter, our earnings were impacted by a sizeable one-time benefit related to U.S. tax reform, as well as impairment, severance and workforce early retirement charges. Earnings from operations were stronger than anticipated primarily as a result of a significant increase in product and service demand across our entire distribution and services segment, particularly in our land-based market. In our marine transportation segment, continued high utilization and demand in our inland market were partially offset by ongoing weakness in our coastal business.\"\nMr. Grzebinski continued, \"Inland marine utilization, which spiked late in the third quarter following Hurricane Harvey, remained in the low to mid-90% range throughout the fourth quarter. A favorable pricing environment for our customers' products and new petrochemical capacity led to increased movement of petrochemicals and crude oil by tank barge. During the quarter, we took actions to improve the efficiency of our business, including workforce reductions and early retirements, and the sale of aging and inefficient towboats. While these actions adversely impacted the quarter's financial results, we believe they improve overall efficiencies and put Kirby in a position of strength as this market begins to recover from a prolonged industry downturn. Looking into 2018, we will continue to pursue the right acquisition opportunities to further upgrade our fleet, consolidate the industry, and ultimately emerge larger, more efficient, and better able to service our customers.\"\nMr. Grzebinski also commented, \"In our coastal marine business, the quarter's results were adversely impacted by low year-over-year spot market pricing and declining fleet utilization as barges transitioned from term contracts into the spot market. We took proactive measures during the fourth quarter to improve our profitability going forward, including shoreside workforce reductions and the impairment and early retirement of barges and tugboats from our coastal fleet. We believe these actions are a critical step to remove excess capacity from the industry's fleet and help accelerate balance in the market. We hope that the industry follows our lead and also retires equipment.\"\nMr. Grzebinski continued, \"In our distribution and services segment, we saw strong demand during the fourth quarter for new pressure pumping equipment and transmission orders. We also benefited from a steady backlog for the remanufacture of pressure pumping equipment and overhaul of transmissions. During the quarter, we made notable progress on the integration of Stewart & Stevenson (\"S&S\"). By optimizing our capacity and sales efforts across our entire land-based business, we secured pressure pumping equipment orders that otherwise would not have been possible. In our marine-based business, we experienced an increase in demand for major overhauls of diesel engines which were previously deferred due to unfavorable market conditions.\"\nMr. Grzebinski continued, \"I am also pleased to announce that Kirby has elected William (\"Bill\") Harvey as our Executive Vice President of Finance. Bill will become Chief Financial Officer of Kirby after we file our 2017 Form 10-K. Bill is a Chartered Financial Analyst and has more than 14 years of senior financial experience, primarily in the energy and paper industries. Prior to joining Kirby, he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Walter Energy and Resolute Forest Products.\"\nSegment Results – Marine Transportation\nMarine transportation revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter were $330.4 million compared with $356.2 million for the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating income for the 2017 fourth quarter was $28.9 million compared with $59.1 million for the 2016 fourth quarter.\nIn the inland market, barge utilization was in the low to mid-90% range for the quarter, compared to mid-80% range in the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating conditions during the quarter were challenged by weather and lock delays along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Infrastructure challenges and low water levels, particularly on the Ohio River, also increased delay days throughout the quarter. Demand for inland tank barge transportation of petrochemicals and crude oil was higher compared to the 2016 fourth quarter, while demand for the transportation of refined petroleum products was slightly lower. Both term and spot contract pricing were stable relative to the third quarter. The operating margin for the inland business was in the mid-teens, and was adversely impacted by severance costs and workforce early retirements.\nIn the coastal market, utilization was in the low to mid-60% range during the fourth quarter as the market continued to weaken and more barges transitioned from term contracts into the spot market. Revenues were further reduced by an outage at a key customer's plant. Revenues from the transportation of refined petroleum products and black oil were lower than the 2016 fourth quarter, while revenues from the transportation of petrochemicals were higher. The operating margin for the coastal business was in the negative high single digits and was negatively impacted by severance costs and workforce early retirements.\nThe marine transportation segment's 2017 fourth quarter operating margin was 8.8% compared with 16.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of weaker term pricing in both marine markets, lower spot pricing in the coastal market, and reduced utilization in the coastal market as more barges operated in the spot market and were taken out of service.\nSegment Results – Distribution and Services\nDistribution and services revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter were $377.7 million with operating income of $34.5 million, compared with 2016 fourth quarter revenues of $79.4 million and operating income of $1.3 million.\nHigher revenues and operating profit compared to the 2016 fourth quarter were primarily due to accelerated growth in the legacy land-based business and the acquisition of S&S, which was completed in the 2017 third quarter. As a result of increasing oilfield commodity prices, healthy rig counts and high drilled-but-uncompleted well inventories, these businesses benefited from strong demand for the construction of new pressure pumping units and higher sales of new transmissions, engines, and parts. Additionally, the legacy business experienced steady demand for the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units and transmission overhauls.\nThe land-based business also benefited from elevated demand for power generation rental equipment and service sales through October following hurricanes Harvey and Irma. This demand returned to normal levels in November and December.\nIn the marine distribution and services business, revenues and operating profit increased compared to the 2016 fourth quarter primarily due to more customers performing major maintenance overhauls of medium-speed diesel engines that were previously deferred, as well as higher demand for new parts in the Gulf Coast offshore drilling market. Demand in the power generation market was slightly higher in the quarter, both sequentially and compared to the 2016 fourth quarter.\nThe distribution and services operating margin was 9.1% for the 2017 fourth quarter compared with 1.7% for the 2016 fourth quarter. The increase is primarily a result of increased activity in the legacy land-based business and marine-based medium-speed engine business, as well as the favorable contribution from S&S.\nCash Generation\nEBITDA of $402.4 million for 2017 compares with EBITDA of $445.0 million for 2016. Cash flow was used to fund capital expenditures of $177.2 million, including $17.9 million for new inland tank barge and towboat construction, $53.8 million for progress payments on the construction of one new coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat unit (\"ATB\"), two 4900 horsepower coastal tugboats and six 5000 horsepower coastal ATB tugboats, and $105.5 million primarily for upgrades to existing inland and coastal fleets and marine transportation and distribution and services facilities. In addition, cash used in acquisitions was $470.1 million, including $377.9 million for the acquisition of S&S. Total debt as of December 31, 2017 was $992.4 million and Kirby's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 24.2%.\nOutlook\nCommenting on the 2018 first quarter and full year market outlook and guidance, Mr. Grzebinski said, \"Our earnings guidance for the first quarter is $0.45 to $0.65 per share compared with $0.51 per share for the 2017 first quarter. This includes a $0.05 to $0.10 per share temporary negative impact to our distribution and services segment related to the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard which limits percentage of completion revenue accruals. This new standard will result in revenue accrual timing delays on certain new pressure pumping unit orders until the second quarter. Our full year earnings guidance is $2.50 to $3.00 per share. The new revenue recognition standard is not expected to materially impact the full year earnings results. These guidance ranges include the benefit of a lower effective tax rate of $0.08 to $0.12 per share for the first quarter and $0.40 to $0.50 per share for the full year.\"\nMr. Grzebinski continued, \"In our marine transportation segment, first quarter and full year guidance contemplates inland marine utilization in the low to mid-90% range and the full year effect of pricing declines experienced during 2017 as contracts renewed. We expect that industry-wide retirements, minimal new-builds, competitor consolidation, and additional petrochemical capacity will yield improved utilization compared to 2017 in the inland marine market, which will likely lead to modest mid-single digit pricing improvement in the second half of 2018. In our coastal market, factoring in the early retirements of barges and tugboats during the 2017 fourth quarter, we expect utilization in the low to mid-80% range for both the first quarter and the full year. Our guidance range considers continued pricing pressure in the coastal market. Overall, we expect operating profit in our marine transportation segment to be slightly down year-on-year, with reductions in our inland business, driven primarily by the full year effect of prior contract renewals, being partially offset by some price improvement in the second half of 2018 and reduced costs in our coastal business.\"\nMr. Grzebinski also said, \"In our distribution and services segment, we expect continued strong demand in 2018 for our land-based products and services as market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry continue to favor the remanufacture and new construction of pressure pumping units. The integration of our legacy business and S&S will generate incremental opportunities for growth, but the land-based business could be somewhat constrained by the availability of new engines, transmissions and parts as vendor supply chains are challenged. We expect operating margins for this business in the mid-to-high single digits in 2018. In our marine-based business, we expect full year results to improve as demand for new diesel engines and engine overhauls increases after more than a year of deferral and under-investment during the industry downturn. Our power generation business is expected to be relatively consistent with 2017.\"\nMr. Grzebinski continued, \"In summary, after a long couple of years, we are clearly starting to see improving market fundamentals in many of our businesses. Throughout the downturn, Kirby has taken thoughtful and strategic steps to position itself to excel when our core markets rebound. In marine transportation, we have rationalized our cost structures, retired older equipment, and acquired excess industry capacity, ultimately giving Kirby the youngest and most efficient marine fleet in its history. In distribution and services, we have expanded our manufacturing capabilities, enhanced our geographic footprint, and diversified our product and service offerings. We are excited about capitalizing on these efforts as we move into 2018, while continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities as they arise, particularly in the inland marine transportation industry.\"\nKirby expects 2018 capital spending to be in the $195 to $215 million range. Capital spending guidance includes approximately $75 million in progress payments on new marine vessels including six 5000 horsepower coastal tugboats, and fifteen inland towboats of varying horsepower to be delivered over a period of three years. Approximately $100 to $115 million is associated with capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment, including ballast water treatment systems for coastal vessels, as well as facility improvements. The balance largely relates to rental fleet growth, new machinery and equipment, and facility improvements in the distribution and services segment.\nConference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Central time tomorrow, Thursday, February 1, 2018, to discuss the 2017 fourth quarter and full year performance as well as the outlook for the 2018 first quarter and full year.

measures, one of which is EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Kirby defines EBITDA as net earnings attributable to Kirby before interest expense, taxes on income, depreciation and amortization, and impairments on long-lived assets. EBITDA is presented because of its wide acceptance as a financial indicator. EBITDA is one of the performance measures used in Kirby's incentive bonus plan. EBITDA is also used by rating agencies in determining Kirby's credit rating and by analysts publishing research reports on Kirby, as well as by investors and investment bankers generally in valuing companies. EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to, but should only be considered in conjunction with, Kirby's GAAP financial information.\n(2)\nTon miles indicate fleet productivity by measuring the distance (in miles) a loaded tank barge is moved. Example: A typical 30,000 barrel tank barge loaded with 3,300 tons of liquid cargo is moved 100 miles, thus generating 330,000 ton miles.\n(3)\nInland marine transportation revenues divided by ton miles. Example: Fourth quarter 2017 inland marine transportation revenues of $241,951,000 divided by 2,971,000,000 inland marine transportation ton miles = 8.1 cents.\n(4)\nTowboats operated are the average number of owned and chartered towboats operated during the period.\n(5)\nDelay days measures the lost time incurred by a tow (towboat and one or more tank barges) during transit. The measure includes transit delays caused by weather, lock congestion and other navigational factors.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kirby-corporation-announces-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results-300591559.html\nSOURCE Kirby Corporation",
