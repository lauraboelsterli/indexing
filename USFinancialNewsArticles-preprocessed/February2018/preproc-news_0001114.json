(NYSE:XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $71 million, or $0.40 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring, realignment, acquisition-related charges and other special items, the Company delivered adjusted net income of $137 million or $0.76 per share in the quarter, a 15-percent increase over the prior year period. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 17 percent including the full quarter contribution from the Sensus business versus the prior year period which included only two months of Sensus results. Revenue for the quarter increased seven percent on a pro forma organic basis, driven by a strong performance in the public utility end market in nearly every geography and continued growth in industrial, commercial and residential end markets. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) improved by 40 basis points year-over-year to 20.2 percent driven by net productivity gains and volume leverage. Reported operating margin in the quarter was 14 percent and adjusted operating margin decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 15.2 percent, including a 20-basis-point impact due to purchase accounting amortization.\nFor the full year 2017, Xylem generated $4.7 billion in revenue, up 25 percent on a reported basis and four percent on a pro forma organic basis. Full-year reported net income was $331 million, or $1.83 per share, with an operating margin of 11.8 percent. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment, acquisition-related charges and other special items, was $433 million, or $2.40 per share, an 18-percent increase over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA improved by 80 basis points to 18.7 percent year-over-year. Xylem delivered a full-year 2017 adjusted operating margin of 13.4 percent, down 20 basis points versus the prior year including a 50-basis-point impact due to purchase accounting amortization. The Company generated $544 million in free cash flow, an increase of 41 percent versus last year, representing a 147-percent conversion.\n“Our teams delivered a strong performance throughout 2017 and I’m very pleased with our full-year results,” said Patrick Decker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xylem. “Our relentless focus on the customer and continuing to enhance our execution in the field translated into improved results in revenue, orders and backlog growth, with the momentum we built in the second half of the year carrying into 2018. We capitalized on improving end market conditions, particularly in public utilities where we continue to gain share. Our productivity for growth initiatives continue to generate significant savings and fund critical R&D investments for our long-term growth. The successful integration of the new capabilities and capacity we gained with the addition of Sensus and Visenti are opening up new growth opportunities for us. And we’re building upon this as we continue to execute our strategy of disciplined capital deployment.”\nXylem also confirmed the completion of its previously announced acquisition of Pure Technologies, a leader in smart infrastructure assessment and management. Pure’s diagnostic and analytics solutions and services address key water and wastewater infrastructure challenges, including non-revenue water and asset management, a critical issue as infrastructure ages.\nDecker continued, “Pure’s solutions are highly complementary to the broader Xylem portfolio. This business brings a unique set of proprietary technologies as well as data analytics expertise that further augment our ability to identify and address some of our customers’ most urgent needs. As we bring these and other advanced infrastructure analytics capabilities together, we will create a portfolio of solutions that is holistic, disruptive and scalable to significantly improve the economics of our customers’ operations.”\nXylem announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.21 per share, an increase of 17 percent. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2018.\nFull-year 2018 Outlook\nXylem forecasts full-year 2018 revenue in the range of $5.1 to $5.2 billion, up eight to 10 percent, including growth from previously announced acquisitions. On an organic basis, Xylem’s revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of four to six percent.\nFull-year 2018 adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 14.0 to 14.4 percent, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 to $2.97. This represents an increase of 18 to 24 percent from Xylem’s 2017 adjusted results. The Company’s adjusted earnings outlook excludes projected integration, restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $35 million for the year. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.\nFourth Quarter Segment Results\nWater Infrastructure\nXylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue was $583 million, up six percent organically compared with fourth quarter 2016. This increase was driven by strong results in the public utility end market across most regions globally from wastewater transport applications and treatment project deliveries. The industrial end market also continued to show solid growth, reflecting improved market conditions in North America for dewatering applications. Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $103 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $4 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $107 million, a six-percent increase over the same period a year ago. Reported operating margin for the Water Infrastructure segment was 17.7 percent, down 100 basis points versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was down 70 basis points to 18.4 percent. This reflects inflation and higher investments in strategic initiatives, which more than offset strong productivity gains and volume leverage achieved in the quarter.\nApplied Water\nXylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in residential and commercial building services, and industrial applications.\nFourth quarter 2017 Applied Water revenue was $373 million, a five-percent increase organically year-over-year. This performance reflects continued growth in the U.S. and Europe industrial end markets. Demand for clean water supply helped drive growth in the residential end market in Asia Pacific, and the Company also captured share gains in Europe. Commercial building applications showed solid growth from demand for projects and restocking due to cold weather conditions. Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $61 million and adjusted operating income, which excludes $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $64 million, a 16-percent increase over the comparable period last year. Applied Water segment reported operating margin was 16.4 percent, up 270 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 17.2 percent as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and the funding of investments.\nMeasurement & Control Solutions\nXylem’s Measurement & Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics and analytic instrumentation.\nFourth quarter 2017 Measurement & Control Solutions revenue was $321 million, up 12 percent organically versus the prior year. This growth was driven by a strong performance in the Sensus business, which increased 15 percent on a pro forma organic basis in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in water, gas and software services sectors partially offset by modest declines in the electric business. Revenue from Xylem’s legacy analytics business increased one percent organically in the quarter. Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $30 million, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $4 million of restructuring and realignment costs and acquisition-related costs, was $34 million. Measurement & Control Solutions segment reported operating margin was 9.3 percent. Adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 10.6 percent as volume leverage and mix combined with cost reductions more than offset inflation and the funding of strategic R&D investments.\nSupplemental information on Xylem’s fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings and reconciliations for certain non-GAAP items is posted at www.xylem.com/investors .\nAbout Xylem\nXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to developing innovative technology solutions to the world’s water challenges.

Non-GAAP Measures Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or \"adjusted\") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators: “Organic revenue\" and \"Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation impacts is determined by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. “Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. “EBITDA” defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. “Adjusted EBITDA” reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation charges, restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses and special charges. For Sensus historical adjustments, see Sensus Historical - Adjusted EBITDA table. \"Adjusted Operating Income\", \"Adjusted Segment Operating Income\", \"Adjusted Net Income\" and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operating income, adjusted net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain or loss from sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable. For Sensus historical adjustments, see Sensus Historical - Adjusted Operating Income table. “Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. Our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt. “Realignment costs” defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs. “Sensus Acquisition Related Costs\" defined as costs incurred by the Company associated with the acquisition of Sensus that are being reported within operating income. These costs include integration costs, acquisition costs, costs related to the recognition of the backlog intangible asset amortization and inventory step-up recorded in purchase accounting. “Special charges\" defined as costs incurred by the Company, such as non-cash impairment charges, due diligence costs, initial acquisition and integration costs not related to Sensus and other special non-operating items, as well as interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt and financing costs on the bridge loan entered into for the Sensus acquisition during 2016. “Tax-related special items\" defined as tax items, such as tax return versus tax provision adjustments, tax exam impacts, tax law change impacts, significant reserves for cash repatriation, excess tax benefits/losses and other discrete tax adjustments. \"Pro forma\" defined as including the results of Sensus for the calendar period prior to the acquisition of Sensus by Xylem Inc. on October 31, 2016.
