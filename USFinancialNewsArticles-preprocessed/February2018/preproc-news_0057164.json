    "text": "The stock market rout earlier this month triggered by rising interest rates had market watchers warning that volatility was back and here to stay.\nThe Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) , which measures market expectations of volatility and is often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, spiked to a multi-year high during the recent market sell-off . It stood at 16.49 at the end of last week.\nGreater volatility in markets comes as central banks move to tighten monetary policy after years of low interest rates.\nAmid the higher volatility, U.S. stock indexes still rounded up the week ending Feb. 23 with gains. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 closed higher by 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent on the week.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
