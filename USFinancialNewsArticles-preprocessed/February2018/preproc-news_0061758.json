    "text": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BayCom Corp (the “Company”), (OTCBB:BCML), the holding company for United Business Bank (the “Bank”), announced earnings of $5.3 million or $0.81 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.9 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company reported a net loss of $839 thousand or $0.12 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net earnings of $3.2 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2017 and $1.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss during the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of a $2.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share income tax adjustment due to a revaluation adjustment of the Company’s deferred tax asset as result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The current quarter results were also impacted by $1.2 million of acquisition-related expenses related to the Plaza Bank acquisition, which, net of tax benefit, reduced net income by $0.11 per diluted share, and the full year results were impacted by $3.4 million of acquisition-related expenses which, net of tax benefit, reduced net income by $0.34 per diluted share. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter was $3.7 million, which was a $1.5 million or 29.2%, decrease compared to the preceding quarter and a $404 thousand, or 12.2%, increase from the year ago quarter.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, George J. Guarini stated, “2017 has been a transformational year for us. We closed two mergers doubling our asset size and number of branch locations, expanded our market footprint to include three new market areas, and we launched our SBA lending activities. While the immediate impact of the federal tax rate and the expenses related to the Plaza Bank merger caused a loss for the fourth quarter, we are well positioned to show strong earnings in 2018.”\nMr. Guarini added, “We are again in a position to look for new opportunities and anticipate that the M&A environment will allow us to continue to expand our geographical market reach, build market penetration, and add value for our clients and earnings per share growth for our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Performance Highlights:\nTotal assets increased $60.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.19 billion at September 30, 2017 and $675.3 million at December 31, 2016. Loans, net of allowance and deferred fees, totaled $890.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $841.1 million at September 30, 2017 and $504.3 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits totaled $1.10 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.05 billion at September 30, 2017 and $590.8 million at December 31, 2016. Non-interest bearing deposits represent 29.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans represented 0.02% of total loans as of December 31, 2017, compared to 0.02% and 0.21% of total loans as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Bank remains a “well-capitalized” institution for regulatory capital purposes at December 31, 2017.\nLoans and Credit Quality\nLoans increased $40.9 million, or 4.8%, to $894.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $853.9 million at September 30, 2017 and increased $386.9 million, or 76.1%, from $508.4 million at December 31, 2016. The Plaza Bank acquisition in November 2017 accounted for $65.4 million of loan growth with loan originations adding $36.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by loans sold and principal repayments. Loan originations in the fourth quarter of 2017 were spread throughout our markets with the majority focused in Solano, Contra Costa and San Mateo Counties, with commercial and residential real estate secured loans accounting for the majority of the originations during the quarter. The increase in loans from the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily the result of the Company’s acquisition of United Business Bank, FSB in April, 2017, which accounted for $316.0 million of the loan growth. Loan originations for year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $127.9 million. The Company also sold $24.7 million of the guaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans during 2017, of which $22.3 million settled in 2017.\nNon-accrual loans totaled $179 thousand, or 0.02% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to $187 thousand, or 0.02% of total loans, at September 30, 2017 and $1.1 million, or 0.21% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-accrual loans from a year ago primarily relates to repayment on delinquent loans. At December 31, 2017, accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days totaled $1.9 million, compared to zero delinquent loans at September 30, 2017 and $625 thousand at December 31, 2016. The increase in past due loans was related to seven unrelated loans, all of which were brought current in January 2018.\nAt December 31, 2017, our allowance for loan losses was $4.2 million, or 0.47% of total loans compared to $4.1 million, or 0.48% of total loans, at September 30, 2017 and $3.8 million, or 0.74% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses plus the discount on acquired loans totaled $12.9 million, representing 1.45% of total loans at December 31, 2017 compared to $11.9 million, representing 1.40% of total loans, at September 30, 2017. Included in the carrying value of loans are net discounts on acquired loans which may reduce the need for an allowance for loan losses on these loans, because they are carried at their estimated fair value on the date on which they were acquired. As of December 31, 2017, acquired loans net of their discount totaled $399.1 million. Net recoveries for the fourth quarter totaled $23 thousand compared to charge-offs of $45 thousand in the prior quarter and $456 thousand in the same quarter a year ago. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $22 thousand compared to $673 thousand in 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $117.0 thousand primarily as a result of growth in our organic and legacy loan portfolio. Low levels of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, the level of our allowance for loan losses and stabilized real estate values in our market areas mitigated the required provision for loan losses.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nDeposits totaled of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $590.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in deposits was primarily attributable to the $482.2 million of deposits acquired in connection with our two bank acquisitions in 2017 and to a lesser extent, organic growth. Non-interest bearing deposits totaled $327.3 million, or 29.6% of total deposits, at December 31, 2017, compared to $128.7 million, or 21.8% of total deposits, at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, borrowings totaled $11.4 million, which included $6.0 million in long-term secured borrowings and $5.4 million, net carrying value, of junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities that were acquired through our acquisition of United Business Bank, FSB. The Company had no borrowings at December 31, 2016.\nEarnings\nNet interest income increased $4.8 million, or 69.3%, to $11.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.0 million for the same period of 2016. Net interest income increased $13.4 million, or 50.4%, to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $26.6 million for the same period of 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets of $516.9 million and $348.7 million for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. Interest income on loans for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 included $983 thousand and $3.7 million, respectively, in accretion of purchase accounting fair value adjustments on acquired loans, compared to $815 thousand and $3.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The remaining net discount on these purchased loans was $14.4 million, $13.8 million, and $7.4 million at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The average yield earned on loans for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 5.44%, down 32 basis points from 5.76% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet interest margin is enhanced by the amortization of acquisition accounting discounts on loans acquired in the acquisitions, which are accreted into loan interest income. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.96% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net interest margin of 4.31% in the preceding quarter, and 4.16% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Accretion of acquisition accounting discounts on loans and the recognition of revenue from purchase credit impaired loans in excess of discounts increased our net interest margin by 22 basis points, 62 basis points and 60 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2017, the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The decline in net interest margin during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter a year earlier primarily reflects reduction in revenue from repayment of purchase credit impaired loans in excess of discounts partially offset by a reduction in the cost of funds.\nNon-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $336 thousand, or 31%, to $1.4 million, compared to $1.1 million for the prior quarter and increased $1.0 million, or 282%, from $371 thousand in the same quarter in 2016. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $3.4 million, or 253%, to $4.8 million, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase compared to the prior quarter primarily relates to a gain on sale of other real estate owned property. The increases in the fourth quarter and the year ending December 31, 2017 compared to the prior periods in 2016 primarily relate to gain on sale of loans, higher loan fee income and servicing charge income. We recorded a $461 thousand and $2.2 million gain on sale of loans during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, with no gain on sale of loans recorded during 2016. Additionally, the acquisitions and organic growth significantly increased the deposit portfolio and number of accounts serviced, which increased service charges and fees.\nNon-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $1.9 million, or 25.3%, to $9.4 million, compared to $7.5 million in the prior quarter, and by $5.3 million, or 132%, compared to $4.1 million for the same quarter in 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 was higher than the prior quarter primarily due to the $1.2 million one-time recognition of acquisition-related expenses related to Plaza Bank. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $13.2 million, or 77.6%, to $30.1 million, compared to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increases for the fourth quarter and year end December 31, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 were primarily attributable to higher operating costs resulting from our two bank acquisitions during 2017, including an increase in salary and benefits associated with the increased number of employees, an increase in occupancy expense associated with additional branch offices and an increase in data processing charges as a result of higher transaction volume. One time merger related expenses totaled $3.5 million, or 12% of total operating expenses, in 2017.\nAbout BayCom Corp\nThe Bank offers a full-range of loans, including SBA, FSA and USDA guaranteed loans, and deposit products and services to businesses and its affiliates throughout the Greater Bay Area.
