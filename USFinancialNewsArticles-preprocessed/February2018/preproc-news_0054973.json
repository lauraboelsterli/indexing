    "text": "February 23, 2018 / 9:34 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago EU rules on NPLs to give banks eight years to write down secured loans - source Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MILAN (Reuters) - A draft proposal by the European Commission to tackle the blocâ€™s stock of bad bank loans gives lenders eight years to write down impaired debts backed by collateral, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Confirming a press report in Italian daily Il Messaggero, the source said the percentage of writedowns required every year once a loan is classed as non-performing would rise gradually over time. The source added the draft envisaged gradual writedowns over two years for unsecured loans, of which 35 percent in the first year. The EU Commission was not immediately available for a comment.
