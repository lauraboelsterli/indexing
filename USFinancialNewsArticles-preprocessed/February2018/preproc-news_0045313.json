    "text": "(Reuters) - Guess Inc ( GES.N ) said on Tuesday its co-founder Paul Marciano will give up his day-to-day responsibilities at the company on an unpaid basis pending the completion of a probe into accusations of improper conduct.\nEarlier this month, model and actress Kate Upton accused Marciano of using his power in the fashion industry to harass women. Marciano and the company have both denied the claims.\n“The company takes very seriously any allegations of sexual misconduct, is committed to maintaining a safe work environment, and looks forward to the completion of a thorough investigation of all the facts,” it said in a statement.\nFILE PHOTO: Model Kate Upton arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala (Met Gala) to celebrate the opening of \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\" in the Manhattan borough of New York, U.S. May 2, 2016. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo Guess’ shares fell more than 17 percent in early February following Upton’s accusations against Marciano made on Twitter.\n“He shouldn’t be allowed to use his power in the industry to sexually and emotionally harass women #metoo”, Upton tweeted, using a popular hashtag designed to highlight the wide spread of sexual harassment, without elaborating.\nShortly after, the company’s board formed a special committee made up of two independent directors to oversee an investigation into accusations against Marciano.\nThe investigation is being conducted by law firm O‘Melveny & Myers while the special committee hired law firm Glaser Weil to look into the accusations.\nGuess shares were down about 4 percent at $14.93 in early trading on Tuesday.\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Bill Rigby\n ",
