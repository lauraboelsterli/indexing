We are also continuing to demonstrate the value creation potential from the FelCor merger,” commented Ross H. Bierkan, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Combining our recent sale of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Boston, the post year-end disposition of the Embassy Suites Marlborough, and another asset that we have under contract, we will reach our initial goal of selling at least $300 million in assets. Our disposition pipeline is strong, and we are encouraged by our progress and ability to pay down debt with the proceeds. We remain focused on executing on our key strategic priorities of realizing synergies, selling non-core assets, optimizing the balance sheet, and opportunistically reinvesting in our hotels.”\nFinancial and Operating Results\nThe prefix “Pro forma” as defined by the Company, denotes operating results which include results for periods prior to its ownership and excludes sold hotels. Pro forma RevPAR and Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin are reported on a comparable basis and therefore exclude any hotels sold during the period and non-comparable hotels that were not open for operation or were closed for renovation for comparable periods. Explanations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA Margin, FFO, and Adjusted FFO, as well as reconciliations of those measures to net income or loss, if applicable, are included within this release.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, decreased $68.4 million to $7.4 million, representing a 90.3% decrease over the comparable period in 2016. Net income included transaction costs of $7.5 million related primarily to the FelCor merger and $31.8 million of non-cash income tax expense related primarily to the change in tax rates from the recently passed tax reform bill.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income decreased $125.6 million to $75.7 million, representing a 62.4% decrease over the comparable period in 2016.

Adjusting for real estate taxes, insurance and operational disruption related to our Courtyard Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile hotel, Pro Forma Hotel EBITDA margin would have been slightly positive.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin decreased 123 basis points over the comparable period in 2016 to 33.1%.\nPro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increased $1.1 million to $143.0 million, representing a 0.8% increase over the comparable period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Pro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA decreased $25.8 million to $605.9 million, representing a 4.1% decrease over the comparable period in 2016.

The Company's Pro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA excludes $10.5 million in hotel EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is inclusive of the period prior to hotel ownership.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $586.5 million of unrestricted cash on its balance sheet, $600.0 million available on its revolving credit facility, and $2.8 billion of debt outstanding. The Company’s ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, was 3.9 times (excluding preferred equity).\nDividends\nThe Company’s Board of Trustees declared a cash dividend of $0.33 per common share of beneficial interest in the fourth quarter. The dividend was paid on January 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of December 29, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company declared a total dividend of $1.32 per common share of beneficial interest.\nThe Company's Board of Trustees declared a preferred dividend of $0.4875 on its Series A cumulative convertible preferred shares (“Series A Preferred Shares”).

Both term loans were amended to include more favorable pricing. The Company also amended its $150.0 million unsecured term loan due January 2022 with more favorable pricing.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company closed on the sale of the Embassy Suites Marlborough for $23.7 million.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company’s outlook includes only hotels owned as of February 27, 2018. Potential future acquisitions or dispositions could result in a material change to the Company’s outlook. The outlook includes capital expenditures related to renovations and ROI projects in the range of $130 million to $140 million, which the Company anticipates will result in approximately 100 basis points of RevPAR disruption. The outlook also assumes 50 basis points of RevPAR headwinds related to tough comps from last year's hurricane efforts. On the margin front, the outlook assumes 60 to 70 basis points of headwinds from property taxes and insurance increases, partially driven by the impact from Proposition 13 on FelCor's California hotels.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company anticipates:\nCurrent Outlook Pro forma RevPAR growth -1.0% to +1.0% Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin 31.25% to 32.5%\nPro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA $565.0M to $600.0M\nAdjusted EBITDA $527.0M to $562.0M\nCorporate Cash General & Administrative $37.0M to $39.0M\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will conduct its quarterly analyst and investor conference call on February 28, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the use of the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “will continue,” “intend,” “should,” or similar expressions. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, beliefs, and expectations, such forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events or guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that might cause such a difference include the following: the current global economic uncertainty, increased direct competition, changes in government regulations or accounting rules, changes in local, national, and global real estate conditions, declines in the lodging industry, seasonality of the lodging industry, risks related to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, hostilities, including future terrorist attacks or fear of hostilities that affect travel, the Company’s ability to obtain lines of credit or permanent financing on satisfactory terms, changes in interest rates, access to capital through offerings of the Company’s common and preferred shares of beneficial interest, or debt, the Company’s ability to identify suitable acquisitions, the Company’s ability to close on identified acquisitions and integrate those businesses, and inaccuracies of the Company’s accounting estimates. Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and urges investors to carefully review the disclosures the Company makes concerning risks and uncertainties in the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report, as well as risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFor additional information or to receive press releases via email, please visit our website:\nhttp://rljlodgingtrust.com\nRLJ Lodging Trust\nNon-GAAP and Accounting Commentary\nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) Adjusted EBITDA, (5) Hotel EBITDA, and (6) Hotel EBITDA Margin. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”)\nThe Company calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units are redeemable for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”)\nEBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results.\nIn addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. The Company presents EBITDA attributable to common shareholders, which includes OP units, because the OP units are redeemable for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand EBITDA attributable to all common shares and OP units.\nAdjustments to FFO and EBITDA\nThe Company adjusts FFO and EBITDA for certain items that the Company considers either outside the normal course of operations or extraordinary. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income, FFO, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of its operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO and EBITDA for the following items:\nTransaction Costs: The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period. Non-Cash Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items. The Company has excluded the amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash gain or loss on the sale of assets, and certain non-cash income taxes. Other Non-Operational Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses. The Company excludes hurricane-related costs not reimbursed by insurance, property-level severance costs, debt modification and extinguishment costs, and other income and expenses outside the normal course of operations.\nHotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin\nWith respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operational performance of the Company’s hotels and the effectiveness of third-party management companies.\nPro forma Consolidated Hotel EBITDA includes unadjusted prior ownership information provided by the sellers of the hotels for periods prior to our acquisition of the hotels, which has not been audited and excludes sold hotels as applicable. Pro forma Hotel EBITDA and Pro forma Hotel EBITDA Margin exclude the results of non-comparable hotels that were under renovation or not open for the entirety of the comparable periods. The following is a summary of pro forma hotel adjustments:\nPro forma adjustments: Acquired hotels\nNo hotels were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company acquired the following hotels in August 2017 in conjunction with the FelCor merger:\nDoubleTree Suites by Hilton Austin DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Orlando - Lake Buena Vista Embassy Suites Atlanta - Buckhead Embassy Suites Birmingham Embassy Suites Boston - Marlborough Embassy Suites Dallas - Love Field Embassy Suites Deerfield Beach - Resort & Spa Embassy Suites Fort Lauderdale 17th Street Embassy Suites Los Angeles - International Airport/South Embassy Suites Mandalay Beach - Hotel & Resort Embassy Suites Miami - International Airport Embassy Suites Milpitas Silicon Valley Embassy Suites Minneapolis - Airport Embassy Suites Myrtle Beach - Oceanfront Resort Embassy Suites Napa Valley Embassy Suites Orlando - International Drive South/Convention Center Embassy Suites Phoenix - Biltmore Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport - South San Francisco Embassy Suites San Francisco Airport - Waterfront Embassy Suites Secaucus - Meadowlands Hilton Myrtle Beach Resort Holiday Inn San Francisco - Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco Marriott Union Square DoubleTree by Hilton Burlington Vermont, formerly Sheraton Burlington Hotel & Conference Center Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill Hotel The Fairmont Copley Plaza, Boston The Knickerbocker, New York The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel, Charleston The Vinoy Renaissance St. Petersburg Resort & Golf Club Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill Wyndham Houston - Medical Center Hotel & Suites Wyndham New Orleans - French Quarter Wyndham Philadelphia Historic District Wyndham Pittsburgh University Center Wyndham San Diego Bayside Wyndham Santa Monica At The Pier\nPro forma adjustments: Sold hotels\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the following hotel was sold:\nThe Fairmont Copley Plaza Boston was sold in December 2017\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the following hotels were sold:\nHoliday Inn Express Merrillville was sold in February 2016 SpringHill Suites Bakersfield was sold in November 2016 Hilton Garden Inn New York 35th Street was sold in December 2016 Hilton New York Fashion District was sold in December 2016\nRLJ Lodging Trust\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nAssets Investment in hotel properties, net $ 5,791,925 $ 3,367,776 Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 23,885 — Cash and cash equivalents 586,470 456,672 Restricted cash reserves 72,606 67,206 Hotel and other receivables, net of allowance of $510 and $182, respectively 60,011 26,018 Deferred income tax asset, net 56,761 44,614 Intangible assets, net 133,211 898 Prepaid expense and other assets 69,936 60,209 Total assets $ 6,794,805 $ 4,023,393 Liabilities and Equity Debt, net $ 2,880,488 $ 1,582,715 Accounts payable and other liabilities 225,664 137,066 Deferred income tax liability 5,547 11,430 Advance deposits and deferred revenue 30,463 11,975 Accrued interest 17,081 3,444 Distributions payable 65,284 41,486 Total liabilities 3,224,527 1,788,116 Equity Shareholders’ equity: Preferred shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, $0.01 par value, 12,950,000 shares authorized; 12,879,475 shares issued and outstanding, liquidation value of $328,266 at December 31, 2017 366,936 — Common shares of beneficial interest, $0.01 par value, 450,000,000 shares authorized; 174,869,046 and 124,364,178 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 1,749 1,244 Additional paid-in capital 3,208,002 2,187,333 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 8,846 (4,902 ) (Distributions in excess of net earnings) retained earnings (82,566 ) 38,249 Total shareholders’ equity 3,502,967 2,221,924 Noncontrolling interest: Noncontrolling interest in consolidated joint ventures 11,700 5,973 Noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership 11,181 7,380 Total noncontrolling interest 22,881 13,353 Preferred equity in a consolidated joint venture, liquidation value of $45,430 at December 31, 2017 44,430 — Total equity 3,570,278 2,235,277 Total liabilities and equity $ 6,794,805 $ 4,023,393 Note:\nThe corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.
