In addition, the Company provided 2018 financial guidance and an update on its R&D programs.\n“In 2017, our team progressed our clinical stage development programs towards key milestones, unveiled novel discovery programs, and continued to build our organization to support our maturing pipeline,” said Gene Kinney, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Prothena. “We successfully completed enrollment in both the Phase 2b PRONTO and Phase 3 VITAL studies in AL Amyloidosis. We also presented data elucidating the toxic effect – that is unique from other forms of heart failure – of misfolded soluble light chain on cardiomyocytes that results in increased production of NT-proBNP, a cardiac biomarker that has been shown in multiple independent studies to predict survival in patients with AL amyloidosis. We also initiated, with our partners at Roche, the Phase 2 PASADENA study of PRX002/RG7935 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. Looking ahead, in 2018 we will continue to capitalize on our deep expertise in protein misfolding in seeking to advance a broad pipeline of disease-modifying therapeutics in the neurodegenerative and orphan disease categories, and we remain focused and on track to reach key milestones, including the topline data from the Phase 2b PRONTO study which is expected in the second quarter and the initiation of the Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study of PRX004 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis expected by mid-year.”\nFull Year 2017 and Recent Highlights:\nNEOD001 is a monoclonal antibody for the potential treatment of AL amyloidosis:\nPresented new preclinical data at the Heart Failure Society of America 21 st Annual Meeting (HFSA) Annual Scientific Meeting that further supports the important role of the cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP in the biology of AL amyloidosis. Preclinical data presented in a moderated poster talk and poster session at the conference demonstrated the relationship between misfolded soluble light chain toxicity to cardiomyocytes and production of NT-proBNP. Completed enrollment in the Phase 3 VITAL Amyloidosis Study evaluating NEOD001 in newly diagnosed, treatment naïve patients with AL amyloidosis and cardiac dysfunction. The VITAL study is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, registrational study with an event-based composite primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiac hospitalizations as qualifying events. Secondary endpoints include Short-form 36 (SF-36, a quality of life measure) and Six-Minute Walk Test. Completed enrollment in the Phase 2b PRONTO study evaluating NEOD001 in previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis and persistent cardiac dysfunction. The PRONTO study is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, registration-directed study with a primary endpoint of best response over 12 months of the cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP, defined by the consensus criteria of NT-proBNP change. Secondary endpoints include evaluations of SF-36 and Six-Minute Walk Test.\nPRX002/RG7935 is a monoclonal antibody for the potential treatment of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies, and is the primary focus of Prothena's worldwide collaboration with Roche:\nInitiated the Phase 2 PASADENA study of PRX002/RG7935 in patients with early Parkinson's disease, triggering a $30 million milestone payment from Roche to Prothena. PASADENA is a global two-part clinical study being conducted by Roche. The primary endpoint of this study is the comparison of change from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score (parts 1, 2 and 3) at week 52 in each of the two treatment groups vs. the placebo group. In a late-breaking therapeutic strategies session at the 13 th ​International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases (AD/PD), Joseph Jankovic, M.D., of Baylor College of Medicine presented clinical data from the 80-patient Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study of PRX002/RG7935 in patients with Parkinson's disease. The Phase 1b study results further supported advancing PRX002/RG7935 into the Phase 2 PASADENA study.\nPRX004 is a monoclonal antibody for the potential treatment of ATTR amyloidosis:\nAdvanced a proprietary, high-sensitivity assay that specifically detects circulating misfolded-hATTR in plasma across multiple TTR mutations that can be used in clinical studies to monitor pharmacodynamic response to PRX004 in plasma.\nAdditional Discovery Program Highlights:\nProvided an update on the Company’s growing discovery pipeline targeting novel therapeutic approaches in the neuroscience and orphan disease categories during an R&D day hosted in New York City. Identified antibodies targeting novel epitopes on the tau protein with the potential to block misfolded tau from binding to cells to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission, preventing downstream toxic functional effects. Tau is a protein implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other tauopathies. Advanced a new approach to design a potentially more potent anti-Aβ antibody. Aβ, or Amyloid Beta is a protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\nIdentified novel epitopes on the misfolded forms of LECT2, a protein implicated in ALECT2 amyloidosis. Similar to AL amyloidosis and ATTR amyloidosis, ALECT2 amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by deposits of misfolded aggregated protein in vital organs, most often the kidneys and liver.\nUpcoming Research and Development Milestones\nProthena's development pipeline includes three protein immunotherapy programs.\nNEOD001\nTopline results in the Phase 2b PRONTO study expected following the 12-month study period in the second quarter of 2018. The Phase 3 VITAL study is designed to evaluate a composite endpoint of time to all-cause mortality or cardiac hospitalization with an anticipated final event in the second half of 2019.\nPRX002/RG7935\nThe Phase 2 PASADENA study, initiated in the second quarter of 2017, continues to enroll patients with early Parkinson's disease.\nPRX004\nPhase 1 multiple ascending dose study expected to begin by mid-2018.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year of 2017 Financial Results and 2018 Financial Guidance\nProthena reported a net loss of $47.8 million and $153.2 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to a net loss of $48.9 million and $160.1 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 was $1.24 and $4.07, respectively, as compared to a net loss per share of $1.41 and $4.66 for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively.\nProthena reported total revenue of $0.2 million and $27.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to total revenue of $0.2 million and $1.1 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue for the full year of 2017 was primarily due to achievement of a clinical milestone payment from Roche of $30.0 million, of which $26.6 million was recognized as collaboration revenue and $3.4 million was recognized as an offset to research and development expenses.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses totaled $33.5 million and $134.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to $39.8 million and $119.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to lower product manufacturing expenses and to a lesser extent lower clinical trial costs, which were partially offset by higher personnel costs, higher consulting expense, and higher expense associated with PRX002/RG7935. The increase in R&D expenses for the full year of 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to higher personnel costs, and to a lesser extent higher clinical trial costs associated primarily with the NEOD001 program, higher consulting expenses and higher expenses associated with PRX002/RG7935, which were partially offset by a decrease in external expenses related to product manufacturing. R&D expenses included non-cash share-based compensation expense of $3.1 million and $10.9 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to $1.9 million and $7.1 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses totaled $14.0 million and $48.2 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to $9.6 million and $41.1 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to higher personnel costs and to a lesser extent higher consulting expense and other expenses in 2017, which were partially offset by a reduction in share-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of stock options in the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, a gain was recognized from the assignment of the Company's former South San Francisco facility lease in January 2017. G&A expenses included non-cash share-based compensation expense of $4.4 million and $15.9 million and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to $3.3 million and $17.8 million and full year of 2016, respectively.\nTotal non-cash share-based compensation expense was $7.4 million and $26.8 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, respectively, as compared to $5.2 million and $24.9 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Prothena had $421.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and no debt.\nAs of February 9, 2018, Prothena had approximately 38.5 million ordinary shares outstanding.\nThe Company expects the full year 2018 net cash burn from operating and investing activities to be $175 to $230 million, and to end the year with approximately $218 million in cash (mid-point). The estimated full year 2018 net cash burn from operating and investing activities is primarily driven by an estimated net loss of $200 to $260 million, which includes an estimated $33 million of non-cash share-based compensation expense.\nConference Call Details\nProthena management will discuss these results and its 2018 financial guidance during a live audio webcast and conference call today, Wednesday, February 14, 2018, at 4:30 PM ET.
