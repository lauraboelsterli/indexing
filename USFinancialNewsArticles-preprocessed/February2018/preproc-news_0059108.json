    "text": "CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) â€” The average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline dropped about 6 cents nationally over the past two weeks, to $2.59.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that it's the first decline since December. She says prices are expected to rise again as crude oil costs go up.\nThe current gas price is 26 cents above where it was a year ago.\nGas in San Francisco was the highest in the contiguous United States at an average of $3.38 a gallon. The lowest was in Jackson, Mississippi, at $2.23 a gallon.",
