    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Crowell & Moring LLP is pleased to announce that former federal prosecutor William S.W. Chang has joined the firm as a partner in the Health Care and White Collar & Regulatory Enforcement groups. Chang joins the firm from the U.S. Department of Justice where he was a founding member of the Corporate Health Care Fraud Strike Force, which investigates and prosecutes the largest and most sophisticated health care fraud cases. He led health care fraud investigations of public and private companies and individuals, and his cases spanned several districts and involved multiple state and federal agencies as well as parallel civil proceedings.\n\"Will's insight as a former DOJ prosecutor focused on the health care industry is extremely valuable to clients navigating this complicated area,\" said Philip T. Inglima , chair of Crowell & Moring. \"His addition builds upon the talents of our multifaceted team of health care and white collar practitioners who routinely handle health care fraud and abuse matters. We are thrilled to welcome Will to the firm.\"\nAt Crowell & Moring, Chang's practice will focus primarily on health care fraud investigations and litigation. It will offer fraud and abuse counseling; internal investigations; and trial and appellate representation of health care companies, executives, and medical professionals in criminal, civil, and administrative actions. It will also involve health care-focused e-discovery legal services, including effective preservation and collection of evidence, negotiating discovery protocols, targeted production, and related litigation.\n\"Because of the enormous risks inherent in health care fraud cases – from significant False Claims Act damages to criminal prosecutions to program exclusion – a comprehensive, experienced, and adept health care fraud legal team is essential to defend our clients in complex cases,\" said Chris Flynn , who co-chairs the firm's Health Care Group and the firm's Health Care Litigation Team. \"Will's experience fits squarely at the center of a coordinated and deep health care fraud practice and makes him an incredibly valuable addition to our firm and our clients.\"\nChang has 13 years of legal experience overall, including as a federal trial attorney from 2013 to 2018. As a DOJ prosecutor, Chang led nearly a dozen complex cases resulting in convictions of all 24 defendants, including the largest Provider Attendant Services fraud in Texas history. That case was featured at the 2017 National Health Care Fraud Training Conference as a case study for successful federal and state interagency prosecutions. He has tried five jury trials involving health care fraud, securities fraud, Anti-Kickback Statute violations, Bank Secrecy Act violations, and money laundering. He also served as the Health Care Fraud Unit's Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property prosecutor on cybercrimes and the collection of electronic evidence, where he was also responsible for training new prosecutors. The DOJ, the Department of Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and the FBI repeatedly recognized Chang: He received two Assistant Attorney General's Awards for Distinguished Service; an Exceptional Achievement Award and an Award for Excellence in Fighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse from HHS-OIG; and multiple commendations from the FBI director.\nChang was previously an appellate lawyer at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, where he represented clients before the U.S. Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and federal administrative agencies. He was also an attorney with Kirkland & Ellis LLP. He clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n\"Crowell & Moring is known for its premier health care and white collar work – the two areas that are the cornerstone of my practice,\" Chang said. \"I am thrilled to join these talented lawyers who work together in a very collaborative way.\"\nChang's addition comes a year after Laura M. Kidd Cordova , the founder and head of the DOJ's Corporate Health Care Fraud Strike Force, joined Crowell & Moring as a partner.\n\"Over the past five years, clients have become much more sophisticated about engaging defense lawyers who have both the substantive experience and relationships with the current government prosecutors on specialized investigations,\" said Daniel L. Zelenko , chair of the firm's nationally recognized White Collar & Regulatory Enforcement Group. \"Based on his impressive track record and stellar reputation at the DOJ, Will absolutely fills that need.\"\nChang is active in the Asian Pacific American Bar Association as well as the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association at Harvard Law School. He is a former member of the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Diversity Committee. Chang earned his J.D. from Harvard Law School and his A.B. in international relations from Stanford University.\nAbout Crowell & Moring's Health Care Group\nCrowell & Moring's nationally recognized Health Care Group provides a comprehensive range of litigation, investigation, regulatory compliance, fraud and abuse, transactions and counseling services to health care clients nationwide.
