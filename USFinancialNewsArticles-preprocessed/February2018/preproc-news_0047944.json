    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iridium Communications Inc. (Nasdaq:IRDM) (“Iridium”) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017, issued its full-year 2018 guidance and updated its long-range outlook. Net income was $141.9 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to net income of $24.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operational EBITDA (“OEBITDA”) (1) for the fourth quarter was $63.7 million, as compared to $61.3 million for the prior-year period, representing a year-over-year increase of 4% and an OEBITDA margin (1) of 55%. OEBITDA benefitted from continued growth in the Company’s Internet of Things (“IoT”) data business and from higher equipment sales.\nIridium reported fourth-quarter total revenue of $115.5 million, which consisted of $91.4 million of service revenue and $24.0 million of revenue related to equipment sales and engineering and support projects. Total revenue increased 7% versus the comparable period of 2016, while service revenue grew 9% from the year-ago period. Service revenue, which represents primarily recurring revenue from Iridium’s growing subscriber base, was 79% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company ended the quarter with 969,000 total billable subscribers, which compares to 850,000 for the year-ago period and is up from 949,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Total billable subscribers grew 14% year-over-year, driven by growth in commercial IoT and government customers.\nFull-Year 2017 Iridium Business Highlights\nFor the full year, Iridium reported net income of $233.9 million, or $1.82 per diluted share attributable to common stockholders, as compared to net income of $111.0 million, or $0.89 per diluted share attributable to common stockholders for 2016. The Company reported 2017 total revenue of $448.0 million, which was up 3% from the year-ago period. Total revenue included $349.7 million of service revenue and $98.3 million of revenue related to equipment sales and engineering and support projects. OEBITDA for 2017 was $265.6 million, a 4% increase from $254.2 million in the prior-year, representing an OEBITDA margin of 59%. Capital expenditures were $400.1 million for the full-year 2017.\n“Iridium is executing well as we continue to move into the Iridium ® NEXT era. IoT remains a strong catalyst for subscriber growth, and Iridium’s unique offering continues to attract large, new business partners with growing satellite requirements,” said Matt Desch, CEO, Iridium. Desch continued, “The Company delivered 9% total service revenue growth in the latest quarter and exceeded our full-year guidance for Operational EBITDA in 2017. Momentum for services enabled by the Iridium network, including personal tracking and real-time asset telemetry, helped to fuel a 23% rise in commercial IoT subscribers and drive total billable subscribers to a record 969,000 at year end.”\nCommenting on Iridium NEXT, Desch said, “We made great progress in 2017 on our next generation constellation, with four launches and 40 satellites in orbit, including our most recent launch in December. Thirty-two satellites are now in operation with eight more drifting toward their intended orbital slots.”\nDesch concluded, “Today, we issued 2018 full-year guidance and updated our long-term outlook. We expect continued demand for Iridium’s one-of-a-kind global solutions and new services available with Iridium NEXT satellites will drive significant revenue and subscriber growth for our Company.”\nFourth-Quarter Iridium Business Highlights\nService – Commercial\nCommercial service remained the largest part of Iridium’s business, representing 60% of the Company’s total revenue during the fourth quarter. The Company’s commercial customer base is diverse and includes markets such as maritime, aviation, oil and gas, mining, recreation, forestry, construction, transportation and emergency services. These customers rely on Iridium’s products and services as critical to their daily operations and integral to their communications and business infrastructure.\nCommercial service revenue was $69.4 million, up 12% from last year’s comparable period due to revenue from hosted payload and other data services and to increased IoT revenues.\nCommercial voice and data subscribers rose from the year-ago period to 359,000 customers. Commercial voice and data average revenue per user (“ARPU”) was $42 during the fourth quarter, compared to $41 in last year’s comparable period. Commercial IoT data subscribers grew 23% from the year-ago period to 510,000 customers. Commercial IoT data ARPU was $13 in the fourth quarter, compared to $14 in last year’s comparable period.\nIridium’s commercial business ended the quarter with 869,000 billable subscribers, which compares to 766,000 for the prior-year quarter and is up from 854,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. IoT data subscribers represented 59% of billable commercial subscribers at the end of the quarter, an increase from 54% at the end of the prior-year period.\nService – Government\nIridium’s voice and data solutions improve situational awareness for military personnel and track critical assets in tough environments around the globe, providing a unique value proposition that is not easily duplicated. The Company operates through two Defense Information Systems Agency (“DISA”) contracts, which include a $400 million, five-year, fixed-price agreement for satellite communications services and a $38 million multi-year contract to support and maintain the Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) dedicated gateway.\nGovernment service revenue was $22.0 million, consistent with the prior-year period, as the final step up in the fixed fee under the Company’s airtime services contract with DISA occurred in 2015.\nIridium’s government business ended the quarter with 100,000 subscribers, which compares to 84,000 for the prior-year quarter and is up from 95,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Government voice and data subscribers increased 18% from the year-ago period to 52,000 as of December 31, 2017. IoT data subscribers increased 20% year-over-year and continued to represent 48% of government subscribers at year-end.\nEquipment\nEquipment revenue was $19.4 million during the fourth quarter, up 18% from the prior-year period, reflecting heightened sales from hurricane-related activity. The Company forecasts lower equipment sales in 2018.\nEngineering & Support\nEngineering and support revenue was $4.7 million during the fourth quarter, down 32% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the episodic nature of government-sponsored projects.\nCapital expenditures were $109.4 million for the fourth quarter and primarily related to spending for the Company’s next-generation satellite constellation, Iridium NEXT. The Company ended the fourth quarter with a cash and marketable securities balance of $297.6 million and credit facility gross debt of $1.8 billion. Net debt was $1.5 billion, calculated as $1.8 billion of credit facility gross debt and $55.6 million of Thales bills of exchange, less $297.6 million of cash and marketable securities, as well as $102.4 million in restricted cash.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company issued its full-year 2018 outlook for total service revenue growth and OEBITDA. Based on expectations that approximately $14 million in hosting revenues from Aireon will be recognized, the Company expects:\nTotal service revenue growth between 10% and 12% for the full-year 2018. Full-year 2018 OEBITDA between $280 million and $290 million. OEBITDA for 2017 was $265.6 million.\nThe Company also announced that it believes it has reached an agreement in principle with its credit facility lenders to solidify its liquidity position. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company would be required to raise additional debt by July 2018, and the lenders would delay a portion of the principal repayments. The proceeds of this capital raising and delayed principal payment schedule would provide the Company with sufficient cash to meet its needs, including principal and interest payments under its credit facility, for the next several years, even in the absence of any hosting fee payments from Aireon.\nLong-Range Outlook\nThe Company updated its long-range outlook for total service revenue growth and peak net leverage, while affirming its guidance for OEBITDA margin, cash taxes, and 2019 net leverage. Given our expected completion of the Iridium NEXT system in 2018, the Company expects:\nTotal service revenue of approximately $440 million for the full-year 2019. OEBITDA margin of approximately 60% in 2019. Negligible cash taxes through approximately 2020. Peak net leverage of 6.0x to 6.5x OEBITDA in 2018. Net leverage of approximately 4.5x OEBITDA in 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures & Definitions\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides Operational EBITDA and Operational EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as supplemental measures to help investors evaluate the Company’s fundamental operational performance. Operational EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, Iridium NEXT revenue and expenses (for periods prior to the deployment of Iridium NEXT only), loss from investment in Aireon, share-based compensation expenses, the impact of purchase accounting, and non-cash gain from the Boeing transaction. Iridium NEXT revenue and expenses were excluded from Operational EBITDA through 2017. In 2018, Iridium NEXT revenues and recurring Iridium NEXT expenses (recurring Iridium NEXT expenses are not part of the approximately $3 billion construction cost of Iridium NEXT (the “Construction Costs”)) will no longer be excluded in calculating Operational EBITDA. U.S. GAAP requires that certain of the Construction Costs be expensed. These certain Construction Costs, which beginning in 2018 will principally consist of in-orbit insurance, will continue to be excluded from the calculation of Operational EBITDA through 2019. The Company also presents Operational EBITDA expressed as a percentage of GAAP revenue, or Operational EBITDA margin. Operational EBITDA, along with its related measure, Operational EBITDA margin, does not represent, and should not be considered, an alternative to U.S. GAAP measurements such as net income or loss, and the Company’s calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. By eliminating interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, Iridium NEXT revenue and expenses (for periods prior to the deployment of Iridium NEXT only), loss from investment in Aireon, share-based compensation expenses, the impact of purchase accounting, and non-cash gain from the Boeing transaction, the Company believes the result is a useful measure across time in evaluating its fundamental core operating performance. Management also uses Operational EBITDA to manage the business, including in preparing its annual operating budget, debt covenant compliance, financial projections and compensation plans. The Company believes that Operational EBITDA is also useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. However, there is no standardized measurement of Operational EBITDA, and Operational EBITDA as the Company presents it may not be comparable with similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As indicated, Operational EBITDA does not include interest expense on borrowed money, the payment of income taxes, amortization of the Company’s definite-lived intangible assets, or depreciation expense on the Company’s capital assets, which are necessary elements of the Company’s operations. It also excludes expenses in connection with the development, deployment and financing of Iridium NEXT and the loss from investment in Aireon. Since Operational EBITDA does not account for these and other expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company’s operating performance has material limitations. Due to these limitations, the Company’s management does not view Operational EBITDA in isolation, but also uses other measurements, such as net income, revenues and operating profit, to measure operating performance. Please refer to the schedule below for a reconciliation of consolidated GAAP net income to Operational EBITDA and Iridium’s Investor Relations webpage at www.iridium.com for a discussion and reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP financial measures. We do not provide a forward-looking reconciliation of expected full-year 2018 Operational EBITDA guidance as the amount and significance of special items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be estimated at this time without unreasonable efforts.\nIridium Communications Inc.
