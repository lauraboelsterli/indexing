Excluding the three events below, NAV per share declined 0.5% Redeemed higher cost debt (1) which reduced overall funding costs by approximately 42 basis points and should contribute approximately $0.02 per share per year to net investment income. The extinguishment of the debt resulted in ($0.03) loss per share during the quarter Subsequent to quarter end, a significant portion of the Company’s first lien secured debt investment in Solarplicity Group Limited was repaid. (2) The repayment reduces non-core assets (3) by approximately $106.4 million to approximately $416 million or 19% of the portfolio, at fair value, reduces PIK income, and reduces average borrower exposure. The Company recorded a $(0.04) loss per share on its investment in Solarplicity Group during the December quarter The Company recorded a $(0.06) loss per share on its oil hedge and a $0.03 unrealized gain per share on its oil and gas investment marks. The oil hedge is designed to protect against a significant decline in the price of oil. The net impact of these two items was a $(0.03) loss per share during the quarter Continued to successfully execute portfolio repositioning strategy, including increasing core assets (4) to 74% of the portfolio as of the end of the quarter, at fair value. Since commencing our repositioning strategy in July 2016, funded approximately $1.1 billion into core strategies (5) Net leverage (6) as of the end of the quarter was 0.62x, compared to 0.59x as of September 30, 2017 providing substantial investment capacity to further execute portfolio repositioning strategy Declared a distribution of $0.15 per share Repurchased 0.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $4.6 million during the quarter and repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of $10.0 million subsequent to quarter end (7)\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apollo Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:AINV) or the “Company,” or “Apollo Investment,” today announced financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s net investment income was $0.16 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.16 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) was $6.60 per share as of December 31, 2017, compared to $6.72 as of September 30, 2017.\nOn February 6, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.15 per share, payable on April 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 27, 2018.\nMr. James Zelter, Apollo Investment’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During the December quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategy by repositioning the portfolio into core assets and reducing our funding costs. The significant drivers of the decline in NAV for the quarter include 1) an unrealized mark-to-market loss our oil hedge which protects us against significant declines in the price of oil, partially offset by gains on our oil investment marks, 2) a realized loss associated with the redemption of higher cost debt which has a payback period of approximately one year, and 3) a loss on our investment in Solarplicity Group, among other factors. We are pleased to announce that subsequent to quarter end, we sold a majority of our investment in Solarplicity Group, a non-core asset that we had been actively seeking to exit, and whose exit we believe greatly enhances the quality of our portfolio and meaningfully reduced our non-core assets.” Mr. Zelter continued, “Additionally, we continued to actively repurchase stock below NAV during the quarter and have continued to do so in the March quarter. Since the inception of the stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately $119 million or 8.5% of shares outstanding through this shareholder friendly initiative.”\n(1) On October 16, 2017, the Company redeemed $150 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2042. The Company recognized a realized loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $(5.8) million or $(0.03) per share during the three months ended December 31, 2017. (2) Subsequent to quarter end, a significant portion of the Company’s first lien secured debt investment in Solarplicity Group Limited was repaid at a price, slightly below the fair value as of December 31, 2017. The repayment reduced the Company’s exposure to Solarplicity Group Limited by approximately $106.4 million, assuming the same currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2017. Based on the fair value mark as of December 31, 2017 and including estimated escrowed amounts, the retained portion of the Company’s investment in Solarplicity Group Limited is approximately $16.4 million. In addition, the Company still holds its investments in Solarplicity UK Holdings Limited, which had a fair value of approximately $7.9 million as of December 31, 2017. (3) Non-core strategies include oil & gas, structured credit, renewables, shipping, and commodities. (4) Core strategies include corporate lending, aviation, life sciences, asset based and lender finance. (5) Excluding aviation. (6) The Company’s net leverage ratio is defined as debt outstanding plus payable for investments purchased, less receivable for investments sold, less cash and cash equivalents, less foreign currencies, divided by net assets. (7) Through February 6, 2018.
