(NASDAQ:PLUS), a leading provider of technology solutions, today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Comment\n“In our third quarter, we achieved solid year-on-year growth in revenue, adjusted gross billings of products and services, and gross profit, due in part to our continued focus on high value solutions that help drive our customers’ IT transformation. The expansion of our cloud solution offerings, including the acquisitions of OneCloud and IDS, has positioned ePlus as a valued partner for our customers’ multi-cloud environments,” stated Mark Marron, president and chief executive officer.. “In addition, security remains a critical customer priority, as our year-to-date sales of security solutions increased at a double-digit rate and accounted for 17.6% of year-to-date adjusted gross billings, up from 16.7% in the same period last year.”\nMr. Marron continued, “Our operating costs were impacted in the quarter by increased acquisition and integration related costs, as the pace of acquisition activity was higher than in prior years. Despite positive trends in revenue and gross profit, we continue to focus on improving our operating metrics while making the necessary investments to capture future marketplace opportunities. We are very focused on expanding our solutions, geographic footprint, and developing upselling and cross-selling programs to capture wallet share with new and existing clients.”\n“We believe our year-to-date gross profit performance reflected a favorable mix of products and services, and a positive contribution from financing activities. Our culture and solution portfolio helps to attract and retain highly-credentialed client-facing sales and services professionals, which in turn allows us to address the complex IT needs of our more than 3,200 enterprise and mid-market customers.\"\nPrior Period Reclassifications due to Stock Split\nReclassifications of prior period amounts related to numbers of shares and per share amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation due to the 2 for 1 stock split completed on March 31, 2017.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nFor the third quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the third quarter of the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2016:\nConsolidated net sales increased 4.9% to $342.6 million, from $326.7 million.\nTechnology segment net sales increased 4.5% to $332.6 million, from $318.3 million.\nAdjusted gross billings of product and services increased 7.3% to $464.1 million. Adjusted gross billings are sales of product and services adjusted to exclude the costs incurred of applicable third-party software assurance, maintenance, and services.\nFinancing segment net sales increased 19.0% to $9.9 million, from $8.4 million.\nConsolidated gross profit rose 3.9% to $76.7 million, from $73.8 million.\nConsolidated operating income decreased 23.1% to $16.4 million, from $21.3 million.\nNet earnings rose 23.5% to $15.6 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 16.9% to $19.3 million, from $23.2 million.\nOur provision for income tax expense was $0.7 million and $19.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $8.7 million and $27.3 million for the same periods in the prior year. Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, was 4.2% and 29.7%, respectively, compared to 40.8% and 40.5% for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. In the third quarter, the Company revised its estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect a change in the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, resulting from legislation that was enacted on December 22, 2017. The rate change is administratively effective at the beginning of our 2018 fiscal year, using a blended rate for the annual period. As a result, the blended U.S. statutory tax rate for the 2018 fiscal year is 31.5%, and our total estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is 37%. As a result, we recognized an estimated tax benefit in our tax provision of $5.7 million for the quarter related to the provisional adjustment our deferred tax balance to reflect the new corporate tax rate as well as adjustment of our tax provision from the beginning of our fiscal year to the new blended rate. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is expected to be approximately 29%.\nDiluted earnings per share was $1.11, compared with $0.91 in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.97, compared with $1.12 last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income and acquisition related amortization expense, net of taxes, the tax (benefit) expense recognized due to the vesting of share based compensation, the tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rates, as well as an adjustment to our tax expense in the prior year assuming a 31.5% effective annual income tax rate for U.S. operations.\nFiscal Year to Date Results\nFor the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the nine months of the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2016:\nConsolidated net sales rose 8.4% to $1,080.6 million, from $996.6 million.\nTechnology segment net sales rose 7.9% to $1,049.5 million, from $972.5 million.\nAdjusted gross billings of product and services increased 10.0% to $1,449.4 million.\nFinancing segment net sales increased 28.7% to $31.1 million, from $24.1 million.\nConsolidated gross profit rose 8.3% to $241.9 million, from $223.4 million.\nConsolidated operating income decreased 1.9% to $65.7 million, from $67.0 million.\nNet earnings rose 15.4% to $46.2 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA rose 0.6% to $72.8 million, from $72.4 million.\nDiluted earnings per share was $3.30, compared with $2.86 in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.14, compared with $3.12 last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income and acquisition related amortization expense, net of taxes, the tax (benefit) expense recognized due to the vesting of share based compensation, the tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rates, as well as an adjustment to our tax expense in the prior year assuming a 31.5% effective annual income tax rate for U.S. operations.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, ePlus had cash and cash equivalents of $76.1 million, compared with $109.8 million as of March 31, 2017. Inventory decreased 45.2% to $51.3 million and current deferred revenue decreased 22.3% to $50.7 million primarily due to the shipment of large projects within the first nine months of the fiscal year. Total stockholders' equity was $383.6 million and total shares outstanding were 14.0 million, compared with $345.9 million and shares outstanding of 14.2 million on March 31, 2017. During the quarter, we purchased 125,605 shares of our outstanding common stock at an average cost of $77.88 per share for a total purchase price of $9.8 million under the current share repurchase program.\nSummary and Outlook\n“Year-to-date results have positioned ePlus for another year of growth across key operating and financial metrics in fiscal 2018. We will continue to focus on scaling those investments that increase our capabilities in emerging technologies, and managing our cost structure.\n“Tax reform provides ePlus the dual benefit of a lower tax rate, yielding additional cash for investment, and additional purchasing power for our clients for the products and services we provide. The organic expansion of our platform and acquisition growth initiatives are key elements of our capital allocation strategy, along with investments to further improve efficiencies across the organization, and our stock buyback program,” concluded Mr. Marron.\nResults of Operations – Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company's operations are conducted through two business segments. The technology segment includes sales of information technology products, third-party software, third-party maintenance contracts, advanced professional services and managed services, and the Company's proprietary software to commercial entities and state and local governments. The financing segment consists of the financing of equipment, software, and related services to commercial entities, state and local governments, and government contractors.\nTechnology Segment\nThe results of operations for the technology segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Sales of product and services $ 330,953 $ 317,391 $ 13,562 4.3 % Fee and other income 1,678 915 763 83.4 % Net sales 332,631 318,306 14,325 4.5 % Cost of sales, product and services 264,487 251,729 12,758 5.1 % Gross profit 68,144 66,577 1,567 2.4 % Selling, general and administrative 53,836 47,780 6,056 12.7 % Depreciation and amortization 2,893 1,908 985 51.6 % Operating expenses 56,729 49,688 7,041 14.2 % Operating income $ 11,415 $ 16,889 $ (5,474 ) (32.4 %) Key Business Metrics Adjusted gross billings, product\nand services $ 464,105 $ 432,407 $ 31,698 7.3 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,308 $ 18,797 $ (4,489 ) (23.9 %) Net sales were $332.6 million, up 4.5% from $318.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted gross billings of products and services grew 7.3% to $464.1 million, from $432.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of an increase in demand for products and services from our customers in the Technology, Financial Services and Healthcare industries, and the acquisitions of Consolidated Communication’s IT services and equipment integration business in December 2016, OneCloud Consulting in May 2017, and IDS in September 2017.\nGross margin on sales of product and services was 20.1%, compared with 20.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in margins was due to lower margins from sales of product partially related to large competitively priced projects, offset by increases in sales of services and a higher proportion of the sales of third party software assurance, maintenance and services.\nOperating expenses rose 14.2% to $56.7 million, from $49.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly attributable to an increase of $4.3 million, or 10.8%, in salaries and benefits due to an increase of 123, or 11.1%, in personnel to 1,236 from 1,113, of which 50 related to the acquisition of IDS in September 2017 and 57 related to the acquisition of OneCloud Consulting in May 2017. The position additions included 107 sales and engineering positions with the remaining additions being administrative hires. The increase in salaries and benefits was also attributable to higher variable compensation as a result of higher gross profit. General administrative expenses increased $1.5 million primarily due to $0.7 million from adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration for acquisitions, higher expenses in travel, advertising and marketing, and additional expenses from recent acquisitions.\nSegment operating income was $11.4 million, compared with $16.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.3 million for the current quarter, compared with $18.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFinancing Segment\nThe results of operations for the financing segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change $ 9,592 $ 8,190 $ 1,402 17.1 % Fee and other income 346 161 185 114.9 % Net sales 9,938 8,351 1,587 19.0 % Direct lease costs 1,394 1,142 252 22.1 % Gross profit 8,544 7,209 1,335 18.5 % Selling, general and administrative 3,298 2,380 918 38.6 % Depreciation and amortization 1 2 (1 ) (50.0 %) Interest and financing costs 270 409 (139 )\n(34.0 %) Operating expenses 3,569 2,791 778 27.9 % Operating income $ 4,975 $ 4,418 $ 557 12.6 % Key Business Metrics Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,976 $ 4,420 $ 556 12.6 % Net sales were $9.9 million, up 19.0% from $8.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, due to increases in post-contract earnings and transactional gains. Post contract earnings increased $1.4 million due to the sale of residual assets associated with terminated leases. Direct lease costs increased $0.3 million or 22.1% over the previous year period due to higher depreciation expense from operating leases.\nOperating expenses increased $0.8 million, or 27.9%, mainly due to higher variable compensation as a result of the increase in gross profit, as well as the changes in reserve for credit losses.\nSegment operating income and adjusted EBITDA both increased to $5.0 million from $4.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nResults of Operations – Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTechnology Segment\nThe results of operations for the technology segment for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nNine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Sales of product and services $ 1,045,792 $ 968,799 $ 76,993 7.9 % Fee and other income 3,707 3,679 28 0.8 % Net sales 1,049,499 972,478 77,021 7.9 % Cost of sales, product and services 834,873 769,780 65,093 8.5 % Gross profit 214,626 202,698 11,928 5.9 % Selling, general and administrative 158,838 141,295 17,543 12.4 % Depreciation and amortization 7,084 5,400 1,684 31.2 % Operating expenses 165,922 146,695 19,227 13.1 % Operating income $ 48,704 $ 56,003 $ (7,299 ) (13.0 %) Key Business Metrics Adjusted gross billings, product\nand services $ 1,449,371 $ 1,317,188 $ 132,183 10.0 % Adjusted EBITDA\n$ 55,788 $ 61,403 $ (5,615 ) (9.1 %) Net sales rose 7.9% to $1,049.5 million, from $972.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted gross billings grew 10.0% to $1,449.4 million, from $1,317.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The increase in net sales and adjusted gross billings of products and services was a result of an increase in demand for products and services from our customer in the technology, financial and healthcare sectors, and the acquisitions of Consolidated Communication’s IT services and equipment integration business in December 2016, OneCloud Consulting in May 2017, and IDS in September 2017.\nGross margin on sales of product and services was 20.2%, compared with 20.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin was due to lower margins from sales of product primarily related to a large competitively bid project, most of which was delivered in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018, partially offset by increases in sales of services and a higher proportion of the sales of third party software assurance, maintenance and services.\nOperating expenses rose 13.1% to $165.9 million, from $146.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, reflecting increased salaries and benefits due to increased variable compensation and an 11.1% increase in personnel to 1,236 from 1,113. Also contributing to the increase in salaries and benefits was higher healthcare cost. General and administrative expenses increased $3.9 million primarily due to higher expenses in advertising and marketing, travel, and communications, as well as the incremental expenses from contingent consideration for acquisitions, and additional expenses from recent acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.7 million due to the acquisitions. Professional and other fees also increased $0.9 million or 20.7%, due to legal fees related to the acquisitions of IDS and OneCloud Consulting.\nSegment operating income was $48.7 million, compared with $56.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $55.8 million, compared with $61.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company maintained its balanced portfolio of customer-end markets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION We included reconciliations below for the following non-GAAP information: (i) Adjusted Gross Billings of Product and Services, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA, (iii) Segment Adjusted EBITDA, and (iv) non-GAAP Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted. We define adjusted gross billings of product and services as our sales of product and services calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude the costs incurred related to sales of third-party software assurance, maintenance and services. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for the following: interest expense, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes, and other income. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for interest expense, and depreciation and amortization. We consider the interest on notes payable from our financing segment and depreciation expense presented within cost of sales, which includes depreciation on assets financed as operating leases, to be operating expenses. Non-GAAP net earnings per common share are based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income and acquisition related amortization expense, and related effects on income taxes, the tax (benefit) expense recognized due to the vesting of share based compensation, the tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rates, as well as an adjustment to our tax expense in the prior year assuming a 31.5% effective annual income tax rate for U.S. operations.\nOur use of non-GAAP information as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate similar non-GAAP Adjusted Gross Billings, Adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Sales of product and services $ 330,953 $ 317,391 $ 1,045,792 $ 968,799 Costs incurred related to sales of third party software assurance, maintenance and services\n133,152\n115,016\n403,579\n348,389 Adjusted gross billings of product and services $ 464,105 $ 432,407 $ 1,449,371 $ 1,317,188\nThree Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Consolidated Net earnings $ 15,581 $ 12,620 $ 46,225 $ 40,066 Provision for income taxes 678 8,687 19,499 27,310 Depreciation and amortization [1] 2,894 1,910 7,086 5,408 Other (income) expense [2] 131 - 1 (380 ) Adjusted EBITDA $\n19,284\n$ 23,217 $ 72,811 $ 72,404 Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Technology Segment Operating income $ 11,415 $ 16,889 $ 48,704 $ 56,003 Depreciation and amortization [1] 2,893 1,908 7,084 5,400 Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,308 $ 18,797 $ 55,788 $ 61,403 Financing Segment Operating income $ 4,975 $ 4,418 $ 17,021 $ 10,993 Depreciation and amortization [1] 1 2 2\n8 Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,976 $ 4,420 $ 17,023 $ 11,001\nThree Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands, except per share data) GAAP: Earnings before provision for income taxes $ 16,259 $ 21,307 $ 65,724 $ 67,376 Acquisition related amortization expense [3] 1,871 1,035 4,178 3,098 Other (income) expense [2] 131 - 1 (380 ) Non-GAAP: Earnings before provision for income taxes 18,261 22,342 69,903 70,094 GAAP: Provision for income taxes 678 8,687 19,499 27,310 Acquisition related amortization expense 547 267 1,421 956 Other (income) expense 55 13 - (144 ) Remeasurement of deferred taxes [4] 3,407 - 3,407 - Adjustment to FY17 U.S. federal tax rate to 31.5% [5] - (2,252 ) - (2,252 ) Tax benefit on restricted stock - 6 1,563 514 Non-GAAP: Provision for income taxes 4,687 6,721 25,890 26,384 Non-GAAP: Net earnings $ 13,573 $ 15,621 $ 44,012 $ 43,710 GAAP: Net earnings per common share – diluted $ 1.11 $ 0.91 $ 3.30 $ 2.86 Non-GAAP: Net earnings per common share – diluted $ 0.97 $ 1.12 $ 3.14 $ 3.12\n[1] Amount consists of depreciation and amortization for assets used internally.
