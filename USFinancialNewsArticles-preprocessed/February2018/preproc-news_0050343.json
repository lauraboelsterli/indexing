    "text": "Published: Feb 25, 2018 4:35 p.m. ET Share \n‘Tense’ phone call last week between Trump, Peña Nieto AFP/Getty Images Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto speaks in December. \nBy Santiago Pérez Peter Nicholas \nMEXICO CITY — Plans for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexico’s Enrique Peña Nieto have been shelved for the second time in a year over disagreements about the funding of a border wall, Trump administration officials confirmed Sunday. \nThe border wall has been a key issue for Trump since he began campaigning for the U.S. presidency but has strained relations between the two countries and enraged Mexicans. \nTrump and Peña Nieto took part in a “tense” phone call lasting nearly an hour Tuesday that culminated in what U.S. officials contend was a mutual decision to put off a meeting at the White House. \nThings got difficult as Trump was “exasperated” at Peña Nieto’s insistence that Trump steer clear of talking about his campaign vow that Mexico will pay for construction of the border wall, according to senior U.S. and Mexican officials.",
