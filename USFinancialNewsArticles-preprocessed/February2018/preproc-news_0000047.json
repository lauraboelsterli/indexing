    "text": "SADORUS, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Less than a year after acquiring the Village of Sadorus water system, Illinois American Water is investing approximately $1.2 million to upgrade Sadorus’ water distribution system. The project, which is currently under design, includes installing about three miles of water main to connect Sadorus to Illinois American Water’s Champaign County water distribution system.\nAccording to Dave Farrar, senior manager of field operations and production, “When Sadorus entrusted us with its water system, we made a commitment to provide the Village with the best product possible. This investment will enhance water quality and improve the taste and odor of drinking water.”\nIllinois American Water plans to start installing the new water main in early March. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the project should be completed by the end of the summer.\nIllinois American Water acquired the Village of Sadorus water system at the end of March 2017. The Village of Sadorus Board voted in favor of the sale in April 2016 and the Illinois Commerce Commission approved the sale for $240,000 on Feb. 1, 2017.\nFuture investment projects in Sadorus will include upgrading undersized, outdated water mains. New fire hydrants will also be installed to enhance fire protection.\nAbout Illinois American Water\nIllinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and/or wastewater services to approximately 1.3 million people.
