    "text": "WHEN: TODAY, WEDNESDAY, February 28, 2018\nWHERE: CNBC'S \"SQUAWK BOX\"\nFollowing are excerpts from the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with Founder and CEO of Invemed Associates and Co-Founder of Home Depot Ken Langone today on CNBC's \"Sqauwk Box.\" Following are links to the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/02/28/ge-is-a-colossal-failure-in-governance-says-former-board-member.html?play=1 and https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/02/28/like-it-or-not-tax-cuts-will-help-growth-says-home-depot-co-founder.html?play=1 .\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\nLANGONE GE'S JEFF IMMELT\nTHE THING I AM REALLY ANGRY ABOUT TO SAY THAT GE WAS TRANSFORMED IS TO SAY THAT THE WORD TRANSFORM IS A SYNONYM FOR DESTRUCTION.\nLANGONE ON GENERAL ELECTRIC\nGE TO ME IS A COLOSSAL FAILURE IN GOVERNANCE.. I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW AND I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS HERE'S A CASE WHERE I THINK AN ACTIVIST IS GOING TO MAKE A HUGE HUGE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT ALL HAS TO COME OUT.\nLANGONE ON THE TAX CUT\nIT'S GOING TO HELP GROWTH. LIKE IT OR NOT, ITS GOING TO HELP GROWTH…HOME DEPOT AND LOWES, TOO, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE, THEY WERE SHARING THE GOODIES. WE'RE SHARING THEM. AND WE DID IT QUICK.\nLANGONE ON JEROME POWELL\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE LASTING IMPRESSIONS. I, FRANKLY, WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE GUY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME THAT KNOW THIS - WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT BETTER THAN ME - WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY WHAT HE DID.\nLANGONE ON WHETHER PALANTIR WILL GO PUBLIC\nI DONT KNOW. FRANKLY, IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS, I WOULD WISH THEY WOULDN'T I THINK WHAT THEY DO, AND THE WAY THEY DO IT, AND THE MIND SET ON THE FUTURE, I DONT KNOW IF THE PUBLIC COULD ACCOMMODATE THAT.\nLANGONE ON DICKS SPORTING GOODS\nWHAT DICK'S DID TODAY WAS RIGHT FOR TWO REASONS. IT WAS THE RIGHT THING, BUT I CANT NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD OVERALL FOR PEOPLE FEELING GOOD ABOUT DICK'S AND WANTING TO GO INTO THEIR STORES. YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PEOPLE FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHERE THEY SPEND MONEY.",
