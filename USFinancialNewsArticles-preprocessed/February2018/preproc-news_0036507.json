    "text": "C.J. Miles’ four-point play ignited a game-swinging, second-quarter run Wednesday night as the Toronto Raptors rallied from an early deficit to blitz the Chicago Bulls 122-98 in Chicago in both teams’ final game before the All-Star break.\nSerge Ibaka and Kyle Lowry scored 20 points apiece to lead the Raptors, who completed a 4-0 season-series sweep of the Bulls with a seventh straight win.\nThe Raptors go into the break with a 41-16 record, best in the Eastern Conference.\nBobby Portis came off the bench to total 18 points for the Bulls, who have alternated losses and wins in their last five games, dropping three of five.\nSeeking a third win in a stretch of four straight home games, Chicago led by as many as eight points in the first quarter.\nToronto closed within 33-27 by period’s end, then took command for good shortly after Miles’ rare four-point play got them within 36-33 in the second minute of the second period.\nPascal Siakam (eight) and Jakob Poeltl (six) combined for 14 points as the Raptors outscored the Bulls 34-16 in the second quarter to go up 61-49 at halftime.\nToronto pulled away throughout the second half for their most one-sided win over the Bulls this season after having won the first three meetings by seven, five and nine points.\nLowry registered a game-high 10 assists to complement his 20 points and seven rebounds for the Raptors, who shot 52.2 percent from the field.\nSiakam finished with 17 points, Jonas Valanciunas 14, Fred VanVleet 11 and Poeltl 10 for Toronto. Valanciunas narrowly missed a double-double with a game-high nine rebounds.\nPortis hit eight of his 14 shots en route to his team-high point total for the Bulls, who shot just 42.9 percent.\nLauri Markkanen had 14 points, Zach LaVine 11 and Robin Lopez 10 for Chicago, which misfired on 20 of its 24 3-point attempts.\nLed by Lowry, who connected four times from long range, the Raptors outscored the Bulls 42-12 on 3-pointers.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
