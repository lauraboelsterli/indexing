    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ardelyx, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARDX) today announced that Jeremy Caldwell, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, will be leaving the company, effective February 16, 2018, to pursue a position as chief executive officer of an early stage biotech start-up company based in San Diego.\n\"Jeremy has been a tremendous asset to Ardelyx, and I am incredibily grateful for his many contributions to the company and our programs over the years,\" said Mike Raab, president and chief executive officer of Ardelyx. \"Jeremy has been instrumental in building our propriety platform, leading drug discovery efforts, like our RDX013 potassium secretagogue program, and supporting the development of tenapanor to where it is today. Our team will continue Jeremy's legacy as we work to bring important medicines to patients who need them. We will miss Jeremy's presence and the value that he has consistently contributed to our entire team. We wish him much success in this important new opportunity.\"\n\"My time with Ardelyx has been extremely rewarding, and I'm proud of the many accomplishments of this team,\" said Jeremy. \"Since joining in 2014, we have brought forward several first-in-class programs, culminating in the first New Drug Application for tenapanor for IBS-C planned for submission in the second half of the year. I believe that tenapanor will play a critical role in treating both hyperphosphatemia and IBS-C in the future. I'm proud of what we've discovered with the RDX013 program, as it represents an entirely new approach to treating hyperkalemia. I look forward to watching these program progress, and want to thank everyone at Ardelyx for helping me reach this next stage in my career.\"\nAbout Ardelyx, Inc.\nArdelyx is focused on enhancing the way people with cardiorenal diseases are treated by developing differentiated, minimally systemic medicines. Ardelyx's cardiorenal pipeline includes the Phase 3 development of tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in people with end-stage renal disease who are on dialysis and RDX013, a potassium secretagogue program for the potential treatment of hyperkalemia. In addition to its cardiorenal pipeline, Ardelyx has completed Phase 3 development of tenapanor for the treatment of people with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and anticipates submitting a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication in the second half of 2018. To efficiently bring its treatments to market, Ardelyx is pursing strategic collaborations in the U.S. and beyond, with established agreements with Fosun Pharma in China and Kyowa Hakko Kirin in Japan.
