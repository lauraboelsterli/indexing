    "text": "Playing their first game with the roster they planned on icing when the season started, the Nashville Predators dominated the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday night in a 5-0 win at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn.\nFilip Forsberg returned from an 11-game stint on injured reserve to score one of Nashville’s three first-period goals, and Craig Smith, Calle Jarnkrok, Colton Sissons and Viktor Arvidsson also contributed goals. Pekka Rinne stopped 19 shots for his fifth shutout of the season.\nFor Los Angeles, it was a 180-degree turnaround from its 3-0 drilling of the Dallas Stars on Tuesday night. The Kings looked a step slow throughout and didn’t do much to help goalie Jonathan Quick, who was activated off injured reserve and stopped 31 of 36 shots.\nLos Angeles found penalty trouble just before the midway point of the first period, and the Predators, who possess one of the league’s best power plays, capitalized. Smith pounced on the rebound of Ryan Johansen’s slapper, chipping the puck over Quick at 10:02 for his 16th goal.\nForsberg, who has scored 23 goals in the last two Februarys, picked up where he left off at 16:02 with Nashville on a five-on-three man advantage. Kevin Fiala banked a pass off the boards behind the net, and Forsberg’s wrister caromed off Quick and into the net’s short side for his 16th marker.\nA failed clearing attempt at 17:21 teed up Jarnkrok for a 3-0 lead. Jarnkrok intercepted the puck at the right post and swatted at it three times. The third attempt trickled in off Quick’s pad for Jarnkrok’s 11th tally.\nSissons made it 4-0 at 11:01 of the second period. Miikka Salomaki took the puck from Jake Muzzin behind the net and fed Sissons in the slot. Sissons shoveled a wrister under Quick for his first goal in 29 games and fourth of the season.\nArvidsson capped the scoring at 9:44 of the third period with his 16th goal, collecting a rebound between the left circle and goal line and zipping a wrister over the goal line. The play was ruled no goal originally but reversed upon replay review.\nJohansen finished with three assists.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
