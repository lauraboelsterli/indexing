    "text": "SEATTLE and NEW YORK and SAN FRANCISCO and LONDON, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PitchBook , the premier data provider for the private and public equity markets, today announced the appointment of Amy Whaley as VP of People (HR). Leaving her decade-long post as SVP of People Services at Marchex, Inc., Whaley brings more than 20 years of HR experience to support PitchBook's fast growth. Over the last year, PitchBook's global headcount grew by 20% and the company has plans to match that in 2018. To help manage PitchBook's aggressive growth goals, Whaley will oversee all aspects of HR for the growing business, including total rewards, employee relations, talent development, recruiting, culture and employment-related compliance and services.\n\"I've always said, the best thing about PitchBook is the people. Over the last ten years we've worked hard to cultivate a company culture that is fun, inclusive and built around achieving excellence for our customers,\" said John Gabbert, founder and CEO of PitchBook. \"As we continue to expand globally, it's important we focus on the right processes and organizational structure to maintain our unique culture. Amy brings a wealth of experience and will play a key role in taking PitchBook to the next level.\"\nWhaley started her 20-year career in HR as a manager at Fox Communications, local provider of telecommunications and Internet solutions, where she was tasked with launching the HR department for the company's spin-off, Who's Calling, Inc. In this role, Whaley built HR programs from the ground up, which played a key role in earning the company accolades such as, Top 100 Fastest Growing Companies by Puget Sound Business Journal as well as one of the Top Ten Best Company to work for by Washington CEO Magazine. Whaley was also a partner at consulting firm, Inside Results, where she helped organizations align HR systems and practices with company values through leadership coaching and HR team consulting. She joined Marchex in 2007 as the top HR executive, managing all aspects of HR for more than 10 years. At PitchBook, Whaley will be responsible for overseeing all HR activities and strategizing ways to further anchor PitchBook's profitable business operations.\n\"My entire career has been rooted in developing and overseeing HR programs for growing tech companies, so when I came across this opportunity at a fast-growth company like PitchBook, I had to jump at it,\" said Whaley. \"PitchBook is at a unique growth inflection point, making this role as VP of People an opportunity to be part of something truly meaningful. In the short time I've been part of the company, I've been thoroughly impressed by the incredibly talented and motivated individuals that make up the PitchBook team. I'm eager to become engrained in this exceptional culture.\"\nFor more information about career opportunities at PitchBook, click here.\nAbout PitchBook\nPitchBook is a financial data and software company that provides transparency into the capital markets to help professionals discover and execute opportunities with confidence and efficiency.
