    "text": "TEMPE, Ariz., VirTra, Inc . (OTCQX:VTSI), a global provider of training simulators for the law enforcement, military, educational and commercial markets, today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has filed a request with FINRA to authorize a 1-for-2 reverse split of its common stock as part of the Company’s efforts to qualify for and complete an uplist to The NASDAQ Capital Market. In connection with the anticipated move to The NASDAQ Capital Market, we will register VirTra’s common shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and VirTra will thereafter be subject to all the reporting obligations of a public reporting company. With the successful implementation of the reverse stock split, and provided that the Company's common stock meets the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement, the Company believes it will meet all requirements for listing VirTra’s common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market and will thereafter move as quickly as possible to secure an uplisting. Despite these steps being taken by VirTra there can be no assurance that the Company's application for listing will be approved.\nIn the reverse stock split, every two shares of issued and outstanding common stock will be converted into one share of new common stock, with all fractional shares being rounded up to the nearest whole share. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of issued and outstanding common stock from approximately 15.85 million pre-split shares to approximately 7.9 million post-split shares. Proportional adjustments will be made to VirTra's outstanding stock options. Upon completion of the 1-for-2 reverse split each stockholder's percentage ownership interest in VirTra, and the proportional voting power, will remain unchanged. In addition, the rights and privileges of the holders of VirTra common stock are unaffected by the reverse stock split. VirTra has requested that the reverse stock split become effective as of 5 p.m. ET on February 26, 2018, and accordingly the Company's common stock is expected to begin trading on a post-split basis under the symbol \"VTSID\" at the open of trading on Thursday, March 1, 2018. The Company's common stock will also be identified under a new CUSIP number (92827K 301). Before any listing of the common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market could occur, NASDAQ will need to approve the Company's application for listing. There can be no assurance that the Company's application for listing will be approved.\n“The Board of Directors firmly believes in the value that a listing on NASDAQ brings to the shareholders of VirTra, and we are confident that listing on a national securities exchange will be beneficial to our future,” commented Bob Ferris, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VirTra. “Having a track record of successfully completing high-tech simulator projects in increasingly larger numbers, we are now in a position to be considered as a potential supplier to larger municipalities, both within the United States and around the world. We believe that the transparency and marketability of attaining a national exchange listing will be an important factor for some customers. In addition, a national listing is also expected to improve liquidity for our shareholders and provide us the opportunity to reach an even larger audience of investors. In connection with the uplisting process, we expect to become an SEC registered company in the United States and for VirTra and its shareholders this will be another significant milestone to be achieved.”\nAbout VirTra\nVirTra is a global provider of training simulators for the law enforcement, military, educational and commercial markets.
