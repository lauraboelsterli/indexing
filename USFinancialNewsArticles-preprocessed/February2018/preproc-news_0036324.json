    "text": "Company Delivers Full-Year 2017 Revenue Growth\nDigital Revenues Grow to 32% of Total Revenue\nMCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) (\"Gannett\" or \"company\" or \"we\" or \"our\") today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017. Our full-year 2017 results include 53 weeks as compared to 52 weeks in 2016, with the extra week impacting the fourth quarter. For comparability purposes, our same store revenue comparisons exclude the 53rd week.\n\"We are pleased with our financial results for the full-year 2017. Digital revenues grew to $1.0 billion and now comprise 31.6% of total revenues, evidence that our transformation to a next-generation media company is well underway,\" said Robert J. Dickey, president and chief executive officer. \"Additionally, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth and flat Adjusted EBITDA, despite continued secular pressures in print advertising and circulation.\"\nDickey continued, \"In the fourth quarter, we improved Adjusted EBITDA, despite a more challenging print advertising environment than expected. Strong profitability gains in our ReachLocal segment and solid overall cost management offset print revenue pressures. Looking ahead to 2018, we remain focused on growing our marketing solutions and consumer businesses, while driving additional operating efficiencies.\"\n\"We are excited by the momentum in the ReachLocal North America business, especially with the newly migrated Gannett clients,” said Sharon Rowlands, president of USA TODAY NETWORK Marketing Solutions and chief executive officer of ReachLocal. \"There is a tremendous opportunity to increase penetration across our local markets by growing both new digital marketing services customers and wallet share. In 2018, we plan to capitalize on this significant opportunity with our newly aligned sales organization, which we expect will drive revenue growth and margin improvement.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Consolidated Results\nOperating revenues were $854.2 million, including approximately $49.1 million from the 53rd week, compared to $867.0 million in the prior year quarter. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates benefited revenues by $4.2 million. Same store operating revenues declined 8.8%, an improvement compared to a decline of 9.4% in the third quarter of 2017, due to our strategic subscriber pricing initiatives and the inclusion of a full quarter of ReachLocal revenue in our same store calculation. Total digital revenues increased to $272.3 million, or approximately 31.9% of total revenue. GAAP net losses were $13.6 million, including a $42.8 million tax expense from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and $27.6 million of after-tax restructuring, asset impairment charges and other costs. The effective tax rate was impacted by one-time items related to the reduction in deferred tax assets that resulted from the decrease in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and valuation allowances recorded on certain deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter without charges related to our deferred tax assets and other adjustments was 25.7%. Adjusted EBITDA (1) totaled $132.7 million compared to $129.8 million in the prior year quarter with a 50 basis point margin improvement year-over-year; the 53rd week contributed approximately $3.6 million in Adjusted EBITDA.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Publishing Segment\nPublishing segment operating revenues were $764.8 million compared to $790.5 million in the prior year quarter. Same store publishing segment operating revenues declined 10.0% year-over-year. Same store print advertising revenues declined 18.5% year-over-year, consistent with the 18.7% decline in the third quarter of 2017. Same store circulation revenues fell 6.7% from the prior year quarter compared to a 7.6% decline in the third quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting the positive impact from our subscriber pricing strategies. Digital-only subscriber volumes grew 49.5% year-over-year and now total approximately 341,000. Digital advertising revenues increased 7.3% to $118.9 million compared to the prior year quarter. Same store digital revenues increased 0.7% with growth in areas such as digital marketing services, audience extension, mobile and branded content, offset in part by weaknesses in digital classified and local desktop display. Publishing segment Adjusted EBITDA was $149.2 million compared to $145.9 million in the prior year quarter reflecting continued operational efficiencies.\nFourth Quarter 2017 ReachLocal Segment\nOperating revenues were $101.4 million, a 34.9% increase compared to the prior year quarter; excluding the 53rd week, the increase was approximately 25.6%. The increase was attributable to continued solid growth in North America and the migration of Gannett clients onto the ReachLocal platform. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.0 million, representing a 6.9% margin, up from the 5.6% margin in the third quarter. Improved profitability in the quarter was driven by solid growth in average revenue per client due to more successful cross-selling and the continued ramp up of Gannett clients on the ReachLocal platform.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Cash Flow\nNet cash flow from operating activities was approximately $72.8 million compared to $47.6 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $25.4 million, primarily for product development, technology investments, and maintenance projects. The company paid dividends of $17.9 million; there were no share repurchases. The company had a cash balance of $120.6 million and a balance on its revolving line of credit of $355.0 million, or net debt of $234.4 million. Long-term pension liabilities totaled $421.9 million at year end, down $256.1 million from the end of the third quarter 2017 primarily due to strong asset returns during 2017.\nSubsequent Event\nOn February 5th, we closed on the sale of one of two parcels of property in downtown Nashville, generating net proceeds of approximately $38 million. The second parcel is planned to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an additional $6 million. We have entered into a leaseback for the next 15 months. As a result of the sale, plus additional cash generated during the first quarter, we have paid down an additional $50 million on our revolver in the first quarter, resulting in a revolver balance of $305 million.\nOutlook\nFor 2018, the company expects the following:\nConsolidated revenues of $2.930-3.030 billion. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $330-340 million. The slight margin compression reflects rising newsprint prices, our continued transformation to digital and a contribution to our charitable foundation. Capital expenditures of $65-75 million, excluding real estate projects. Depreciation and amortization of $140-150 million, excluding accelerated depreciation related to facility consolidations. The non-operating cost associated with our pension plans, recorded in other non-operating items, is currently estimated to be a credit of $5-10 million as compared to an expense of $21 million in 2017. An effective tax rate between 25% and 27%.\nWe will be moving our reporting calendar to the Gregorian calendar in 2018 as compared to our 5-4-4 reporting calendar in 2017. From a quarterly perspective, this change will impact our traditional print operations as we will lose one Sunday in the first quarter of 2018 and gain one Sunday in the third quarter. As Sundays are our most profitable days, this change will reduce our first quarter margin and benefit our third quarter margin. Additionally, we expect softer revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as our sales transition is implemented but do anticipate trend improvement in total advertising revenues and Adjusted EBITDA margins as we progress throughout the year.\n1 The company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before income taxes, interest expense, equity income, other non-operating items, restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, asset impairment charges, depreciation, amortization and other items. Because of the variability of these and other items as well as the impact of future events on these items, management is unable to reconcile without unreasonable effort the company's forecasted range of adjusted EBITDA for the full year to a comparable GAAP range. * * * *\nConference Call Information\nThe company will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss its fourth quarter results.

Specifically, this guidance requires entities to classify the service cost component of the net benefit cost in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs while all other components of net benefit cost must be presented as non-operating items. The guidance further requires such classification changes to be retrospectively applied beginning in the interim period in which the guidance is adopted. As a result of adopting this guidance, in the fourth quarter and year ended December 25, 2016, operating income and other non-operating expenses increased $2.8 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Net income, retained earnings, and earnings per share remained unchanged. ** The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 includes incremental tax expense of $42.8 million as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017 and tax expense of $7.7 million related to the revaluation of a deferred tax asset associated with a deferred intercompany transaction. Further, the tax provision for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 is partially offset by a benefit of $0.9 million and $21.0 million, respectively, related to a worthless stock and debt deduction for one of our ReachLocal international subsidiaries.

These non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\nThe company defines its non-GAAP measures as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that the company believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of our business. The company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before (1) income taxes, (2) interest expense, (3) equity income, (4) other non-operating items, (5) restructuring costs, (6) acquisition-related expenses (including certain integration expenses), (7) asset impairment charges, (8) other items (including certain business transformation costs, litigation expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawals, and gains or losses on certain investments), (9) depreciation, and (10) amortization. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that the company uses for calculating adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\"). Adjusted net income is defined as net income before the adjustments we apply in calculating adjusted EPS, as described below. We believe presenting adjusted net income is useful to enable investors to understand how we calculate adjusted EPS, which provides a useful view of the overall operation of the company's business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that the company believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of our business. The company defines adjusted EPS as EPS before tax-effected (1) restructuring costs, (2) asset impairment charges, (3) acquisition-related expenses (including certain integration expenses), (4) non-operating (gains) losses, and (5) other items (including certain business transformation expenses, litigation expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawals and gains or losses on certain investments). The tax impact on these non-GAAP tax deductible adjustments is based on the estimated statutory tax rates for the United Kingdom of 19.25% and the United States of 38.7%. In addition, tax is adjusted for the impact of non-deductible acquisition costs, a tax benefit related to a worthless stock and debt deduction, tax expense associated with new tax rates in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and revaluation of a deferred tax asset associated with a deferred intercompany transaction. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is diluted EPS. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that adjusts our reported GAAP results for items that we believe are critical to the ongoing success of our business. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities as reported on the statement of cash flows less capital expenditures, which results in a figure representing free cash flow available for use in operations, additional investments, debt obligations, and returns to shareholders.
