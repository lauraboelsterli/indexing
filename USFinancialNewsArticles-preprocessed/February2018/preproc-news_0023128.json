    "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria has handed over its findings on suspect money flows related to its 2003 purchase of Airbus Eurofighter jets to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Austrian defense ministry said in a statement on Monday.\nThe ministry said it had handed over the documents around two months ago.\n“Foreign authorities were informed about the results of the defense ministry’s investigation in the context of the international fight against corruption. The Department of Justice has also been informed,” it said.\nProsecutors in Germany have also been investigating whether Airbus issued bribes to win the $2 billion contract. Airbus denies the charges.\nOn Friday, German prosecutors ordered Airbus to pay 81 million euros ($99 million) to settle the German investigation.\nAustria is seeking up to 1.1 billion euros in compensation.\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; Writing by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Victoria Bryan\n ",
