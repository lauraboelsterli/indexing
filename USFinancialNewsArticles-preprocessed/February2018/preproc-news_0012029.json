    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Andrews & Springer LLC , a boutique securities class action law firm focused on representing shareholders nationwide, is investigating potential breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Board of Directors of La Quinta Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LQ) (“La Quinta” or the “Company”) relating to the sale of the Company to Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham”). On January 18, 2018, the two parties announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Wyndham will acquire La Quinta in a merger worth $1.95 billion. As a result of the merger, La Quinta’s shareholders are only anticipated to receive $8.40 per share in cash in exchange for each share of La Quinta.\nAndrews & Springer's investigation so far has revealed that the consideration La Quinta’s shareholders are expected to receive is inadequate. An analyst at Wells Fargo who follows the Company has already described the deal consideration as “slightly lower than our expectation.” Our investigation has also revealed that the process leading up to the announcement of the merger appears to have significant conflicts of interest thus making the process and consideration unfair.\nIf you own shares of La Quinta and want to receive additional information and protect your investments free of charge, please visit us at http://www.andrewsspringer.com/cases-investigations/la-quinta-class-action-investigation/ or contact Craig J.
