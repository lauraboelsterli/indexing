    "text": "UNIONDALE, N.Y., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flushing Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:FFIC), the parent holding company for Flushing Bank (the “Bank”), today announced that the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has authorized the purchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock. Stock will be purchased from time to time, in the open market or through private transactions, subject to market conditions. There is no expiration or maximum dollar amount under this authorization. The Company will complete the purchase of the 124,713 shares remaining from its previous purchase authorization prior to purchasing shares under this authorization.\nAs previously announced on January 22, 2018, the Company has planned for an 11% quarterly dividend increase for 2018. The Company announced today that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $0.20 per common share, payable on March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2018.\nJohn R. Buran, Flushing Financial’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “Our strong financial performance and capital position, as well as our confidence in the opportunities for future growth, underlie our belief that our shares are a good value in today’s marketplace and that the repurchase of our shares represents an attractive investment opportunity that will benefit the Company and our shareholders. While the timing and amount of future share repurchases will depend on market conditions and the attractiveness of alternative capital investments, this action confirms a continuing commitment to utilize share repurchases as one approach for enhancing shareholder value. In addition to the share repurchase, as we strive to enhance our continuing efforts to increase total shareholder return, the Board approved an 11% increase of the dividend. The Board will continue to review further dividend payments on a quarterly basis.”\nFLUSHING FINANCIAL CORPORATION (Nasdaq:FFIC) is the holding company for Flushing Bank®, a New York State-chartered commercial bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
