Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “strategies,” “prospects,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans,” “may increase,” “may fluctuate,” and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “should,” “would,” “may” and “could” are generally forward looking in nature and not historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations as a result of many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the actual level of commercial vehicle production in our end markets, adverse developments in the business of our key customers, pricing changes to our supplies or products, our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or our acquired businesses not performing as planned, our ability to mitigate any tax risks, including, but not limited to, those risks associated with changes in legislation, tax audits and the loss of the benefits associated with our tax rulings and incentives in certain jurisdictions and the risk that we may need to increase our provisional charge relating to the transition tax under U.S. tax law, and the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section and the “Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements” section of WABCO’s Form 10-K, as well as in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements” section of WABCO’s Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports. WABCO does not undertake any obligation to update such . All market and industry data are based on company estimates.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo facilitate the understanding of Q4 and full year 2017 results, several tables follow this news release. Sales, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income, which are adjusted to exclude the effects of foreign exchange, as well as EBIT, are non-GAAP financial measures and are denoted by the word “adjusted” in the line item. Additionally, gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, EBIT, tax rate, pre-tax income attributable to the company, net income attributable to the company, and net income attributable to the company per diluted share on a “performance basis” are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude items for separation, streamlining and acquisition, discrete and one-time tax items, and other items that management believes may mask the underlying operating results of the company, as applicable. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies as not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures is useful to shareholders because it enhances their understanding of how management assesses the operating performance of the company's business. Certain non-GAAP measures may be used, in part, to determine incentive compensation for current employees.\nWABCO Financial Attachment\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Data Supplement Sheet Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Data Supplement Sheet Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for Full Year 2018 Guidance\nWABCO media, investors and analysts contact\nSean Deason, +1 248 270 9287, investorrelations@wabco-auto.com\nWABCO HOLDINGS INC.
