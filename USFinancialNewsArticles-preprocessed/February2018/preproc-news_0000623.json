    "text": "Police shortage impact on Houston 2 Hours Ago Houston, Texas is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. But based on its population size, the department is short as many as 2,000 officers. The city’s chief says it’s about the same size as Chicago, which has close to 13,000 officers to its 5,100. The budgetary constraints put on the city have prevented it from proper staffing for years. We talk recruiting, staffing challenges and how recent police-involved shootings and violence have impacted interest in joining the force.",
