Britain’s biggest retailer said profit for the full 2017-18 year would be slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations and confirmed it would pay a final dividend. It also said Booker boss Charles Wilson would stay on and run its entire UK business once it completes the 3.7 billion pound takeover of the wholesaler.\nRyanair fell 1.7 percent. The airline posted a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit but warned of possible further disruption by pilots and said it was not optimistic about average fares in European short-haul in the summer.
