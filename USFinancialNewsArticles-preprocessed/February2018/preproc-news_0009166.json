    "text": "study@ (Recasts, adds cost of study, American Cancer Society comment, background)\nFeb 2 (Reuters) - Male rats exposed to very high levels of the kind of radiation emitted by cellphones developed tumors in the tissues around their hearts, according to a draft report by U.S. government researchers on the potential health risks of the devices.\nFemale rats and mice exposed in the same way did not develop tumors, according to the preliminary report from the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), a part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nThe findings add to years of research meant to help settle the debate over whether cellphone radiation is harmful.\nHowever, NTP scientists and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were quick to say the findings could not be extrapolated to humans and that current safety limits on cellphone radiation are protective.\nThe 10-year, $25 million studies - the most comprehensive assessments of health effects and exposure to radiofrequency radiation in rats and mice to date - do raise new questions about exposure to the ubiquitous devices.\nJohn Bucher, a senior scientist with NTP, said the tumors seen in the studies are \"similar to tumors previously reported in some studies of frequent cellphone users.\"\nDr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, noted that the studies were negative for common tumors.\nThese draft reports are bound to create a lot of concern, but in fact they wont change what I tell people: the evidence for an association between cellphones and cancer is weak, and so far, we have not seen a higher cancer risk in people,\" he said in a statement on Twitter.\nBrawley said if cellphone users are concerned about this data in animals they should wear an earpiece.\nUnlike ionizing radiation such as that from gamma rays, radon and X-rays, which can break chemical bonds in the body and are known to cause cancer, radiofrequency devices such as cellphones and microwaves emit radiofrequency energy, a form of non-ionizing radiation.\nThe concern with this type of radiation is that it produces energy in the form of heat, and frequent exposure against the skin could alter brain cell activity, as some studies have suggested.\nIn the NTP study, rats and mice were exposed to higher levels of radiation for longer periods of time than what people experience with even the highest level of cellphone use, and their entire bodies were exposed all at once, according to the draft report.\nCellphones typically emit lower levels of radiation than maximum levels allowed, the draft report said.\nNTP, a part of the National Institutes of Health, will hold an external expert review of its complete findings from these rodent studies on March 26-28.\nDr. Jeffrey Shuren, head of the FDA's radiological health division, said there is not enough evidence to say cellphone use poses health risks to people.\n\"Even with frequent daily use by the vast majority of adults, we have not seen an increase in events like brain tumors,\" he said in a statement. \"We believe the current safety limits for cellphones are acceptable for protecting the public health.\"\nNevertheless, the findings are potentially a concern for device makers, especially the world's three biggest smartphone sellers, Apple Inc, Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and China's Huawei Technologies.\nThe CTIA, the trade association representing AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Apple Inc, Sprint Corp, DISH Network Corp, and others, said on Friday that previous studies have shown cellphone RF energy emissions have no known heath risks.\n\"We understand that the NTP draft reports for its mice and rat studies will be put out for comment and peer review so that their significance can be assessed, the group said.\nSamsung and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
