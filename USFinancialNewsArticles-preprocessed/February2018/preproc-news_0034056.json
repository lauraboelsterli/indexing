    "text": "CAMPBELL, Calif., Panzura, the leader in enterprise hybrid cloud NAS, announced today that CRN ® , a brand of The Channel Company , has named Steve Simpson, Director of Channels, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN's editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending, and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nAs Director of Channels, Steve played an integral role in the design and implementation of a dynamic new channel partner program to reflect the company's shift to a channel-first sales model.
