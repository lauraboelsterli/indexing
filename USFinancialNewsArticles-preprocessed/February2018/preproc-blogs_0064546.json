Sherwin-Williams will continue to operate its own stores. On the day the deal was announced, Lowe's also reported quarterly earnings that fell short as profit margins were squeezed. Lowe's share prices were down more than 7% Wednesday morning. News of the deal comes as Lowe's fights to keep pace with rival Home Depot , which recently revealed its plans to partner with Tesla to sell solar panels in its stores. Lowe's and Home Depot compete within the industry to win the best brands that, in turn, will attract more shoppers. Last October, for example, Stanley Black & Decker tapped Lowe's as the next retail destination for its Craftsman tool brand. In securing the deal with Sherwin-Williams, Lowe's aims to be the go-to retailer for do-it-yourself shoppers. That category has been growing, and painting is consistently a top DIY project.",
