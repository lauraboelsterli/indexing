As Workfront's CMO, Heidi will be responsible for telling the Workfront story, creating and executing an integrated marketing strategy, driving increased awareness, and building a customer marketing function to deepen Workfront's customer relationships.\nHeidi brings to Workfront over two decades of senior marketing leadership and her reputation for building award-winning marketing teams in the technology industry. She has a proven track record for driving measurable growth for some of the most respected enterprise SaaS technology brands and has been recognized for her industry expertise. Her knowledge in B2B marketing has enabled her to become a thought leader and a sought out speaker at many industry events throughout the country.\nPrior to Workfront, Heidi was the CMO of Plex Systems, Inc., where she was responsible for strategy and execution of all marketing efforts. She also previously served as CMO at Eloqua, Polycom, Taleo, Hyperion, and was the group vice president of marketing at PeopleSoft.

Her leadership will be a driving force in the ongoing success of our marketing efforts and will play an integral role in creating demand for Workfront and our products.\"\nHeidi joins Workfront at an exciting time as the company was recently recognized by Comparably as being among the top 50 companies nationwide for women to work for and named to the Women in Tech Council's 2018 Shatter List for actively employing measures to help break technology's glass ceiling.
