    "text": "PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - Swedish snowboarder Mans Hedberg escaped injury after a nasty fall during qualification at the Winter Olympics, his team said on Saturday.\n“Mans is doing alright! X-ray shows no damage, according to team doctor Jacob Swanberg,” the team wrote in an email to Reuters, a day after the crash during the final jump in Hedberg’s first run at the snowboard slopestyle qualifications.\nThe 24-year-old Hedberg was taken from the slopes in a neck brace after Friday’s accident.\nHedberg broke his neck last March in an accident during an event in Italy and underwent surgery. He returned to competition last November.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ",
