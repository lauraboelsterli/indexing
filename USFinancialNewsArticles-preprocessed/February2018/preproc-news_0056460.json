    "text": "Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle combined for 40 points and 20 rebounds, and the Los Angeles Lakers picked up their third straight win with a 123-104 rout of the struggling Atlanta Hawks on Monday at Philips Arena.\nIngram finished with 21 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Lakers. He had a big third quarter, scoring 15 of his points to help Los Angeles put away the Hawks. The Lakers led 96-75 heading into the fourth quarter.\nThe Hawks, who have lost four in a row, had no answer for Randle in the paint. He bulled his way for 19 points and 10 rebounds.\nTaurean Prince scored 24 points, and Dennis Schroder added 20 points to lead Atlanta.\nThe Lakers enjoyed a wild first half that saw them hit 10 3-pointers but also commit 14 turnovers. Kyle Kuzma and Brook Lopez each hit three triples, helping Los Angeles take a 64-46 lead into halftime. The Lakers shot 58.5 percent from the floor in the first half.\nL.A. opened second half with seven straight points as the lead ballooned to 71-46. The Hawks answered back with an 11-0 run, capped by a jumper from Dewayne Dedmon. But that was as close as Atlanta would get.\nIngram had a dunk, and Randle converted a three-point play as the Lakers pushed the lead back over 20 late in the third quarter. Ingram has scored in double figures in 13 straight games.\nLonzo Ball returned to action and found his shooting stroke. The rookie hit all three of his 3-point attempts. Ball sat out Saturdayâ€™s win over Sacramento, after having missed 15 of the previous 16 games with knee soreness. He finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists against the Hawks.\nEight different Lakers scored in double figures. Josh Hart scored 14 points, and Isaiah Thomas added 13 points.\nThe Lakers continue their four-game road trip at Miami on Thursday.\nThe Hawks host Indiana on Wednesday and Golden State on Friday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
