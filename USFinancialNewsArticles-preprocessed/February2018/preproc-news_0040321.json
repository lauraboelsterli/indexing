    "text": "RED BANK, N.J., North European Oil Royalty Trust (NYSE: NRT) reported the net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which appears in the table below compared to net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Total royalty income includes adjustments made by the operating companies to reflect their corrected royalty calculations for prior periods as well as the inclusion or absence of Mobil sulfur royalties. The total adjustments for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased total royalty income by $129,582. By comparison, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, total adjustments increased total royalty income by $23,796.\n1st Fiscal Quarter\nEnded 1/31/2018\n1st Fiscal Quarter\nEnded 1/31/2017\nPercentage\nChange\nTotal Royalty Income\n$1,770,241\n$1,724,686\n+ 2.64%\nNet Income\n$1,495,086\n$1,475,017\n+ 1.36%\nDistributions per Unit\n$0.17\n$0.15\n+ 13.33%\nThe Trust receives nearly all of its royalties under two royalty agreements. The Mobil Agreement, which is the higher royalty rate agreement, covers gas sales from the western half of the Oldenburg concession. The OEG Agreement, which is the lower royalty rate agreement, covers gas sales from the entire Oldenburg concession. The factors determining the amount of gas royalties payable under the two agreements from the preceding calendar quarter are shown in the table below comparing the fourth calendar quarters of 2017 and 2016. Further details will be available in the Trust's 10-Q filing available through the SEC or on the Trust's website, www.neort.com , on or about February 27, 2018.\nQuarterly Gas Data Providing Basis for Fiscal Quarter Royalties\nMobil Agreement\n4 th Calendar Quarter\nEnded 12/31/2017\n4 th Calendar Quarter\nEnded 12/31/2016\nPercentage\nChange\nGas Sales (Bcf 1 )\n5.660\n6.489\n- 12.78%\nGas Prices 2 (Ecents/kWh 3 )\n1.6593\n1.4789\n+ 12.20%\nAverage Exchange Rate 4\n1.1965\n1.0582\n+ 13.07%\nGas Royalties\n$1,278,038\n$1,164,964\n+ 9.71%\nOEG Agreement\nGas Sales (Bcf)\n18.150\n20.060\n- 9.52%\nGas Prices (Ecents/kWh)\n1.6921\n1.5081\n+ 12.20%\nAverage Exchange Rate\n1.2008\n1.0590\n+ 13.39%\nGas Royalties\n$540,669\n$466,168\n+ 15.98%\n1 Billion cubic feet 2 Gas prices derived from August-October period 3 Euro cents per kilowatt hour\n4 Based on average Euro/dollar exchange rates of cumulative royalty transfers\nTrust expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 10.45%, or $26,167, to $276,626 from $250,459 for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in expenses reflects costs relating to the biennial examination of the royalty statements by the Trust's German accountants, increased Trustee fees as specified in the Trust Agreement, and the timing of mailing costs associated with the annual meeting.\nThe previously declared distribution of 17 cents per unit will be paid on February 28, 2018 to owners of record as of February 16, 2018.
