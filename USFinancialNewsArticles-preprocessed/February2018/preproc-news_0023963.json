    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PBB Bancorp (“PBCA”) (OTCQX: PBCA) , the parent company of Premier Business Bank (“Premier”), announced another record year in the bank’s 11 year history. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017 reflected exceptional results: total assets of $626.4 million; net loans of $523.3 million; total deposits of $479.1 million; and total equity of $50.6 million.\nNet income for the 3 month period ended December 31, 2017 was $940,500, or $0.19 per share and net income for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2017 was $4.8 million, or $0.96 per share. Net income for the current quarter and the 12 month period ended December 31, 2017 was impacted by $184,600 for the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset as a result of the reduced corporate tax rate that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Normalized quarterly earnings would have been $1.1 million or $0.23 per share and annual earnings would have been $5.0 million or $1.00 per share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.8 million compared to $5.7 million recorded in previous year. In 2016, net income included a $2.1 million one-time non-taxable bargain purchase gain from the acquisition of First Mountain Bank in January 2016. Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected an increase of $1.4 million or 39% increase compared to the adjusted net income for 2016.\nWith a record 25+ consecutive quarters of positive growth, Premier is very pleased to announce the 2017 year-end record results. Our team of experienced bankers and focused strategic efforts created an environment to meet and exceed strategic goals set for 2017. “I am pleased with such a productive and successful year. We reached our goals, invested in our communities, and continued to build upon our successes to offer the best community banking,” stated President and Chief Executive Officer, John R. Polen.\nHIGHLIGHTS for the Year-End 2017\nPBB Bancorp to merge into First Foundation Inc. was announced in a joint press release on December 19, 2017.
