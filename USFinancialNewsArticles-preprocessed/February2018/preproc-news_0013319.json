The company expects to deliver $400-$500 million in development properties, at yields in the 7.5%-8.5% range.\nLiberty anticipates property level operating income for industrial same store properties to grow by 3% to 4% on a straight line basis and 4% to 5% on a cash basis, and industrial rental growth by 12% to 15% in a straight line basis.\nThis outlook also reflects $0.02 per diluted share of costs associated with information system upgrades being undertaken in 2018. As is customary the first quarter will reflect approximately $0.04 per diluted share of incremental non-cash expenses due to the accelerated vesting of grants to certain employees under the retirement provisions of our compensation plan.\nA reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income available to common shareholders per diluted share to NAREIT FFO per diluted share for 2018 is below (all 2018 amounts projected).

The SEC has agreed to the disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure on a per share basis in its Release No. 34-47226, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. The Company believes that the calculation of NAREIT FFO is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the Company’s operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from operating property dispositions. As a result, year over year comparison of NAREIT FFO reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. In addition, management believes that NAREIT FFO provides useful information to the investment community about the Company’s financial performance when compared to other REITs since NAREIT FFO is generally recognized as the standard for reporting the operating performance of a REIT. NAREIT FFO available to common shareholders does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. NAREIT FFO available to common shareholders also does not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that the line on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income entitled “net income available to common shareholders” is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to FFO.\nInquiries: Jeanne Leonard, Liberty Property Trust, 610.648.1704\nSource:Liberty Property Trust",
