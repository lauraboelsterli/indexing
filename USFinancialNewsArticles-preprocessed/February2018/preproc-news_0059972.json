Michelle is committed to the mission, vision and values of Adventist Health and will continue to look for ways to make healthcare in Sonora world-class.”\nFuentes, who previously served as an assistant vice president and chief operating officer at Florida Hospital, brings more than 18 years of healthcare experience to her new position.\n“I’m honored to take on the role and want to continue to build the culture that makes us special,” Fuentes said. “I love that we take care of our friends and the neighbors we see every day, and I feel a huge responsibility to take care of this community.”\nFuentes holds a bachelor of science in business administration from Union College in Lincoln, Neb.; a master’s degree in business administration from Webster University in Orlando; and membership in the American College of Healthcare Executives.\nABOUT ADVENTIST HEALTH: Adventist Health is a faith-based, non-profit integrated health system serving more than 75 communities on the West Coast and Hawaii.
