    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 2:03 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Alpine skiing - Vonn edges Goggia for second day running Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nGARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany (Reuters) - American Lindsey Vonn showed that she has hit peak form ahead of the Winter Olympics by winning her second downhill in as many days on Sunday and the 81st World Cup race of her career. \nThe four-times overall World Cup winner, who pipped Sofia Goggia by two hundredths of a second in Saturday’s sprint downhill at Garmisch, again edged the Italian in Sunday’s conventional race on the Kandahar mountain, this time by 0.11 seconds. Tina Weirather of Liechteinstein was third. \nThe U.S. team also had a scare, one day after Jacqueline Wiles crashed and was ruled out of this month’s games in Pyeongchang after fracturing her fibula and tibia and suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament. \nThis time, Stacy Cook fell at over 100 kilometres per hour, crashing dramatically into the safety netting, but staggered to her feet after a few tense minutes and brushed herself down. \nThere was no immediate comment on her condition from the U.S. skiing federation.

REUTERS/Michael Dalder \nLaurenne Ross, another American who crashed on Saturday but emerged unscathed, completed the course but was nearly two seconds slower than Vonn’s time. \nIt was Vonn’s fourth win of the World Cup season and her third in a row in the downhill.

REUTERS/Michael Dalder \nThe 33-year-old, the finest woman skier of her generation, won the downhill gold at the Vancouver games in 2010 but missed Sochi four years ago through injury. \nShe suffered an 11-month layoff after suffering a knee injury in Andorra in February 2016 and then broke her arm in training in Colorado the following November, requiring an intensive programme of rehabilitation. \nShe was also left with lingering nerve damage.
