    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 10:16 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Dutch prosecutors say won't open criminal case against big tobacco firms Reuters Staff 1 Min Read AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch prosecutors on Thursday rejected a call by civil groups, hospitals and the city of Amsterdam to open a criminal case against major tobacco companies, saying the firms had adequately warned smokers of the health risks. The groups filed a formal complaint in 2016 accusing four major tobacco companies of a range of offences, including misleading marketing and causing deaths. “It is the smoker – aware of the health risks – who accepts the considerable chance of any resulting health damage by starting to smoke or, having already started, not choosing to quit,” the prosecutors said in a statement dismissing the case.
