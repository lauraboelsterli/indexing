    "text": "Q4 2017 Revenue increased 3% to $46.9 million\nFull Year 2017 Revenue increased 8% to $167.5 million\nNEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sequential Brands Group, Inc. (“Sequential” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:SQBG) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results:\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 3% to $46.9 million compared to $45.4 million in the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 was $(162.9) million or $(2.58) per diluted share, which includes one-time, net charges of $171.7 million related to both the recent federal tax reform legislation and the Company’s goodwill. The tax reform impact was a $132.4 million non-cash positive benefit in the fourth quarter. Specifically, the Company revalued its deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower federal tax rates and released the valuation reserves on its federal deferred tax assets. The goodwill adjustment represents a one-time, non-cash charge of $304.1 million that was driven by the Company’s stock price during the fourth quarter – as well as the increase in the Company’s book value related to tax reform – which resulted in an assessed fair value of equity that was significantly below its net book value. This compares to a GAAP net loss in the prior year’s quarter of $(1.0) million or $(0.02) per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $7.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $7.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA (defined in the accompanying Non-GAAP Financial Measures) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $27.4 million compared to $24.2 million in the prior year quarter. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.\n“We ended the full year with 8% revenue growth, strong organic growth and an improved Adjusted EBITDA margin which reflect the power of our unique portfolio of brands,” said Sequential Brands Group CEO Karen Murray. “We are encouraged by the momentum so far in 2018 and are focused on driving revenue through both existing partnerships as well as executing against our robust new business development pipeline. Our refinancing efforts continue to progress and we remain on track with an early 2018 refinancing.”\nFull Year 2017 Results:\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 8% to $167.5 million, compared to $155.5 million in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(185.7) million or $(2.95) per diluted share which includes one-time, net charges in the fourth quarter of $171.7 million related to both the recent federal tax reform legislation and the goodwill adjustment previously described. Also reflected in the net loss for 2017 were non-core charges of $45.1 million highlighted in the Company’s third quarter 2017 earnings release. This compares to a net loss in the prior year ended December 31, 2016 of $(0.8) million or $(0.01) per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $27.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $21.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $98.4 million, compared to $83.1 million in the prior year. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.\nAppointment of Chief Financial Officer:\nIn conjunction with today’s earnings release, the Company announced the appointment of Peter Lops as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Lops joins Sequential from Viacom Media Networks where he served as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer for the Distribution and Business Development division. Andrew Cooper, President and Interim Chief Financial Officer, will continue to serve as President.\nInvestor Call and Webcast:\nManagement will provide further commentary today, February 28, 2018, on the Company’s financial results and financial update via a conference call and webcast beginning at approximately 8:30 am ET. To join the conference call, please dial (877) 407-0789 or visit the investor relations page on the Company’s website www.sequentialbrandsgroup.com . A replay of the conference call is available on the Company’s website.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis press release contains historical and projected measures of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Sequential Brands Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries, excluding interest income or expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, deal advisory costs, non-cash compensation, restructuring costs, costs incurred in connection with CEO transition, MSLO shareholder and pre-acquisition litigation costs, realized loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities, MSLO pre-acquisition sales tax refunds, other non-cash items, impairment of available-for-sale securities, non-cash impairment of goodwill and trademarks, net of non-controlling interest, and severance. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures which represent net income (loss) attributable to Sequential Brands Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries, excluding deal advisory costs, mark-to-market adjustments to non-cash stock-based compensation provided to non-employees, write-off of deferred financing costs, restructuring costs, costs incurred in connection with CEO transition, non-cash stock-based compensation - restructuring, MSLO shareholder and pre-acquisition litigation costs, realized loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities, MSLO pre-acquisition sales tax refunds, other non-cash items, impairment of available-for-sale securities, non-cash impairment of goodwill and trademarks, net of non-controlling interest, and adjustment to taxes. These non-GAAP metrics are an alternative to the information calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), as provided in the reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies and should only be used in conjunction with the Company’s results reported according to GAAP. Any financial measure other than those prepared in accordance with GAAP should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We consider these measures to be useful measures of our ongoing financial performance because they adjust for certain costs and other events that the Company believes are not representative of its core licensing business. See below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics from the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAbout Sequential Brands Group, Inc.\nSequential Brands Group, Inc.

Management uses this information to measure performance over time on a consistent basis and to identify business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful measures of ongoing financial performance because they adjust for certain costs and other events that the Company believes are not representative of its core licensing business. (2 ) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Sequential Brands Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries, excluding interest income or expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, deal advisory costs, non-cash compensation, MSLO shareholder and pre-acquisition litigation costs, restructuring costs, costs incurred in connection with CEO transition, realized loss on the sale of available-for-sale securities, MSLO pre-acquisition sales tax refunds, other non-cash items, impairment of available-for-sale securities, non-cash impairment of goodwill and trademarks, net of non-controlling interest, and severance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to identify business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. (a) Represents deal advisory costs including legal, financial and accounting services that are not representative of the Company's day-to-day licensing business. (b) Represents the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments to stock-based compensation provided to non-employees. (c) Represents the write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the extinguishment of a portion of the Company’s loan facilities. (d) Represents restructuring charges associated with the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. acquisition and other cost savings initiatives. (e) Represents $3.2 million in severance expense and $3.5 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense in connection with the CEO transition. The non-cash stock based compensation expense represents the accelerated vesting of previously granted stock awards, and was calculated based on the stock’s April 2015 grant-date fair value of $14.33 per share in accordance with GAAP. The fair value of the shares on the termination date was $3.95 per share, or approximately $1.1 million total. (f) Represents non-cash stock-based compensation recorded in connection with restructuring activities. (g) Represents legal costs related to shareholder and pre-acquisition litigation matters associated with the Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. acquisition. (h) Represents the realized loss recognized in connection with the sale of the Company’s available-for-sale securities. (i) Represents sales tax refund received related to years prior to the acquisition of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. (j) Adjustments to estimated accruals previously recorded in conjunction with acquisitions. (k) Represents impairment of available-for-sale securities to fair value. (l) Represents non-cash impairment charges, net of non-controlling interest, related to the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for certain non-core brands. (m) Adjustments reflect that the Company expects to pay annual cash income taxes of $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, as the Company's net operating losses and other tax benefits are expected to reduce any additional tax obligation. (n) Represents weighted-average diluted shares the Company reported or would have reported if the Company reported GAAP net income in the periods presented. (o) Represents costs associated with employee terminations not representative of the Company’s day-to-day compensation costs.\nSource:Sequential Brands Group, Inc.",
