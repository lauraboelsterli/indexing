    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average rebounded on Tuesday morning after suffering a sharp drop last week, as investors played catch-up after U.S. shares rose on Monday, when markets were closed for a national holiday in Japan.\nThe Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to 21,537.46 points by midmorning, after posting a 7.1 percent weekly drop in the last week hit by a sell-off in Wall Street.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.6 percent to 1,742.20.\nSecurities, real estate and textile sectors outperformed, with Nomura Holdings rising 2.4 percent, Mitsui Fudosan soaring 2.6 percent and Toray Industries surging 6.6 percent.\nAir transport and land transport sectors, on the other hand, underperformed. ANA Holdings dropped 0.9 percent and East Japan Railway Co shed 0.4 percent.\nEditing by Kim Coghill\n ",
