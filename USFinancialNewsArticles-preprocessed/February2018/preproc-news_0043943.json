    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Parsley Energy, Inc. (NYSE: PE) (\"Parsley,\" \"Parsley Energy,\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company has posted to its website a presentation that supplements the information in this release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet production averaged 80.3 MBoe per day, up 12% versus 3Q17 and 78% year-over-year. Net oil production increased 9% quarter-over-quarter and 69% year-over-year. Parsley's previously announced 2018 oil production guidance of 65-70 MBo per day represents year-over-year growth of 50% at the midpoint. Lease operating expense (\"LOE\") per Boe decreased 23% versus 3Q17 to $3.44. Favorable trends in unit costs supported a 23% quarter-over-quarter increase in Parsley's pre-hedge cash margin to $31.45 per Boe. (1) The Company recently executed several high-impact acreage trades that will facilitate extended lateral lengths in its core Upton County footprint. Net of acreage traded away, Parsley added approximately 0.4 million net lateral feet to the Company's horizontal drilling inventory through trades executed since its last quarterly update in November. Proved reserves of 416 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017 represent an 87% increase versus proved reserves as of December 31, 2016. Proved developed reserves of 209 MMBoe as of December 31, 2017 represent a 97% increase versus proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2016.\n\"Following a transformative 2017 for Parsley Energy, we are eager to efficiently harvest the ample resource base our team has assembled, tested, and optimized,\" said Bryan Sheffield, Parsley's Chairman and CEO. \"Even at a steady activity pace, we look forward to delivering compelling high-margin growth on a simplified 2018 development program.\"\nOperational Highlights\nDuring 4Q17, Parsley spud 42 and completed 41 horizontal wells with an average working interest of 95% and an average lateral length of approximately 9,500 feet.\nParsley's 4Q17 activity included a three-well stacked pad in Martin County targeting the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B zones. The Strain Ranch 12-1 pad is part of the Company's growing activity on its expanded asset base in the northern Midland Basin. Early results from these three 1.5 mile lateral wells are promising, with peak 30-day production rates averaging 175 Boe (139 Bo) per day per thousand lateral feet.\n\"Acquisitions completed in 2017 transformed the long-term resource potential of our Company,\" said Matt Gallagher, Parsley's President and COO. \"Results like the Strain Ranch pad highlight the high-return opportunity set we possess, and having integrated and gained experience on acquired assets, we are prepared to capitalize on this sizable resource opportunity.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nDuring 4Q17, the Company recorded net income attributable to its stockholders of $49.9 million, or $0.20 per weighted average share, compared to a net loss of $13.3 million, or $0.05 per weighted average share, during 3Q17. Excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, certain items that the Company does not view as indicative of its ongoing financial performance, and adding back the non-controlling interest allocated to Class B stockholders, adjusted net income for 4Q17 was $95.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $29.3 million, or $0.12 per weighted average share, during 3Q17. (2)\nAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and exploration expense (\"Adjusted EBITDAX\") for 4Q17 was $217 million, up 32% compared to 3Q17. (3)\nParsley registered favorable quarter-over-quarter trends in unit costs. LOE per Boe decreased from $4.49 in 3Q17 to $3.44 in 4Q17. General and administrative expense (\"G&A\") per Boe decreased from $5.10 in 3Q17 to $4.72 in 4Q17, while cash G&A per Boe, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, decreased from $4.32 in 3Q17 to $4.04 in 4Q17. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense per Boe decreased from $14.41 in 3Q17 to $14.23 in 4Q17.\nReported capital expenditures increased from $307 million in 3Q17 to $417 million in 4Q17, reflecting a 41% quarter-over-quarter increase in net completed footage, as well as increases in facilities and infrastructure spending and non-operated development.\nSolid Balance Sheet and Advantaged Hedge Position\nParsley entered 2018 with a strong balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity, consisting of $703 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and an undrawn amount of $997 million on the Company's revolver. (4) Pro forma for the January 2018 divestiture of certain non-operated properties, the Company likewise had approximately $1.7 billion of liquidity, consisting of $739 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and an undrawn amount of $997 million on the Company's revolver. (4) Parsley's proactive hedging strategy protects its balance sheet and anticipated cash flow while retaining commodity price upside.\nFor details on Parsley's hedging position, please see the tables below under Supplemental Information, the presentation posted to the Company's website, and/or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, upon availability, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFull-year 2018 Guidance\n2018E\nProduction\nAnnual net oil production (MBo/d)\n65-70\nAnnual net total production (MBoe/d)\n98-108\nCapital Program\nTotal development expenditures ($MM)\n$1,350-$1,550\nDrilling and completion (% of total)\n85-90%\nFacilities, Infrastructure & Other (% of total)\n10-15%\nActivity\nGross operated horizontal POPs (1)\n~160\nMidland Basin (% of total)\n~75%\nDelaware Basin (% of total)\n~25%\nAverage lateral length\n~9,500'\nAverage working interest\n~90%\nUnit Costs\nLease operating expenses ($/Boe)\n$3.75-$5.00\nCash general and administrative expenses ($/Boe)\n$3.50-$4.25\nProduction and ad valorem taxes (% of revenue)\n6.0%-7.0%\n(1)\n\"POPs\" defined as wells placed on production.\nYear-end 2017 Reserves\nParsley posted strong reserves growth in 2017.

Organic reserves replacement ratio of 683%. (5) Parsley's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved reserves (\"standardized measure\") at December 31, 2017 was $3.0 billion, an increase of 155% relative to the Company's standardized measure at December 31, 2016.

(6) At SEC Pricing, the pre-tax PV-10 of proved developed reserves was $2.5 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of over 150% relative to the corresponding measure at December 31, 2016. (6) Positive performance revisions of 4.5 MMBo to oil proved developed producing (\"PDP\") reserves estimates indicate the stability of the Company's asset base.\nChanges in reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table below:\n(MMBoe)\nBalance, December 31, 2016\n222.3\nPurchases of reserves in place\n55.8\nDivestures of reserves in place\n(6.5)\nExtensions and discoveries\n160.3\nRevisions of previous estimates\n9.2\nProduction\n(24.8)\nBalance, December 31, 2017\n416.4\nParsley's internally prepared estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, the Company's independent reserve engineer.

Measures\nAdjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Company's consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration and abandonment costs, net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), change in Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\") liability, stock-based compensation, acquisition costs, asset retirement obligation accretion expense, loss (gain) on sale of property, loss on early extinguishment of debt, inventory write down, loss (gain) on derivatives, net settlements on derivative instruments, net premium realization on options that settled during the period, and certain additional items.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows the Company to more effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDAX is useful to investors as a widely followed measure of operating performance.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) for each of the periods indicated.\nParsley Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nAdjusted EBITDAX (1)\n(Unaudited, in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAdjusted EBITDAX reconciliation to net income (loss):\nNet income (loss) attributable to Parsley Energy, Inc. stockholders\n$\n49,919\n$\n(30,745)\n$\n106,774\n$\n(74,182)\nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(4,922)\n(3,352)\n17,146\n(14,735)\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n105,143\n62,653\n352,247\n233,766\nExploration and abandonment costs\n35,122\n1,152\n40,415\n13,931\nInterest expense, net\n30,028\n16,279\n89,445\n55,233\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(19,830)\n4,341\n5,708\n(17,424)\nEBITDAX\n195,460\n50,328\n611,735\n196,589\nChange in TRA liability\n(56,396)\n(7,351)\n(35,847)\n(7,351)\nStock-based compensation\n4,989\n3,405\n19,619\n12,871\nAcquisition costs\n8\n155\n10,977\n1,081\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations\n374\n157\n971\n732\nLoss on sale of property\n14,332\nâ€”\n14,332\n119\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nâ€”\n36,335\n3,891\n36,335\nInventory write down\n1,060\nâ€”\n1,060\nâ€”\nLoss on derivatives\n72,310\n26,993\n66,135\n50,835\nNet settlements on derivative instruments\n16\n1,881\n15,670\n26,441\nNet premium realization on options that settled during the period\n(14,699)\n5,576\n(37,103)\n31,757\nAdjusted EBITDAX\n$\n217,454\n$\n117,479\n$\n671,440\n$\n349,409\n(1)\nCertain reclassifications to prior period amounts have been made to conform with current presentation.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted net income is not a measure of net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure used by management to evaluate financial performance, prior to non-cash gains or losses on derivatives, net cash received for derivative settlements, net premiums received on options that settled during the period, change in TRA liability, loss (gain) on sale of property, exploration and abandonment costs, acquisition costs, inventory write down, and loss on early extinguishment of debt while adjusting for noncontrolling interest and the associated changes in estimated income tax. Management believes adjusted net income is useful because it may enhance investors' ability to assess Parsley's historical and future financial performance. Adjusted net income should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, consolidated net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income to the GAAP financial measure of net loss.\nParsley Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nAdjusted Net Income and Net Income Per Share\n(Unaudited, in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) - as reported\n$\n49,919\n$\n(30,745)\n$\n106,774\n$\n(74,182)\nAdjustments:\nLoss on derivatives\n72,310\n26,993\n66,135\n50,835\nNet settlements on derivative instruments\n16\n1,881\n15,670\n26,441\nNet premium realization on options that settled during the period\n(14,699)\n5,576\n(37,103)\n31,757\nChange in TRA liability\n(56,396)\n(7,351)\n(35,847)\n(7,351)\nLoss on sale of property\n14,332\nâ€”\n14,332\n119\nExploration and abandonment costs\n35,122\n1,152\n40,415\n13,931\nAcquisition costs\n8\n155\n10,977\n1,081\nInventory write down\n1,060\nâ€”\n1,060\nâ€”\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nâ€”\n36,335\n3,891\n36,335\nNoncontrolling interest\n(3,891)\n(3,310)\n19,225\n(14,953)\nChange in estimated income tax (1)\n(1,919)\n(18,884)\n(865)\n(47,152)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n95,862\n$\n11,802\n$\n204,664\n$\n16,861\nNet income (loss) per diluted share - as reported\n$\n0.16\n$\n(0.17)\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.46)\nAdjustments:\nLoss on derivatives\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.26\nNet settlements on derivative instruments\nâ€”\n0.01\n0.05\n0.14\nNet premium realization on options that settled during the period\n(0.05)\n0.03\n(0.13)\n0.17\nChange in TRA liability\n(0.18)\n(0.04)\n(0.12)\n(0.04)\nLoss on sale of property\n0.05\nâ€”\n0.05\nâ€”\nExploration and abandonment costs\n0.11\n0.01\n0.14\n0.07\nAcquisition costs\nâ€”\nâ€”\n0.04\n0.01\nInventory write down\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nâ€”\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nâ€”\n0.18\n0.01\n0.19\nNoncontrolling interest\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nâ€”\n(0.08)\nChange in estimated income tax (1)\n(0.01)\n(0.09)\n0.01\n(0.24)\nAdjustment for change in weighted average diluted share count\nâ€”\n0.02\nâ€”\n0.07\nAdjusted net income per diluted share\n$\n0.30\n$\n0.06\n$\n0.69\n$\n0.09\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding - as reported\n249,659\n178,990\n240,733\n161,793\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nClass B Common Stock\n63,946\nâ€”\n54,665\nâ€”\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n1,259\nâ€”\n1,114\nâ€”\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding - as reported (2)\n314,864\n178,990\n296,512\n161,793\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nClass B Common Stock\nâ€”\n28,009\nâ€”\n30,371\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nâ€”\n1,118\nâ€”\n872\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding for adjusted net income\n314,864\n208,117\n296,512\n193,036\n(1)\nThe Company is subject to a full valuation allowance for federal income taxes as of December 31, 2017, resulting in minimal federal tax expense; as a result, tax expense is calculated based on a 0.75% Texas margin tax rate applied against certain taxable items.\n(2)\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 the number of weighted average diluted shares used to calculate reported net income per share is based on the fact that, under the \"if converted\" and treasury stock methods, Class B Common Stock and restricted stock and restricted stock units were not recognized because they would have been antidilutive.\nPV-10\nPV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from the Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net reserves. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the GAAP financial measure of Standardized Measure as of December 31, 2017:\nAs of December 31, 2017\n(in millions)\nPV-10 of proved reserves\n$\n3,918.0\nPresent value of future income tax discounted at 10%\n(902.5)\nStandardized Measure\n$\n3,015.5\nSupplemental Information\nDerivatives\nParsley Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpen Crude Oil Derivatives Positions (1)\n1Q18\n2Q18\n3Q18\n4Q18\n1Q19\n2Q19\n3Q19\n4Q19\nPut Spreads (MBbls/d) (2)\n7.8\n11.5\n34.2\n37.5\n11.7\n11.5\n8.2\n8.2\nPut Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n52.14\n$\n52.50\n$\n49.64\n$\n49.67\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\n$\n55.00\n$\n55.00\nShort Put Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n41.43\n$\n42.50\n$\n39.64\n$\n39.67\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\n$\n45.00\n$\n45.00\nThree Way Collars (MBbls/d) (3)\n43.3\n49.5\n31.0\n31.0\n8.3\n8.2\n8.2\n8.2\nShort Call Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n65.67\n$\n68.11\n$\n75.65\n$\n75.65\n$\n80.40\n$\n80.40\n$\n80.40\n$\n80.40\nPut Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n50.77\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\n$\n50.00\nShort Put Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n40.19\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\n$\n40.00\nPremium Realizations ($ MM) (4)\n$\n(18.5)\n$\n(16.5)\n$\n(17.9)\n$\n(19.1)\n$\n(5.9)\n$\n(5.9)\n$\n(3.9)\n$\n(3.9)\nCollars (MBbls/d) (5)\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\nShort Call Price ($/Bbl)\n$61.31\n$61.31\n$61.31\nPut Price ($/Bbl)\n$45.67\n$45.67\n$45.67\nTotal MBbls/d Hedged\n51.1\n64.0\n68.2\n71.5\n20.0\n19.7\n16.4\n16.4\nMid-Cuch Basis Swaps (MBbls/d)\n11.5\n11.4\n11.3\n11.3\nSwap Price ($/Bbl)\n$\n(0.86)\n$\n(0.86)\n$\n(0.86)\n$\n(0.86)\nParsley Energy, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpen Natural Gas Derivatives Positions (1)\n1Q18\n2Q18\n3Q18\n4Q18\nThree Way Collars (MMBtu/d) (3)\n35.0\n8.2\n8.2\n8.2\nCall Price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n4.44\n$\n3.60\n$\n3.60\n$\n3.60\nPut Price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n3.19\n$\n3.00\n$\n3.00\n$\n3.00\nShort Put Price ($/MMBtu)\n$\n2.64\n$\n2.75\n$\n2.75\n$\n2.75\nSwaps (MMBtu/d)\n5.0\nStrike Price ($/MMBtu)\n$3.50\nTotal MMBtu/d Hedged\n40.0\n8.2\n8.2\n8.2\nOrganic Reserves Replacement Ratio\nParsley uses the organic reserves replacement ratio as an indicator of the company's ability to replace the reserves that it has developed and to increase its reserves over time. The ratio is not a representation of value creation and has a number of limitations that should be considered. For example, the ratio does not incorporate the costs or timing of developing future reserves. The organic reserves replacement ratio of 683% was calculated as total 2017 reserve additions and revisions (technical and pricing), divided by total 2017 production. The ratio calculation excludes acquisitions and divestitures.\n(1)\nAs of 2/21/2018\n(2)\nWhen NYMEX price is above put price, Parsley receives the NYMEX price. When NYMEX price is between the put price and the short put price, Parsley receives the put price. When NYMEX price is below the short put price, Parsley receives the NYMEX price plus the difference between the short put price and the put price.\n(3)\nFunctions similarly to put spreads except that when index price is at or above the call price, Parsley receives the call price.\n(4)\nPremium realizations represent net premiums paid (including deferred premiums), which are recognized as a loss in the period of settlement.\n(5)\nWhen NYMEX price is above the call price, Parsley receives the call price. When NYMEX is below the put price, Parsley receives the put price. When NYMEX is between call and put prices, Parsley receives the NYMEX price.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parsley-energy-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-and-operating-results-announces-officer-promotions-300602290.html\nSOURCE Parsley Energy, Inc.",
