    "text": "OAKVILLE, Ontario, Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Saint Jean Carbon Inc. (“Saint Jean” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:SJL) (OTCQB:TORVF), a carbon science company engaged in the design and build of green energy storage, green energy creation and green re-creation through the use of carbon materials is pleased to announce that the Company on January 25 th 2018 has entered into an arm’s length non-binding term sheet with Great Lake Graphite Inc. to acquire a 95% ownership of the historical mining property known as the Lochaber claims located in South Western Quebec in the same general region as the Company’s other flag ship properties. The Lochaber Graphite Deposit reports an Inferred Resource of 4,091,000 tonnes at 4.01% Cg using a cut-off grade of 2.45% Cg. Link to Resource: http://www.greatlakesgraphite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/NI43-101-Res-Est-Lochaber.pdf\nTerms; The Company will issue to Great Lakes Graphite Inc. 3,000,000 shares, pay a 1.75% net operational operating cost royalty for 10 years, pay a fee of $425,000.00 divided equally into four payments over four years and enter into an offtake agreement to allow Great Lakes the first right of refusal to purchase up to 10,000 metric tons per year for the life of the mine. (The cost of the material will be a market value and the royalty will not be paid on offtake purchases).\nThe proposed terms are subject to the TSX Venture approval and if deemed necessary shareholder approval. The transaction is subject to customary due diligence that will be completed in the coming weeks. Once completed, the Companies will enter into a definitive agreement shortly thereafter.\nPaul Ogilvie, CEO, commented: “The relationship between our properties is directly in the same historical past producing zones, this will greatly increase our holdings. The ability to run mineralized material from other regional properties helps us to better understand how a multi pit plan could possibly provide a more stable mining signature. Our goal to be the largest holder of properties in SW Quebec continues to grow.”\nDr. Christian Derosier, P.Geo., President of C.D.G.C.
