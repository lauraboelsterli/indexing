    "text": "February 3, 2018 / 8:46 PM / Updated 28 minutes ago Actor Uma Thurman accuses Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault Alex Dobuzinskis 3 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Uma Thurman has accused movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexually assaulting her at a London hotel after they worked together on the 1994 hit film “Pulp Fiction.” \nIn a New York Times article on Saturday by columnist Maureen Dowd, Thurman broke her silence after saying in October that she would wait to speak out about inappropriate behaviour in the workplace because she did not want to say anything in anger. \nThurman became the latest of more than 70 women who have accused 65-year-old Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. A spokeswoman for Weinstein said on Saturday that he had apologised to Thurman for making an “awkward pass” at her 25 years ago, but that her claims about being physically assaulted were untrue. \nIn the Times article, Thurman, 47, said Weinstein pushed her down when she met him in his suite at London’s Savoy Hotel. \n“He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn’t actually put his back into it and force me,” she told the newspaper.
