    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Foreigners bought long-term U.S. securities for a sixth straight month in December, data from the U.S. Treasury department showed on Thursday.\nOffshore investors purchased $27.3 billion in long-term U.S assets after buying $57.5 billion in November. Including shorter-dated securities, however, overseas investors sold $119.3 billion in December, after buying $33.5 billion the previous month.\nThe report also showed foreign investors sold Treasuries for a third straight month in December, while Chinaâ€™s holdings of U.S. government bonds increased after declining in November.
