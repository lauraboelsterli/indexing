On an organic 1 basis, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 14% year-over-year.\nCost of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $37.1 million, or 32.4% of revenue, compared with $38.6 million, or 40.2% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016. This translates into gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 67.6%, a year-over-year increase of 780 basis points compared with 59.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016, and a sequential increase of 80 basis points compared with 66.8% for the third quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.4 million, resulting in diluted net income per share of $0.12, compared with $0.7 million and $0.00 per share, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income and diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 include a benefit of $15.5 million and $0.11 per share, respectively, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, which is discussed in further detail below.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $25.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 78% compared with $14.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 22.3%, a year-over-year increase of 740 basis points compared with 14.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.8 million, resulting in Non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.06, compared with $7.4 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for 2017 was $449.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 5% compared with $427.6 million for 2016.\nCost of revenue for 2017 was $151.0 million, or 33.6% of revenue, compared with $159.2 million, or 37.2% of revenue for 2016. This translates into gross margin for 2017 of 66.4%, a year-over-year increase of 360 basis points compared with 62.8% for 2016.\nNet income for 2017 was $34.8 million resulting in diluted net income per share of $0.24, compared with $27.1 million and $0.18 per share, respectively, for 2016. Net income and diluted net income per share for 2017 include a benefit of $15.5 million and $0.11 per share, respectively, as a result of the Tax Act.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $109.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 9% compared with $99.9 million for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2017 was 24.3%, an increase of 90 basis points compared with 23.4% for 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income for 2017 was $41.8 million, resulting in Non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.29, compared with $51.0 million and $0.34 per share, respectively, for 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $97.7 million for 2017, a year-over-year increase of 5% compared with $92.8 million for 2016, and representing 21.7% of revenue.\n“We’re pleased with the transformations and achievements of our financial goals in 2017, delivering revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in-line with our guidance, expanding margins on a year-over-year basis, and again generating strong operating cash flow,” said Chris Greiner, chief financial officer and chief operating officer of Inovalon.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Non-GAAP net income are Non-GAAP measures. Net income is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income. Reconciliations of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income, identifying the differences between net income and each of these Non-GAAP financial measures, are included in this press release after the consolidated financial statements.\nKey Highlights\nStrong Financial Performance In-Line with Company Expectations. Fourth quarter revenue of $114.6 million grew 19% year-over-year as reported and 14% year-over-year organically 1 , in-line with the Company’s preliminary expected results announced on January 8, 2018 as well as with the guidance previously provided in the Company’s Q3 2017 earnings report. Fourth quarter gross margin of 67.6% improved 780 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially, demonstrating continued operating leverage from higher-margin offering mix, favorable pricing, and technology-enabled efficiencies that Inovalon has realized throughout 2017. Adjusted EBITDA of $25.5 million was at the mid-point of the Company’s previously-stated expectations, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.3% was up 740 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher gross margin. The Company's strong financial performance continued to drive healthy cash flow, with full-year 2017 net cash provided by operating activities of $97.7 million, representing 21.7% of revenue and slightly ahead of Company expectations.\nUnderlying Growth and Transition to Subscription-Based Platforms . Inovalon is successfully orchestrating a transition from legacy enterprise solutions to subscription-based cloud-based platform offerings. In 2016, the Company's revenue consisted of 12%, 34%, and 54%, from services, legacy enterprise solutions, and subscription-based cloud-based platform offerings, respectively. In 2017, these contributions were 15%, 19%, and 66%, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 30% in subscription-based cloud-based platform offerings in 2017. Driving the expansion in subscription-based cloud-based platform offering adoption is an increase in the number of patients on the Inovalon ONE™ Platform, a number that reached over 94 million at the end of 2017, a year-over-year increase of over 450%. As clients contract for an increasing scope of capabilities enabled through the Inovalon ONE™ Platform, their realized value increases, as does subscription-based revenue to Inovalon. As of the end of 2017, the vast majority of clients represented by the more than 94 million patients on the Inovalon ONE™ Platform utilized only a small fraction of the Platform’s capabilities.\nContinued Strong Expansion of Connectivity and Deeper Clinical Datasets. During 2017, Inovalon significantly expanded its industry-leading datasets and healthcare ecosystem connectivity, both key differentiators for the Company. At the end of 2017, Inovalon had achieved direct electronic health record (EHR) system connectivity with more than 126,000 physicians, representing growth of 23% from 2016 levels, and expects connectivity to continue to grow significantly in 2018. Data within the Company’s proprietary MORE 2 Registry ® dataset also continued to expand, ending 2017 with a unique patient count of more than 240 million and medical event count of nearly 38 billion, up 59% and 183%, respectively, from 2016. In addition to new engagements and the expansion of existing engagements, dataset metric growth during 2017 was driven by the addition of clinical data for over 40 million patients from the Company’s EHR connectivity.\nComments Regarding Overall Growth Dynamics in 2018 . In 2017, the Company achieved a reacceleration of growth. Strong market adoption of the Company’s cloud-based platform offerings supported a 30% growth rate in the Company’s subscription-based cloud-based platform offerings and an organic revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter of 14% on a year-over-year basis. The Company's strong underlying business performance is expected to continue in 2018. Opposing these positive and accelerating growth factors, however, are the short-term effects of ACA-related decisions of certain health plans within Inovalon’s client base. Decisions by a limited number of clients to withdraw from ACA markets resulted in a decrease in contract activity, and in one case a contract non-renewal, that is expected to have an estimated combined negative impact of approximately 8% on Inovalon’s growth rate in 2018, predominantly seen in the first half of the year. The strong underlying organic growth of the Company is seen as surpassing this factor by the second half of the year, resulting in full year projected growth (excluding any unannounced acquisitions) of approximately 5% at the midpoint of guidance. Adjusting for the impact of these client-specific ACA decisions, Inovalon's growth rate in 2018 would be consistent with the Company's organic growth rate exiting the fourth quarter of 2017.\nManagement Transition\nInovalon’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Mr. Christopher Greiner, has accepted a new opportunity outside of the Company that is relocating him closer to his family in New York.\n“The last five years with Inovalon have been professionally invigorating and personally rewarding. Working alongside so many mission-driven colleagues and clients focused on transforming how technology can be the driving force to improving healthcare has been an enriching and humbling experience,” said Mr. Greiner.\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Greiner will remain with the Company until March 16, 2018. Mr. Jonathan Boldt, vice president of finance, has been named the interim chief financial officer until such time as a permanent replacement is named. Mr. Boldt joined the Company in 2012 and was previously with Deloitte & Touche, LLP. Mr. Greiner's operational responsibilities will report to Mr. Robert Wychulis, president of Inovalon.\n“The Company's capabilities in the areas of Finance and Operations have materially advanced over the years. One of the many key contributors enabling the Company's progress has been Jonathan,” said Dr. Keith Dunleavy, chief executive officer and chairman of Inovalon. “The Board, management team and I have a very high degree of confidence in Jonathan and we are pleased to see him take on another leadership role at Inovalon.”\nOther Financial Data and Key Metrics\nThe following constitute other financial and key metrics which are presented quarterly.\nGrowth of Datasets: At December 31, 2017, the MORE 2 Registry ® dataset contained more than 240 million unique patient counts and nearly 38 billion medical event counts, increases of 59% and 183%, respectively, compared with December 31, 2016.\nInvestment in Innovation: For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Inovalon’s ongoing investment supporting innovations in advanced, cloud-based platforms empowering a data-driven transformation from volume-based to value-based models was $26.4 million, or 23.0% of revenue. For the full year 2017, Inovalon’s Investment in Innovation was $85.8 million, or 19.1% of revenue.\nAnalytical Process Count Growth: Inovalon’s trailing 12-month Patient Analytics Months (PAM) count, which the Company believes is indicative of the Company’s overall level of analytical activity, grew to more than 42 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 60% as compared with December 31, 2016.\nPlease see the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for further detail regarding the preceding other financial data and key metrics.\nImpact of Changes in Tax Legislation\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company remeasured its ending deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 to reflect the decrease in the federal corporate tax rate. As a result, the Company recognized a $15.5 million tax benefit in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit recognized may be impacted if additional guidance is released. Also, as a result of the Tax Act, the Company expects its future effective tax rate to decrease, which is discussed in more detail below with respect to the Company's outlook for 2018.\nShares Outstanding\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Inovalon continued to repurchase shares of its Class A common stock in the open market, pursuant to its previously-announced share repurchase program, repurchasing approximately 1.9 million shares of Class A common stock for a total of $28.6 million. This brings the total number of shares repurchased from the open market since the start of the repurchase program to approximately 14.6 million shares. The share repurchase program expired on December 31, 2017. As of February 9, 2018, the Company had 63.4 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 81.0 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe combination of the above-referenced factors yield the following guidance for 2018.\nFinancial Metric 2018 Guidance Revenue $462 million to $482 million Net income $12 million to $16 million Adjusted EBITDA $113 million to $121 million Non-GAAP net income $44 million to $49 million Diluted net income per share $0.09 to $0.11 Non-GAAP diluted net income per share $0.31 to $0.35 Inovalon’s 2018 guidance excludes the impact of any additional acquisitions that have not yet been announced or consummated.\nReconciliations of net income, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP net income, identifying the differences between each of these Non-GAAP financial measures and net income, are included in this press release after the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile changes in the stock price could change the fully diluted share count, under the treasury stock method, the Company is assuming 140 million shares for the full year 2018. Additionally, the Company’s guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for the full year 2018.\nConference Call\nInovalon will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today.
