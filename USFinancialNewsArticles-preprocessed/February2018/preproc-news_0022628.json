    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 6:42 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago China Jan vehicle sales rise 11.6 percent - industry association Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - China’s automobile sales in January increased 11.59 percent from a year earlier to 2.81 million vehicles, an industry association said on Friday, a fast start to the year amid a broader slowdown in the world’s largest auto market. \nThe increase, the eighth straight month sales have risen, follows a 0.1 percent year-on-year increase in overall auto sales in December. \nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has previously forecast that China’s auto market will likely see growth of around 3 percent this year, in what would be a second straight year of lacklustre growth.
