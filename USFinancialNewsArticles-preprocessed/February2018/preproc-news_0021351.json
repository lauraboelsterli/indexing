    "text": "- Establishes 2018 First Quarter and Full Year Guidance -\n- Declares 2018 First Quarter Dividend of $0.63 per Common Share -\nWYOMISSING, Pa., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (NASDAQ:GLPI) (the “Company”), the first gaming-focused real estate investment trust (“REIT”) in North America, today announced results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2017\nActual 2017\nGuidance (1) 2016\nActual 2017\nActual 2017\nGuidance (1) 2016\nActual Net Revenue $ 240.7 $ 242.6 $ 238.8 $ 971.3 $ 973.2 $ 828.3 Net Income $ 93.3 $ 96.2 $ 93.7 $ 380.6 $ 383.6 $ 289.3 Funds From Operations (2) $ 118.5 $ 121.5 $ 118.6 $ 481.7 $ 484.7 $ 384.9 Adjusted Funds From Operations (3) $ 165.3 $ 168.0 $ 164.9 $ 669.5 $ 672.1 $ 542.1 Adjusted EBITDA (4) $ 219.9 $ 221.6 $ 218.2 $ 884.6 $ 886.3 $ 721.4 Net income, per diluted common share $ 0.43 $ 0.45 $ 0.45 $ 1.79 $ 1.80 $ 1.60\n(1) The guidance figures in the tables above present the guidance provided on October 26, 2017 for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n(2) Funds from operations (“FFO”) is net income, excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation as defined by NAREIT.\n(3) Adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) is FFO, excluding stock based compensation expense, debt issuance costs amortization, other depreciation, amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and direct financing lease adjustments, reduced by capital maintenance expenditures.\n(4) Adjusted EBITDA is net income, excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, direct financing lease adjustments and the amortization of land rights.\nChief Executive Officer, Peter M. Carlino, commented, “Our portfolio of diversified real estate assets continues to deliver dependable cash flow, with cash rent during the fourth quarter slightly exceeding guidance. We believe our high quality regional gaming assets and well-respected operators are effectively positioned to produce stable and predictable cash flow for our shareholders.”\nMr. Carlino continued, “Our focus remains on identifying opportunities to grow AFFO. In the fourth quarter, our two largest tenants, Penn National Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:PENN) and Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:PNK), announced that PENN intends to acquire PNK. In agreeing to the transaction, we announced that we would be acquiring two new physical assets, PENN’s Plainridge Park Casino and PNK’s Belterra Park, for approximately $315 million. Additionally, in order to facilitate the transaction, we intend to enter into a new lease with Boyd Gaming Corp. (NYSE:BYD), whereby BYD will become the operator for four casino operations they are acquiring from PNK. In aggregate, this transaction will increase our total annual rent by approximately $46 million and will be accretive to our shareholders at closing. We are excited to partner with PENN, PNK and BYD to complete this transaction and demonstrate our commitment to creating value for our shareholders. We continue to explore opportunities for further acquisitions and we remain focused on transactions that will enhance existing GLPI shareholder value. In our view, seller expectations are often inflated relative to interest rate risk and the market-based performance risk of the assets offered for sale. We intend to pursue only transactions where the level of accretion compensates for these risks and continues through economic cycles associated with long term leases.”\nThe Company’s fourth quarter net income, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA as compared to guidance were primarily impacted by the following:\nCorporate overhead had a unfavorable variance of $1.9 million, primarily due to an additional bonus accrual as a result of the pending transaction with PENN, PNK, and BYD; Interest expense had a favorable variance of $0.5 million; and Income tax had an unfavorable variance of $1.8 million due to an adjustment at the TRS Properties for the December 22, 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The TRS Properties' deferred taxes were adjusted to reflect the newly enacted 21% tax rate from the previous 35% tax rate.\nPortfolio Update\nGLPI owns over 4,400 acres of land and approximately 15 million square feet of building space, which was 100% occupied as of December 31, 2017. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company owned the real estate associated with 38 casino facilities and leases 20 of these facilities to PENN, 15 of these facilities to PNK and one to Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois. Two of the gaming facilities, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Perryville, Maryland, are owned and operated by a subsidiary of GLPI, GLP Holdings, Inc., (collectively, the “TRS Properties”).\nCapital maintenance expenditures at the TRS Properties were $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet Update\nThe Company had $29.1 million of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion in total debt, including $1.1 billion of debt outstanding under its unsecured credit facility term loans and no outstanding balance under its unsecured credit facility revolver at December 31, 2017. The Company’s debt structure as of December 31, 2017 was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2017 Interest Rate Balance (in thousands) Unsecured Term Loan A (1) 3.052 % $ 230,000 Unsecured Term Loan A-1 (1) 2.960 % 825,000 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2018 4.375 % 550,000 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2020 4.875 % 1,000,000 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2021 4.375 % 400,000 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2023 5.375 % 500,000 Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2026 5.375 % 975,000 Capital Lease 4.780 % 1,230 Total long-term debt $ 4,481,230 Less: unamortized debt issuance costs (38,350 ) Total long-term debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs $ 4,442,880\n(1) The rate on the term loan facilities and revolver is LIBOR plus 1.50%. The Company's revolver and $300.0 million term loan credit facility mature on October 28, 2018 and the incremental term loan of $825.0 million matures on April 28, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had 212,751,346 weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nDividends\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared the fourth quarter 2017 dividend.

The Company believes FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company’s current business. This is especially true since these measures exclude real estate depreciation, and we believe that real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. In addition, in order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it must distribute 90% of its REIT taxable income annually. The Company adjusts AFFO accordingly to provide our investors an estimate of taxable income for this distribution requirement. Direct financing lease adjustments represent the portion of cash rent we receive from tenants that is applied against our lease receivable and thus not recorded as revenue and the amortization of land rights represents the non-cash amortization of the value assigned to the Company's assumed ground leases.\nFFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures, that are considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding (gains) or losses from sales of property and real estate depreciation. We have defined AFFO as FFO excluding stock based compensation expense, debt issuance costs amortization, other depreciation, amortization of land rights, straight-line rent adjustments and direct financing lease adjustments, reduced by capital maintenance expenditures. Finally, we have defined Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest, taxes on income, depreciation, (gains) or losses from sales of property, stock based compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, direct financing lease adjustments and the amortization of land rights.\nFFO, AFFO and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP. Because certain companies do not calculate FFO, AFFO, and Adjusted EBITDA in the same way and certain other companies may not perform such calculation, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating profit or net income. The Company’s presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of the Company’s financial results in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Gaming and Leisure Properties\nGLPI is engaged in the business of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements, pursuant to which the tenant is responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. GLPI expects to grow its portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional gaming facilities to lease to gaming operators. GLPI also intends to diversify its portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties outside the gaming industry to lease to third parties. GLPI elected to be taxed as a REIT for United States federal income tax purposes commencing with the 2014 taxable year and is the first gaming-focused REIT in North America.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter of 2018 and the full 2018 fiscal year; our expectations regarding future acquisitions and the expected impact of PENN's proposed acquisition of PNK, refinancing of indebtedness and dividend payments.
