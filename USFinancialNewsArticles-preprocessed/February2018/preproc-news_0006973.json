    "text": "Top News \nSony Chief Steps Down \nKazuo “Kaz” Hirai will hand over the reins at Sony to CFO Kenichiro Yoshida at the start of the next financial year. Hirai, who has been at the helm for six years, will become chairman, and strategy chief Hiroki Totoki will move into Yoshida’s post. “Mr. Yoshida combines a deeply strategic mindset with a relentless determination to achieve defined targets, and the ability to take a global viewpoint,” said Hirai. The Verge \nCBS-Viacom Merger Talk \nCBS’s board has convened a team to “evaluate a potential combination with Viacom Inc.” and Viacom, too, has retained independent legal counsel and financial advisors to look into the idea. For now, there are no guarantees of anything, although mutual parent National Amusements is all for it. The announcements sent both companies’ share prices upwards. Variety \nDeutsche Bank Loss \nDeutsche Bank has posted its third consecutive annual loss. This time analysts forecast a loss of €290 million ($363 million) but the German banking giant instead lost €497 million. Reasons included a drop in revenue from Deutsche Bank’s investment banking side, “challenging markets,” and the U.S. tax law. Without a tax-reform-based non-cash charge of around €1.4 billion, Deutsche Bank said, it would have instead posted a full-year income of €900 million. Deutsche Bank \nBitcoin Crash \nBitcoin’s value continues to take a kicking, thanks to reasons ranging from India planning a ban on using cryptocurrencies for purchases, to continued fears over the possibility that bitcoin prices have been artificially propped up. The price had fallen below $8,250 at the time of writing. Fortune Around the Water Cooler \nPolish Memory \nAs controversy rages over the Polish government’s criminalization of suggestions that Poles were complicit in the Holocaust, Politico’s Jan Cienski shares family recollections of that time in order to demonstrate the complexity of the situation. His grandparents helped to hide Jews from the Nazis, but the fugitives were eventually spotted and betrayed by other Poles. Politico \nChina and the Catholic Church \nPope Francis will reportedly lift the excommunications of seven state-appointed Chinese Catholic bishops. If true, this may lead to the Chinese government accepting his legitimacy as head of the Catholic Church in the country, and perhaps a reunification of the state-controlled church and the underground church that is loyal to Rome. Wall Street Journal \nBelt and Road Courts \nWhen disputes arise between Chinese companies and their counterparts in other markets, who will settle them? According to China, the answer lies in new “international courts” sited in Beijing, Xián and Shenzhen. Many companies are understandably concerned that these courts might favor Chinese companies. What happens next may be crucial in characterizing China’s “Belt and Road” foreign infrastructure-building initiative. CNBC \nZuma Tries to Hang On \nSouth African President Jacob Zuma is reportedly determined to present the annual State of the Nation address on Thursday, despite growing calls to remove him from office. His ANC party has a new president in the form of Cyril Ramaphosa, and the scandal-engulfed Zuma is certainly on his way out at some point. The question now is how long he will try to hang onto his position, even if it means risking impeachment and losing all his presidential benefits as a result.
