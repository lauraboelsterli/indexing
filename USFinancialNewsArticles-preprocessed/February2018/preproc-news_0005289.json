(NYSE:ROP), a diversified technology company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nRoper reports results – including revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, and diluted earnings per share (“DEPS”) – on a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFourth quarter GAAP and adjusted revenue increased 21% to $1.23 billion, and organic revenue grew 5%. GAAP gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 62.4% and adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 62.6%.\nGAAP DEPS was $4.27, and adjusted DEPS was $2.70, a 23% increase. Adjusted results exclude a one-time net gain of $215 million resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in addition to customary adjustments.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 21% to $441 million. Operating cash flow and free cash flow both increased 36% to $369 million and $353 million, respectively.\nFull Year 2017\nFull year GAAP revenue increased 22% to $4.61 billion and adjusted revenue grew 23% to $4.67 billion. GAAP gross margin expanded 70 basis points to 62.2% and adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 62.6%.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 22% to $1.60 billion. Operating cash flow grew to $1.23 billion, a 28% increase and a 23% increase on an adjusted basis.\n“2017 was a remarkable year for Roper as our strategic focus on asset-light diversified technology businesses continued to drive shareholder value,’’ said Brian Jellison, Roper’s Chairman, President and CEO. “Cash flow performance across our operations was outstanding, helping us reduce debt by $1.06 billion and operate with negative working capital for the first time. Our strong organic revenue growth was enhanced by contributions from our large 2016 software acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, which exceeded our initial revenue and cash flow expectations for the year.”\n2018 Outlook and Guidance\n“The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide significant benefits for Roper,” said Mr. Jellison. “The expected decrease in our effective tax rate will lead to increases in both earnings and cash flow in 2018 and beyond. Furthermore, our ability to better access our cash worldwide will enable us to accelerate investment and continue pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities from a robust pipeline.”\nRoper expects full year adjusted DEPS between $10.88 and $11.20 with first quarter adjusted DEPS between $2.44 and $2.50.\nThe Company’s guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures.\nConference Call to be Held at 8:30 AM (ET) Today\nA conference call to discuss these results has been scheduled for 8:30 AM ET on Friday, February 2, 2018.
