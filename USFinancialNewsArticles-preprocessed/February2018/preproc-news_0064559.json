Kendall, MD, a world renowned diabetes expert, joined MannKind as Chief Medical Officer in February 2018\nWESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MannKind Corporation (NASDAQ:MNKD) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Afrezza net revenue was $4.5 million, an increase of 125% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and 238% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter net revenue is a favorable adjustment for a change in estimate of $1.4 million. The change in estimate relates to obtaining new and more comprehensive data regarding the inventory in the distribution channel – specifically inventory in the retail channel. This data indicated that the amount of inventory in the distribution channel was less than had been previously estimated using syndicated prescription data. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of Afrezza shipped to wholesale and retail channels, but not yet recognized as net revenue, was $3.0 million, the same amount as September 30, 2017. A reconciliation of gross to net revenues can be found in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCost of goods sold was $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $0.4 million and $3.4 million respectively. Cost of goods sold during these periods is greater than the associated product sales due to the under-utilization of our manufacturing facility.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2017. The $0.9 million decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in clinical study expenses and a $0.4 million decrease in compensation expenses. Research and development expenses were $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a period-over-period increase of $1.9 million which was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in compensation costs, a $1.4 million increase in consultant and supply costs and a $0.3 million increase in facilities costs, all due to increased clinical studies, partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million related to a one-time FDA submission fee for a label expansion incurred in 2016 that did not recur in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. The $5.6 million increase was primarily due to $5.0 million in selling expenses associated with our first direct-to-consumer television advertising campaign in the fourth quarter of 2017. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $15.3 million representing a period-over-period increase of $8.0 million which was primarily due to the $5.0 million DTC TV campaign and growth in our commercial infrastructure.\nThe net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $32.8 million, or $0.28 per share based on 116.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to a $32.9 million net loss in the third quarter of 2017 or $0.31 per share based on 104.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we had net income of $54.0 million, or $0.56 per share based on 95.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. The net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 included net collaboration revenue of $10.2 million related to our license and collaboration agreement with Sanofi and a $72.0 million gain from the extinguishment of debt owed to Sanofi pursuant to a settlement agreement.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nDue to the termination of the Sanofi license and collaboration agreement in early 2016 and our commencement of commercial activities for Afrezza in the third quarter of 2016, a comparative analysis for Afrezza product revenue and commercial support between the year ended December 31, 2017 and the prior year is not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total net revenue of $11.7 million was comprised of $9.2 million of Afrezza net revenue, $1.7 million from the net revenue of surplus bulk insulin to a third party, $0.6 million from the sale of certain oncology intellectual property, and $0.3 million from collaboration net revenue.\nResearch and development expenses were $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $14.9 million for the prior year. The $0.8 million decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million decrease in research and development expenses associated with a reduction in workforce in 2016, and a one-time FDA submission fee for label expansion of $1.0 million incurred in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in clinical trial expenses, a $0.7 million increase in expenses incurred for the development of manufacturing improvements.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $75.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $46.9 million for the prior year, an increase of $28.1 million primarily due to the creation of a commercial support infrastructure after termination of the Sanofi license and collaboration agreement.\nThe loss on foreign currency translation is related to our purchase commitment for insulin which is denominated in Euros. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the loss was $13.6 million as compared to a gain of $3.4 million in the prior year, a $17.1 million change due to the unfavorable movement of the U.S. dollar-Euro exchange rate.\nThe net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $117.3 million, or $1.13 per share based on 104.2 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to net income for the prior year of $125.7 million, or $1.37 per share based on 92.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. The net income for the prior year included net revenue – collaboration of $171.1 million and a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $72.0 million due to the recognition of previously deferred revenue following the termination of the Sanofi license and collaboration agreement.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 increased to $43.9 million compared to $22.9 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to cash inflows of $57.7 million of net proceeds from a registered direct offering of common stock, $0.5 million through sales under the at-the-market equity offering facility, $30.6 million received from Sanofi pursuant to a settlement agreement, $16.7 million from the sale of our Valencia, CA facility, $15.4 million from a net increase of debt, and cash received from revenue of $12.5 million offset in part by commercial and general corporate spending of $95.6 million. In addition to the $43.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, the Company had $4.4 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2017 of which $3.2 million was released in January 2018 following a conversion of Facility Financing Obligation debt to equity. The net cash used in operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $30.0 million.\n2H 2017 Results vs. Guidance\nAfrezza gross revenue was $8.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared with a range of $9-$14 million. Afrezza net revenue was $6.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared with a range of $6-$10 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $30.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $23.3 million in the third quarter 2017 totaling $53.3 million compared with a range of $48-$56 million.\nConference Call\nMannKind and presentation webcast to discuss these results today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
