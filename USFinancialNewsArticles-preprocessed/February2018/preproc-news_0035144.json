    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - A man died after two vehicles collided on the airfield at London’s Heathrow Airport, Europe’s biggest hub, police said on Wednesday. \n“One male, is believed to have sustained a broken shoulder; his injuries are not life-threatening or life-changing,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. \n“Another male, aged in his 40s, was taken to a west London hospital with serious injuries. He has since died.” \nSome passengers had to disembark from a plane due to the incident, a spokeswoman for the airport said. \n“We will be fully cooperating with the police in the investigation which will follow,” Heathrow said in a statement. \nThe airport was not closed as a result of the accident. \nReporting by Costas Pitas; Editing by William Schomberg\n ",
