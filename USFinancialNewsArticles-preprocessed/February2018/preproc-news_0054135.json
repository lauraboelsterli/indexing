    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its previously announced agreements in principle to sell its St. Louis stations, Emmis Communications Corporation (Nasdaq: EMMS) announced today that it has entered into definitive agreements to sell its St. Louis stations KSHE (94.7 FM) and The Point (KPNT, 105.7 FM) to Hubbard Radio for $45 million, and St. Louis stations KFTK (FM News Talk 97.1 FM) and NOW (KNOU, 96.3 FM) to Entercom Communications Corp for $15 million. The transactions are subject to FCC approval as well as closing adjustments and prorations.\nLocal Marketing Agreements (LMAs) of the stations will start March 1. The final transactions are expected to close in Emmis' first fiscal quarter.\nEmmis said net proceeds, after deducting transaction-related costs and estimated tax payments, will be used to repay term loans outstanding.\n\"The St. Louis team has been an integral part of our Emmis family since 1984. We love our people in St. Louis and the team's performance has been nothing short of remarkable,\" said Jeff Smulyan, Chairman and CEO of Emmis. \"Hubbard and Entercom are both tremendous radio operators and they are adding great people and great brands to their St. Louis clusters.\"\nNote: Certain statements included in this press release which are not statements of historical fact, including but not limited to those identified with the words \"expect,\" \"will\" or \"look\" are intended to be, and are, by this Note, identified as \"forward-looking statements,\" as defined in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Emmis to be materially different from any future result, performance or achievement expressed or implied by such forward-looking statement.
