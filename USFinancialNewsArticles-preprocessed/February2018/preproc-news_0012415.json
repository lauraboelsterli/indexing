    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ING Capital LLC (\"ING\") has led a $297.6 million financing package on behalf of Starwood Global Opportunity Fund X (\"SOF X\") used to acquire One South Dearborn, a 40-story, Class A, office tower located in downtown Chicago's Central Loop. The acquisition closed on January 24, 2018. ING, as Administrative Agent, fully underwrote and closed a $235.1 million senior loan. In addition Deutsche Asset Management provided a $62.5 million mezzanine loan at closing on behalf of one of its private investors. ING expects to syndicate a portion of the senior loan in the coming weeks.\nOne South Dearborn was developed by Hines in 2005 and has been anchored by Sidley Austin LLP (\"Sidley\") since its completion. Sidley is one of the nation's largest law firms and recently renewed its lease at the property. The trophy property combines innovative design, technology-enabled infrastructure and a five-star amenity package.\n\"Starwood is very excited to add One South Dearborn to SOF X's portfolio. It is one of the top office properties in Chicago's Loop,\" said Austin Nowlin, Head of Capital Markets at Starwood Capital Group. \"ING was the perfect partner for us on this transaction. They were able to move very quickly, offer competitive terms with a great deal of flexibility, and provide us with certainty of execution which was critical for this transaction.\"\n\"ING is thrilled to have supported Starwood Capital, one of our global clients, in its acquisition of One South Dearborn,\" said Craig Bender, Managing Director and Head of US Real Estate Finance at ING. \"The opportunity to finance One South Dearborn was very welcome given the quality of the property and the strength of downtown Chicago's office market, which has seen a significant increase in demand over recent years due to urban migration from the suburbs.\"\nPress enquiries:\nElaine Clark\nElaine.Clark@ing.com\n+1646-424-7021\nAbout ING\nING Capital LLC is an indirect U.S. subsidiary of ING Group N.V.
