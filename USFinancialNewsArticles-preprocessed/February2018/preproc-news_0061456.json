    "text": "MOUNT KISCO, N.Y., Feb 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- All For One Media Corp. (OTCQB â€“ AFOM), an SEC fully reporting Branded Entertainment Company across multiple platforms, announces the appointment of Howard Kra as Chief Operating Officer. An innovative leader and entrepreneur, Mr. Kra's business experience spans Wall Street, Private Investment Firms, and his own startup companies. He began his career in 1982 as a wealth advisor at Lehman Brothers in New York, rising rapidly to become a Senior Vice President. In 1993, Mr. Kra relocated to Washington D.C. to join Morgan Stanley as a Senior Vice President, serving until 2002. During his time on Wall Street, Mr. Kra participated in industry consolidations/rollups in the advertising, courier/logistics, and telecommunications industries. Mr. Kra played an instrumental role in the launching of Streamline.com , a pioneering e-commerce company that he helped take public in 1999, raising $45 million before it was acquired by Peapod. Following that, Mr. Kra helped lead the founder of Advanced Communications Group through the process of going public and raising $115 million. In 2004, he became a partner and private investor at Atlantic Capital Group. While there, he worked closely with the beverage company Honest Tea (acquired by Coca-Cola Corp) both as an advisor and early investor. Most recently, Mr. Kra has been working closely with startups through his consulting company, Kra Consults.\nBrian Lukow, AFOM's CEO, stated, \"We are thrilled that Howard Kra has agreed to join the AFOM management team. I've known Howard for over 30 years and strongly believe he has the perfect combination of experience, work ethic and creativity in both finance and marketing as AFOM transitions from a development stage company to a producer of high quality content for the tween demographic.\"\nHoward Kra stated, \"I've known Brian my whole professional career and am beyond excited at the opportunity to work alongside him. I have always had a strong passion for the entertainment industry and look forward to further developing the All for One Media platform.\"\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howard-kra-joins-all-for-one-media-corp-as-chief-operating-officer-300605480.html\nSOURCE All For One Media Corp.",
