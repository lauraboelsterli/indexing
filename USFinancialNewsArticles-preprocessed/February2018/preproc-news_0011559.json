    "text": "Two senators are introducing compromise legislation that would help achieve legal status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children.\nThe bill calls for bolstering border security by 2020. But it does not explicitly provide money for a border wall with Mexico, the focus of President Donald Trump 's immigration policies.\nThe plan is a more modest approach than Trump has sought for protecting \"Dreamers,\" young immigrants helped by the Obama -era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\nIt lacks Trump's demands for limiting the relatives that \"Dreamers\" can sponsor for citizenship, and ending a visa lottery aimed at admitting more immigrants from diverse places including Africa.\nTrump swung back hard against more conciliatory immigration proposals, saying, \"Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time\" in a tweet Monday morning.\nTrump tweet \nThe measure is by Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons .\nâ€”CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.",
