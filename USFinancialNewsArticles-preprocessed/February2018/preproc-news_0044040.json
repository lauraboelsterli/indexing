    "text": "* Stronger dollar makes oil costlier for some buyers\n* API report showed lower U.S. crude inventories (Updates throughout, changes dateline from SINGAPORE)\nLONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, dragged lower by a firmer dollar that offset support from a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories.\nBrent crude futures were down 28 cents at $65.14 a barrel by 1007 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures dropped 37 cents to $61.31 a barrel.\nThe dollar rose to a one-week high against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, after minutes of the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed policymakers were more confident of the need to keep raising interest rates.\nWith the strengthening dollar, the oil price has lost nearly 10 percent since hitting a multi-year high above $70 in January.\n\"Given the markets whipsaw reaction we could add another key takeaway, that recent heightened market volatility could be here to stay,\" LCG markets strategist Jasper Lawler said.\nThe correlation between moves in the oil price and the dollar has strengthened in the last couple of weeks, as investors increasingly sell other assets to buy the U.S. currency on expectations of a faster pace of rate rises.\n\"The firming dollar continues to thwart investor sentiment despite the bullish inventory data,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA.\nA stronger dollar pushes up the bill for countries paying for imports in other currencies, potentially curbing demand.\nThe American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday reported an unexpected drop in U.S. crude oil inventories by 907,000 barrels to 420.3 million barrels for the week to Feb. 16.\nInventories usually rise at this time of year, as many refineries cut crude intake to conduct maintenance, but a bottleneck in Canada's pipeline system has reduced U.S. imports and pushed U.S. stocks lower.\n\"Improved pipeline infrastructure to the Gulf coast and the decreased supply via TransCanada's Keystone pipeline, sent ... inventories tumbling,\" Innes said.\nBut analysts said oil markets were still generally well supported due to rising demand for crude and production restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.\n\"OPEC production curbs have stabilised the market. Adherence to (the) agreement has been relatively good,\" Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ bank, said in a report on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Edmund Blair)",
