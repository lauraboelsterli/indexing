    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 23 (Reuters) - China’s imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose to a record in January, as the world’s most populous nation rushed to shore up supplies ahead of another cold snap and the Spring Festival celebrations this month.\nArrivals totalled 5.18 million tonnes, compared with the previous record of 5.03 million tonnes set in December and up 51.2 percent from January 2017, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs released on Friday.\nPurchases spiked to cover a surge in demand under Beijing’s push to replace coal with gas for households and factories, leading companies to pull in cargoes from suppliers as diverse as Nigeria, Angola and Norway.\nImports were affected by the timing of the Spring Festival, which fell in February this year, rather than January as in 2017.
