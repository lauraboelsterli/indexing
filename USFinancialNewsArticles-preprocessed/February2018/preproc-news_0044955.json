(NASDAQ: SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today reported business highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“By thinking differently about CNS, Sage has accelerated innovation across the development cycle, from discovery through development, and is now progressing toward potential commercial operations and patient care,” said Jeff Jonas, M.D., chief executive officer of Sage. “While our 2017 achievements demonstrate the strength of our R&D organization, successful execution against our 2018 goals will drive our planned transition to a commercial company with the opportunity to create a new standard of care for women with postpartum depression. In addition, our broad portfolio of fully-owned, internally developed molecules creates further opportunity to transform the lives of patients with life-altering CNS disorders and the potential to drive near and long-term value.”\nPipeline Updates\nSage is advancing a portfolio of novel CNS product candidates targeting the GABA and NMDA receptor systems. Dysfunction in these systems is known to be at the core of numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders.\nGABA Programs\nSage is developing its proprietary intravenous (IV) formulation of brexanolone and a pipeline of novel, next-generation positive allosteric modulators of synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA A receptors.\nBrexanolone IV in Postpartum Depression (PPD): Following a pre-NDA meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Sage remains on track to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA in 1H 2018. Sage anticipates presenting detailed study results from the Phase 3 program of brexanolone IV in PPD at upcoming medical meetings and through publication. SAGE-217 in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD): The FDA recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to SAGE-217 for the treatment of MDD based on the positive results from the Phase 2, placebo-controlled trial of SAGE-217 in 89 adult patients with moderate to severe MDD. Sage plans to initiate additional clinical trials of SAGE-217 in MDD in 2018. SAGE-217 in Postpartum Depression: Sage is currently conducting a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in severe PPD. Sage believes the positive Phase 2 trial of SAGE-217 in MDD and positive Phase 3 trials of brexanolone in PPD support maximizing the utility of the ongoing Phase 2 trial of SAGE-217 in PPD. Sage increased the size of the ongoing trial and expects top-line results in 4Q 2018. SAGE-217 in Bipolar Depression, Parkinson’s Disease and Insomnia: Sage plans to initiate clinical development of SAGE-217 in bipolar depression and continue further clinical development of SAGE-217 in Parkinson’s disease and disorders of sleep in 2018. Sage believes that available data from studies of MDD, Parkinson’s disease and a healthy volunteer insomnia model support further exploration in these indications. SAGE-324: SAGE-324 is currently in IND-enabling studies and is intended to be developed with a focus on indications involving GABA hypofunction, such as essential tremor and epileptiform disorders. Sage expects to initiate a Phase 1 trial of SAGE-324 in 1H 2018. GABA Discovery Programs: Sage is currently evaluating a series of novel GABA A receptor modulators in pre-clinical development, including SAGE-689, SAGE-105, and others.\nNMDA Programs\nSage is developing novel, oral, first-in-class oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor, which may have potential in the treatment of a range of neurological disorders associated with a variety of cognitive, neurological and behavioral symptoms.\nSAGE-718: Sage previously announced it completed a Phase 1 single-ascending dose study of SAGE-718 in healthy volunteers. SAGE-718 was generally well-tolerated with no severe adverse events. The pharmacokinetics of SAGE-718 were highly predictable with low variability. Sage expects to initiate a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose program of SAGE-718 in 1H 2018. SAGE-904: Sage recently announced it selected SAGE-904 as its second NMDA receptor positive allosteric modulator product candidate for development. SAGE-904 has a differentiated pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic profile from SAGE-718. SAGE-904 is currently in IND-enabling studies.\nExpected Milestones\nTrial Initiations: Phase 1 program for SAGE-324 (1H 2018) Phase 1 multiple ascending dose program of SAGE-718 (1H 2018) Trials of SAGE-217 in MDD, bipolar depression, Parkinson’s disease, and sleep disorders (2018) Data Readouts: Results from Phase 1 multiple ascending dose program of SAGE-718 (2H 2018) Results from recently expanded Phase 2 trial of SAGE-217 in PPD (4Q 2018) Results from trials of SAGE-217 in MDD, bipolar depression, Parkinson’s disease, and sleep disorders (2018-2019) Regulatory and Commercial: NDA filing in U.S. for brexanolone in PPD (1H 2018) Brexanolone commercial launch in PPD, if approved (1H 2019)\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017\n“Sage has a track-record of executing with a very deliberate R&D strategy and a disciplined investment philosophy,” said Kimi Iguchi, chief financial officer of Sage. “Our robust balance sheet and strategic approach to spending facilitate the continued expansion of our commercial, manufacturing, quality, and medical affairs capabilities as part of our planned transition to a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company and enable the continued development of Sage’s broad CNS pipeline.”\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 were $518.8 million, compared with $397.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds of $325.8 million from Sage's follow-on public offering completed in November 2017. In February 2018, Sage completed an underwritten public offering, which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $631.1 million. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $50.9 million, including $5.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $42.0 million, including $5.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, for the same period of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, research and development expenses were $210.3 million, including $19.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, compared to $120.8 million, including $11.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, for the same period of 2016. The increase in R&D expenses year-over-year was primarily due to Phase 3 clinical development of brexanolone and CMC work in preparation for a potential filing for regulatory approval; the ongoing Phase 2 development of SAGE-217; ongoing early-stage R&D programs and discovery efforts focused on identifying new development candidates and additional indications of interest; and investments in R&D headcount to support the growth in Sage's pipeline and operations. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $19.6 million, including $4.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $14.4 million, including $5.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, for the same period of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, G&A expenses were $62.9 million, including $15.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, compared to $39.4 million, including $11.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, for the same period of 2016. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to the increase in personnel-related expenses, professional fees to support expanding operations, costs related to continued preparations for a potential commercial launch, and facilities-related costs to support expanding operations. Net Loss: Net loss was $69.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $270.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $55.9 million and $159.0 million, respectively, for the comparable periods of 2016.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nBased upon its current operating plan, Sage anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and estimated brexanolone product sales, if the product is approved, will enable Sage to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2020. Sage expects that its operating expenses will increase year over year in 2018 to support continued pipeline advancement and potential product commercialization of brexanolone in PPD.\nConference Call Information\nSage will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 AM ET to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and recent corporate updates.
