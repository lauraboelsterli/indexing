    "text": "6:43 AM EST \nThings may be starting to look up for ride-hailing app Uber after a tumultuous 2017. \nDuring the fourth quarter, the company posted a loss of $1.1 billion , down from $1.46 billion in losses in the third quarter, according to figures first published by The Information Tuesday. \nRead: Uber’s Waymo Settlement Seen as a Win for New CEO \nUber’s revenue for the quarter also grew to about $11.1 billion, up from $9 billion—a not insignificant accomplishment for CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in his first full quarter leading the company. \nThe full year picture is less bright. Uber lost $4.5 billion in 2017, up from $2.8 billion the year before, or a 61% increase in losses, according to figures confirmed by CNBC . \nRead: Uber Is Setting New Limits to Help Prevent Accidents From Drowsy Driving \nDespite this, Uber appears poised to move forward, putting a string of scandals and the departure of CEO Travis Kalanick behind it. The company last week reached a settlement with self-driving company Waymo over trade secrets. And last month, Uber raised $14 billion in funding in a deal with SoftBank and other investors.
