Shanghai stocks have declined 6.4 percent this month. ** About 15.10 billion shares were traded on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 72.2 20.91 billion shares a day. The volume in the previous trading session was 17.42 billion. ** As of 07:05 GMT, 27.74 Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 15.05 1.9 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has risen by 1.17 percent to 29.50 trillion yuan.
