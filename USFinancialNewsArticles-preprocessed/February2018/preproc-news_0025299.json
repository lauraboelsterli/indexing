    "text": "LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain’s Nationwide Building Society on Friday reported a 6 percent fall in nine-month statutory pretax profit hurt by lower consumer spending following the UK’s vote to leave the European Union.\nThe country’s second-biggest mortgage provider said its cost to income ratio rose to 59.6 percent from 57.6 percent a year earlier as its defined benefit pension costs increased.\nNationwide said lending to homeowners also fell, amid tough competition in the mortgage market that is hitting profitability.
