It also expects 50 percent growth in its core international service, in part by strengthening partnerships with foreign airlines.\nThe carrier is a major player in the growing budget aviation market in Japan, where its brands Vanilla Air and Peach Aviation compete against Jetstar Japan, a joint venture between JAL and Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd, as well as a newly re-launched AirAsia Japan.\nANA said Tokyo-based Vanilla and Osaka-based Peach would look to launch medium-haul flights of up to eight hours flying time from Japan, from around 2020.\nIn October, CEO Yumi Hirako told Reuters the airline was considering whether to shift some ageing Boeing Co 767 aircraft from its premium brand to the low-cost offshoots to start medium-length flights.\nANA on Thursday said it planned to introduce “a new small size medium-haul aircraft” for the business, without referring to any particular model.\nAirbus SE on Wednesday said the A321LR, the world’s longest-range single-aisle jet, had made its maiden flight. Rival Boeing Co is studying proposals for a compact twin-aisle jet.\nANA overtook its once-bankrupt rival Japan Airlines Co (JAL) in 2016 to become the country’s biggest international airline and holds a higher Skytrax rating for passenger service and comfort.\nANA benefitted from JAL’s bankruptcy by winning slots at Haneda Airport, the airport preferred by business travellers departing from or arriving in Tokyo.\nOperating profit jumped around 25 percent in the three months to December, to about 50.9 billion yen ($465 million), according to Reuters calculations based on the company’s results for the first nine months of the fiscal year.\nANA maintained its forecast that operating profit for the year to March would hit 160 billion yen.\n$1 = 109.5100 yen Reporting by Minami Funakoshi in TOKYO; Additional reporting by Jamie Freed in SINGAPORE; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ",
