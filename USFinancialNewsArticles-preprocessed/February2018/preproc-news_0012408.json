    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Chinese video-streaming firm Leshi Internet Information & Technology said it has 5.62 billion yuan ($890 million) of loans and liabilities due in 2018.\nLeshi last week flagged that it expected a loss of 11.6 billion yuan for 2017 due to the ongoing financial crisis at its founder Jia Yueting’s LeEco conglomerate.\nLeshi had said it had loans and financial liabilities totalling 9.29 billion yuan, while its largest shareholder Jia and related LeEco units owe it 7.5 billion yuan. LeEco had disputed that figure.\nLeshi, which listed the amount of loans and liabilities due at the end of this year in a statement late on Friday, used to be the main listed unit of Jia’s LeEco.\nBut Leshi, controlled now by property developer Sunac China - its second-largest shareholder, is trying to distance itself from the LeEco brand.\nLeEco was once China’s Netflix-to-Tesla contender but ran into a cash crunch since late 2016 after expanding too fast.
