    "text": "PLANO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rent-A-Center, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ/NGS: RCII) today announced results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“I am excited to be back at Rent-A-Center to lead the organization through these challenging times and believe my experience spanning over 30 years in the business will be invaluable. I fully understand the headwinds the Company is facing and will aggressively pursue a path that brings the Company back to health. The fourth quarter performance was more challenging than the Company expected and demonstrated the need for change,” stated Mitch Fadel, Chief Executive Officer of Rent-A-Center.\n“In order to improve company performance, we are focusing our attention on reducing costs and improving cash flow. We also intend to improve traffic trends through a more targeted value proposition and customer centric approach. In addition, we have also initiated efforts to more aggressively expand our franchising operations in order to enhance our brand in a more capital-efficient way.”\nMr. Fadel continued, “In December, the Board of Directors engaged AlixPartners, a well-known business consulting firm, to assist the Company in identifying financial cost-savings and efficiencies. We are pleased to report the Company has identified approximately $100 million of annualized EBITDA and working capital opportunities. Additionally, the new tax reform, passed in December of 2017, is expected to generate a material benefit to cash taxes of approximately $200 million over the next three years, which the Company expects to utilize to improve our capital position by paying down debt. These cost reductions and working capital opportunities will be pursued alongside our Board of Directors ongoing review and evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives in an effort to maximize stockholder value.”\nStrategic Plan\nThe Company's strategic plan will now focus on several improvement areas including a significant cost savings plan, a more targeted value proposition, and a refranchising program. The Company will track performance against these areas to monitor progress on a quarterly basis.\nThe Company is targeting significant cost savings opportunities across the business in the areas of overhead, supply chain and other store expenses. The updated value proposition in the Core is intended to improve traffic trends with a balanced approach of competitively pricing elastic categories while capturing more margin in inelastic categories. Within Acceptance NOW, the value proposition will center around improved return on investment through a shorter payback period and higher ownership levels. Refranchising brick and mortar locations will enable the Company to maintain and grow its presence while using proceeds to pay down debt.\nConsolidated Overview\nExplanations of performance are excluding special items and compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted.\nOn a Consolidated basis, total revenues of $639.0 million declined by 6.6 percent primarily due to closures of certain of the Company's Acceptance NOW locations, a same store sales decline of 2.0 percent and the 2017 hurricane activity. Net profit and diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, were $34.8 million and $0.65 compared to net loss and diluted loss per share of $146.4 million and $2.76 in the fourth quarter of last year.\nGAAP earnings benefited by $1.45 per share related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) passed in December of 2017, which resulted in the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities to a 21 percent federal tax rate.\nExcluding special items, the Company’s diluted loss per share was $0.41 and the Company generated negative $8.5 million in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue decreased 390 basis points versus the third quarter.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated $110.5 million of cash from operations, ended the fourth quarter with $73.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, and reduced its outstanding debt balance by $52.5 million.\nSegment Operating Performance\nCORE U.S. fourth quarter revenues of $444.7 million decreased 6.0 percent primarily due to a same store sales decline of 3.6 percent, the impact from the 2017 hurricanes and the rationalization of the Core U.S. store base. In addition, same store sales was negatively impacted by higher promotional free time activity in the quarter. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year increased 10 basis points. Labor decreased $4.2 million versus prior year driven primarily by lower store count. Other store expenses decreased $2.7 million driven by lower skip/stolen losses and lower store count.\nACCEPTANCE NOW fourth quarter revenues of $175.8 million decreased 9.1 percent primarily due to closures of the Company's Conn’s and HHGregg locations as well as the impact from the 2017 hurricanes, which was partially offset by a same store sales increase of 6.7 percent. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year decreased 220 basis points primarily due to lower gross profit on merchandise sales resulting from a focused effort to encourage ownership and reduce returned product. Labor, as a percent of store revenue, improved 200 basis points versus prior year due to efforts to improve store level profitability through conversions of staffed locations to direct locations. Other store expenses, as a percent of store revenue, increased by 740 basis points primarily driven by a one-time, non-cash, charge to write off unreconciled invoices and higher skip/stolen losses.\nMEXICO fourth quarter revenues decreased 2.4 percent on a constant currency basis driven by a same store sales decline of 2.3 percent. Gross profit as a percent of total revenue versus prior year decreased 270 basis points driven by lower rental sales gross margin and merchandise sales gross margin.\nFRANCHISING fourth quarter revenues were $6.7 million and operating profit was $1.5 million.\nCORPORATE operating expenses decreased $6.6 million compared to the prior year primarily driven by lower executive and incentive compensation.\nSAME STORE SALES (Unaudited) Table 1 Period Core U.S. Acceptance Now Mexico Total Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 (1) (3.6 )% 6.7 % (2.3 )% (2.0 )% Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 (5.1 )% 7.9 % (6.2 )% (3.1 )% Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 (13.9 )% 1.7 % (1.4 )% (9.3 )% Note: Same store sale methodology - Same store sales generally represents revenue earned in stores that were operated by us for 13 months or more and are reported on a constant currency basis. The Company excludes from the same store sales base any store that receives a certain level of customer accounts from closed stores or acquisitions. The receiving store will be eligible for inclusion in the same store sales base in the 24 th full month following account transfer.\n(1) Given the severity of the recent natural disasters, the Company instituted a change to the same store sales store selection starting in the month of September, excluding geographically impacted regions for 18 months.\n2018 Selected Guidance\nAs the Company remains in the midst of a strategic and financial alternatives review process, the following selected guidance is being provided at this time:\nThe Board of Directors recently engaged AlixPartners to assist in identifying financial cost-savings and efficiencies. The Company has identified annualized cost savings opportunities of $65 to $85 million, approximately two thirds of which is expected to be realized in 2018. Overhead of $30 to $40 million Supply Chain of $25 to $30 million Other Store Expenses of $10 to $15 million Working Capital benefits of $20 to $25 million, 100 percent of which is expected to be realized in 2018 Free Cash Flow of at least $130 million\nGuidance Policy\nThe Company provides selected guidance and will only provide updates if there is a material change versus the original guidance.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nTo supplement the Company's financial results presented on a GAAP basis, Rent-A-Center uses the non-GAAP measures (\"special items”) indicated in Table 2 below, which primarily excludes charges in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to capitalized software write-downs, hurricane damage, closure of Acceptance Now locations, incremental legal and advisory fees, legal settlements, and charges related to previous store closure plans. Gains or charges related to store closures will generally recur with the occurrence of these events in the future. The presentation of these financial measures is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Rent-A-Center management believes that excluding special items from the GAAP financial results provides investors a clearer perspective of the Company's ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results. This press release also refers to the non-GAAP measures EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Free Cash Flow (EBITDA less cash taxes, interest, capital expenditures, plus stock-based compensation expense and plus (less) the net decrease (increase) in net working capital) when addressing guidance for future periods. The Company has not quantitatively reconciled differences between EBITDA or Free Cash Flow and their corresponding GAAP measures for such future periods due to the inherent uncertainty regarding variables affecting the comparison of these measures.\nReconciliation of net earnings (loss) to net (loss) earnings excluding special items:\nTable 2 Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands, except per share data) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net earnings (loss) $ 34,824 $ 0.65 $ (146,383 ) $ (2.76 ) $ 6,653 $ 0.12 $ (105,195 ) $ (1.98 ) Special items, net of taxes: Goodwill impairment charge — — 128,633 2.43 — — 128,633 2.43 Other charges (gains) (1) 17,009\n0.32\n(1,676 ) (0.03 ) 37,256\n0.70\n12,483 0.23 Debt refinancing charges — — — — 1,239 0.02 — — Tax Cut and Jobs Act gain (77,505\n) (1.45\n) — — (77,505\n) (1.45\n) — — Discrete income tax items 3,566\n0.07 7,063 0.13 3,642\n0.07 5,027 0.09 Net (loss) earnings excluding special items $ (22,106 ) $ (0.41 ) $ (12,363 ) $ (0.23 ) $ (28,715 ) $ (0.54 ) $ 40,948 $ 0.77 (1) Other charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily includes charges, net of tax, related to capitalized software write-downs, hurricane damage, closure of Acceptance Now locations, incremental legal and advisory fees, legal settlements, and charges related to previous store closure plans.
