Generated fourth quarter normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $0.27 per share and OP unit on a fully diluted basis, consistent with the same period last year. Completed fourth quarter investments of approximately $387.6 million, which consisted of 11 healthcare facilities, including the remaining controlling interest in one facility, totaling 1,047,908 leasable square feet. Issued $350.0 million of public senior notes on December 1, 2017, with a maturity of 10 years and a coupon rate of 3.95%. Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share and OP unit for the fourth quarter 2017, paid January 18, 2018. Portfolio was 96.6% leased based on square footage as of December 31, 2017. Increased gross leasable square footage by 7.9% in the fourth quarter 2017 to 13,996,802 square feet across 280 healthcare properties from 12,969,653 square feet across 270 healthcare properties as of September 30, 2017. Same-Store Cash Net Operating Income (NOI) growth was 3.0% year over year.\nSubsequent Events Highlights:\nClosed an additional $100.7 million of investments subsequent to the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Disposed of one property for $1.4 million, which resulted in no gain or loss.\nMILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE: DOC) (the “Company,” the “Trust,” “we,” “our” and “us”), a self-managed healthcare real estate investment trust, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nJohn T. Thomas, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Trust, commented, “Physicians Realty Trust delivered another year of value-creating growth in 2017, increasing our portfolio of quality medical office facilities to over $4.2 billion in gross asset value. We believe the $1.4 billion of investments completed during the year are some of our most impressive to date, demonstrating the unique value provided to our shareholders by our experienced management team, disciplined acquisition strategy, and health system partnerships.”\n“Our consistent approach in acquiring high-quality medical office properties, occupied by the highest quality health systems, and managed by a team that understands healthcare’s needs, continues to produce outstanding results. Following our 2017 investments, the Physicians Realty Trust portfolio includes nearly 14 million leasable square feet of healthcare real estate at industry leading occupancy rates, with nearly half of that space being leased to an investment grade entity or subsidiary. Our best in class asset management team continues to set the standard for medical office management, delivering outstanding year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 3.0%. We look forward to sharing more about our latest investments and quarterly results, as we continue to execute upon our proven strategy to build long-term value for our shareholders,” Mr. Thomas concluded.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $97.3 million, an increase of 32.1% from the same period in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the portfolio was 96.6% leased.\nTotal expenses for the fourth quarter 2017 were $87.8 million, an increase of 34.9% from the same period in 2016. The increase in expenses was primarily the result of a $9.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $5.6 million increase in interest expense, and a $5.0 million increase in operating expenses.\nNet income for the fourth quarter 2017 increased to $10.2 million, compared to net income of $8.6 million for the fourth quarter 2016, an increase of 18.2%.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter 2017 was $9.5 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.05 based on 185.3 million weighted average common shares and OP units outstanding.\nFunds from operations (FFO) for the fourth quarter 2017 consisted of net income, less $0.1 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for partially owned properties, less $0.2 million of preferred distributions, plus $36.1 million of depreciation and amortization, less $0.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense for partially owned properties, less $0.6 million of gain on sale of an investment property, plus $1.0 million of impairment loss, resulting in $0.25 per diluted share. Normalized FFO, which adjusts for $3.9 million of acquisition expenses and $0.5 million of net changes in fair value, was $49.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share.\nNormalized funds available for distribution (FAD) for the fourth quarter 2017, which consists of normalized FFO adjusted for non-cash share compensation, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above-market and below-market leases, amortization of assumed debt, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of deferred financing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and seller master lease and rent abatement payments, was $44.2 million for the fourth quarter 2017.\nOur same-store portfolio, which includes 218 properties representing approximately 67.6% of our net leasable square footage, generated year-over-year Same-Store NOI growth of 3.0% for the fourth quarter 2017. Same-Store data for the fourth quarter 2017 excludes 10 assets slated for disposition and the Kennewick MOB.\nAssets Slated for Disposition\nWe consider 10 properties in four states, representing an aggregate of approximately 391,014 square feet of gross leasable area, to be slated for disposition as of December 31, 2017. These assets include five assets leased to entities who have succeeded to the interests of certain Foundation Healthcare, Inc. affiliates (“Former Foundation Assets”) and five additional properties which we believe no longer meet our core business strategy from a size, age, geography, or line of business perspective.\nOther Recent Events\nDividend Paid\nOn December 21, 2017, our Board of Trustees authorized and declared a cash distribution of $0.23 per common share for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2017. The distribution was paid on January 18, 2018 to common shareholders and OP Unit holders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2018.\nFourth Quarter Investment Activity\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed 11 property acquisitions, including the remaining controlling interest in one facility, representing an aggregate of 1,047,908 net leasable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $387.4 million. Total investment activity for the quarter was approximately $387.6 million.\nOn December 18, 2017, we sold one medical office building totaling 20,939 square feet in Nebraska for approximately $2.5 million and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $0.7 million.\nRecent Investment Activity\nSince December 31, 2017, the Company has acquired two medical office facilities and funded one loan transaction for an aggregate investment activity of approximately $100.7 million and disposed of one property for $1.4 million, resulting in no gain or loss. The acquisitions are described below.\nHazelwood Medical Commons - On January 9, 2018, the Company closed the acquisition of a 147,885 square foot medical office facility in Maplewood, Minnesota, for a purchase price of approximately $70.7 million. This multi-tenant facility opened in October 2017 and is 90.3% leased. Services provided in this facility consist of a family clinic, urgent care, an onsite lab, a pharmacy, and a dedicated surgery center. This state-of-the-art facility is located across from the Fairview Health System (Moody’s: “A2”) St. John’s Hospital Campus which anchors and occupies 75.6% of the facility both directly and through affiliates. The first year unlevered yield on this investment is expected to be approximately 5.3%. Hazelwood Medical Commons opened in September 2017 and was named the 2017 Medical Office Development of the Year in the United States with over 100,000 rentable square feet by Healthcare Real Estate Insights (“HREI”).\nLee's Hill Medical Plaza - On January 23, 2018, the Company closed the acquisition of a 72,255 square foot medical office facility in Fredericksburg, Virginia for a purchase price of approximately $28.0 million. The multi-tenant facility is 88.5% leased with 50.5% leased to Mary Washington Healthcare System (Moody’s: “Baa1”). Mary Washington operates a wide range of medical specialties including a free-standing emergency department, a comprehensive medical image practice, outpatient laboratory services, a wound center, and administrative support. The first year unlevered yield on this investment is expected to be approximately 6.0%.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call on February 28, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss its financial performance and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.

For purposes of the SEC’s Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the company, or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. As used in this press release, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe that information regarding FFO is helpful to shareholders and potential investors because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP units, excluding preferred distributions, gains (or losses) on sales of depreciable operating property, impairment write-downs on depreciable assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs). Our FFO computation may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT definition or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. The GAAP measure that we believe to be most directly comparable to FFO, net income, includes depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses on property sales, impairments and noncontrolling interests. In computing FFO, we eliminate these items because, in our view, they are not indicative of the results from the operations of our properties. To facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as presented in our financial statements. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, should not be considered to be an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to shareholders.\nWe use Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, acquisition expenses, acceleration of deferred financing costs, write off contingent consideration, and other normalizing items. However, our use of the term Normalized FFO may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Normalized FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our financial performance or of cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP), or as an indicator of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nWe define Normalized FAD, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes from Normalized FFO non-cash share compensation expense, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above or below market leases and assumed debt, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of deferred financing costs, and recurring capital expenditures related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and includes cash payments from seller master leases and rent abatement payments. Other REITs or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating Normalized FAD, and accordingly, our computation may not be comparable to those reported by other REITs. Although our computation of Normalized FAD may not be comparable to that of other REITs, we believe Normalized FAD provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance due to its frequency of use by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a REIT. Normalized FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to controlling interest (computed in accordance with GAAP) or as an indicator of our financial performance. Normalized FAD should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income or loss, computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from our total portfolio of properties before general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment losses. We believe that NOI provides an accurate measure of operating performance of our operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. Our use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount.\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NOI straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of acquired above and below market leases, and other non-cash and normalizing items. Other non-cash and normalizing items include items such as the amortization of lease inducements, payments received from seller master leases and rent abatements, and write-offs of contingent consideration. We believe that Cash NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of our operating assets because it excludes certain items that are not associated with management of the properties. Additionally, we believe that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate community. Our use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as such other companies may have different methodologies for computing this amount.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005734/en/\nPhysicians Realty Trust\nJohn T.
