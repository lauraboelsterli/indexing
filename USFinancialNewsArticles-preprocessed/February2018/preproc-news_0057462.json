The alliance, referred to as “Seamless Air Alliance,” aims to let mobile operators provide services to airline customers through satellite technology, the companies said in a statement. Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed. Sprint will be launching its 5G network next year, the company’s Chief Commercial Officer Dow Draper said on Monday. Delta said Gogo, its existing partner and in-flight connectivity provider, will also join the alliance. Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier",
