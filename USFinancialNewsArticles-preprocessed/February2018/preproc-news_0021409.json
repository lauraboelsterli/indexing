Ghoulam will undergo tests to ascertain the extent of the injury... today,” said the statement. \nIt did not give further details on how he sustained the injury. Italian media said that he could be facing one year on the sidelines. \nGhoulam suffered the original ligament injury during the Champions League match at home to Manchester City on Nov.1. \nLast month, Italian media quoted club officials as saying they were amazed at the speed of his recovery.
