    "text": "Winger J.T. Compher scored 2:28 into overtime Thursday night, allowing the visiting Colorado Avalanche to escape with a 4-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers.\nThe Avalanche recovered after blowing 2-0 and 3-1 leads.\nConnor McDavid scored twice for the Oilers, including the game-tying goal with 28 seconds remaining in the third period, to fuel the comeback. The goals were his 16th and 17th of the season.\nThe Avalanche dominated the overtime, getting two early shots on goal by Erik Johnson that were turned away by Edmonton’s Al Montoya.\nHowever, after an Oilers turnover and a Tyson Barrie shot that was blocked by Edmonton’s Darnell Nurse, the Avalanche regained possession of the puck. Gabriel Landeskog then found Compher for the game-winner, his 10th goal of the season.\nBarrie was credited with an assist along with Landeskog.\nJonathan Bernier had 29 saves for the Avalanche, who snapped a three-game losing streak that bridged the All-Star break.\nMontoya was credited with 27 saves for the Oilers, who have alternated losses and wins in their first four outings of a five-game homestand.\nUnassisted goals by Nikita Zadorov and Blake Comeau sandwiched a power-play score by Samuel Girard in the second period as the Avalanche, after a scoreless first period, went in front by two goals heading to the third period.\nMcDavid’s second goal came after Drake Caggiula’s seventh of the season, assisted by Matt Benning and Ryan Strome, got the Oilers back within 3-2 at the 6:52 mark of the third period.\nAfter the goals by Zadorov, his fourth of the season, and Girard, his second, gave Colorado a 2-0 lead 7:52 into the second period, McDavid began Edmonton’s rally. McDavid scored at the 9:11 mark of the second period, assisted by Leon Draisaitl and Michael Cammalleri, to close Edmonton within 2-1.\nAvalanche winger Mikko Rantanen was penalized for holding in the final minute of the middle period. During the ensuing power play, after Edmonton won a faceoff in its offensive end, Comeau stole the puck from Milan Lucic and raced in for the goal that re-established Colorado’s two-game advantage just 29 seconds before period’s end.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
