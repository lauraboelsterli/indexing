    "text": "Current Chief Financial Officer John Black to Retire\nTORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (NYSE: GOOS, TSX: GOOS) today announced that Jonathan Sinclair will succeed John Black as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President and is expected to join the company toward the middle of the year. John has informed the Company of his intention to retire and will continue as Chief Financial Officer until Jonathan’s appointment, and will remain in a senior role until the end of year to ensure a smooth transition.\n“Jonathan is an accomplished business leader and seasoned financial executive. His extensive experience with luxury brands and direct-to-consumer operations will be invaluable as we continue to bring more Canada Goose to the world,” said Dani Reiss, President & Chief Executive Officer. “I am extremely grateful for John Black’s contributions over the past 4 and a half years. He has played a pivotal role in leading our finance team through strong growth and many important milestones, including our initial public offering and the implementation of public company infrastructure and processes. We wish John all the best in his well-deserved upcoming retirement.”\nJonathan brings more than 20 years of global financial and operational experience to his role.

I am drawn to Canada Goose for the same reason – an exceptional team, as well as an amazing brand. Canada Goose has great potential for continued strong global growth and l am thrilled to join this talented and entrepreneurial team.”\n“It has been a great honour to be a part of the incredible success at Canada Goose and I am proud of the many accomplishments the Company has achieved during my tenure.
