She could have been fired, but instead she said the conservative Republicans in her chain of command promoted her to division chief. \nA decade later, that kind of acceptance was overshadowed by what Chandler called the hate and divisive language of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, prompting her to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. \n“The real simplistic answer to why I‘m running: It’s to answer a call. It’s to a answer a call to service like I did after 9/11,” said Chandler, one of more than a dozen Democrats seeking the nomination in the third district of Massachusetts. \nIn his first year in office, President Trump has weakened LGBT protections in employment, schools and housing and has appointed officials and judges seen as hostile to LGBT rights. \nChandler is among an estimated 40 transgender candidates running for all levels of government in the November 2018 elections, an unprecedented number. Many of the candidates will have the backing of advocacy groups such as Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization in the United States. \nHRC’s $26 million commitment to the elections, nearly as much as it spent in the 2012 and 2016 campaigns combined, is part of a push to regain momentum after Trump became president and Republicans kept control of Congress. \nThe White House and the Republican National Committee did not respond to requests for comment on the LGBT advocates’ strategy. \nWhile gays and lesbians have been elected for decades, openly transgender candidates are rarer, making it remarkable last year when eight won elective office, the most recorded in the United States. \nIn addition to those who have declared their candidacies this year, nearly as many parents of transgender children are also running, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, the leading trans advocacy group. \nHRC has created a database of 52 million pro-LGBT voters who can be deployed to get out the vote for candidates who support LGBT rights. Those voters in the database, who showed support for equal rights for LGBT people, amount to 37 percent of the 139 million Americans who voted in the 2016 general election, and about 5 percent of the electorate has identified as LGBT in exit polls.

Slideshow (14 Images) \nThe use of voter demographics and commercial data, known as microtargeting, has been part of U.S. politics for at least a decade. It has grown more sophisticated with each election cycle, reflecting the increasing importance of getting out the vote and generating enthusiasm among a party’s core supporters. \nThis is the first year in which microtargeting will be put to work on such a wide scale on behalf of LGBT candidates. \nChandler, the former intelligence analyst, has captured plenty of attention from LGBT groups. She has been endorsed by the Trans United Fund. She took a four-day LGBT candidate course with the Victory Institute, which specializes in such training, and she has long worked with the National Center for Transgender Equality. \nChandler is already campaigning, emphasizing her 13 years of working for the military, the need to improve healthcare policies, tackle an opioid abuse crisis and to create jobs. She says she understands those issues as a working mother. \n“I’ve had Trump voters who say they’re going to vote for me. There is a hunger for something different,” Chandler said. \nNonetheless, transgender groups said they will be doubling their efforts. \nThe transgender center’s Keisling said that while Republicans are typically better at voter turnout, “this year Democrats and progressives and immigrants and people of color and trans people are so angry and so scared, there’s never been more incentive to vote.” Reporting by Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and Grant McCool",
