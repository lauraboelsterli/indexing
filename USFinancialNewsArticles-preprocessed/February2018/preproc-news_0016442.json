Excluding these items, pro forma operating income 3 was $149.2 million versus $112.9 million in the prior year. Full-year Adjusted EBITDA 3 was $290.5 million versus $239.7 million in the prior year.\nThe following table summarizes operating income (loss), pro forma operating income (loss) 3 and Adjusted EBITDA 3 for the current full year and comparable prior year:\nYear Ended December 31, Operating Income\n(Loss)\nPro forma\nOperating Income\n(Loss) 3\nAdjusted EBITDA 3 (millions of dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Southern Timber $42.2 $43.1 $42.2 $43.1 $91.6 $92.9 Pacific Northwest Timber 1.1 (4.0 ) 1.1 (4.0 ) 33.1 21.2 New Zealand Timber 72.5 33.1 72.5 33.1 109.0 58.3 Real Estate 116.0 202.4 49.0 58.5 71.6 84.7 Trading 4.6 2.0 4.6 2.0 4.6 2.0 Corporate and other (20.9 ) (20.8 ) (20.2 ) (19.8 ) (19.4 ) (19.4 ) Total $215.5 $255.8 $149.2 $112.9 $290.5 $239.7 Full-year cash provided by operating activities was $256.3 million versus $203.8 million in the prior year. Full-year cash available for distribution (CAD) 3 of $188.7 million increased $44.4 million versus the prior year primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA 3 ($50.8 million) and lower cash interest paid ($0.2 million), partially offset by higher capital expenditures ($6.6 million).\n“We are pleased with our fourth quarter results, as favorable performance in the Pacific Northwest Timber, New Zealand Timber and Real Estate segments more than offset the impact of lower harvest volumes and lower average stumpage prices in the Southern Timber segment,” said David Nunes, President and CEO. “Southern Timber volumes decreased 5% relative to the prior year quarter, as wet weather conditions hampered access in certain areas. Average stumpage prices in Southern Timber decreased 4% relative to the prior year quarter primarily due to geographic mix. In Pacific Northwest Timber, results improved significantly despite 10% lower volumes due to a 27% increase in delivered sawtimber prices relative to the prior year quarter, reflecting strong domestic and export market conditions. New Zealand Timber results also improved significantly versus the prior year quarter, driven by 16% higher harvest volumes and increases in export and domestic sawtimber prices of 11% and 7%, respectively. Real Estate results, excluding the gain on Large Dispositions 2 , were significantly above the prior year quarter driven by an increase in the number of acres sold, partially offset by lower average pricing, reflecting the mix of properties sold.”\nSouthern Timber\nFourth quarter sales 1 of $32.5 million decreased $2.5 million, or 7%, versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes decreased 5% to 1.22 million tons versus 1.29 million tons in the prior year period, primarily due to storms in the fourth quarter resulting in wet ground conditions that limited access in certain areas. Average pine sawtimber stumpage prices decreased 9% to $24.44 per ton versus $26.75 per ton in the prior year period, while average pine pulpwood stumpage prices decreased 4% to $15.16 per ton versus $15.83 per ton in the prior year period. The decrease in average sawtimber and pulpwood stumpage prices was driven primarily by geographic mix, including a lump-sum sale of 165,000 tons in one of the Company’s lowest-priced regions. Overall, weighted-average stumpage prices (including hardwood) decreased 4% to $18.24 per ton versus $19.06 per ton in the prior year period. Operating income of $7.2 million decreased $0.9 million versus the prior year period due to lower weighted-average stumpage prices ($1.0 million), lower volumes ($0.7 million), higher depletion rates ($0.2 million) and higher road maintenance costs ($0.2 million), which were partially offset by higher non-timber income ($0.6 million) and lower overhead expense ($0.6 million).\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $19.5 million was $1.3 million below the prior year period.\nPacific Northwest Timber\nFourth quarter sales 1 of $26.4 million increased $3.0 million, or 13%, versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes decreased 10% to 321,000 tons versus 356,000 tons in the prior year period, primarily due to the decision to defer approximately 50,000 tons of volume into 2018 to capture improving market pricing. Average delivered sawtimber prices increased 27% to $95.34 per ton versus $74.97 per ton in the prior year period, while average delivered pulpwood prices increased 12% to $44.44 per ton versus $39.62 per ton in the prior year period. The increase in average sawtimber prices was due to stronger domestic and export markets. The increase in average pulpwood prices was due to geographic mix and additional chip export demand in the Washington market. Operating income of $2.4 million increased $5.5 million relative to an operating loss of $3.1 million in the prior year period due to higher prices ($4.4 million), lower depletion rates ($1.0 million) and higher non-timber income ($0.1 million).\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $10.6 million was $3.4 million above the prior year period.\nNew Zealand Timber\nFourth quarter sales 1 of $59.3 million increased $9.2 million, or 18%, versus the prior year period. Harvest volumes increased 16% to 649,000 tons versus 562,000 tons in the prior year period, driven primarily by incremental volume from recent acquisitions. Average delivered prices for export sawtimber increased 11% to $115.77 per ton versus $104.26 per ton in the prior year period, while average delivered prices for domestic sawtimber increased 7% to $83.02 per ton versus $77.41 per ton in the prior year period. The increase in export sawtimber prices was primarily due to stronger demand from China. The increase in domestic sawtimber prices (in U.S. dollar terms) was driven by strong local demand for construction materials, partially offset by a modest decrease in the NZ$/US$ exchange rate (US$0.70 per NZ$1.00 versus US$0.72 per NZ$1.00). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices increased 11% from the prior year period. Operating income of $16.1 million increased $4.4 million versus the prior year period due to higher prices ($5.3 million) and higher volumes ($2.1 million), which were partially offset by lower carbon sales ($2.8 million), higher road maintenance costs ($0.1 million) and higher depletion rates ($0.1 million).\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $22.8 million was $4.9 million above the prior year period.\nReal Estate\nFourth quarter sales 1 of $85.9 million decreased $2.2 million versus the prior year period, while operating income of $58.8 million increased $9.4 million versus the prior year period. Fourth quarter sales and operating income included $53.4 million and $38.8 million, respectively, from Large Dispositions 2 . The prior year fourth quarter sales and operating income included $77.7 million and $42.6 million, respectively, from Large Dispositions 2 . Excluding these items, pro forma sales 3 of $32.5 million increased $22.1 million versus the prior year period, while pro forma operating income 3 of $20.0 million increased $13.2 million versus the prior year period due to a higher number of acres sold (7,475 acres sold versus 1,489 acres sold in the prior year period), partially offset by a decrease in weighted-average prices ($4,378 per acre versus $6,929 per acre in the prior year period) due to the mix of properties sold.\nImproved Development closings of $6.4 million in the Wildlight development project included 20.7 acres of commercial property for $6.0 million ($292,553 per acre) and 8 residential lots for $0.4 million ($46,000 per lot or $344,000 per acre). Based on ongoing site development obligations, $6.1 million of revenue was recognized in the fourth quarter.\nRural sales of $3.3 million were comprised of 1,204 acres at an average price of $2,721 per acre. This compares to the prior year quarter sales of $1.5 million, comprised of 504 acres at an average price of $2,749 per acre.\nNon-strategic / Timberland sales of $23.0 million were comprised of 6,249 acres at an average price of $3,686 per acre, including a sale of 1,922 acres in Nassau County, Florida for $4,000 per acre. This compares to the prior year quarter sales of $5.6 million, comprised of 901 acres at an average price of $6,228 per acre, including 816 acres in Washington for $6,495 per acre.\nLarge Dispositions 2 of $53.4 million were comprised of 24,645 acres in Alabama an average price of $2,167 per acre. This compares to Large Dispositions 2 in the prior year quarter of $77.7 million comprised of 37,114 acres in Alabama and Mississippi at an average price of $2,094 per acre.\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $28.2 million was $17.6 million above the prior year period.\nTrading\nFourth quarter sales 1 of $35.6 million increased $2.9 million versus the prior year period due to higher volumes and prices. Sales volumes increased 2% to 326,000 tons versus 321,000 tons in the prior year period. Average prices increased 8% to $108.07 per ton versus $100.41 per ton in the prior year period primarily due to stronger demand from China. Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $1.2 million increased $0.7 million versus the prior year period.\nOther Items\nFourth quarter corporate and other operating expenses of $5.6 million increased $0.5 million versus the prior year period due to higher selling, general and administrative costs ($0.5 million), higher depreciation expense ($0.2 million) and a reduction in overhead costs historically allocated to operating segments ($0.6 million), partially offset by lower pension expense ($0.8 million).\nFourth quarter interest expense of $8.5 million decreased $0.1 million versus the prior year period due to lower average debt.\nFourth quarter income tax expense of $4.9 million increased $2.1 million versus the prior year period due to improved results from the New Zealand JV, which is the primary driver of income tax expense.\nOutlook\n“In 2018, we expect to achieve net income attributable to Rayonier of $78 to $87 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $280 to $305 million,” added Nunes. “In our Southern Timber segment, we expect an increase in harvest volumes with a full-year contribution from our 2017 acquisitions in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. We further anticipate modestly improved pricing in certain Southern markets; however, we expect overall pricing in the Southern Timber segment to be relatively flat to 2017 average pricing due to geographic mix. In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect a modest increase in harvest volumes as well as higher sawtimber prices relative to 2017 average pricing due to stronger domestic and export markets. In our New Zealand Timber segment, we expect a modest increase in harvest volumes and continued strong pricing dynamics driven by solid demand in both domestic and export markets. In our Real Estate segment, we continue to focus on unlocking the long-term value of our HBU development and rural property portfolio. Following a year of meaningful infrastructure investments in our Wildlight development project, we expect additional residential and commercial closings in 2018.”\nConference Call\nA conference call and live audio webcast will be held on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 10:00 AM EST to discuss these results.\nAccess to the live audio webcast will be available at www.rayonier.com .

repurchase of the Company’s common shares, debt reduction and strategic acquisitions. CAD is defined as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital spending (excluding timberland acquisitions and spending on the Rayonier office building) and working capital and other balance sheet changes. CAD is not necessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods.\n(c) “Costs related to shareholder litigation” include expenses incurred as a result of the securities litigation and the shareholder derivative demands. See Note 10—Contingencies of Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, these costs include the costs associated with the Company’s response to a subpoena it received from the SEC in November 2014. In July 2016, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC notified the Company that it had concluded its investigation into the Company.\n(d) The Company used foreign exchange derivatives to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates while awaiting the capital contribution to the New Zealand JV.\n(e) “Large Dispositions” are defined as transactions involving the sale of timberland that exceed $20 million in size and do not have a demonstrable premium relative to timberland value. In 2017, the Company completed two dispositions of approximately 50,000 acres in total. In January 2017, the Company completed a disposition of approximately 25,000 acres of timberland located in Alabama for a sales price and gain of approximately $42.0 million and $28.2 million, respectively. In December 2017, the Company completed a second disposition of approximately 25,000 acres of timberland located in Alabama for a sales price and gain of approximately $53.4 million and $38.8 million, respectively. In 2016, the Company completed two dispositions of approximately 92,000 acres in total for a combined sales price and gain of approximately $207.3 million and $143.9 million, respectively.\n(f) Cash interest paid is presented net of patronage refunds received of $3.0 million and $0.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(g) Pro forma revenues (sales) is defined as revenues (sales) adjusted for Large Dispositions. Rayonier believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate our core business operations because it excludes specific items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\n(h) Pro forma net income is defined as net income attributable to Rayonier Inc. adjusted for costs related to shareholder litigation, the gain on foreign currency derivatives and Large Dispositions. Rayonier believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate our core business operations because it excludes specific items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\n(i) Pro forma operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) adjusted for costs related to shareholder litigation, the gain on foreign currency derivatives and Large Dispositions. Rayonier believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate our core business operations because it excludes specific items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results.\n(j) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, the non-cash cost of land and improved development, costs related to shareholder litigation, the gain on foreign currency derivatives and Large Dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to make strategic decisions about the business and that investors can use to evaluate the operational performance of the assets under management. It removes the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations on an ongoing basis.\nF\nRAYONIER INC.
