    "text": "Gary Harris scored 27 points and the Denver Nuggets used an array of 3-point shooting to produce a 121-104 victory against the visiting Charlotte Hornets on Monday night at Pepsi Center.\nSeven Denver players hit at least one 3-point basket, topped by Harris with five (on seven attempts).\nThe Nuggets ended up 18-for-34 on 3-point attempts, though they went 0-for-3 in the fourth quarter.\nDenver’s Jamal Murray, who made four treys, and Will Barton, who supplied eight assists, both posted 18 points. Nikola Jokic added 15 points and 16 rebounds for the Nuggets, who completed a 3-0 homestand. Emmanuel Mudiay (12 points), Trey Lyles (11) and Darrell Arthur (10) gave Denver production off the bench.\nKemba Walker scored 20 points and Dwight Howard added 19 points for the Hornets, who are halfway through a four-game road trip after winning a night earlier at Phoenix.\nNic Batum’s 15 points, Jeremy Lamb’s 14 points and Treveon Graham’s 11 points weren’t enough for Charlotte to make a strong run at the end. Cody Zeller racked up a team-best 10 rebounds.\nHoward was 7-for-7 from the field in the first half, and he finished 9-for-11.\nWalker set the franchise record for career 3-point baskets in the previous game, and he was 3-for-6 from long range in this game. Charlotte was 11-for-26 from beyond the arc.\nThe Nuggets took control with a 16-4 run to open the third quarter.\nCharlotte had only one field goal in the first six minutes after halftime.\nDenver ended up 7-for-10 on third-quarter 3-point tries.\nMurray’s 3-pointer gave Denver a 63-62 halftime lead.\nCharlotte used a 14-0 run to burst ahead 54-48 late in the second quarter. The Nuggets went about 3 1/2 minutes without scoring.\nDenver was saved in the first half by 11-for-21 shooting from 3-point range.\nThe Nuggets led by 12 points in the first quarter.\nDenver played for the fourth game in a row without forward Mason Plumlee (right calf strain). Charlotte forward Marvin Williams missed his fourth consecutive game with an ankle sprain.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
