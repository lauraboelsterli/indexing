    "text": " 51 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago UPDATE 1-ANZ shuts Laos retail products and services in Asia strategy push   \n(Adds details on last day of service in Laos, background, share movement) \nFeb 8 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said on Thursday it would close its retail products and services in Laos to focus on its institutional banking business in the Southeast Asian country. \nThe move is part of its strategy to simplify business and improve capital efficiency in Asia, said ANZ, Australia’s third-largest lender by market capitalisation. \nThe last day of service for its Laos retail products and services will be March 30, the bank said. \nThe company did not say how many jobs will be affected by the move. \nANZ has been slowly retreating from Asia, having sold its wealth and retail businesses in five Asian markets to DBS Group Holdings in 2016, and since then also quitting its retail banking business in the Philippines and Vietnam. \nBig Australian banks are trying to shed capital-intensive assets amid stiffer bank capital rules. \nIn July last year, Australia set new rules for higher capital on its largest banks with targets that would imply a combined capital shortfall of as much as A$8 billion ($6.12 billion), and raised the target of major banks’ Tier 1 ratio by 150 basis points to at least 10.5 percent by 2020. \nANZ said in its full-year results last year that its common equity Tier-1 capital ratio at Sept. 30 was 10.6 percent, above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) target. \nANZ shares edged up 0.3 percent to A$27.86 in a flat market.
