    "text": "Full-Year Highlights\nRevenues increased 7% to $31.3 billion Turner and Home Box Office’s Subscription revenues increased 13% and 11%, respectively Operating Income grew 5% to $7.9 billion and Adjusted Operating Income grew 7% to $8.2 billion EPS grew 34% to $6.64 and Adjusted EPS grew 27% to $7.47 Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations grew 9% to $5.1 billion and Free Cash Flow grew 2% to $4.4 billion\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said: “We had another very successful year in 2017, achieving our financial goals thanks to the great creative and programming excellence across Time Warner. All three of our operating divisions increased revenue and profits while also investing to capitalize on the growing demand for the most creative and compelling content as well as new ways to deliver it to audiences worldwide. Warner Bros. had its best year ever at the global box office with its films grossing over $5 billion in box office receipts, led by hits like Wonder Woman, It and Dunkirk, which received eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture. Warner Bros. also remains the #1 supplier of television shows for the broadcast networks, and saw continued growth in games with franchise releases Middle-earth: Shadow of War and Injustice 2.”\nMr. Bewkes continued: “HBO again excelled with its combination of the biggest Hollywood hit movies and award-winning original programming - receiving more Primetime Emmy Awards in 2017 than any other network for the 16 th consecutive year as well as four Golden Globe Awards in 2018 for Big Little Lies, also the most of any network. Led by its great content, Home Box Office delivered its highest increase in domestic subscribers ever in 2017 and its best subscription revenue growth in over 20 years. Turner continued to deliver exceptional value with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim all ranking among ad-supported cable’s top five networks in primetime among adults 18-49 for the year. Turner claimed the #1 comedy across all television among adults 18-34 with Adult Swim’s Rick and Morty, and CNN was the #1 digital news destination for the second year in a row. We remain excited about the proposed merger with AT&T, pending judicial review, and the potential to accelerate our pace of innovation and connect more directly with consumers.”\nFull-Year Company Results\nFull-year revenues increased 7% to $31.3 billion due to increases at all operating divisions. Operating Income increased 5% to $7.9 billion and Adjusted Operating Income increased 7% to $8.2 billion due to increases at all operating divisions.\nThe Company posted 2017 Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations (“EPS”) of $6.64, up 34% compared to $4.94 in 2016. Adjusted Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted EPS”) was $7.47, up 27% from $5.86 for the prior year. EPS and Adjusted EPS in 2017 include a tax provision benefit of $1.07 related to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. EPS and Adjusted EPS in 2016 included a net tax benefit of $0.29 related to an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)-approved tax accounting method change. Adjusted EPS excludes premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases of $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016.\nIn 2017, Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations reached $5.1 billion and Free Cash Flow totaled $4.4 billion.\nFourth-Quarter Company Results\nRevenues grew 9% to $8.6 billion due to increases at all operating divisions. Operating Income increased 13% to $1.9 billion and Adjusted Operating Income increased 9% to $1.9 billion due to growth at Turner and Home Box Office and lower corporate expenses, partially offset by decreases at Warner Bros. and a negative swing in intercompany eliminations.\nThe Company posted EPS of $1.75 compared to $0.40 for the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS was $2.66 versus $1.25 for the prior year quarter. EPS and Adjusted EPS in the current year quarter include a tax provision benefit of $1.06 related to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. Adjusted EPS excludes premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases of $1.1 billion in the current year quarter and $1.0 billion in the prior year quarter.\nRefer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this release for a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nSegment Performance\nThe schedule below reflects Time Warner’s financial performance for the three months and year ended December 31, by line of business (millions).\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues: Turner $ 3,123 $ 2,838 $ 12,081 $ 11,364 Home Box Office 1,680 1,491 6,329 5,890 Warner Bros. 4,053 3,868 13,866 13,037 Intersegment eliminations (245 ) (306 ) (1,005 ) (973 ) Total Revenues $ 8,611 $ 7,891 $ 31,271 $ 29,318 Operating Income (Loss) (a) : Turner $ 1,026 $ 841 $ 4,489 $ 4,372 Home Box Office 486 429 2,152 1,917 Warner Bros. 512 574 1,761 1,734 Corporate (96 ) (168 ) (430 ) (498 ) Intersegment eliminations (21 ) 15 (52 ) 22 Total Operating Income $ 1,907 $ 1,691 $ 7,920 $ 7,547 Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) (a) : Turner $ 1,022 $ 851 $ 4,506 $ 4,426 Home Box Office 483 431 2,189 1,928 Warner Bros. 514 586 1,861 1,662 Corporate (80 ) (124 ) (339 ) (437 ) Intersegment eliminations (21 ) 15 (52 ) 22 Total Adjusted Operating Income $ 1,918 $ 1,759 $ 8,165 $ 7,601 Depreciation and Amortization: Turner $ 55 $ 52 $ 219 $ 208 Home Box Office 29 22 101 88 Warner Bros. 99 86 345 347 Corporate 8 7 29 26 Intersegment eliminations — — — — Total Depreciation and Amortization $ 191 $ 167 $ 694 $ 669\n(a)\nOperating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 included restructuring and severance costs of (millions):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Turner $ (51 ) $ (46 ) $ (59 ) $ (61 ) Home Box Office (7 ) (8 ) (13 ) (49 ) Warner Bros.

Unless otherwise noted, the dollar amounts in parentheses represent year-over-year changes.\nTURNER\nFull-Year Results\nRevenues increased 6% ($717 million) to $12.1 billion, benefiting from increases of 13% ($752 million) in Subscription revenues and 11% ($74 million) in Content and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease of 2% ($109 million) in Advertising revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues was due to higher domestic rates and growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by lower domestic subscribers. Content and other revenues increased due to higher licensing revenues. The decline in Advertising revenues was primarily due to lower delivery at Turner’s domestic entertainment networks and the comparison to Turner’s networks airing the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball National Championship and Final Four games in the prior year, partially offset by increases at Turner’s news businesses and growth at Turner’s international networks.\nOperating Income increased 3% ($117 million) to $4.5 billion due to the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher expenses, including increased programming and marketing costs. Programming costs grew 12% primarily due to higher costs related to the first year of Turner’s new agreement with the NBA. The increase in marketing costs was mainly to support original series on Turner’s domestic entertainment networks.\nAdjusted Operating Income increased 2% ($80 million) to $4.5 billion.\nIn 2017: Turner had three of the top five ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18-49 with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim; Adult Swim was the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18-34 and 18-49; and Rick and Morty ranked as the #1 comedy across all of television among adults 18-34. CNN was the #1 news network in both primetime and total day among adults 18-34 and was also the #1 digital news destination for the second consecutive year in 2017. Through January 25, viewership of NBA on TNT during the 2017-2018 regular season is up 21% compared to last season. In 2017, Turner acquired the multi-platform rights to the UEFA Champions League and Europa League in the U.S., starting with the 2018-2019 season, and the rights to air Primera Division soccer matches in Argentina, in conjunction with Fox Sports Latin America, and agreed to acquire the multi-platform rights to Chilean soccer matches, including Primera Division matches, subject to regulatory review and approval.\nFourth-Quarter Results\nRevenues increased 10% ($285 million) to $3.1 billion, due to increases of 14% ($204 million) in Subscription revenues, 32% ($55 million) in Content and other revenues and 2% ($26 million) in Advertising revenues. Subscription revenues benefited from higher domestic rates and growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by lower domestic subscribers. Content and other revenues increased primarily due to higher licensing revenues. The increase in Advertising revenues was due to higher revenues associated with MLB postseason games and growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by a decline at Turner’s news businesses related to the comparison to last year’s U.S. Presidential election.\nOperating Income increased 22% ($185 million) to $1.0 billion, reflecting revenue growth partially offset by higher expenses, including increased programming costs. Programming expenses grew 10%, mainly due to higher costs associated with airing MLB postseason games.\nAdjusted Operating Income increased 20% ($171 million) to $1.0 billion.\nHOME BOX OFFICE\nFull-Year Results\nRevenues increased 7% ($439 million) to $6.3 billion, due to an increase of 11% ($532 million) in Subscription revenues, partially offset by a decrease of 10% ($93 million) in Content and other revenues. Subscription revenues grew primarily due to higher domestic subscribers and rates and international growth. Content and other revenues declined due to lower home entertainment revenues.\nOperating Income increased 12% ($235 million) to $2.2 billion, reflecting higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses, including higher programming and marketing costs. Programming costs grew 4%, reflecting higher original and acquired programming costs, partially offset by lower programming charges. The increase in marketing costs was related to original programming and HBO’s OTT products.\nAdjusted Operating Income grew 14% ($261 million) to $2.2 billion.\nHome Box Office added over 5 million domestic subscribers across its HBO and Cinemax services in 2017, its largest annual increase ever. In 2017, HBO received 29 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most of any network for the 16 th consecutive year, including Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Limited Series for Big Little Lies and Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In 2018, HBO received four Golden Globe Awards for Big Little Lies, the most of any network. Average viewership for the seventh season of Game of Thrones increased 28% year over year to 33 million viewers, a record for an HBO original series. In November 2017, HBO launched OTT services in 11 Central European countries.\nFourth-Quarter Results\nRevenues increased 13% ($189 million) to $1.7 billion, reflecting an increase of 16% ($206 million) in Subscription revenues, partially offset by a decrease of 7% ($17 million) in Content and other revenues. Subscription revenues increased due to higher domestic subscribers and rates and international growth. The decrease in Content and other revenues reflects lower international licensing revenues.\nOperating Income increased 13% ($57 million) to $486 million. The growth in revenues more than offset higher expenses, including programming and marketing costs. Programming expenses increased 13%, due to higher original and acquired programming costs. The increase in marketing costs was related to original programming and HBO’s OTT products.\nAdjusted Operating Income increased 12% ( $52 million ) to $483 million.\nWARNER BROS.\nFull-Year Results\nRevenues increased 6% ($829 million) to $13.9 billion due to growth in theatrical, television and games revenues. Theatrical revenues benefited from higher television licensing revenues of theatrical product, the strong box office performances of Wonder Woman and It, and higher home entertainment revenues. Games revenues increased due to the mix of releases, including Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Injustice 2 and Golf Clash. Television revenues grew primarily due to higher licensing revenues related to certain library series, partially offset by lower initial telecast revenues.\nOperating Income increased 2% ($27 million) to $1.8 billion, with the growth in revenues largely offset by higher associated costs due to the mix of television product as well as higher selling, general and administrative costs and restructuring and severance charges. Operating Income in the prior year also included a $90 million gain on the sale of Flixster.\nAdjusted Operating Income increased 12% ($199 million) to $1.9 billion. Adjusted Operating Income in the prior year excluded the gain on the sale of Flixster.\nFor the 90 th Academy Awards, Warner Bros. films received 14 nominations, including Best Picture and Best Directing nominations for Dunkirk. At the global box office, Warner Bros. films grossed over $5 billion in box office receipts in 2017. Five Warner Bros. films each grossed more than $500 million at the global box office and eight films ranked #1 in their opening weekends in the U.S., more than any other studio. For the 2017-2018 television season, Warner Bros. is producing 70 series, including 37 primetime series on broadcast networks, the most of any studio for the 9 th season in a row. Season-to-date, among adults 18-49, The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon are the #1 and #2 comedies, respectively, and The Voice is the #1 unscripted series.\nFourth-Quarter Results\nRevenues increased 5% ($185 million) to $4.1 billion, primarily reflecting higher games revenues, partially offset by lower theatrical revenues. Games revenues benefited from a favorable mix of releases in the current year period, including Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Theatrical revenues decreased as lower home entertainment revenues related to the comparison to last year’s release of Suicide Squad were partly offset by higher television licensing revenues of theatrical product.\nOperating Income decreased 11% ($62 million) to $512 million, as the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher associated costs of revenues due to the mix of television and games product, as well as higher restructuring and severance costs.\nAdjusted Operating Income decreased 12% ($72 million) to $514 million.\nCONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AND PER SHARE RESULTS\nFull-Year Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $5.2 billion and EPS of $6.64. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders in 2016 of $3.9 billion and EPS of $4.94. The increase in EPS primarily reflects higher Operating Income, a lower effective tax rate reflecting the tax provision benefit related to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 and lower interest expense.\nAdjusted EPS was $7.47 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.86 in 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases of $1.1 billion in the current year and $1.0 billion in the prior year.\nFor 2017 and 2016, the Company had Net Income attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $5.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.\nFourth-Quarter Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $1.4 billion and EPS of $1.75 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $317 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share. The increase in EPS reflects the tax provision benefit related to the U.S. tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017 and higher Operating Income.\nAdjusted EPS was $2.66 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.25 in last year’s fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS excludes premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases of $1.1 billion in the current year quarter and $1.0 billion in the prior year quarter.\nFor the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, the Company had Net Income attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $1.4 billion and $293 million, respectively.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. These measures are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses. Some limitations of Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS are that they do not reflect certain charges that affect the operating results of the Company’s businesses and they involve judgment as to whether items affect fundamental operating performance.\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) is Operating Income (Loss) excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks); gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income divided by Revenues.\nBeginning with periods ending on or after October 1, 2016, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is defined as Operating Income (Loss) excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks); gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; costs related to the pending acquisition by AT&T Inc. (including retention, restructuring and severance costs associated with the transaction); external costs related to mergers, acquisitions or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations.\nAdjusted EPS is Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders with the following items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders: noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets and investments; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks), liabilities (including extinguishments of debt) and investments, in each case including associated costs of the transaction; gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; and amounts attributable to businesses classified as discontinued operations; as well as the impact of taxes and noncontrolling interests on the above items and the Company’s share of the above items with respect to equity method investments. Adjusted EPS is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses as this measure eliminates amounts that do not reflect the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses. The Company utilizes Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses both on an absolute basis and relative to its peers and the broader market. Many investors also use an adjusted EPS measure as a common basis for comparing the performance of different companies.\nBeginning with periods ending on or after October 1, 2016, Adjusted EPS is Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders with the following items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders: noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets and investments; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks), liabilities (including extinguishments of debt) and investments, in each case including associated costs of the transaction; gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; costs related to the pending acquisition by AT&T Inc. (including retention, restructuring and severance costs associated with the transaction); external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; and amounts attributable to businesses classified as discontinued operations; as well as the impact of taxes and noncontrolling interests on the above items and the Company's share of the above items with respect to equity method investments.\nFor periods ending on or before December 31, 2016, Free Cash Flow has been defined as Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries), external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), to the extent such costs are expensed, contingent consideration payments made in connection with acquisitions, and excess tax benefits from equity instruments, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any.\nOn January 1, 2017, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, new accounting guidance that requires excess tax benefits from equity instruments to be classified as a cash flow from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Previously, excess tax benefits from equity instruments were classified as a cash flow from financing activities and amounts related to such excess tax benefits were added in the calculation of Free Cash Flow. Because of the Company’s adoption of the new accounting guidance, such adjustment is no longer necessary. Therefore, beginning with periods ending on or after January 1, 2017, Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries), external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), to the extent such costs are expensed, and contingent consideration payments made in connection with acquisitions, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate the performance and liquidity of its businesses and considers Free Cash Flow when making decisions regarding strategic investments, dividends and share repurchases. The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock.\nA general limitation of these measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and excluded items. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company’s Operating Income (Loss), Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nABOUT TIME WARNER INC.\nTime Warner Inc., a global leader in media and entertainment with businesses in television networks and film and TV entertainment, uses its industry-leading operating scale and brands to create, package and deliver high-quality content worldwide on a multi-platform basis.\nCAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nTime Warner Inc. (“Time Warner” or the “Company”) is a leading media and entertainment company whose businesses include television networks and film and TV entertainment. Time Warner classifies its operations into three reportable segments: Turner: consisting principally of cable networks and digital media properties; Home Box Office: consisting principally of premium pay television services and a service that delivers video content to consumers over the internet (“OTT service”) domestically and premium pay, basic tier television and OTT services internationally; and Warner Bros.: consisting principally of television, feature film, home video and game production and distribution. On October 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), West Merger Sub, Inc., and West Merger Sub II, LLC, pursuant to which the Company will be acquired by AT&T for a combination of $53.75 and shares of AT&T stock. At the time of entry into the merger agreement, the value of the merger consideration was $107.50 per share of Time Warner common stock and the value will vary, subject to a collar, prior to the closing of the transaction. The merger is conditioned on the receipt of certain antitrust and other required regulatory consents. On November 20, 2017, the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “Court”) under a federal antitrust statute to enjoin the merger. The Court has set March 19, 2018 as the start date for the trial. Time Warner intends to vigorously contest the action. In addition, Time Warner and AT&T have agreed to extend the termination date of the Merger Agreement to April 22, 2018, and each has agreed to waive, until June 21, 2018, its right to terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger is not completed by April 22, 2018.
