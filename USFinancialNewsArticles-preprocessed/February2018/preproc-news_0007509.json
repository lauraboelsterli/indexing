    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- HVAC Investigators (HVACi), the nation's leading provider of HVAC damage assessments for insurance claims, announced yesterday the acquisition of Donan Engineering's HVAC Forensics division. The consolidation of two market-leading brands in the insurance industry is anticipated to benefit the customer bases of both organizations through larger service areas, increased technical expertise, and quicker cycle times.\nDamon Stafford, CEO of HVACi, stated, \"We are excited about the opportunities this strategic acquisition will bring in advancing our leadership in the onsite HVAC assessment business and enhancing services for clients of both organizations. Not only will this provide current HVAC Forensics customers with a nationwide service, but it will also expand the technical depth of the current HVACi network of technicians.\"\nDonan's HVAC Forensics division previously served 23 states. Those customers will now be able to utilize HVACi's 800+ network of technicians and national footprint to assign any HVAC or refrigeration claim, anywhere, to one service provider. The breadth of HVACi's technician network will also provide HVAC Forensics' clients with quicker assessment cycle times. HVAC Forensics customers can anticipate additional benefits, such as access to real-time HVAC market pricing verification and availability, technical professionals following the closing of the claim, and HVACi's dedicated large loss team.\nThe acquisition will be equally beneficial for current HVACi customers, according to Matt Livingston, HVACi's President and Director of Vendor Relations. \"The integration of Donan's HVAC Forensics team and its extended technical expertise is a powerful addition to HVACi's current network. Additionally, the growth of the network following the HVAC Forensics acquisition will allow HVACi to service loss locations at faster turnaround times.\"\nHVACi and Donan are committed to providing a smooth transition for all customers and have worked diligently to ensure a seamless integration and customer experience. HVACi's proven record of excellent customer service and dedication to maintaining the quality of support clients have come to expect from Donan, assures that there will be no disruption of service for either customer base.\nFollowing the February 1, 2018 acquisition, all of Donan's HVAC Forensics division will become part of the HVACi group of companies. All other lines of Donan Engineering's business will remain within the Donan Engineering Company family.\nHVAC Investigators (HVACi) is the nation's leading provider of HVAC and refrigeration damage assessments. Our prompt inspections and actionable reports help insurance carriers settle HVAC claims more efficiently and with a higher degree of accuracy.
