    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ATTOM Data Solutions , curator of the nation's premier property database, today announced it has acquired Onboard Informatics, the leading provider of neighborhood data and data-enabled turnkey products to the real estate industry.\n\"Onboard has a long and accomplished track record as an innovator in enhancing and democratizing neighborhood data assets, paralleling our own mission of powering real estate transparency,\" said Rob Barber, CEO at ATTOM Data Solutions. \"This acquisition will benefit existing customers of both companies — and the entire marketplace — by providing complementary datasets in a one-stop data shop.\"\nOnboard's neighborhood data is being integrated into the ATTOM Data Warehouse, which blends property tax, deed, mortgage, foreclosure, environmental risk, natural hazard, and neighborhood data for more than 155 million U.S. residential and commercial properties. A persistent, unique ID assigned to every property record in the ATTOM Data Warehouse — the ATTOM ID — will be used to link the new Onboard neighborhood data with all other datasets, and the combined data will be available through ATTOM's flexible delivery solutions, including bulk file license , APIs and customized reports .\n\"This acquisition by ATTOM will enable Onboard's customers to conveniently access robust tax, deed and mortgage data, that, when combined with Onboard's neighborhood data, completes the full property data picture needed to improve decision-making, increase lead generation and grow revenue,\" said Marc Siden, CEO and Co-founder of Onboard Informatics.\nFounded 15 years ago, Onboard Informatics fuels sales and feeds decision-making for some of the largest U.S. brands, including Century 21, Coldwell Banker and Weichert. Its data products include area data (neighborhood, metro and residential boundaries along with school attendance zones), point of interest data (restaurants, banks, shopping and more), and community data (crime, population, education, weather and commuter times).\n\"Not only will our customers now be able to access a broader set of property-related data from one vendor, they'll also have more flexible options for consuming that data through the various ATTOM data delivery solutions including the ability to consume neighborhood data as bulk files,\" said Jonathan Bednarsh, president and co-founder of Onboard Informatics.\nAbout ATTOM Data Solutions\nATTOM Data Solutions blends property tax, deed, mortgage, foreclosure, environmental risk, natural hazard, and neighborhood data for more than 155 million U.S. residential and commercial properties multi-sourced from more than 3,000 U.S. counties.
