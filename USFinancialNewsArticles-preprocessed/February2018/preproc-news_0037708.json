The Fed sought to bar Peter Little from the industry and fine him $487,500 for allegedly using chatrooms to wrongly coordinate trades. The action follows a Fed action in May 2015 when officials fined Barclays $342 million for unsafe and unsound practices related to foreign exchange markets. Little could not be immediately reached for comment. Reporting By Patrick RuckerEditing by Chizu Nomiyama",
