Repsol and Tullow each have stakes of 37.5 percent in that block. \nTotal added it had an option to buy a 25 percent working interest in the Orinduik Block, in an agreement with Canadian company Eco Atlantic Oil & Gas Ltd, which will retain a 15 percent interest following exercise of the option, alongside Tullow Oil which has 60 percent.
