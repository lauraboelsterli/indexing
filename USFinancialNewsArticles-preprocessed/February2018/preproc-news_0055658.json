    "text": "HONOLULU (AP) â€” State sheriffs on Thursday removed protesters from the ruins of a Hawaii hotel where they have been squatting since last year in an attempt to block redevelopment of land where Hawaiian chiefs once lived and where Elvis Presley's character got married in the movie \"Blue Hawaii.\"\nThe Hawaii Department of Public Safety said in a statement Thursday that state sheriffs arrested 23-year-old Mahealani Hanie-Grace for trespassing at Coco Palms on Kauai.\nThe protest began when two men arrived claiming they owned the property because they descend from King Kaumualii, the last ruler of Kauai. Dozens of other protesters have come and gone.\nPolice have cited protesters for trespassing. A judge last month issued an order to evict them.\nThe public safety department said 25 deputy sheriffs participated in the raid.\nCoco Palms has been shut since 1992, when Hurricane Iniki heavily damaged the property.\nDemolition began in 2016, with the goal of reopening in mid-2018. The clash has caused delays, so the developers hope to start construction soon after the protesters leave.\nThe renovated hotel will have 350 rooms, including 22 master suites and about 50 junior suites. Hyatt will manage the hotel once it's reopened.\nThe protest is the latest example of Native Hawaiian activists taking a stand on cultural issues and sacred places. Protesters in recent years blocked a road leading to the summit of Mauna Kea, the Big Island's highest peak, to stop the construction of one of the world's largest telescopes. That case is currently before the courts.\nHawaiian chiefs were born and lived on the property hundreds of years ago. Royalty favored the area for its plentiful water, which made it ideal for irrigating fields for the starchy vegetable taro, a staple crop.\nCoco Palms opened as a resort in 1953. Eight years later, it served as the backdrop for scenes in a Hollywood romantic comedy featuring Presley.",
