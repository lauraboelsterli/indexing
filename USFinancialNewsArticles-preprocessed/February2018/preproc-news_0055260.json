    "text": " 20 AM / Updated 34 minutes ago Australian deputy prime minister resigns from Cabinet, remains in parliament Reuters Staff 1 Min Read SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Friday he will resign as leader of his party and will move to the backbench after weeks of pressure over an extra-marital affair with his former media secretary. Slideshow (2 Images) Joyce said he will step down on Monday as leader of the National party, the junior partner in Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s centre-right coalition. He will remain in parliament, safeguarding Turnbull’s shaky one-seat majority. Joyce, a practising Catholic, has been married for 24 years and has campaigned on “family values”.
