(NASDAQ: PYPL) today announced fourth quarter and full year results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\n“PayPal had a transformative year in 2017. We brought record numbers of new customer accounts to our platform by democratizing financial services for consumers and commerce capabilities for merchants. We also substantially expanded our opportunities for future growth and redefined our competitive position through our successful partnership strategy driven by our open platform architecture,” said Dan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal.\nSchulman continued, “I am very pleased to announce that PayPal and eBay have signed a term sheet to make PayPal available, as a way to pay on eBay, through July 2023. We enter 2018 with strong momentum supporting an increasingly differentiated and expansive value proposition, and a focused commitment to deliver increasing value to our customers and shareholders.”\nSignificant events in fourth quarter 2017\nPayPal and Synchrony Financial announced an agreement expanding their consumer credit relationship. Under the terms of the transaction, Synchrony Financial will acquire PayPal’s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, which totaled approximately $6.4 billion in receivables as of December 31, 2017. Subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, this transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. The application of held for sale accounting relating to the U.S. consumer credit receivables resulted in the reversal of the related allowance for losses on interest and principal receivables. The impact from the one-time adjustments related to held for sale accounting on GAAP net revenues was $39 million and on GAAP transaction and loan losses was $283 million, a benefit to GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.25. PayPal's GAAP results also include the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which resulted in a preliminary net tax expense of $180 million.\nFinancial highlights for fourth quarter 2017 include:\nGAAP revenue growth of 26% to $3.74 billion, or 26% on a foreign currency neutral (FX-neutral) basis with non-GAAP revenue growth of 24% to $3.71 billion, or 24% on a FX-neutral basis GAAP operating margin of 22.5% with non-GAAP operating margin of 21.8% GAAP EPS growth of 57% to $0.50, which includes the impact of held for sale accounting of $0.25, partially offset by the impact from the Tax Act of ($0.15), with non-GAAP EPS growth of 30% to $0.55 Entered into a $3.0 billion unsecured, term loan credit facility\nFinancial highlights for full year 2017 include:\nGAAP revenue growth of 21% to $13.09 billion, or 22% on an FX-neutral basis with non-GAAP revenue growth of 20% to $13.06 billion, or 21% on an FX-neutral basis GAAP operating margin of 16.2% with non-GAAP operating margin of 21.1% GAAP EPS growth of 28% to $1.47, which includes the impact of held for sale accounting of $0.26, partially offset by the impact from the Tax Act of ($0.15), with non-GAAP EPS growth of 27% to $1.90 Returned $1.01 billion to stockholders by repurchasing 19.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $51\nFourth quarter and full year 2017 impact of held for sale accounting on cash flow\nThe application of held for sale accounting resulted in a change to the characterization of cash flows related to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Cash flows related to repayments of loans originated prior to the application of held for sale accounting continue to be reflected in cash flow from investing activities. Cash flows related to the net changes in loans originated following our application of held for sale accounting are now reflected in cash flow from operating activities. In the fourth quarter, $1.3 billion of net cash outflows recognized in cash flow from operating activities would previously have been recognized in cash flow from investing activities. This change resulted in operating cash flow of ($147) million with free cash flow of ($327) million in the fourth quarter. For full year 2017, inclusive of the impact from held for sale accounting, PayPal is reporting operating cash flow of $2.5 billion with free cash flow of $1.9 billion.\nOperating highlights for fourth quarter 2017 include:\n8.7 million active customer accounts added, with net new actives up 61% 2.2 billion payment transactions, up 25% $131 billion in total payment volume (TPV), up 32%, or 29% on an FX-neutral basis 33.6 payment transactions per active account on a trailing twelve months basis, up 8%\nOperating highlights for full year 2017 include:\nActive customer accounts of 227 million, up 15% with growth of 29 million net new actives 7.6 billion payment transactions, up 24% $451 billion in TPV, up 27% both on a spot and FX-neutral basis 33.6 payment transactions per active account on a trailing twelve months basis, up 8%\nPayPal’s expanding value proposition\nPayPal processed $131 billion in TPV in the fourth quarter, representing growth of 32%, or 29% on an FX-neutral basis. Merchant Services TPV grew 36%, or 33% on an FX-neutral basis, and represented 87% of overall TPV for the quarter. eBay volume grew 10%, or 7% on an FX-neutral basis, and represented approximately 13% of overall TPV for the fourth quarter versus approximately 16% a year ago.\nPerson-to-Person (P2P) volume grew 50% to approximately $27 billion, and represented approximately 20% of TPV in the fourth quarter. Venmo, the company’s social payments platform, processed $10.4 billion in payment volume in the fourth quarter, an increase of 86% year over year, and for the first time surpassed $10 billion in payment volume processed in a quarter. For the full year, Venmo’s volume increased 97% with approximately $35 billion in payment volume processed.\nDriven by strong mobile engagement on our platform over the holiday shopping season, PayPal processed approximately $48 billion in mobile payment volume in the fourth quarter, representing approximately 53% growth year over year.\nExtending PayPal’s global reach and merchant offering\nDuring the fourth quarter, PayPal announced the launch of domestic operations in India. Merchants offering PayPal will be able to process both local and global payments through the platform, gaining access to PayPal’s more than 200 million customers around the world and in India through a single integration.\nPayPal also made progress introducing Pay with Venmo to consumers. More than two million U.S. merchants now offer Venmo as a mobile payment option through the PayPal and Braintree platforms.\nOne Touch, PayPal’s innovative checkout experience, continues its global roll out, ending the fourth quarter with 80 million consumers opted in, up from 40 million a year ago. At the end of 2017, eight million merchants offered One Touch compared with five million a year ago.\nSubsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, PayPal and eBay signed a term sheet to continue to feature PayPal at checkout on the eBay Marketplace through July 2023.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial and Operating Highlights\nFourth Quarter\n(presented in millions, except per share data and percentages)\n2017\n2016\nYoY Growth\nFX-Neutral\nYoY Growth\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV) $ 131,449 $ 99,348 $ 32,101 32 % 29 % GAAP Net revenues $ 3,744 $ 2,981 $ 763 26 % 26 % Operating margin 22.5 % 15.4 % ** 708bps N/A Effective tax rate 28.2 % 16.8 % ** 1,140 bps N/A Net income $ 620 $ 390 $ 230 59 % N/A Earnings per diluted share $ 0.50 $ 0.32 $ 0.18 57 % N/A Net cash provided by operating activities $ (147 ) $ 923 $ (1,070 ) (116 %) N/A Non-GAAP Net revenues $ 3,705 $ 2,981 $ 724 24 % 24 % Operating margin 21.8 % 20.8 % ** 102bps N/A Effective tax rate 19.1 % 18.5 % ** 61bps N/A Net income $ 670 $ 512 $ 158 31 % N/A Earnings per diluted share $ 0.55 $ 0.42 $ 0.13 30 % N/A Free cash flow $ (327 ) $ 771 $ (1,098 ) (142 %) N/A ** Not meaningful.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments - PayPal’s cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nFull year 2018 revenue and earnings guidance\nPayPal expects revenue to grow 15 - 17% at current spot rates and 14 - 16% on an FX-neutral basis, to a range of $15.00 - $15.25 billion.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and free cash flow.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included in this press release.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the company’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company’s financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company’s management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, restructuring-related charges, other certain gains, losses or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company’s management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.\nRestructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nCertain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.\nThe company also uses free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company’s business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company’s cash balance for the period.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also analyzes certain measures, including net revenues and operating expenses, on an FX-neutral basis to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. The company believes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not indicative of the company’s operations and evaluating growth in net revenues and operating expenses on an FX-neutral basis provides an additional meaningful and comparable assessment of these measures to both management and investors. FX-neutral results are calculated by translating the current period’s local currency results by the prior period’s exchange rate. FX-neutral growth rates are calculated by comparing the current period’s FX-neutral results by the prior period’s results, excluding the impact from hedging activities.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Revenues to Non-GAAP Net Revenues and\nGAAP Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nThree 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) GAAP net revenues $ 3,744 $ 2,981 $ 13,094 $ 10,842 Other (1) (39 ) — (39 ) — Non-GAAP net revenues $ 3,705 $ 2,981 $ 13,055 $ 10,842 (1) Elimination of allowance on interest receivable due to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio designation as held for sale.\nThree 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages) GAAP operating income $ 843 $ 460 $ 2,127 $ 1,586 Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes 223 127 761 455 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (1) 58 32 129 133 Restructuring — — 40 — Other (2) (317 ) — (302 ) — Total non-GAAP operating income adjustments (36 ) 159 628 588 Non-GAAP operating income $ 807 $ 619 $ 2,755 $ 2,174 Non-GAAP operating margin 22 % 21 % 21 % 20 % (1) Includes $30 million impairment related to a portion of acquired TIO customer-related intangible assets in 2017.\n(2) Includes elimination of allowance on loans receivable ($283 million), allowance on interest receivable ($39 million) due to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio designation as held for sale and certain fees associated with the sale ($5 million), and impairment of an investment in an intellectual property fund ($15 million).\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income,\nGAAP Diluted EPS to Non-GAAP Diluted EPS,\nand GAAP Effective Tax Rate to Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate\nThree 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions, except percentages) (unaudited) GAAP income before income taxes $ 864 $ 469 $ 2,200 $ 1,631 GAAP income tax expense 244 79 405 230 GAAP net income 620 390 1,795 1,401 Non-GAAP adjustments to net income: Non-GAAP operating income adjustments (see table above) (36 ) 159 628 588 Other (1) 201 — 224 — Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (115 ) (37 ) (329 ) (164 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 670 $ 512 $ 2,318 $ 1,825 Diluted net income per share: GAAP $ 0.50 $ 0.32 $ 1.47 $ 1.15 Non-GAAP $ 0.55 $ 0.42 $ 1.90 $ 1.50 Shares used in GAAP diluted share calculation 1,228 1,216 1,221 1,218 Shares used in non-GAAP diluted share calculation 1,228 1,216 1,221 1,218 GAAP effective tax rate 28 % 17 % 18 % 14 % Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments to net income (9 )% 1 % — % 4 % Non-GAAP effective tax rate 19 % 18 % 18 % 18 % (1) Tax expense related to the Tax Act ($180 million) and intra-entity transfer of intellectual property ($44 million).\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash Flow\nThree 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions/unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities $ (147 ) $ 923 $ 2,531 $ 3,158 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (180 ) (152 ) (667 ) (669 ) Free cash flow $ (327 ) $ 771 $ 1,864 $ 2,489\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180131006195/en/\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nInvestor Relations Contacts\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\nVice President, Investor Relations\ngrabinovitch@paypal.com\nor\nAkila Moorthy\nDirector, Investor Relations\namoorthy@paypal.com\nor\nMedia Relations Contacts\nMartha Cass\nSenior Director, Corporate Communications\nmcass@paypal.com\nor\nAmanda Miller, 408-219-0563\nDirector, Corporate Communications\namandacmiller@paypal.com\nSource: PayPal Holdings, Inc.",
