Foster, Main Street's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017, periods during which we increased our total investment income, our distributable net investment income per share and our net asset value per share, in each case over the same periods in the prior year and for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis over the third quarter of 2017. As a result of our positive performance, we again generated distributable net investment income per share in excess of our regular monthly dividends, exceeding the regular monthly dividends paid during the quarter and year by approximately 21% and 15%, respectively. In addition, we maintained our supplemental dividends at $0.55 per share. We also completed our second investment grade debt offering, which provided significant enhancement to our already strong capital structure. We believe that our 2017 performance continues to highlight the unique benefits of our diversified portfolio, differentiated investment strategy and efficient operating structure.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nThe following table provides a summary of our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange ($)\nChange (%)\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nInterest income\n$ 44,594\n$ 37,508\n$ 7,086\n19%\nDividend income\n9,506\n7,088\n2,418\n34%\nFee income\n1,697\n2,234\n(537)\n(24%)\nTotal investment income\n$ 55,797\n$ 46,830\n$ 8,967\n19%\nNet investment income\n$ 37,483\n$ 30,432\n$ 7,051\n23%\nNet investment income per share\n$ 0.64\n$ 0.57\n$ 0.07\n12%\nDistributable net investment income (1)\n$ 39,967\n$ 32,759\n$ 7,208\n22%\nDistributable net investment income per share (1)\n$ 0.69\n$ 0.61\n$ 0.08\n13%\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations\n$ 61,440\n$ 47,993\n$ 13,447\n28%\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations per share\n$ 1.05\n$ 0.90\n$ 0.15\n17%\nThe $9.0 million increase in total investment income in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the comparable period of the prior year was principally attributable to (i) a $7.1 million increase in interest income primarily related to higher average levels of portfolio debt investments and increased activities involving existing investment portfolio debt investments and (ii) a $2.4 million increase in dividend income from investment portfolio equity investments, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in fee income. The total investment income in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes (i) an increase of $2.7 million related to interest income activity from portfolio companies that is considered to be less consistent on a recurring basis or non-recurring when compared to the same period in 2016 and (ii) an increase of $1.1 million primarily related to higher accelerated prepayment, repricing and other activity for certain investment portfolio debt investments when compared to the same period in 2016.\nCash operating expenses (total operating expenses excluding non-cash, share-based compensation expense) increased to $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $14.1 million for the corresponding period of 2016. This comparable period increase in cash operating expenses was principally attributable to (i) a $1.0 million increase in interest expense primarily due to the issuance of our 4.50% Notes due 2022 in November 2017, (ii) a $0.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses and (iii) a $0.5 million increase in compensation expense related to increases in the number of personnel, base compensation levels and incentive compensation accruals, with these increases partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in the expenses allocated to the external investment manager, a wholly owned portfolio company and registered investment advisor that provides investment management services to third parties (the \"External Investment Manager\"), in each case when compared to the same period in the prior year. Our Operating Expense to Assets Ratio was 1.5% on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is consistent with the ratio for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding the effect of certain non-recurring professional fees and other expenses incurred prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, our Operating Expense to Assets Ratio was 1.5%, which is consistent with the ratio for the prior year. Including the effect of the non-recurring expenses, the ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 1.6%.\nThe $7.1 million increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to the increase in total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses both as discussed above.\nThe $7.2 million increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 in distributable net investment income, which is net investment income before non-cash, share-based compensation expense, was primarily due to the higher level of total investment income, partially offset by higher operating expenses as discussed above. Distributable net investment income on a per share basis for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects (i) an increase of approximately $0.06 per share from the comparable period in 2016 attributable to the net increase in the comparable levels of accelerated prepayment, repricing and other unusual activity for certain investment portfolio debt investments and (ii) a greater number of average shares outstanding compared to the corresponding period in 2016 primarily due to shares issued through our at-the-market, or ATM, program, shares issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans and shares issued pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan.\nThe $13.4 million change in the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was primarily the result of (i) a $26.4 million improvement in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from portfolio investments, including the impact of accounting reversals relating to realized gains/income (losses), to net unrealized appreciation of $47.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes the impact of approximately $15 million of unrealized appreciation in the LMM equity portfolio related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, and (ii) a $7.1 million increase in net investment income as discussed above, with these changes partially offset by (i) a $12.3 million change in the income tax benefit (provision) from an income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 to an income tax provision of $12.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and (ii) a $7.7 million increase in the net realized loss from investments to a net realized loss of $11.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The net realized loss from investments of $11.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of (i) the net realized loss of $9.0 million in our middle market portfolio, which was the result of (a) the realized loss of $5.6 million on the exit of a middle market investment and (b) the realized loss of $3.4 million on the restructure of a middle market investment, (ii) the net realized loss of $3.1 million in our LMM portfolio, which is primarily the net result of (a) the realized loss of $3.7 million on the exit of a LMM investment, (b) the realized loss of $1.5 million on the partial exits of two LMM investments and (c) realized gains of $2.1 million related to other activity in the LMM portfolio, with these net realized losses partially offset by (iii) net realized gains of $0.4 million resulting from a gain on the exit of a private loan investment and a loss on the restructure of a private loan investment.\nThe following table provides a summary of the total net unrealized appreciation of $47.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nLMM (a)\nMiddle Market\nPrivate Loan\nOther (b)\nTotal\n(dollars in millions)\nAccounting reversals of net unrealized (appreciation) depreciation recognized in prior periods\ndue to net realized (gains)/(income) losses recognized during the current period\n$ 4.6\n$ 6.9\n$ (1.0)\n$ -\n$ 10.5\nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) relating to portfolio investments\n34.2\n(1.0)\n(0.9)\n4.1\n36.4\nTotal net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) relating to portfolio investments\n$ 38.8\n$ 5.9\n$ (1.9)\n$ 4.1\n$ 46.9\nUnrealized appreciation relating to SBIC debentures (c)\n0.8\nTotal net change in unrealized appreciation\n$ 47.7\n(a)\nLMM includes unrealized appreciation on 34 LMM portfolio investments and unrealized depreciation on 14 LMM portfolio investments.\n(b)\nOther includes $2.5 million of unrealized appreciation relating to the External Investment Manager and $1.6 million of net unrealized appreciation relating to our other portfolio.\n(c)\nRelates to unrealized appreciation on the Small Business Investment Company (\"SBIC\") debentures held by Main Street Capital II, LP which are accounted for on a fair value basis.\nThe income tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $12.1 million principally consisted of a deferred tax provision of $9.4 million, which is primarily the result of the net activity relating to our portfolio investments held in our taxable subsidiaries, including changes in net operating loss carryforwards, changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation and other temporary book-tax differences, and other current tax expense of $2.7 million related to (i) current tax expense of $2.4 million related to accruals for U.S. federal and state income taxes and (ii) a $0.3 million accrual for excise tax on our estimated undistributed taxable income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $51.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $521.0 million of unused capacity under our Credit Facility, which we maintain to support our investment and operating activities.\nSeveral details regarding our capital structure as of December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nOur Credit Facility included $585.0 million in total commitments from a diversified group of fifteen participating lenders, plus an accordion feature which allows us to increase the total commitments under the facility to up to $750.0 million. $64.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility, bearing interest at an annual interest rate of 3.2%. $295.8 million of outstanding SBIC debentures through our three wholly owned SBIC subsidiaries, with $54.2 million of remaining capacity under the permitted maximum amount of SBIC debentures of $350.0 million. These debentures, which are guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, had a weighted-average annual fixed interest rate of approximately 3.6% and mature ten years from original issuance. The first maturity related to our SBIC debentures does not occur until 2019, and the weighted-average remaining duration was approximately 5.8 years. $185.0 million of notes outstanding, the 4.50% Notes due 2022, that bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year. The 4.50% Notes due 2022 mature on December 1, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option subject to certain make-whole provisions. $175.0 million of notes outstanding that bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year (the \"4.50% Notes due 2019\"). The 4.50% Notes due 2019 mature on December 1, 2019 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at our option subject to certain make-whole provisions. $90.7 million of notes outstanding that bear interest at a rate of 6.125% per year (the \"6.125% Notes\"). The 6.125% Notes mature on April 1, 2023, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option on or after April 1, 2018. The 6.125% Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade under the symbol \"MSCA.\" Our net asset value totaled $1,380.4 million, or $23.53 per share.\nInvestment Portfolio Information as of December 31, 2017 (3)\nThe following table provides a summary of the investments in our LMM portfolio, middle market portfolio and private loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017:\nAs of December 31, 2017\nLMM (a)\nMiddle Market\nPrivate Loan\n(dollars in millions)\nNumber of portfolio companies\n70\n62\n54\nFair value\n$ 948.2\n$ 609.3\n$ 467.5\nCost\n$ 776.5\n$ 629.7\n$ 489.2\n% of portfolio at cost - debt\n67.1%\n97.3%\n93.6%\n% of portfolio at cost - equity\n32.9%\n2.7%\n6.4%\n% of debt investments at cost secured by first priority lien\n98.1%\n90.5%\n94.5%\nWeighted-average annual effective yield (b)\n12.0%\n9.0%\n9.2%\nAverage EBITDA (c)\n$ 4.4\n$ 78.3\n$ 39.6\n(a)\nWe had equity ownership in 97% of our LMM portfolio companies, and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those portfolio companies was approximately 39%.\n(b)\nThe weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost, including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status.\n(c)\nThe average EBITDA is calculated using a simple average for the LMM portfolio and a weighted-average for the middle market and private loan portfolios. These calculations exclude certain portfolio companies, including six LMM portfolio companies, one middle market portfolio company and three private loan portfolio companies, as EBITDA is not a meaningful valuation metric for our investments in these portfolio companies, and those portfolio companies whose primary purpose is to own real estate.\nThe fair value of our LMM portfolio company equity investments was approximately 182% of the cost of such equity investments and our LMM portfolio companies had a median net senior debt (senior interest-bearing debt through our debt position less cash and cash equivalents) to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) ratio of 2.8 to 1.0 and a median total EBITDA to senior interest expense ratio of 2.7 to 1.0. Including all debt that is junior in priority to our debt position, these median ratios were 3.3 to 1.0 and 2.7 to 1.0, respectively. (3) (4)\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had other portfolio investments in eleven companies, collectively totaling $104.6 million in fair value and $109.4 million in cost basis, which comprised approximately 4.8% of our investment portfolio at fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there was no cost basis in our investment in the External Investment Manager and this investment had a fair value of $41.8 million, which comprised approximately 1.9% of our investment portfolio at fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had five investments on non-accrual status, which comprised approximately 0.2% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and approximately 2.3% at cost. Our total portfolio investments at fair value were approximately 108% of the related cost basis as of December 31, 2017.\nExternal Investment Manager\nThe External Investment Manager maintains an investment sub-advisory relationship with HMS Income Fund, Inc., a non-listed business development company (\"HMS Income\"), and earns management fees for the services provided to HMS Income. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the External Investment Manager generated $2.9 million of fee income from this relationship, and HMS Income ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with total assets of over $1.1 billion. The relationship with HMS Income benefited our net investment income by $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 through a $1.6 million reduction of our operating expenses for expenses we allocated to the External Investment Manager for services we provided to it and $0.9 million of dividend income we received from the External Investment Manager.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call / Webcast\nMain Street has scheduled a conference call for Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nYou may access the conference call by dialing 412-902-0030 at least 10 minutes prior to the start time. The conference call can also be accessed via a simultaneous webcast by logging into the investor relations section of the Main Street web site at http://www.mainstcapital.com .\nA telephonic replay of the conference call will be available through Friday, March 2, 2018 and may be accessed by dialing 201-612-7415 and using the passcode 13674997#. An audio archive of the conference call will also be available on the investor relations section of the company's website at http://www.mainstcapital.com shortly after the call and will be accessible for approximately 90 days.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the financial and other information included in this press release, please refer to the Main Street Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 to be filed Commission ( www.sec.gov ) and Main Street's Fourth Quarter 2017 Investor Presentation to be posted on the investor relations section of the Main Street website at http://www.mainstcapital.com .\n(1) Distributable net investment income is net investment income as determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense which is non-cash in nature. Main Street believes presenting distributable net investment income and the related per share amount is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure for analyzing its financial performance since share-based compensation does not require settlement in cash. However, distributable net investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for net investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, distributable net investment income should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Main Street's financial performance. A reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with U.S. GAAP to distributable net investment income is detailed in the financial tables included with this press release.\n(2) Return on equity equals the net increase in net assets resulting from operations divided by the average quarterly total net assets for the period.\n(3) Portfolio company financial information has not been independently verified by Main Street.\n(4) These credit statistics exclude certain portfolio companies for which EBITDA is not a meaningful metric for the statistic.\nABOUT MAIN STREET CAPITAL CORPORATION\nMain Street ( www.mainstcapital.com ) is a principal investment firm that primarily provides long-term debt and equity capital to lower middle market companies and debt capital to middle market companies.

Main Street believes presenting distributable net investment income and the related per share amount is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure of information for analyzing its financial performance since share-based compensation does not require settlement in cash. However, distributable net investment income is a non-U.S. GAAP measure and should not be considered as a replacement for net investment income and other earnings measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Instead, distributable net investment income should be reviewed only in connection with such U.S. GAAP measures in analyzing Main Street's financial performance. A reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with U.S. GAAP to distributable net investment income is presented in the table above.\nContacts:\nMain Street Capital Corporation\nDwayne L.
