    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bella All Natural is voluntarily recalling its Diet Capsules labeled as Bella, Lot Number MFD:10.15.2017 EXP: 10.14.2019, to the consumer level.\nThis recall has been initiated due to presence of sibutramine. Sibutramine is an appetite suppressant that was withdrawn from the U.S. market in October 2010 due to safety concerns. N-Desmethyl sibutramine is an active metabolite of sibutramine.

The company has not received any reports of adverse events or injuries. The product is used as a diet pill and is packaged in a plastic bottle, with 30 pills, and with the Lot Number MFD:10.15.2017 EXP: 10.14.2019.
