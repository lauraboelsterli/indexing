Full-year 2017 net income of $1.045 billion, or $6.29 per share, up 77 percent from $591 million, or $3.55 per share, in 2016. Non-GAAP operating income of $455 million, or $2.74 per share, down 11 percent from $511 million, or $3.07 per share. $542 million increase in fourth-quarter 2017 net income, reflecting a $495 million benefit from net deferred income tax liability revaluation due to U.S. tax reform, a $27 million increase in after-tax property casualty underwriting income and a $19 million after-tax increase in net realized investment gains. $50.29 book value per share at December 31, 2017, up $7.34 or 17.1 percent since December 31, 2016, and including $3.02 or 7.0 percent from the tax benefit noted above. 22.9 percent value creation ratio for full-year 2017, including 7.0 percent from the tax benefit noted above, compared with 14.5 percent for 2016.\nFinancial Highlights\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenue Data\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,258\n$\n1,192\n6\n$\n4,954\n$\n4,710\n5\nInvestment income, net of expenses\n156\n153\n2\n609\n595\n2\nTotal revenues\n1,411\n1,312\n8\n5,732\n5,449\n5\nIncome Statement Data\nNet income\n$\n642\n$\n100\n542\n$\n1,045\n$\n591\n77\nRealized investment gains and losses, net\n(6)\n(25)\n76\n95\n80\n19\nEffects of U.S. tax reform legislation\n495\n—\nnm\n495\n—\nnm\nNon-GAAP operating income*\n$\n153\n$\n125\n22\n$\n455\n$\n511\n(11)\nPer Share Data (diluted)\nNet income\n$\n3.88\n$\n0.60\n547\n$\n6.29\n$\n3.55\n77\nRealized investment gains and losses, net\n(0.04)\n(0.15)\n73\n0.57\n0.48\n19\nEffects of U.S. tax reform legislation\n2.99\n—\nnm\n2.98\n—\nnm\nNon-GAAP operating income*\n$\n0.93\n$\n0.75\n24\n$\n2.74\n$\n3.07\n(11)\nBook value\n$\n50.29\n$\n42.95\n17\nCash dividend declared\n$\n1.00\n$\n0.48\n108\n$\n2.50\n$\n1.92\n30\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n165.6\n166.5\n(1)\n166.0\n166.5\n0\n* The Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures section near the end of this report defines and\nreconciles measures presented in this release that are not based on U.

Full-year 2017 property casualty combined ratio at 97.5 percent, with net written premiums up 6 percent. 6 percent increase in fourth-quarter 2017 net written premiums, reflecting price increases and premium growth initiatives. $151 million fourth-quarter 2017 property casualty new business written premiums. Agencies appointed since the beginning of 2016 contributed $23 million or 15 percent of total fourth-quarter new business written premiums. $106 million increase in fourth-quarter 2017 life insurance subsidiary net income, including a $111 million benefit from revaluation of deferred income taxes due to tax reform, and 11 percent growth in life insurance earned premiums.\nInvestment and Balance Sheet Highlights\n2 percent or $3 million rise in fourth-quarter 2017 pretax investment income, including 5 percent growth for stock portfolio dividends and 1 percent growth for bond interest income. 10 percent full-year increase in fair value of total investments at December 31, 2017, including a 17 percent increase for the stock portfolio and a 6 percent increase for the bond portfolio. $2.511 billion parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end 2017, up 18 percent from a year ago.\nFourth-Quarter Improves Full-Year Results\nSteven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented: \"Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter rose 22 percent over last year's result, bringing our full-year non-GAAP operating income to $455 million. Full-year 2017 net income rose 77 percent to $1.045 billion, including a $495 million benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\"After one of the highest catastrophe losses for any recent third-quarter for our company, fourth-quarter catastrophe losses swung the other way – decreasing 6.2 points compared with fourth-quarter 2016 – and improving our property casualty insurance full-year results. A fourth-quarter combined ratio of 92.9 percent helped improve our combined ratio from 99.1 percent at nine months to 97.5 percent for the full-year. Underwriting profits before taxes increased 91 percent for the quarter and helped us earn a 2017 full-year underwriting profit of $128 million.\n\"Our fourth-quarter and full-year combined ratios also included higher paid losses and some areas of higher reserve estimates of losses and loss expenses not yet paid for our commercial casualty line of business. While our commercial casualty line achieved an underwriting profit in 2017, we felt it was prudent to record higher reserves for estimated losses in this line. Development for all lines in total remained favorable for the full year, advancing our record of net favorable property casualty reserve development to 29 years as we continue to follow our consistent reserving practices.\"\nFocused, Profitable Growth\n\"For the first time, full-year new business premiums written with our independent agencies exceeded $600 million. Property casualty net written premium growth continued to reach our target, increasing 6 percent, compared with full-year 2016, to $4.8 billion and rising for each of our property casualty insurance segments for both the fourth quarter and the full year.\n\"We continue our careful, measured expansion of our product lines, marketing territories and independent agency force, with an eye toward gradual geographic diversification of our premium sources. During the fourth quarter, net written premiums from our excess and surplus lines operation, launched in 2008, passed the $200 million mark. Our initiatives to attract more of our agents' high net worth clients and to grow our reinsurance assumed division, Cincinnati Re SM , continued on track, both increasing property casualty net written premiums.\n\"We continue to make strides toward pricing precision, using models and agent-provided information to identify the right price for new business and to take action on selected renewal accounts to improve price adequacy. During the fourth quarter, commercial lines policies and excess and surplus lines business that renewed had price percentage increases that averaged in the low-single-digits; price increases averaged in the high-single-digits for personal auto renewals and in the mid-single-digits for homeowner policies.\"\nConfidence in the Future\n\"The U.S. tax reform recently passed by Congress enhances our optimism for the future of Cincinnati Financial. Not only does it create a more level playing field for domestic insurers, it also amplifies the advantages of our equity investment strategy. For full-year 2017, our annual equity portfolio total return was 21 percent, increasing our total equity portfolio fair value to $6.249 billion.\n\"At December 31, 2017, our book value climbed 17 percent to $50.29 bolstered by record pretax investment income of $609 million. The board of directors' recent decision to increase the cash dividend demonstrates their confidence in the future success of our strategies and sets the stage for a 58 th consecutive year of increasing regular annual dividends.\"\nInsurance Operations Highlights\nConsolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,199\n$\n1,139\n5\n$\n4,722\n$\n4,482\n5\nFee revenues\n3\n3\n0\n11\n10\n10\nTotal revenues\n1,202\n1,142\n5\n4,733\n4,492\n5\nLoss and loss expenses\n741\n751\n(1)\n3,138\n2,861\n10\nUnderwriting expenses\n373\n345\n8\n1,467\n1,389\n6\nUnderwriting profit\n$\n88\n$\n46\n91\n$\n128\n$\n242\n(47)\nRatios as a percent of earned premiums:\nPt.

The increase in premiums also reflects other growth initiatives, price increases and a higher level of insured exposures. 13 percent and 14 percent increase in fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 new business premiums written by agencies, compared with a year ago. The full-year increase of $75 million included a $58 million increase in standard market property casualty production from agencies appointed since the beginning of 2016. 1,702 agency relationships in 2,256 reporting locations marketing standard market property casualty insurance products at December 31, 2017, compared with 1,614 agency relationships in 2,090 reporting locations at year-end 2016. During 2017, new agency appointments included 107 agencies that market most or all of our property casualty insurance products and 104 that market only our personal lines products. 3.3 percentage-point fourth-quarter 2017 combined ratio decrease, including a decrease of 6.2 points for lower losses from natural catastrophes, partially offset by an increase of 2.3 points for current accident year loss and loss expense experience before catastrophe losses. 2.7 percentage-point increase in full-year 2017 combined ratio, compared with 2016, including a decrease of 0.3 points for losses from natural catastrophes. 1.9 and 2.5 percentage-point fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 benefit from favorable prior accident year reserve development of $23 million and $119 million, compared with 1.5 points or $17 million for fourth-quarter 2016 and 3.7 points or $168 million of favorable development for full-year 2016. 1.3 percentage-point increase, to 61.1 percent, for the full-year 2017 ratio of current accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes, including a 0.8 point increase in the ratio for current accident year losses of $1 million or more per claim. 0.1 percentage-point increase in the full-year 2017 underwriting expense ratio, as higher earned premiums and ongoing expense management efforts were slightly offset by strategic investments that include enhancement of underwriting expertise.\nCommercial Lines Insurance Results\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nEarned premiums\n$\n796\n$\n779\n2\n$\n3,165\n$\n3,089\n2\nFee revenues\n2\n2\n0\n5\n5\n0\nTotal revenues\n798\n781\n2\n3,170\n3,094\n2\nLoss and loss expenses\n487\n503\n(3)\n2,042\n1,928\n6\nUnderwriting expenses\n253\n242\n5\n1,009\n982\n3\nUnderwriting profit\n$\n58\n$\n36\n61\n$\n119\n$\n184\n(35)\nRatios as a percent of earned premiums:\nPt.

or that impair our ability to recover such assessments through future surcharges or other rate changes Increase our provision for federal income taxes due to changes in tax law Increase our other expenses Limit our ability to set fair, adequate and reasonable rates Place us at a disadvantage in the marketplace Restrict our ability to execute our business model, including the way we compensate agents Adverse outcomes from litigation or administrative proceedings Events or actions, including unauthorized intentional circumvention of controls, that reduce the company's future ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Unforeseen departure of certain executive officers or other key employees due to retirement, health or other causes that could interrupt progress toward important strategic goals or diminish the effectiveness of certain longstanding relationships with insurance agents and others Events, such as an epidemic, natural catastrophe or terrorism, that could hamper our ability to assemble our workforce at our headquarters location\nFurther, the company's insurance businesses are subject to the effects of changing social, global, economic and regulatory environments. Public and regulatory initiatives have included efforts to adversely influence and restrict premium rates, restrict the ability to cancel policies, impose underwriting standards and expand overall regulation. The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nAssets\nInvestments\nFixed maturities, at fair value (amortized cost: 2017—$10,314; 2016—$9,799)\n$\n10,699\n$\n10,085\nEquity securities, at fair value (cost: 2017—$3,094; 2016—$2,995)\n6,249\n5,334\nOther invested assets\n103\n81\nTotal investments\n17,051\n15,500\nCash and cash equivalents\n657\n777\nInvestment income receivable\n134\n134\nFinance receivable\n61\n51\nPremiums receivable\n1,589\n1,533\nReinsurance recoverable\n432\n545\nPrepaid reinsurance premiums\n42\n62\nDeferred policy acquisition costs\n670\n637\nLand, building and equipment, net, for company use (accumulated depreciation:\n2017—$253; 2016—$237)\n185\n183\nOther assets\n216\n198\nSeparate accounts\n806\n766\nTotal assets\n$\n21,843\n$\n20,386\nLiabilities\nInsurance reserves\nLoss and loss expense reserves\n$\n5,273\n$\n5,085\nLife policy and investment contract reserves\n2,729\n2,671\nUnearned premiums\n2,404\n2,307\nOther liabilities\n792\n786\nDeferred income tax\n745\n865\nNote payable\n24\n20\nLong-term debt and capital lease obligations\n827\n826\nSeparate accounts\n806\n766\nTotal liabilities\n13,600\n13,326\nShareholders' Equity\nCommon stock, par value—$2 per share; (authorized: 2017 and 2016—500 million shares;\nissued and outstanding: 2017 and 2016—198.3 million shares)\n397\n397\nPaid-in capital\n1,265\n1,252\nRetained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income\n7,968\n6,730\nTreasury stock at cost (2017—34.4 million shares and 2016—33.9 million shares)\n(1,387)\n(1,319)\nTotal shareholders' equity\n$\n8,243\n$\n7,060\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n21,843\n$\n20,386\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income (unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,258\n$\n1,192\n$\n4,954\n$\n4,710\nInvestment income, net of expenses\n156\n153\n609\n595\nRealized investment gains and losses, net\n(8)\n(37)\n148\n124\nFee revenues\n4\n4\n16\n15\nOther revenues\n1\n—\n5\n5\nTotal revenues\n1,411\n1,312\n5,732\n5,449\nBenefits and Expenses\nInsurance losses and contract holders' benefits\n809\n809\n3,390\n3,107\nUnderwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses\n389\n359\n1,546\n1,465\nInterest expense\n14\n14\n53\n53\nOther operating expenses\n2\n2\n13\n12\nTotal benefits and expenses\n1,214\n1,184\n5,002\n4,637\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n197\n128\n730\n812\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nCurrent\n31\n10\n129\n183\nDeferred\n(476)\n18\n(444)\n38\nTotal provision (benefit) for income taxes\n(445)\n28\n(315)\n221\nNet Income\n$\n642\n$\n100\n$\n1,045\n$\n591\nPer Common Share\nNet income—basic\n$\n3.92\n$\n0.61\n$\n6.36\n$\n3.59\nNet income—diluted\n3.88\n0.60\n6.29\n3.55\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures\n(See attached tables for reconciliations; additional prior-period reconciliations available at cinfin.com/investors .)\nCincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.\nNon-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding net realized investment gains and losses (defined as realized investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While realized investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses can be recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of realized investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.\nFor these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information. Value creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is a useful supplement to GAAP information, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segment plus our reinsurance assumed operations. Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus net realized investment gains, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products. Statutory accounting rules: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies. Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nBalance Sheet Reconciliation\n(Dollars are per share)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nValue creation ratio:\nEnd of period book value\n$\n50.29\n$\n42.95\n$\n50.29\n$\n42.95\nLess beginning of period book value\n45.86\n43.24\n42.95\n39.20\nChange in book value\n4.43\n(0.29)\n7.34\n3.75\nDividend declared to shareholders\n1.00\n0.48\n2.50\n1.92\nTotal value creation\n$\n5.43\n$\n0.19\n$\n9.84\n$\n5.67\nValue creation ratio from change in book value*\n9.7\n%\n(0.7)\n%\n17.1\n%\n9.6\n%\nValue creation ratio from dividends declared to\nshareholders**\n2.2\n1.1\n5.8\n4.9\nValue creation ratio\n11.9\n%\n0.4\n%\n22.9\n%\n14.5\n%\n* Change in book value divided by the beginning of period book value\n** Dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of period book value\nNet Income Reconciliation\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n642\n$\n100\n$\n1,045\n$\n591\nLess:\nRealized investment gains and losses, net\n(8)\n(37)\n148\n124\nIncome tax on realized investment gains and losses\n2\n12\n(53)\n(44)\nRealized investment gains and losses, after-tax\n(6)\n(25)\n95\n80\nEffects of U.S. tax reform legislation\n$\n495\n$\n—\n$\n495\n$\n—\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n153\n$\n125\n$\n455\n$\n511\nDiluted per share data:\nNet income\n$\n3.88\n$\n0.60\n$\n6.29\n$\n3.55\nLess:\nRealized investment gains and losses, net\n(0.05)\n(0.23)\n0.89\n0.74\nIncome tax on realized investment gains and losses\n0.01\n0.08\n(0.32)\n(0.26)\nRealized investment gains and losses, after-tax\n(0.04)\n(0.15)\n0.57\n0.48\nEffects of U.S. tax reform legislation\n$\n2.99\n$\n—\n$\n2.98\n$\n—\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n0.93\n$\n0.75\n$\n2.74\n$\n3.07\nLife Insurance Reconciliation\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended December 31,\nTwelve months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income of life insurance subsidiary\n$\n122\n$\n16\n$\n155\n$\n48\nRealized investment gains, net\n2\n4\n6\n8\nIncome tax on realized investment gains\n—\n2\n2\n3\nEffects of U.S. tax reform legislation\n111\n—\n111\n—\nNon-GAAP operating income\n9\n14\n40\n43\nInvestment income, net of expenses\n(38)\n(38)\n(155)\n(155)\nInvestment income credited to contract holders'\n23\n23\n93\n90\nIncome tax excluding tax on realized investment gains and\neffects of U.S. tax reform legislation\n5\n6\n21\n23\nLife insurance segment profit (loss)\n$\n(1)\n$\n5\n$\n(1)\n$\n1\nCincinnati Financial Corporation\nProperty Casualty Operations Reconciliation\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated\nCommercial\nPersonal\nE&S\nCincinnati Re\nPremiums:\nWritten premiums\n$\n1,130\n$\n746\n$\n309\n$\n54\n$\n21\nUnearned premiums change\n69\n50\n11\n2\n6\nEarned premiums\n$\n1,199\n$\n796\n$\n320\n$\n56\n$\n27\nStatutory ratios:\nCombined ratio\n94.3\n%\n94.7\n%\n96.3\n%\n79.9\n%\n89.1\n%\nContribution from catastrophe losses\n0.9\n0.3\n1.9\n0.2\n6.1\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n93.4\n%\n94.4\n%\n94.4\n%\n79.7\n%\n83.0\n%\nCommission expense ratio\n19.2\n%\n19.0\n%\n18.3\n%\n25.3\n%\n24.4\n%\nOther underwriting expense ratio\n13.3\n14.6\n11.7\n3.9\n12.7\nTotal expense ratio\n32.5\n%\n33.6\n%\n30.0\n%\n29.2\n%\n37.1\n%\nGAAP ratios:\nCombined ratio\n92.9\n%\n92.9\n%\n95.5\n%\n79.8\n%\n87.0\n%\nContribution from catastrophe losses\n0.9\n0.3\n1.9\n0.2\n6.1\nPrior accident years before catastrophe losses\n(1.3)\n(1.2)\n(0.5)\n(7.1)\n1.4\nCurrent accident year combined ratio before\ncatastrophe losses\n93.3\n%\n93.8\n%\n94.1\n%\n86.7\n%\n79.5\n%\n(Dollars in millions)\nTwelve months ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated\nCommercial\nPersonal\nE&S\nCincinnati Re\nPremiums:\nWritten premiums\n$\n4,840\n$\n3,202\n$\n1,294\n$\n219\n$\n125\nUnearned premiums change\n(118)\n(37)\n(53)\n(10)\n(18)\nEarned premiums\n$\n4,722\n$\n3,165\n$\n1,241\n$\n209\n$\n107\nStatutory ratios:\nCombined ratio\n97.2\n%\n96.2\n%\n102.4\n%\n71.9\n%\n117.7\n%\nContribution from catastrophe losses\n7.2\n5.0\n10.9\n1.0\n40.7\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n90.0\n%\n91.2\n%\n91.5\n%\n70.9\n%\n77.0\n%\nCommission expense ratio\n18.5\n%\n18.1\n%\n17.7\n%\n26.6\n%\n24.5\n%\nOther underwriting expense ratio\n12.3\n13.6\n10.7\n3.9\n8.0\nTotal expense ratio\n30.8\n%\n31.7\n%\n28.4\n%\n30.5\n%\n32.5\n%\nGAAP ratios:\nCombined ratio\n97.5\n%\n96.4\n%\n103.0\n%\n71.1\n%\n118.5\n%\nContribution from catastrophe losses\n7.2\n5.0\n10.9\n1.0\n40.7\nPrior accident years before catastrophe losses\n(1.9)\n(1.6)\n(0.9)\n(13.6)\n(2.0)\nCurrent accident year combined ratio before\ncatastrophe losses\n92.2\n%\n93.0\n%\n93.0\n%\n83.7\n%\n79.8\n%\nDollar amounts shown are rounded to millions; certain amounts may not add due to rounding.
