    "text": "EWING, N.J., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATRS) today announced the successful regulatory outcome of the Makena ® subcutaneous auto injector collaboration with AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG) (NASDAQ:AMAG). AMAG announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for their supplemental New Drug Application for Makena ® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) subcutaneous auto injector drug-device combination product, which was designed as a ready-to-administer treatment to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past. This drug-device combination product utilizes the Antares Pharma QuickShot ® device which was specifically developed to deliver a rapid injection of highly viscous drug products such as progesterone in oil, through a fine gauge nonvisible needle.\n“Today’s announcement represents the first FDA approval of a drug-device combination product utilizing our QuickShot auto injector. This first pass approval was made possible through an excellent working collaboration with our device team and the development group at AMAG,” said Robert F. Apple, President and Chief Executive Officer of Antares Pharma. “The Makena QuickShot device was designed to enhance performance on the attributes we believe are most critical to healthcare providers and patient acceptance, including decreased time to administer and use of a shorter, thinner nonvisible needle for subcutaneous injection, while potentially providing an alternative to the existing intramuscular methods of administration. We look forward to our continuing partnership with AMAG as it transitions from development to a commercial supply relationship.”\nIn September 2014, Antares Pharma entered into a license, development and supply agreement to develop a variation of our VIBEX ® QuickShot ® subcutaneous auto injector for use with Makena ® . Under this arrangement, AMAG will manufacture and supply the drug product to Antares. Antares will manufacture the device and be responsible for the assembly and packaging of the final product which will be sold to AMAG at cost plus margin. AMAG is also responsible for commercialization and distribution of the final product. Antares will receive high single digit to low double digit royalties on net sales as well as sales milestones.\nAbout Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection)\nMakena is a progestin indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. The effectiveness of Makena is based on improvement in the proportion of women who delivered <37 weeks of gestation. There are no controlled trials demonstrating a direct clinical benefit, such as improvement in neonatal mortality and morbidity.\nLimitation of use: While there are many risk factors for preterm birth, safety and efficacy of Makena has been demonstrated only in women with a prior spontaneous singleton preterm birth. It is not intended for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth.\nMakena should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: blood clots or other blood clotting problems, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, or history of these conditions; unusual vaginal bleeding not related to the current pregnancy, yellowing of the skin due to liver problems during pregnancy, liver problems, including liver tumors, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. Before patients receive Makena, they should tell their healthcare provider if they have an allergy to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, castor oil, or any of the other ingredients in Makena; diabetes or prediabetes, epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, heart problems, kidney problems, depression, or high blood pressure.\nIn one clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena. These included miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), stillbirth (fetal death occurring during or after the 20th week of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia (high blood pressure and too much protein in the urine), gestational hypertension (high blood pressure caused by pregnancy), gestational diabetes, and oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels).\nMakena may cause serious side effects including blood clots, allergic reactions, depression, and yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. The most common side effects of Makena include injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching, bruising, or a hard bump), hives, itching, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common side effects reported with the Makena auto-injector use (and higher than with the Makena intramuscular injection) was injection site pain.\nFor additional product information, including full prescribing information, please visit www.makena.com .\nAbout QuickShot ® Auto Injector\nThe proprietary QuickShot ® auto injector is designed to allow rapid subcutaneous self-administration of highly viscous drugs in oil such as testosterone or progesterone and biologics using high spring pressure through a fine gauge needle. Conventional auto injectors, or even a vial, needle and syringe are not able to inject highly viscous drugs efficiently or as fast and easy as the QuickShot ® device. The QuickShot ® auto injector can also provide the patient with the ease and speed of self-administration, comfort and discretion.\nAbout Antares Pharma\nAntares Pharma focuses on self-administered parenteral pharmaceutical products. The Company’s product, OTREXUP ® (methotrexate) injection for subcutaneous use, is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with severe active rheumatoid arthritis, children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adults with severe recalcitrant psoriasis.
