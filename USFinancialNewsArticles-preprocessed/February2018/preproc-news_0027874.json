Our achievements were realized through the continued dedication and efforts of our entire workforce and partners,\" noted Philip Pascall, Chairman and CEO.\n\"We made significant progress on our copper growth objective. Sentinel's ramp-up over the year accounted for a good part of that progress as did the continued strong performances at the Kansanshi complex and Las Cruces. While our smaller operations are managing the challenges of being in the latter part of their lives, they do make good contributions both in production and providing unique training and experience for our valuable workforce. 2017 marked the sixth consecutive year that we have increased our copper production. This is an achievement we are proud of especially in light of the tough conditions faced by our industry over the past few years.\n\"2018 is an important year for us with the start of the critical phased commissioning of our largest project to date â€“ Cobre Panama. We believe the project will enter operations at a time when the fundamentals for copper will be at their strongest. This has informed our decision to bring forward an expansion and increase our ownership interest.\n\"Through this period of significant growth for our Company, we are also committed to deleveraging the balance sheet and providing some return to our shareholders who have been supportive of our vision and strategy,\" Mr. Pascall concluded.\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nThree months ended\nDecember 31\nYear ended\nDecember 31\n(U.S. dollars where applicable)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCOPPER\n-\nProduction (tonnes)\n154,319\n146,101\n573,963\n539,458\n-\nSales (tonnes)\n151,905\n136,265\n580,130\n535,613\n-\nCost of production:\no\nAISC (per lb)\n$1.76\n$1.71\n$1.65\n$1.46\no\nC1 (per lb)\n$1.30\n$1.22\n$1.23\n$1.06\no\nC3 (per lb)\n$2.16\n$1.91\n$2.05\n$1.83\n-\nRealized price (per lb)\n$2.50\n$2.18\n$2.33\n$2.26\nNICKEL\n-\nProduction (contained tonnes)\n-\n6,206\n17,837\n23,624\n-\nSales (contained tonnes)\n865\n6,073\n18,683\n25,882\n-\nCost of production:\no\nAISC (per lb)\n($0.51)\n$5.03\n$5.29\n$5.29\no\nC1 (per lb)\n($0.61)\n$4.46\n$4.45\n$4.66\no\nC3 (per lb)\n($0.51)\n$6.16\n$6.17\n$6.34\n-\nRealized price (per payable lb)\n$5.37\n$4.50\n$4.67\n$4.25\nGOLD\n-\nProduction (ounces)\n51,904\n54,234\n199,736\n214,012\n-\nSales (ounces)\n50,723\n45,620\n201,376\n232,783\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree months ended\nDecember 31\nYear ended\nDecember 31\n(U.S. dollars millions, except where noted otherwise)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nSales revenues\n885\n689\n3,310\n2,673\nGross profit\n117\n52\n335\n339\nNet earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to\nshareholders of the Company\n(115)\n12\n(316)\n222\nNet loss from discontinued operations\n-\n-\n-\n(267)\nNet earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations\nattributable to shareholders of the Company\n($0.17)\n$0.02\n($0.46)\n$0.32\nNet earnings (loss) per share 5\n($0.17)\n$0.02\n($0.46)\n($0.07)\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share 5\n($0.17)\n$0.02\n($0.46)\n($0.07)\nComparative EBITDA\n318\n218\n1,154\n964\nComparative earnings (loss)\n(36)\n27\n(111)\n165\nComparative earnings (loss) per share\n($0.05)\n$0.04\n($0.16)\n$0.24\nCash flows from continuing operating activities\n203\n93\n914\n914\n5\n2016 figures include discontinued operations.\nTHREE-YEAR GUIDANCE\nCapital Expenditures 6\n(U.S. dollars millions)\n2018\n2019\n2020\nTotal Cobre Panama 7\n1,180\n382\n-\nThird-party contribution 8\n(354)\n(89)\n-\nFirst Quantum's share 9\n826\n293\n-\nCapitalized stripping\n200\n200\n200\nSustaining capital and other projects\n360\n400\n400\nTotal net capital expenditures\n1,386\n893\n600\n6\nExcludes capitalization of any net pre-commercial production costs, revenue and interest.\n7\nReflects the revised total capital expenditure estimate of $6.3 billion.\n8\nThird-party contributions are from the pro-rata funding under a $1 billion precious metals stream agreement and KORES' 10% indirect interest in the project.\n9\nBased on the current 90% ownership.\nProduction\n(000's)\n2018\n2019\n2020\nCopper â€“ excluding Cobre Panama (tonnes)\n590\n595\n610\nNickel (contained tonnes)\n-\n-\n-\nGold â€“ excluding Cobre Panama (ounces)\n200\n200\n195\nZinc (tonnes)\n20\n17\n5\nCobre Panama 10 â€“ copper (tonnes)\n-\n150+\n270 - 300\n10\nAssumes the following:\na)\nStart of commissioning in fourth quarter 2018.\nb)\nContinued ramp-up in 2019 with copper production estimated at a minimum of 150,000 tonnes.\nc)\nFurther ramp-up in 2020 with copper production between 270,000 and 300,000 tonnes.\nCopper AISC and C1 Cost 11\n(Per pound)\n2018\n2019\n2020\nAISC\n$1.65 - $1.85\n$1.65 - $1.80\n$1.65 - $1.80\nC1\n$1.20 - $1.40\n$1.20 - $1.40\n$1.20 - $1.40\n11\nDoes not include estimates for Cobre Panama which are projected at $1.20 per pound C1 and $1.50 per pound AISC, net of a by-product credit of $0.25 per pound at steady-state.\nCONFERENCE CALL & WEB C AST\nConference call and webcast details are as follows:\nDate:\nFebruary 12, 2018\nTime:\n9:00 am (EST); 2:00 pm (GMT); 6:00 am (PST)\nWebcast:\nwww.first-quantum.com\nDial in:\nNorth America: (toll free) (877) 291-4570\nNorth America and international: 1 (647) 788-4919\nUnited Kingdom: (toll free) 0-800-051-7107\nReplay:\nAvailable from noon (EST) on February 12, until 11:59 pm (EST) on February 19, 2018\nNorth America: (toll free) (800) 585-8367\nNorth America and international: 1 (416) 621-4642\nPasscode:\n4089109\nCOMPLETE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe complete audited consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017 are available at www.first-quantum.com and should be read in conjunction with this news release.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors of First Quantum Minerals Ltd.\nG.

The forward-looking statements include estimates, forecasts and statements as to the Company's expectations of production and sales volumes, and expected timing of completion of project development at Cobre Panama and Enterprise and are subject to the impact of ore grades on future production, the potential of production disruptions, capital expenditure and mine production costs, the outcome of mine permitting, other required permitting, the outcome of legal proceedings which involve the Company, information with respect to the future price of copper, gold, nickel, zinc, pyrite, cobalt and sulphuric acid, estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources, First Quantum's exploration and development program, estimated future expenses, exploration and development capital requirements, the Company's hedging policy, and goals and strategies. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements or information can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\" or \"believes\" or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved.\nWith respect to forward-looking statements and information contained herein, the Company has made numerous assumptions including among other things, assumptions about continuing production at all operating facilities, the price of copper, gold, nickel, zinc, pyrite, cobalt and sulphuric acid, anticipated costs and expenditures and the ability to achieve the Company's goals. Forward-looking statements and information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information.
