    "text": "Allerik Freeman scored 24 points and Omer Yurtseven provided 21 points as North Carolina State held on down the stretch to defeat Wake Forest 90-84 on Saturday at Joel Coliseum in Winston-Salem, N.C.\nN.C. State posted its second road victory in a four-day span following a two-game losing skid.\nTorin Dorn’s 14 points and Markell Johnson’s 10 points and 10 assists also helped the Wolfpack (18-9, 8-6 Atlantic Coast Conference) sweep the regular-season series.\nN.C. State bolstered its ACC road record to 4-4 after beginning the conference slate with a couple of blowout losses away from home.\nThe Wolfpack shot 11 of 24 on 3-point attempts compared to Wake Forest’s 5 for 19. Freeman and Yurtseven both made three 3-point shots.\nBryant Crawford led Wake Forest with 29 points, though he shot only 2-for-9 from the field in the second half. Center Doral Moore’s 23 points and 12 rebounds gave the Demon Deacons a big presence in the post. Keyshawn Woods added 13 points.\nWake Forest (10-17, 3-12) was unable to post back-to-back victories in league play for the first time this season coming off Wednesday night’s home triumph against Georgia Tech.\nThe Wolfpack used a 3-point barrage early in the second half to extend its lead to 51-40.\nN.C. State kept a comfortable margin for most of the second half, but Woods’ 3-point basket drew Wake Forest within 76-71 with 1:30 to play.\nThe Wolfpack led 40-34 at halftime, boosted by three 3-pointers from its reserves.\nN.C. State used a 12-3 run to move ahead after an early six-point deficit.\nThe Wolfpack went up 29-21 by scoring on 12 of 15 possessions. At that juncture, Crawford had 12 of Wake Forest’s points on his way to 19 first-half points on 8-for-11 shooting from the field.\nWake Forest attempted only two first-half free throws (though finished with 15-for-22). It was charged with 10 turnovers in the opening half.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
