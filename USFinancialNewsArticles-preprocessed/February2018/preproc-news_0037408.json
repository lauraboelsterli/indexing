LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,541.00, trading up 0.75 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely open steady to higher against the dollar, tracking gains in most Asian peers after greenback fell overnight despite upbeat U.S. inflation data, which prompted expectations the Fed may hike rates at a faster pace going ahead. • Indian sovereign bonds are likely to edge lower in early session tracking a jump in U.S. Treasury yields. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.48 percent-7.55 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street surged on Wednesday as investors shrugged off stronger-than-expected inflation data and snapped up shares of Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple. • Asian stocks gained after Wall Street brushed aside strong U.S. inflation data and surged, a counterintuitive move that also saw the dollar pinned at two-week lows even as Treasury yields jumped in anticipation of a quicker pace of U.S. interest rate hikes. • The dollar extended its losses against the yen and hit a fresh 15-month low, with market participants bracing for further near-term weakness in the U.S. currency. • U.S. Treasury yields on most maturities rose on Wednesday, with those on benchmark 10-year notes hitting a four-year high, boosted by data showing consumer prices in the world's largest economy gained more than expected last month, with underlying inflation posting its largest monthly increase in a year. • Oil prices extended gains from the previous session, pushed up by a weak dollar and by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would rather see an undersupplied market than end a deal with OPEC and Russia to withhold production. • Gold prices held steady, near the 2-1/2-week high hit in the previous session, supported by a weaker dollar and as investors bet on higher U.S. inflation after a faster-than-expected rise in consumer prices last month.
