(“OneLife” or the “Company”) (OTC PINK: OLMM), a mobile medical data and technologies company, today provided this report highlighting the Company’s recent agreement to acquire 100% of Yinuo Technologies Ltd., a Chinese-based developer of mobile communications technologies.\nOn December 22, 2017, OneLife entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Fang Sun, pursuant to which the Company contracted to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Yinuo Technologies Ltd. (“Yinuo”) in exchange for $500,000 and 40,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Also, pursuant to the agreement, the current management of Yinuo, including founder and CEO, Fang Sun, will join OneLife as senior employees.\nFocused primarily in the Chinese marketplace, Yinuo develops, manufactures and markets a series of mobile and handheld medical grade devices for medical and healthcare services.

Yinuo’s technologies have been used in over 100 hospitals across China.\nIn addition to Yinuo’s considerable experience in development and deployment of wearable medical tracking technologies to hospitals in China, Yinuo’s business assets and intellectual property consist of several patents, patents pending, copyrights, and trademarks.

Wagner, CEO of OneLife, commented, “The complete acquisition of Yinuo Technologies by OneLife will elevate our current development partnership to the next level and position the combined companies and management teams to take full advantage of Yinuo’s proven and award winning wearable medical tracking device technologies and OneLife’s sales experience and strategic access to the U.S. healthcare system and U.S. capital markets.”\n“Based on Yinuo’s previous expansion rates and revenue generation with installations across China, we are very excited for the opportunity to aggressively build upon their past success with a stronger combined team to launch this proven technology and business model across the U.S.A.”\nClosing of the acquisition of Yinuo Technologies Ltd. by OneLife is subject to customary terms and conditions, including receipt of (i) a formal Calculation Valuation and Appraisal Report and (ii) two years of audited financial statements audited by a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board registered and approved audit firm.
