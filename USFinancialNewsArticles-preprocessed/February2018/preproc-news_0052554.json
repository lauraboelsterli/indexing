    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Francesco Friedrich’s four-man German bobsleigh team extended their lead after the third run and were perfectly poised for a gold medal at the Olympic Sliding Centre on Sunday.\nThe German unit, piloted by multiple world champion Friedrich, who already has a gold from Monday’s two-man bobsleigh, has a 0.42 seconds lead over Won Yun-jong’s South Korean team.\nThe Nico Walther piloted second German team was in bronze medal position 0.49 seconds behind their compatriots while Justin Kripp’s Canadian foursome was in fourth place.\nGermany, the traditional powerhouse of the sport, failed to make the podium in the four-man event in Sochi four years ago. They won gold in Turin in 2006.\nThe German pair of Friedrich and Thorsten Margis shared gold with Canada in the two-man event on Monday after a dramatic dead-heat.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
