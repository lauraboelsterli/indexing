    "text": "PITTSBURGH, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nBlack Box Corporation (NASDAQ:BBOX), a leading digital solutions provider dedicated to helping customers design, build, manage and secure their IT infrastructure, today reported results for the third quarter of Fiscal 2018 and nine-month period ended December 30, 2017.\nThird Quarter Results\nRevenues declined by $15.5 million or 7.4% to $194.9 million compared to the same period last year.\nGross profit margin was 27.0%, down 270 basis points from 29.7% for the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in our higher margin legacy unified communication business and lower margin incremental deals in both our Products and Services segments during this quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $59.0 million, up 2.8% from $57.4 million for the same period last year and down 2.3% from $60.3 million in the prior quarter. The increase from the same period last year was primarily due to higher spending on the U.S.-based ERP project, partially offset by lower variable compensation costs while the decrease from the prior quarter was primarily due to these lower variable compensation costs incurred this quarter.\nLoss before income taxes was $9.8 million, compared to income before income taxes of $1.6 million for the same period last year and consistent with a loss before income taxes of $9.0 million in the prior quarter.\nProvision for income taxes was $18.1 million, compared to provision for income taxes of $0.3 million for the same period last year and compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.4 million in the prior quarter. The increase in the provision was primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in tax expense of $13.5 million, and valuation allowances booked against U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forwards.\nNet loss was $27.9 million, compared to net income of $1.3 million for the same period last year and compared to a net loss of $11.4 million in the prior quarter.\nDiluted loss per share was $1.85, compared to diluted income per share of $0.09 for the same period last year and compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.75 in the prior quarter.\nCash flow used for operating activities was $27.5 million, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $9.1 million for the same period last year and compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $0.6 million in the prior quarter. The variance compared to the prior quarter was principally due to cash used by increases in working capital.\nYear to Date Results\nRevenues were $580.7 million, down 10.3% from $647.6 million for the same period last year.\nLoss before income taxes was $33.0 million, compared to $4.1 million for the same period last year.\nProvision for income taxes was $16.1 million, compared to $1.1 million for the same period last year.\nNet loss was $49.1 million, compared to $5.3 million for the same period last year.\nDiluted loss per share was $3.26, compared to $0.35 for the same period last year.\nCash flow used for operating activities was $43.1 million, compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of $24.7 million for the same period last year.\nCEO Comment\n“I want to reaffirm that we are committed to our Intelligent Digital Edge strategy which will be the cornerstone for future growth,” stated Joel Trammell, President and CEO. “I acknowledge the near-term challenges that we need to overcome as noted in the Liquidity section of our Form 10-Q, and we are working on them.

23.5 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 18.4 $ 30.5 $ 13.8 $ 18.4 $ 13.8\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs a supplement to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures such as operating income before provision for income taxes (\"EBIT\"), operating net income or operating net loss, operating earnings per share (\"EPS\"), revenues excluding foreign currency, adjusted operating income, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Operating EBITDA and free cash flow to illustrate the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all of the Company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly-titled measures of the Company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. However, each of the amounts included in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures are computed in accordance with GAAP. See below for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate the Company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and associated operating budgets, (c) to allocate resources and (d) to measure operational profitability. Management uses similar non-GAAP measures as an important factor in determining variable compensation for Management and its team members.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nOperating EBIT, operating net income and operating EPS\nManagement believes that operating EBIT, defined by the Company as net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes and adjustments, operating net income, defined by the Company as operating EBIT less operational income taxes, and operating EPS, defined as operating net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding (diluted), provide investors additional important information to enable them to assess, in the way Management assesses, the Company's current and future operations. Adjustments include intangibles amortization, which is a non-cash charge, and restructuring expense and gains/losses on sales of facilities, each of which are cash charges.\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) to operating EBIT and Operating net income (loss) is presented below:\nIn millions and may not foot due to rounding 3Q18 2Q18 3Q17 3QYTD18 3QYTD17 Net income (loss) $ (27.9 ) $ (11.4 ) $ 1.3 $ (49.1 ) $ (5.3 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 18.1 2.4 0.3 16.1 1.1 Effective tax rate (185.3 )% (27.1 )% 19.7 % (48.7 )% (27.4 )% Income (loss) before provision for income taxes $ (9.8 ) $ (9.0 ) $ 1.6 $ (33.0 ) $ (4.1 ) Adjustments Intangibles amortization $ 1.6 $ 2.1 $ 2.3 $ 5.9 $ 7.1 Restructuring expense 1.0 0.1 1.1 5.5 4.1 Accounts receivable impairment loss — — 0.3 — 0.3 Inventory impairment loss — — — — 9.1 Loss (gain) on sale of facility — — 0.3 — (0.9 ) Asset impairment loss — 1.4 — 1.4 0.5 Total pre-tax adjustments $ 2.6 $ 3.7 $ 4.0 $ 12.8 $ 20.2 Operating EBIT $ (7.2 ) $ (5.3 ) $ 5.7 $ (20.2 ) $ 16.1 Operational effective tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Operational income taxes (1) (2.5 ) (1.9 ) 2.0 (7.1 ) 5.6 Operating net income (loss) $ (4.7 ) $ (3.4 ) $ 3.7 $ (13.1 ) $ 10.4 (1) The effective tax rate used to determine operational income taxes is based on the Company's projected full-year ordinary income tax expense and the projected full-year impact of certain discreet tax items.\nA reconciliation of Diluted earnings (loss) per share to operating EPS is presented below:\n3Q18 2Q18 3Q17 3QYTD18 3QYTD17 Diluted EPS $ (1.85 ) $ (0.75 ) $ 0.09 $ (3.26 ) $ (0.35 ) EPS impact * 1.54 0.53 0.15 2.39 1.04 Operating EPS $ (0.31 ) $ (0.23 ) $ 0.24 $ (0.87 ) $ 0.69 * EPS impact is the result of excluding the provision for income taxes and the adjustments and utilizing an operational effective tax rate.\nEBITDA and Operating EBITDA\nManagement believes that EBITDA, defined as Net income (loss) plus provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization, is a widely-accepted measure of profitability that may be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt. Operating EBITDA, defined as EBITDA plus stock compensation expense, accounts receivable impairment loss, inventory impairment loss, and asset impairment loss (consisting of fixed assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill) may also be used to measure the Company's ability to service its debt.\nPursuant to the First Amendment to its Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), the Company was required to maintain a minimum trailing twelve month (\"TTM\") Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during each quarter through the first quarter of Fiscal 2019. The Adjusted EBITDA definition in the Credit Agreement incorporates Operating EBITDA and adds back ERP implementation costs, restructuring expenses and certain other charges.\nA reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA, Operating EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA is presented below:\nIn millions and may not foot due to rounding 3Q18 2Q18 3QYTD18 3Q18 TTM 3Q17 TTM Net income (loss) $ (27.9 ) $ (11.4 ) $ (49.1 ) $ (50.9 ) $ (53.0 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 18.1 2.4 16.1 16.7 (1.5 ) Interest expense, net 1.7 1.8 4.8 5.8 4.4 Intangibles amortization 1.6 2.1 5.9 8.2 9.5 Depreciation 2.5 2.4 7.2 9.6 9.4 EBITDA $ (4.0 ) $ (2.6 ) $ (15.1 ) $ (10.6 ) $ (31.2 ) Stock compensation expense 0.1 1.0 3.4 4.1 4.7 Accounts receivable impairment loss — — — — 2.7 Inventory impairment loss — — — — 15.1 Asset impairment loss — 1.4 1.4 1.4 35.5 Operating EBITDA $ (3.8 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (10.3 ) $ (5.0 ) $ 26.7 ERP implementation costs 4.4 3.4 10.8 12.4 — Restructuring expense 1.0 0.1 5.5 6.1 10.5 Other charges 1.0 0.7 2.1 3.0 (0.1 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 2.6 $ 4.1 $ 8.1 $ 16.4 $ 37.1\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company was required to maintain a minimum trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA of $14.0 million at the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2018.
