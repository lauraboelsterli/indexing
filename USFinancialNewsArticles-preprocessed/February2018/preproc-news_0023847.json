    "text": "Dallas, Texas, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The groundbreaking for the McKinney-based Independent Bank Group’s new 165,000-square-foot corporate headquarters was held on January 17, 2018. SmithGroupJJR is providing integrated design services including architecture, interior design and mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering. Located at the McKinney Corporate Center Craig Ranch and slated for completion in December 2018, the Class A office building will be a standout on the McKinney, Texas skyline along the Sam Rayburn Toll Road (SRTR).\nIndependent Bank's new corporate headquarters, McKinney, Texas. Exterior rendering by SmithGroupJJR.\nThe core team for this 10.4-acre site and building consists of the Independent Bank Executive Team, developer KDC, commercial real estate firm Avison Young, design firm SmithGroupJJR and general contractor Rogers-O’Brien. During the groundbreaking, several individuals spoke passionately about the project and what it will mean to the McKinney community, bank employees and the legacy of Independent Bank.\nAccording to SmithGroupJJR’s lead designer, Tom Philippi , “the design for the new headquarters strives to make a deep connection with the community, its stakeholders, employees and surrounding region by architecturally representing the evolution of the company Independent Bank has become.”\nA strong but unassuming material palette has been selected for the building skin. Glass and metal finishes will be the dominant curtain wall components. In an effort to warm up the overall palette, wood soffits are used at the balconies, the sixth floor terrace and entry overhang.\nThe vision of the building’s interior design will be harmonious with the exterior design. Bringing exterior materiality into the lobby such as natural stone, metals and glass will evoke a sense of stability, solidity and permanence.\n“We chose SmithGroupJJR as our design partner because they were able to, quite gracefully, articulate our vision. The design of our new headquarters building embodies the culture of Independent Bank, our purpose-driven approach, and continued commitment to community.” said David R. Brooks, CEO, Independent Bank. Once complete, approximately 400 employees are expected to occupy the new headquarters.\nThe new office building is targeting LEED Silver certification. Sustainable design features include cost efficient, energy efficient, environmentally friendly and easy to maintain systems throughout. All systems will have energy metering to assist in optimized energy use strategies to conserve energy, reduce water consumption and provide indoor air quality consistent with engineering standards.\nSmithGroupJJR ( www.smithgroupjjr.com ) is one of the world’s preeminent integrated design firms. Working across a network of 12 offices in the U.S. and China, a team of 1,300 experts is committed to excellence in strategy, design and delivery.
