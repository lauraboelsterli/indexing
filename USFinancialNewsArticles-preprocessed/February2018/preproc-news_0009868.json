When you need to recruit engineers, extremely good engineers, you find a highly talented human base here in your region,\" he said. \nSpeaking to Thales' outlook in the U.S. and European market, Caine said the new focus on military and defense signals opportunities for the company. \n\"We will benefit from this new momentum in defense investments in the U.S.\" Caine said. \n\"European countries have also reconsidered how they need to invest more ... in the future of their own defense, which is clearly a good sign for Thales as we are really present in Europe ... as far as defense is concerned,\" the CEO said.
