    "text": "2336 COMMENTS High-school students who survived Florida’s deadly school shooting last week descended on the state capital Wednesday to plead for stricter gun-control measures, raising pressure on lawmakers in the normally firearm-friendly state to pass legislation.\nAt a boisterous rally with hundreds of demonstrators outside the State Capitol, students took the microphone to decry elected officials’ inaction in the face of bloodshed.\n“Ninety-percent of my fellow Americans support background checks, yet you lawmakers have failed to act,” said Florence Yared, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people last Wednesday. “Some of you said it was too soon to talk about gun control. No, it is not too soon.”\nThe eruption of student activism , including other rallies and walkouts across the state, has brought a new energy to the gun-rights debate in Florida and nationally, prodding GOP politicians who usually are staunch defenders of Second Amendment rights to consider legislative changes .\nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in blue shirts, and their chaperones stand in the gallery above the Florida Senate on Wednesday as the chamber holds a moment of silence to honor the victims of last week's mass shooting on the school.

But the path to tighter gun rules has already faced obstacles. The Florida House voted Tuesday against debating a measure to ban outright semiautomatic weapons—something student activists are pushing.\nSince 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims. Among the GOP lawmakers who voted against debating the House bill was Rep. Chris Latvala. He said in an interview that he opposes barring guns for law-abiding citizens but supports other measures to curb gun access, such as banning bump stocks, devices that enable semiautomatic firearms to mimic fully automatic weapons. Mr. Latvala holds a “D” rating from the National Rifle Association, the lowest in his caucus—“and that’s something I’m proud of,” he said.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, President Donald Trump and members of his administration have demonstrated an openness to new gun restrictions. Mr. Trump, in a directive Tuesday, asked the Justice Department to draft a federal regulation effectively banning bump stocks . While that accessory wasn’t used in last week’s Florida shooting, it was used in the Las Vegas gun massacre in October that stands as the deadliest in U.S. history.\nMr. Trump held a meeting Wednesday with parents of victims and survivors of the Parkland shooting to host a discussion about how to prevent another school shooting.\nAndrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed at the school, said the country needs to improve school safety . “How many schools, how many children need to get shot? I am not going to sleep until it is fixed,” he said.\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Alfonso Calderon speaks at a press conference in Tallahassee on Wednesday. Photo: colin abbey/epa-efe/rex/shutters/EPA/Shutterstock Ideas discussed ranged from arming teachers, to better funding mental health service, to tightening gun laws, to requiring regular lockdown drills.\n“Let’s never let this happen again,” said Samuel Zeif, a Parkland student who was in the building where the gunman opened fire. “Please, please, please.”\nStates also are looking at the issue anew . In North Carolina, a new legislative committee is studying whether to arm teachers in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. At least 10 other states, including Florida, are weighing similar measures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nRelated Video In an emotional meeting at the White House on Wednesday, students, parents, and administrators affected by school shootings offered pleas for change to President Trump.

Rick Scott, who received an A+ rating from the NRA and is a potential 2018 candidate for U.S. Senate, said on Tuesday that “everything for me is on the table” in weighing policy responses to the school shooting. His office has said he plans to unveil a package of proposals later this week.\nSome candidates vying to replace Mr. Scott, who is barred from running for a third term, have expressed support for more gun control.\nFormer Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, launched a television ad calling for a ban on AR-15-style rifles like the one used by the Florida gunman. On the GOP side, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam asked state lawmakers to delay a vote on a measure that would allow his agency to issue concealed-weapon licenses without a full background check.\nThree Decades of School Shootings Related Florida, A Big Death-Penalty State, Weighs What to Do About School Shooting Trump Takes Step to Ban ‘Bump Stocks’ FBI Probes Tip-Line Operations After Missed Florida-Shooting Warning Gun Rights Expand Amid Shootings A political committee founded by Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in 2011 , is running a TV ad attacking Mr. Scott for signing into law a measure that year that prevents doctors from discussing gun possession with patients.\nWith little more than two weeks left in the Florida legislative session, lawmakers are responding to pressure to pass new gun restrictions. Republican Sen. Bill Galvano is putting together a package that could include increasing the minimum age to purchase AR-15-style rifles to 21 from 18, and adding a three-day waiting period to buy them.\nIn a televised town hall on CNN Wednesday night, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), who has publicly wavered over the past week on the question of backing tighter gun restrictions, said he was reconsidering his position on the size of gun magazines and came out in favor of the proposal to raise the minimum purchasing age. “If you are 18 years of age, you should not be able to buy a rifle,” he said.\nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas spent hours Wednesday meeting with lawmakers and state officials in Tallahassee, the state capital. Many emerged angry and disheartened, but fired up.\n“I’ve maybe only spoken to three representatives, two of which already agreed with me,” said Ryan Deitsch, an 18-year-old student, at a press conference organized by Democratic Sen. Lauren Book.\n“I want to see those people who shot down that bill,” Mr. Deitsch said, referring to the semiautomatic-rifle ban. “I just want to see your face and know why.”\nAlfonso Calderon, a 16-year-old student, said elected officials should heed their call, or face a potential backlash. “What we need is action, and we need it now,” he said. “People are losing their lives, and it is still not being taken seriously.”\nWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com and Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com",
