    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Kremlin spokesman said on Wednesday he could not rule out that there were Russian civilians in Syria, but that they had no connection to the Russian armed forces.\nAssociates of Russian military contractors fighting alongside government forces in Syria have said there were large-scale casualties among the contractors when U.S.-led coalition forces clashed with pro-government forces in Syriaâ€™s Deir al-Zor province on Feb. 7.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said he had no information about any such casualties.\nReporting by Christian Lowe; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
