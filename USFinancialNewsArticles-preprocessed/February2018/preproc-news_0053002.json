The local share price index futures rose 0.5 percent or 31 points to 6,004, a 4.2-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.8 percent on Friday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.4 percent in early trade, and was headed for its fourth straight session of gains. (Reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru, editing by David Evans)",
