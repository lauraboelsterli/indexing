    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. As Andy Nairn, founding partner of creative agency Lucky Generals, wrote in Campaign earlier this week , it says something about a company’s confidence in its own brand when, in the midst of a crisis, you can find it in yourself to poke fun at the whole affair. It’s been a Code Red situation in the U.K. this week after a delivery blunder forced KFC to close many of its outlets because they’d run out of chicken. One distraught luncher “ had to go to Burger King! ” (I’ve rewatched this video more times than I’d care to admit.) KFC and its creative agency Mother opted for self-deprecation instead of solemn in communicating to customers about the fiasco, topped off with a rib-tickling newspaper ad Friday featuring a devastatingly empty chicken bucket emblazoned with the letters “FCK.”\nSick and Tired of the Photoshop Content moderation isn’t easy, especially when you’re a tech platform with more than a billion users, reams of user-generated content to sift through daily, and you’re keen not to drift too far toward making editorial decisions. The WSJ reports on yet another headache for Facebook and Google in their bids to banish misinformation from their platforms: doctored images . The report details how altered images were an often-used tool for Russian propagandists looking to spread divisive messages during the 2016 U.S. election. Social platforms’ algorithms are some way away from being able to accurately interpret the content of images and identify whether they have been distorted or taken out of context. For years, marketers have worked on the knowledge that photos are far more likely to be shared than the average text post. And the well-versed Russian misinformation marketing machine appears to have taken notice. For its part, Facebook says it’s expanding its program for tracking and suppressing links to fake news articles to include doctored images and videos.\nThe Metrics Reloaded When it comes to social media, there are so many metrics that most of the time, campaign managers can dig out any old number to make their pushes look like a success, regardless of whether they actually made an impact on the business. Facebook, which had a run of measurement mishaps over the past year or so, wants to clear up some of the confusion. The company said Thursday that it will more clearly label its data and remove 20 metrics it says aren’t frequently used by or useful to advertisers, CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports. Remember last year when journalists and analysts found Facebook’s Ad Manager claimed the platform could reach millions more users among certain age groups in countries than official census data said actually resided in those locations? Facebook says incidents like those made it realize it needed to do a better job of labeling when numbers are estimated.\nCut It Out Procter & Gamble’s finance department is like a hog sniffing out a truffle when it comes to agency budget cuts—it’s relentless in digging deeper and deeper to find them. Ad Age reports P&G plans to further reduce agency and production fees by $400 million by 2021 , according to Chief Executive David Taylor, who was speaking at a conference Thursday. That’s in addition to the $750 million the consumer-goods giant has already chopped out over the past three fiscal years. P&G also plans to further reduce the number of agencies it works with. Does it want the remaining ones to work out of the goodness of their hearts?! Turns out P&G is finding the extra wiggle room by switching from spending a big portion of its fees on fixed retainers with agencies of record, to “open sourcing” more projects to other agencies on its roster. There’s also some bonus info in that report from Unilever’s marketing cost-cutting drive. While the company is reducing the number of traditional ads it produces, it’s making 50% more digital ads than it did in 2012.\nMaybe She’s Bored With It? We all know most people don’t like change, but Snapchat users seem to be more likely to dig their heels in than most. As we mentioned earlier this week, more than 1 million people signed a petition begging Snapchat to revert to its old design. Then, Thursday, Snapchat power user Kylie Jenner twisted the knife, tweeting , “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore?” To rub salt in the wound (or perhaps mascara in the eye), cosmetics brand Maybelline tweeted Thursday that its Snapchat views had “dropped dramatically” and ran a poll asking whether it should stay on the platform. The tweet has been deleted, but at one point (thank you to Google’s Adam Singer for screen-grabbing it for posterity ), the majority of respondents clicked “No, I like IG Stories.” Talk about timing: Snap’s 10K SEC filing was released Thursday. The redesign was added to the “risk factors” section, where the company notes the update has received “negative attention in the press and in app store reviews.” Maybe it’s a grower. (Snap’s stock closed down 6% Thursday.)\nUPDATE: Matthew DiGirolamo, chief communications officer at Maybelline parent company L’Oréal USA, said in an emailed statement: “The tweet from an individual within our Maybelline brand in no way reflects the views of the company, nor the Maybelline brand. We have a strong partnership with Snap Inc. and are happy with the results we are seeing with the platform.” He added the tweet was deleted to make the official position clear.\nBest of the rest Publishers including Business Insider, Fusion Media Group, the Atlantic, MSNBC and Slate have signed up to join Scroll, a subscription service that charges consumers $5 a month to get rid of the ads from participating websites. [ CMO Today ]\nA look at the vulnerable economics of furniture retailer Wayfair. The company spent $500 million on advertising in the past four quarters, but a study from marketing professors Daniel McCarthy of Emory University and Peter Fader of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School found that Wayfair spends about $69 to acquire each new customer but earns only $59 back from each acquisition. [ WSJ ]\nFord has promoted Kumar Galhotra, group vice president of Lincoln and Ford chief marketing officer, to the role of Ford North America president. Mr. Galhotra replaces Raj Nair, who was ousted earlier this week after an internal investigation found he had engaged in “inappropriate behavior.” In a statement, Mr. Nair acknowledged “regret” over his behavior. Joy Falotico replaces Mr. Galhotra in the Lincoln chief and Ford CMO role, effective March 1. [ Ad Age ]\nDrinks giant Diageo is joining the “Free the Bid” movement and calling on its agencies to put forward at least one female director as part of any creative bid. [ Marketing Week ]\nAnnual revenue at ad tech company The Trade Desk rose 52% to $308 million. CEO Jeff Green predicted 2018 will be the year connected TV “becomes material” to its overall revenue, saying it eventually will surpass mobile.
