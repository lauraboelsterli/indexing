    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lincoln International, a leading global, mid-market investment bank, is pleased to announce the addition of Brian Bock to the firm in San Francisco. Brian will serve as a key member of the firm's Healthcare Group having extensive expertise in the medical technology (med-tech) and life sciences sectors. He brings to Lincoln significant transaction execution experience and deep sector expertise.\n\"These are transformative times for the Healthcare sector. Demographic changes, innovation and regulatory shifts are driving strong mergers and acquisition activity,\" said Rob Brown, CEO North America & Managing Director at Lincoln International. \"Brian's expertise on the leading edge of med-tech and life sciences will be instrumental in continuing to capitalize on that rising M&A demand. He brings deep experience and knowledge to advise growth-oriented companies and investors in two rapidly advancing areas of Healthcare. Moreover, he joins our recently opened San Francisco office, strengthening our presence in that market which is a key hub for investors in this space. We are thrilled to welcome him to Lincoln.\"\nBrian brings to Lincoln more than 20 years of investment banking and merger and acquisition experience working in partnership with early to late stage clients, venture capital, private equity and growth equity firms on numerous types of corporate finance and merger and acquisition assignments. Brian's M&A advisory experience includes successful engagements for both private and public companies, U.S. domestic and cross-border transactions, reverse mergers, divestitures and special situation assignments across all segments of healthcare.\nPrior to joining Lincoln International, Brian was a Managing Director in JMP Securities' (\"JMP\") healthcare investment banking group where he was a key contributor in establishing the firm's healthcare practice.

With his deep relationships and strong track record of successful transactions in the med-tech and life sciences sectors, Brian's expertise enhances not only Lincoln's Healthcare Group, but also the firm's Technology, Media & Telecom Group.\"\nAbout Lincoln International\nLincoln International specializes in merger and acquisition advisory services, debt advisory services, private capital raising and restructuring advice on mid-market transactions.
