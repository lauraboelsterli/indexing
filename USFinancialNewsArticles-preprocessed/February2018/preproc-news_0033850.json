    "text": "MONTREAL, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - BioAmber Inc. (TSX: BIOA) announced today that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) has notified the Company that it is reviewing, on an expedited basis, the Company's eligibility for continued listing.\nThis review results from the Company not being in a position to obtain the approval of the TSX in connection with its registered direct offering announced on February 9, 2018.\nBioAmber was notified of the listing review on February 12, 2018. A meeting with the continued listing committee of the TSX is scheduled to be held on February 15, 2018 at which the Company may make submissions. Since suspension of trading and delisting of the Company's shares from the TSX is a possible outcome, the Company may seek alternative Canadian marketplaces on which to be listed, including the TSX Venture Exchange.\nThe TSX notification does not affect the Company's business operations or its Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") or applicable Canadian reporting requirements, and does not constitute an event of default under any of the Company's debt obligations.\nAbout BioAmber\nBioAmber (NYSE: BIOA; TSX: BIOA) is a renewable materials company. Its innovative technology platform combines biotechnology and catalysis to convert renewable feedstock into building block materials that are used in a wide variety of everyday products including plastics, paints, textiles, food additives and personal care products.
