    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Shareholders in Tesco ( TSCO.L ), Britain’s biggest retailer, on Wednesday overwhelmingly backed the takeover of Booker ( BOK.L ), the country’s largest wholesaler, according to a provisional voting announcement.\nAt a general meeting of Tesco investors 85.22 percent of votes cast approved the deal, which was valued at 3.7 billion pounds ($5.13 billion) when it was agreed in January 2017 but worth 3.95 billion pounds at Tuesday’s closing share prices.\nRelated Coverage Booker shareholders back Tesco takeover at general meeting Booker says shareholders back Tesco takeover at scheme court meeting “It’s been carried fairly comfortably,” Chairman John Allan, said at the meeting in central London, attended by just 65 Tesco shareholders.\nSome 14.28 percent of votes cast opposed the deal.\nTesco required the support of 50 percent of votes cast.\nFinal voting numbers, which could differ only marginally, will be announced through a statement to the stock exchange later on Wednesday.\nThe proposed transaction is due to be voted on by Booker shareholders at a meeting later on Wednesday. At that meeting it needs the support of 75 percent of votes cast to proceed.\nIf Booker shareholders back the deal it is expected to complete on March 5.\nFor each Booker share Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.\nTesco shares were up 1.6 percent at 210.5 pence at 1130 GMT.\nReporting by James Davey and Alistair Smout; Editing by Kate Holton\n ",
