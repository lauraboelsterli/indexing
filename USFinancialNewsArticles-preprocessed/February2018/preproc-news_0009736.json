    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) today announced its financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2017.\nHighlights:\nQ1 2018 net earnings of $2.2 M, or $0.02 per share, impacted by one-time tax charge and CH2M acquisition Q1 2018 adjusted net earnings of $97.0 M, or $0.77 per share, up 13% year-over-year Q1 2018 year-over-year organic revenue growth, double-digit organic growth in professional services Continued strong gross margin performance of 18%, up 130 bps year-over-year Backlog of $26.2 B at end of 1Q 2018; Jacobs only backlog up $1.4 B year-over-year Closed CH2M acquisition, cost synergies ramping while targeting incremental revenue opportunities Strong balance sheet financial flexibility with $1.5 B of net debt post CH2M close\nCommenting on the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Steve Demetriou, Jacobs Chairman and CEO said, “Our first quarter results further demonstrated progress against our strategy to allocate our resources toward both higher growth and higher margin opportunities. We are seeing continued momentum in our Aerospace & Technology and Buildings & Infrastructure businesses as well as improving trends in our more cyclical Energy and Mining & Minerals businesses. Furthermore, we are off to a solid start capturing the planned CH2M cost synergies and positioning our combined company for incremental revenue opportunities by offering more comprehensive solutions to our clients. Most importantly, Jacobs’ enhanced deep domain knowledge coupled with our digital expertise strengthens our ability to deliver innovative solutions for a more connected, sustainable world.”\nKevin Berryman, Jacobs CFO, added, “The first quarter results displayed our continued focus on profitable growth as we maintained solid margins. While the CH2M acquisition did not materially impact our first quarter results, we are pleased with the performance of CH2M and excited about the combined company’s growth and profitability profile. We are increasing our fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS outlook including the approximately nine-months contribution from the CH2M acquisition to $3.85-$4.25 from $3.55-$3.95. The increase in our outlook is driven by the benefits of the recent change in the U.S. federal tax law.”\nFirst Quarter Review\nFiscal 1Q 2018 Fiscal 1Q 2017 Change Revenue $2.8 billion $2.6 billion +$200 million GAAP Net Earnings $2 million $61 million ($59 million) GAAP Earnings Per Diluted Share $0.02 $0.50 ($0.48) Adjusted Net Earnings $97 million $83 million +$14 million Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share (EPS) $0.77 $0.68 +$0.09 Included in the first quarter GAAP earnings is the impact of a lower annualized tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a lump sum pension settlement and the financial results of CH2M during the two week period from the December 15, 2017 closing date to December 29, 2017.\nThe company’s adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 exclude the charges and costs set forth in the table below.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS.\nAdjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated by excluding (i) the after-tax costs related to the 2015 restructuring activities, which included involuntary terminations, the abandonment of certain leased offices, combining operational organizations and the co-location of employees into other existing offices; and charges associated with our Europe, U.K. and Middle East region, which included write-offs on contract accounts receivable and charges for statutory redundancy and severance costs (collectively, the “2015 Restructuring and other items”); (ii) after-tax costs and other charges associated with restructuring activities implemented in connection with the CH2M acquisition, which include involuntary terminations, costs associated with co-locating Jacobs and CH2M offices, costs and expenses of the Integration Management Office, including professional services and personnel costs, and similar costs and expenses (collectively referred to as the “CH2M Restructuring and other charges”), (iii) transaction costs and other charges incurred in connection with closing of the CH2M acquisition, including advisor fees, change in control payments, costs and expenses relating to the registration and listing of Jacobs stock issued in connection with the acquisition, and similar transaction costs and expenses (collectively referred to as “CH2M transaction costs”), and (iv) one-time net charges resulting from the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We believe that adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the Company’s operating results and understanding the Company’s operating trends by excluding the effects of the items described above, which can obscure underlying trends. Additionally, management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS in its own evaluation of the Company’s performance, particularly when comparing performance to past periods, and believes these measures are useful for investors because they facilitate a comparison of our financial results from period to period.\nThe Company provides non-GAAP measures to supplement U.S. GAAP measures, as they provide additional insight into the Company’s financial results. However, non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation and are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. In addition, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the ability of investors to compare non-GAAP measures of the Company to those used by our peer companies.\nThe following tables reconcile the components and values of U.S. GAAP net earnings and EPS to the corresponding \"adjusted\" amounts. For the comparable periods presented below, such adjustments consist of amounts incurred in connection with the items described above. Amounts are shown in thousands, except for per-share data:\nU.S. GAAP Reconciliation for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017\nThree Months Ended December 29, 2017 U.S. GAAP Effects of\nRestructuring\nand Other\nCharges\nEffects of\nCH2M\ntransaction\ncosts\nOne Time\nTax\nReform\nImpact\nAdjusted\nRevenue $ 2,750,311 $\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n2,750,311 Direct cost of contracts (2,263,131 ) — — — (2,263,131 ) Gross profit 487,180 — — — 487,180 Selling, general and administrative expenses (439,536 ) 19,349 67,641 — (352,546 ) Operating Profit 47,644 19,349 67,641 — 134,634 Total other (expense) income, net (5,728 ) — 256 — (5,472 ) Earnings before taxes 41,916 19,349 67,897 — 129,162 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit\n(39,355 ) (4,692 ) (16,536\n)\n28,803\n(31,780 ) Net earnings of the Group 2,561 14,657 51,361 28,803 97,382 Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests (398 ) — — — (398 ) Net earnings attributable to Jacobs\n$ 2,163 $ 14,657\n$\n51,361\n$\n28,803\n$\n96,984\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.02 $ 0.11\n$\n0.41\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.77\nThree Months Ended December 30, 2016 U.S. GAAP Effects of 2015\nRestructuring\nand other items\nAdjusted Revenue $ 2,551,604 $ — $ 2,551,604 Direct cost of contracts (2,132,292 ) — (2,132,292 ) Gross profit 419,312 — 419,312 Selling, general and administrative expenses (330,684 ) 31,741 (298,943 ) Total other expense, net (2,748 ) — (2,748 ) Earnings before taxes 85,880 31,741 117,621 Income tax expense (24,727 ) (8,938 ) (33,665 ) Net earnings of the Group 61,153 22,803 83,956 Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests (617 ) — (617 ) Net earnings attributable to Jacobs $ 60,536 $ 22,803 $ 83,339 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.50 $ 0.18 $ 0.68 Earnings Per Share:\nFor the Three Months Ended December 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nNumerator for Basic and Diluted EPS: Net income $ 2,163 $ 60,536 Net income allocated to participating securities (15 ) — Net income allocated to common stock for EPS calculation $ 2,148 $ 60,536 Denominator for Basic and Diluted EPS: Weighted average basic shares 124,122 119,438 Effect of dilutive securities: Stock compensation plans 1,023 1,477 Restricted stock 886 936 Diluted shares 126,031 121,851 Shares allocated to participating securities (886 ) — Shares used for calculating diluted EPS attributable to common stock 125,145 121,851 Basic EPS $ 0.02 $ 0.50 Diluted EPS $ 0.02 $ 0.50\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005483/en/\nJacobs Engineering Group Inc.\nKevin C.
