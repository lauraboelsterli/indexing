    "text": "PEMBROKE, Bermuda, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sompo International, a Bermuda-based specialty provider of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, announced today that it has reached an agreement to purchase A&A, S.r.l. (A&A), a leader in the Italian agriculture insurance market since 1996. The transaction is expected to close by March 2018 pending regulatory approvals.\nThe A&A acquisition aligns with Sompo International’s recently announced new initiative, AgriSompo, a global platform to deliver innovative and coordinated agricultural risk management solutions tailored to local market needs. A&A will complement AgriSompo’s objective of building integrated global capabilities in the crop insurance business, both by leveraging Sompo’s extensive agriculture insurance expertise and acquiring specialty companies in key markets.\nSompo International plans to maintain A&A’s current staff, structure and management team, including Mr. Giovanni Giudici as Chairman and Mr. Guido Passarini as Chief Administrative Officer. Once the transaction is complete, Mr. John Charman, Sompo International CEO and Chairman; Mr. Kristopher Lynn and Mr. Avery Cook, Senior Vice Presidents of Agriculture Reinsurance; and Mr. Patrizio Cassinis, Senior Vice President and Senior Underwriter Reinsurance, will join A&A’s Board of Directors.\nMr. Charman commented, “A&A is an attractive addition to our AgriSompo platform, given the A&A team’s deep technical expertise and knowledge of agriculture insurance, and their significant market share built on long-term distribution relationships throughout Italy. The acquisition of A&A will greatly accelerate Sompo International’s presence in the Italian crop insurance market and provide us with unique opportunities to introduce new products and technologies in the Italian agri-business market.”\nMr. Giudici, stated, “Through Sompo International’s extensive agriculture insurance capabilities and financial investment in new technologies, we will be able to provide enhanced risk solutions to the Italian agriculture community. We look forward to working closely with the Sompo International team to expand our business and provide additional value to our clients.”\nAbout Sompo International\nSompo International is a global specialty provider of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance, headquartered in Bermuda.
