    "text": "Blake Griffin generated the buzz, but it was Anthony Tolliver who made the key plays down the stretch to help the Detroit Pistons create a winning streak.\nTolliver scored five points in the last 1:48 and won a crucial jump ball in the final seconds to help the Pistons earn a 104-102 home win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday.\nThe Pistons won their second straight after losing their previous eight games.\nMuch of the focus was on Griffin, the five-time All-Star who made his Detroit debut after coming over from the Los Angeles Clippers in a blockbuster trade on Monday.\nGriffin delivered with 24 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. One of the assists came with 1:48 remaining when he found Tolliver open on the wing for a 3-pointer that gave Detroit a 101-100 lead.\nWith 10.8 seconds remaining, Tolliver won a jump ball against Memphis’ Dillon Brooks, and the ball was run down by Pistons guard Reggie Bullock, who was fouled with 7.2 seconds remaining.\nThe Grizzlies had that foul to give, so the Pistons sent the ensuing inbounds pass to Tolliver, who hit two free throws with 6.2 seconds remaining to give Detroit a 103-100 lead.\nWith 2.6 seconds left, the Pistons fouled Memphis guard Wayne Selden, who made the first free throw and also the second despite trying to intentionally miss, slicing the deficit to 103-102.\nMemphis quickly fouled Bullock, who made the second of two free throws with 2.0 seconds remaining.\nThe Grizzlies had one last chance to win, but a half-court shot by Marc Gasol missed as time expired.\nBullock scored 15 points, Andre Drummond had 14 points and 15 rebounds, and Stanley Johnson added 14 points for Detroit.\nGasol has 19 points and 14 rebounds, and Andrew Harrison scored 18 points in defeat for Memphis.\nDetroit took advantage of a free-throw disparity, making 27 of 37 at the line to Memphis’ 14 of 14.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
