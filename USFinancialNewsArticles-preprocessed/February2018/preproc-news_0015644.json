At 0614 GMT, S&P 500 e-mini futures dropped 1.0 percent. \nMining companies, drugmakers and automakers outperformed. \nEisai Co rose 2.4 percent, Astellas Pharma gained 2.5 percent, and Inpex Corp added 1.4 percent. \nToyota Motor Corp rose 1.2 percent after the automaker said that it expects a record net profit this year. \nThe broader Topix gained 0.4 percent to 1,749.91.
