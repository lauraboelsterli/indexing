    "text": "RENO, Nev., Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. (Nasdaq:MCRI) (“Monarch” or “the Company”) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, as summarized below:\n($ in thousands, except per share data and percentages) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Increase\n(Decrease) 2017 2016 Increase Net revenue $ 56,056 $ 55,596 0.8 % $ 230,726 $ 217,032 6.3 % Adjusted EBITDA (1)(2) 12,589 14,600 (13.8 %) 58,046 55,741 4.1 % Net income (3) $ 4,397 $ 6,470 (32.0 %) $ 25,538 $ 24,574 3.9 % Basic EPS $ 0.25 $ 0.37 (32.4 %) $ 1.45 $ 1.42 2.1 % Diluted EPS (3)(4) $ 0.23 $ 0.36 (36.1 %) $ 1.39 $ 1.39 - (1) Definitions, disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial information are included later in the release.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was negatively affected by approximately $1.6 million of Toucan Charlies buffet redesign and upgrade costs that were expensed in first quarter of 2016.\n(3) The $1.6 million Toucan Charlies buffet redesign and upgrade costs, expensed during the first quarter of 2016, had approximately a $1.0 million negative effect on Net income and a $0.05 negative effect on the Diluted EPS for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\n(4) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a non-cash Deferred tax asset revaluation in the fourth quarter of 2017, which has a $1,461 thousand negative effect on Net income and $0.08 negative effect on the Diluted EPS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding this impact, Net income and diluted EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year declined 9.5% and 13.9%, respectively, and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year increased 9.9% and 5.8%, respectively.\nCEO Comment\nJohn Farahi, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Monarch, commented: “We saw positive business trends in the 2017 fourth quarter. These included a surge of 6% in slot volume as well as growth in food and beverage and hotel revenues at Atlantis Casino Resort, and an increase in gaming revenue at Monarch Casino Black Hawk. However, this improvement was offset by abnormally low slot hold at Atlantis. Moreover, with the anticipated enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we accelerated certain maintenance work into the fourth quarter, resulting in higher maintenance expenses for that quarter. In addition, our self-funded health insurance plans at both properties and our self-funded workers compensation plan at Atlantis each experienced higher than usual fourth quarter claims. These items, representing a total impact of approximately $2.2 million, lowered our fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA.\n“The Reno market and Atlantis Casino Resort continue to benefit from the broad-based economic resurgence that is transforming the Reno area. Since Tesla planted its multi-billion dollar flag in 2014, regional business has increased steadily as employment and wages have strengthened. The Reno-Sparks Convention Center is driving increased bookings of major shows and conferences, including the relocation of Interbike to Reno in September of 2018, as well as Safari Club International in January of 2019. As the only resort directly connected to the Convention Center, we believe that Atlantis is well positioned to realize further growth across all areas of our business.\n“Like Reno, the Denver area economy remains vibrant. Weather at Black Hawk in the fourth quarter of 2017 was relatively dry and mild, reducing weather-related negative impact. The positive weather trend has continued into the first quarter of 2018, allowing our construction team to make steady progress on the Monarch hotel tower and casino expansion, which remains on budget and on schedule for completion in the second quarter of 2019. We believe that our freshly redesigned casino and new parking facility have helped drive growth in the Black Hawk market. We are encouraged to see our Black Hawk peers likewise investing in their properties, signaling a shared vision for Black Hawk to emerge as a premier regional destination for gaming and entertainment.\n“While the strengthening economy presents us with revenue growth opportunities in Reno and Black Hawk, we are experiencing the pressure of a tight labor market, which increases competition for talent and drives rising wages. Thus, we must remain vigilant in managing our expenses to optimize margins, bringing long-term value for our stockholders, while also continuing to deliver an exceptional product and services for our guests.\n“Since breaking ground on the Monarch Casino Black Hawk expansion in the first quarter of 2017 we have not drawn on our credit facility, funding all expansion-related capital spending and maintenance capital expenditures at both properties from operating cash flows. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will bring a recurring benefit to Monarch’s free cash flow and a de-leveraging effect on our balance sheet. Given our current leverage and the effect of the new tax law, we expect that our peak leverage ratio at the completion of the project will be below 2x.”\nSummary of 2017 Fourth Quarter Operating Results\nFor the 2017 fourth quarter, consolidated net revenue increased 0.8% to $56.1 million from $55.6 million in the prior year. Consolidated casino, food and beverage, hotel and other revenue increases were partially offset by a hold-driven casino revenue decline at Atlantis Casino Resort. Consolidated casino revenues, food and beverage revenues and hotel revenues increased 0.3%, 2.1% and 4.6% on a year over year basis, respectively. Consolidated promotional allowances increased $0.4 million, or 3.6%. As a percentage of gross revenues, promotional allowances were 18.1% compared to 17.7% a year ago.\nThe Company generated consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 13.8%, over the same period a year ago. The current year Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by: a $1.3 million effect of the abnormally low slot hold at Atlantis; and a $1.3 million increase in labor expenses as a result of competitive labor markets in both Reno and Denver, additional labor related to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk expansion and higher than average medical and workers compensation claims paid out of the Company’s self-insured plans.\nCasino operating expense as a percentage of casino revenue increased to 41.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 39.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to increase in complimentary and labor expenses. Food and beverage operating expense as a percentage of food and beverage revenue decreased to 39.1% during the fourth quarter of 2017 from 40.1% a year ago primarily driven by product cost efficiencies, offset by an increase in labor expense. Hotel operating expense as a percentage of hotel revenue increased to 38.1% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 33.6% for the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in labor expense and an increase in repair and maintenance expense to keep our hotel product fresh and upscale.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A\") expense for the 2017 fourth quarter was $16.6 million compared to $15.6 million in the prior year period driven primarily by an increase in labor expense. As a percentage of net revenue, SG&A expense increased to 29.6% compared to 28.1% a year ago.\nMonarch Black Hawk Expansion\nSummarized below is an update on the Company’s ongoing upgrade and expansion of Monarch Casino Black Hawk, including the expected costs and completion dates for the project, as well as the amounts spent through December 31, 2017:\n$ in millions Budget\nCost Total Spent\nThrough December 31, 2017 Left to\nSpend Estimated\nCompletion Date I.

(2) Includes upgrades to the interior, which were completed in August 2015, demolition of the original garage, and upgrades to the exterior of the existing facility to match the design of the master planned expansion. (3) The Company anticipates funding the hotel tower and casino expansion, as well as the existing facility exterior upgrades, from a combination of operating cash flow and the Company’s amended credit facility. The expansion project at Monarch Casino Black Hawk remains on schedule and in budget and the Company’s targeted completion date for the project remains the second quarter of 2019.\nCredit Facility and Liquidity\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company did not make any principal borrowings on its amended credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the amount outstanding on the amended credit facility remained at $26.2 million. Capital expenditures of $12.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 represent costs related to the Monarch Casino Black Hawk master development plan and ongoing capital maintenance spending. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 were funded entirely from the Company’s operating cash flow.\nInterest expense for the 2017 fourth quarter was $328 thousand, compared to $341 thousand in the same quarter of 2016.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which are subject to change, including, but not limited to, statements relating to (i) plans, objectives, expectations, growth prospects and future operations regarding Atlantis Casino Resort Spa and Monarch Casino Black Hawk; (ii) plans, costs, financing, construction, completion and opening timelines of upgraded, redesigned and/or expanded facilities at Monarch Casino Black Hawk; (iii) the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our cash flows, leverage ratio and financial condition and (iv) our expectations regarding the quality of service we provide to our guests and our ability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.
