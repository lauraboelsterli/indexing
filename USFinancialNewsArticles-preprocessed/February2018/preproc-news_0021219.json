    "text": "HELSINKI, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The Finnish government’s Solidium investment arm has sold its 3.2 percent stake in Swedish telecoms company Telia for 5.1 billion Swedish crowns ($631.95 million), it said on Thursday.\nThe holdings were sold at a price of SEK 37.32 per share to institutional investors, a slight discount to Wednesday’s SEK 37.68 closing price, and Solidium no longer owns any Telia shares.\nSolidium mainly holds stakes in listed Finnish companies that are considered nationally important.
