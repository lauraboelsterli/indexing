    "text": "February 27, 2018 / 4:33 AM / Updated 8 minutes ago METALS-London copper holds ground ahead of Powell testimony Reuters Staff 5 Min Read (Adds analyst comment, updates prices) MELBOURNE/BEIJING, Feb 27 (Reuters) - London copper prices inched up on Tuesday, lifted in light trade by a weaker dollar ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's highly-anticipated first congressional testimony later in the day. Powell's debut appearance is seen as critical for the financial markets, with many investors nervous about the Fed's policy normalisation following years of stimulus. London copper has held above the $7,000-a-tonne mark since Feb. 14 and edged up on Monday on the back of strong import data from top metals consumer China. \"The positive sentiment in the market looks likely to remain. However, investors will now be focused on economic data, with Chinese PMIs on Wednesday likely to set the tone for the remainder of the week,\" ANZ wrote in a note. China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey will be published on Wednesday, along with a similar official survey covering the services sector. FUNDAMENTALS * LONDON COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper edged up 0.1 percent to $7,115.50 a tonne by 0405 GMT, having finished up 0.2 percent in the previous session. * SHANGHAI COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper eased by 0.3 percent to 53,290 yuan ($8,451.22) a tonne by the mid-session interval. * CHALCO SHARES: Shares in Aluminum Corp of China Ltd , known as Chalco, slumped by the maximum permitted 10 percent in Shanghai on Tuesday for the second day in a row.
