(\"Athene\") (NYSE: ATH), a leading provider of retirement savings products, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.\nNet income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $464 million, or $2.35 per diluted Class A share (\"diluted share\"), compared to net income in the fourth quarter 2016 of $364 million, or $1.78 per diluted share. Net income for the full-year 2017 was $1.4 billion, or $7.37 per diluted share, compared to net income for the full-year 2016 of $768 million, or $4.02 per diluted share.\nAdjusted operating income 1 for the fourth quarter 2017 was $332 million, or $1.69 per adjusted operating share, compared to adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter 2016 of $280 million, or $1.43 per adjusted operating share. Adjusted operating income for the full-year 2017 was $1.1 billion, or $5.66 per adjusted operating share, compared to adjusted operating income for the full-year 2016 of $728 million, or $3.77 per adjusted operating share.\n\"2017 was a milestone year for Athene. In our first year of being public we executed on our growth initiatives, generated very strong financial results and set the stage for long-term strategic growth,\" said Jim Belardi, CEO of Athene.\n\"For the first time we executed in all four of our funding channels, including inorganic, and generated a record $11.5 billion of new deposits. Particularly notable was the extraordinary execution in our institutional channel, which generated $5.3 billion of new deposits. In December, we announced an agreement with Voya Financial to reinsure $19 billion of liabilities, a transaction that demonstrates our expertise and financial capability to provide creative, customized solutions to the life insurance industry. This is the next step in our plan to become a solutions provider to the overall financial services industry,\" Mr. Belardi continued.\n\"In 2018 we will build on this momentum, continuing to expand and diversify our product portfolio, which in combination with our strong balance sheet positions us well to continue to create significant shareholder value.\"\n1 This news release references certain Non-GAAP measures. See Non-GAAP Measures for additional discussion.\nOther Highlights\nFull-year 2017 Retirement Services investment margin of 2.82%, up 6 basis points year-over-year Full-year 2017 Retirement Services adjusted operating income up 41% to $1.1 billion Full-year 2017 ROE of 18.0%, full-year 2017 Retirement Services adjusted operating ROE excluding AOCI of 22.0% Athene shareholders' equity increased 34% year-over-year to $9.2 billion and Athene shareholders' equity ex. AOCI increased 20% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, as of December 31, 2017 ALRe RBC of 562% 1 as of December 31, 2017; BSCR of 354% as of December 31, 2017 U.S. RBC of 490%, as of December 31, 2017 Ranked #2 carrier in fixed indexed annuity sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 2 Announced an agreement with Voya Financial to reinsure approximately $19 billion of fixed and fixed indexed annuity liabilities, for which we expect to deploy approximately $1 billion of total capital Deconsolidated German business, AGER (now Athora), which began to be held as an alternative investment as of January 1, 2018 In January 2018, issued $1.0 billion of senior unsecured debt\n1 ALRe RBC ratio, which is used in evaluating our capital position and the amount of capital needed to support our Retirement Services segment, is calculated by applying the NAIC RBC factors to the Statutory Financial Statements of ALRe.\n2 Rankings as of September 30, 2017 per LIMRA.\nFourth Quarter Results\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $464 million, an increase of $100 million, or 27%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by a $52 million increase in adjusted operating income and realized gains. Additionally, the fourth quarter of 2016 had unfavorable impacts from assumed reinsurance embedded derivatives related to increases in U.S. Treasury rates. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a $7 million tax benefit related to the decrease in net deferred tax liabilities attributed to the lower future income tax rate.\nAdjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $332 million, an increase of $52 million, or 19%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher fixed and other investment income, lower other liability costs and German adjusted operating income of $30 million compared to $17 million in the prior year. This was partially offset by lower alternative investment income. Fixed and other investment income increased mainly due to invested asset growth and increased floating rate investment income due to higher short-term interest rates. Other liability costs were lower primarily due to favorable equity market performance and immaterial out-of-period actuarial adjustments.\nFull-Year Results\nNet income for the full-year 2017 was $1.448 billion, an increase of $680 million, or 89%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by a $381 million increase in adjusted operating income, a favorable change in FIA derivatives resulting from strong equity market performance, favorable assumed reinsurance embedded derivative impacts due to RMBS credit spread tightening, and realized gains.\nAdjusted operating income for the full-year 2017 was $1.109 billion, an increase of $381 million, or 52% over the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher investment income and lower other liability costs, partially offset by higher operating expenses which were consistent with block growth. Additionally, in 2016 a $102 million income tax benefit was recognized due to a deferred tax valuation allowance release. Investment income increased primarily due to invested asset growth, increased floating rate investment income due to higher short-term interest rates and higher alternative investment income. Other liability costs decreased primarily due to favorable variance in unlocking impacts with 2017 recognizing a $20 million expense compared to $158 million in 2016, favorable equity market performance and immaterial out-of-period actuarial adjustments.\nDeposit Highlights\nIn the fourth quarter, Athene generated deposits of $3.5 billion, an increase of 91% compared to the prior year. For the full year, new deposits were $11.5 billion, an increase of 31% from the prior year, driven by robust growth in our institutional channel.\nRetail Sales : In the fourth quarter, Athene generated $1.3 billion of new deposits, down from the prior year due to overall market softness. For the full year, new deposits were $5.4 billion, up 1% over the prior year, driven by expanded distribution, in both the bank and broker-dealer channels, as we are seeing the impact of our ratings upgrade and expanded wholesale team.\nFlow Reinsurance : In the fourth quarter, Athene generated $305 million of new deposits, down from the prior year. For the full year, new deposits were $875 million. We continue to pursue new reinsurance partners and develop new products to diversify our portfolio.\nInstitutional : In the fourth quarter, Athene generated $1.9 billion of new deposits from three pension risk transfer transactions. For the full year, new deposits were $5.3 billion within our institutional channel, comprised of $3.0 billion of funding agreements and $2.3 billion of pension risk transfer liabilities.\nSelected Results\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions, except percentages and per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Deposits $ 3,513 $ 1,840 $ 11,481 $ 8,758 Investments, including related parties 84,367 72,433 Invested assets 82,298 71,834 Debt to capital ratio, ex.

Our Class B common shares are economically equivalent to Class A common shares and can be converted to Class A common shares on a 1-for-1 basis at any time. Our Class M common shares are in the legal form of shares but economically function as options as they are convertible into Class A shares after vesting and settlement of the conversion price. We believe this non-GAAP measure is an appropriate economic representation of our share counts for use in an economic view of book value metrics.\nThree months ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted operating income by segment Retirement Services $ 306 $ 242 $ 1,092 $ 777 Corporate and Other 26 38 17 (49 ) Adjusted operating income 332 280 1,109 728 Investment gains (losses), net of offsets 59 (51 ) 199 47 Change in fair values of derivatives and embedded derivatives - FIAs, net of offsets 111 183 266 95 Integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses\n(34 ) (14 ) (68 ) (22 ) Stock compensation expense (3 ) (23 ) (33 ) (82 ) Income tax (expense) benefit - non-operating (1 ) (11 ) (25 ) 2 Total non-operating adjustments 132 84 339 40 Net income available to AHL shareholders $ 464 $ 364 $ 1,448 $ 768 Earnings per share - basic 1 $ 2.36 $ 1.92 $ 7.41 $ 4.11 Earnings per share - diluted Class A 2 $ 2.35 $ 1.78 $ 7.37 $ 4.02 Adjusted operating earnings per share 3 $ 1.69 $ 1.43 $ 5.66 $ 3.77 Weighted average shares outstanding - basic 1 196.7 189.2 195.3 186.8 Weighted average shares outstanding - diluted Class A 2 126.4 63.9 111.0 53.5 Weighted average shares outstanding - adjusted operating 3 196.1 194.2 195.9 193.4 1 Basic earnings per share, including basic weighted average shares outstanding includes all classes eligible to participate in dividends for each period presented.\n2 Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis for Class A common shares, including diluted Class A weighted average shares outstanding, includes the dilutive impacts, if any, of Class B common shares, Class M common shares and any other stock-based awards. Such dilutive securities totaled 412,058 weighted average shares for the quarter and 3,323,072 weighted average shares for the year. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis for Class A common shares are based on allocated net income of $297 million (64% of net income) and $114 million (31% of net income) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis for Class A common shares are based on allocated net income of $818 million (56% of net income) and $215 million (28% of net income) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n3 Weighted average shares outstanding - adjusted operating assumes conversion or settlement of all outstanding items that are able to be converted to or settled in Class A common shares, including the impacts of Class B common shares on a one-for-one basis, the impacts of all Class M common shares net of the conversion price and any other stock-based awards, but excluding any awards for which the exercise or conversion price exceeds the market value of Class A common shares on the applicable measurement date. Our Class B common shares are economically equivalent to Class A common shares and can be converted to Class A common shares on a 1-for-1 basis at any time. Our Class M common shares are in the legal form of shares but economically function as options as they are convertible into Class A shares after vesting and settlement of the conversion price. In calculating Class A diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, we are required to apply sequencing rules to determine the dilutive impacts, if any, of our Class B common shares, Class M common shares and any other stock-based awards. To the extent our Class B common shares, Class M common shares and/or any other stock-based awards are not dilutive they are excluded. We believe this non-GAAP measure is an appropriate economic representation of our share counts for use in an economic view of adjusted operating earnings per share.\nSegment Results\nRetirement Services\nQ4 Results\nIn the fourth quarter, Retirement Services adjusted operating income was $306 million, an increase of $64 million, or 26%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher fixed and other investment income and lower other liability costs, partially offset by lower alternative investment income.\nFixed and other investment income increased primarily due to invested asset growth and increased floating rate investment income due to higher short-term interest rates. The decrease in other liability costs was primarily due to $53 million of lower rider reserves and DAC amortization due to favorable equity market performance as well as immaterial out-of-period actuarial adjustments, partially offset by an increase resulting from growth in the block of business.\nInvestment margin on deferred annuities was 2.70%, a decrease of 28 basis points over the prior year. The net investment earned rate was 4.57%, a decrease of 36 basis points over the prior year. Investment returns were strong in both fixed and other as well as alternatives, returning 4.43% and 7.92%, respectively. However, the prior year benefited from high alternative returns of 16.25%, resulting from an increase in the fair value of two funds reflecting the removal of liquidity discounts related to marketability assumptions used in the determination of fair value.\nCost of crediting was 1.87%, a favorable decrease of 8 basis points compared to the prior year, as a result of rate actions and lower option costs.\nFull-Year Results\nFor the full-year 2017, Retirement Services adjusted operating income was $1.092 billion, an increase of $315 million, or 41%, over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher fixed and other investment income and lower other liability costs. This was partially offset by higher income tax expense and lower alternative investment income.\nFixed and other investment income increased primarily due to invested asset growth and increased floating rate investment income due to higher short-term interest rates. Other liability costs were lower due to a $138 million favorable change in unlocking of assumptions, $100 million of lower rider reserves and DAC amortization due to favorable equity market performance and immaterial out-of-period actuarial adjustments, partially offset by an increase resulting from growth in the block of business. Income tax expense was lower in the prior year as a result of a deferred tax valuation allowance release of $102 million.\nInvestment margin on deferred annuities was 2.82%, an increase of 6 basis points over the prior year. The net investment earned rate was 4.70%, a slight decrease of 2 basis points over the prior year. Investment returns were strong in both fixed and other as well as alternatives, returning 4.48% and 10.01%, respectively. Alternative income was driven by higher real estate income and higher income from AmeriHome. The prior year had alternative returns of 12.26%, resulting from an increase in the fair value of two funds reflecting the removal of liquidity discounts related to marketability assumptions used in the determination of fair value.\nCost of crediting was 1.88%, a favorable decrease of 8 basis points compared to the prior year, as a result of rate actions and lower option costs.\nCorporate Segment\nQ4 Results\nIn the fourth quarter, Corporate and Other adjusted operating income was $26 million, a decrease of $12 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower alternative income and higher Corporate operating expenses. German adjusted operating income was $30 million, an increase of $13 million over prior year, primarily driven by favorable policyholder dividends as a result of the unwinding of timing differences in recognition of participating income under U.S. GAAP compared to German GAAP that occurred in the third quarter 2017, which had an adjusted operating loss of $17 million.\nFull-Year Results\nFor the full-year 2017, Corporate and Other adjusted operating income was $17 million, an increase of $66 million compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher alternative investment income, partially offset by higher Corporate operating expenses and a decline in German adjusted operating income to $2 million, compared to $16 million in 2016. Alternative investment income was higher than the prior year during which there was a decline in the market value of public equity positions in one of our funds.\nConference Call Information\nThis press release and the fourth quarter 2017 financial supplement will be posted to the Company’s website at ir.athene.com .\nAthene will conduct a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. Additionally, the company will post an earnings presentation deck on the ir.athene.com website prior to market open on February 22, 2018.\nLive conference call: Toll-free at 1-888-317-6003 (domestic) or 1-412-317-6061 (international) Participant entry number: 7966688 Replay available through March 08, 2018 at 1-877-344-7529 (domestic) or 1-412-317-0088 (international) Replay access code: 10116515 Live and archived webcast available at ir.athene.com\nAbout Athene Holding Ltd.\nAthene, through its subsidiaries, is a leading retirement services company that issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. The products offered by Athene include:\nRetail fixed and fixed indexed annuity products; Reinsurance arrangements with third-party annuity providers; and Institutional products, such as funding agreements and group annuity contracts related to pension risk transfers.\nAthene had total assets of approximately $99.6 billion as of December 31, 2017. Athene's principal subsidiaries include Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company, a Delaware-domiciled insurance company, Athene Annuity and Life Company, an Iowa-domiciled insurance company, Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company of New York, a New York-domiciled insurance company and Athene Life Re Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer.\nFurther information about our companies can be found at www.athene.com .\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to our results presented in accordance with GAAP, our results of operations include certain non-GAAP measures commonly used in our industry. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures, together with the relevant GAAP measures, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of our results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. The majority of these non-GAAP measures are intended to remove from the results of operations the impact of market volatility (other than with respect to alternative investments) as well as integration, restructuring and certain other expenses which are not part of our underlying profitability drivers or likely to re-occur in the foreseeable future, as such items fluctuate from period to period in a manner inconsistent with these drivers. These measures should be considered supplementary to our results in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the GAAP measures. See Non-GAAP Measure Reconciliations for the appropriate reconciliations to the GAAP measures.\nAdjusted operating income (formerly operating income, net of tax) is a non-GAAP measure used to evaluate our financial performance excluding market volatility and expenses related to integration, restructuring, stock compensation, and certain other expenses. Our adjusted operating income equals net income available to AHL’s shareholders adjusted to eliminate the impact of the following (collectively, the “non-operating adjustments”):\nInvestment Gains (Losses), Net of Offsets Change in Fair Values of Derivatives and Embedded Derivatives - FIAs, Net of Offsets Integration, Restructuring, and Other Non-operating Expenses Stock Compensation Expense Bargain Purchase Gain Income Tax (Expense) Benefit - Non-operating\nWe consider these non-operating adjustments to be meaningful adjustments to net income available to AHL's shareholders and we believe using a measure which excludes the impact of these items is effective in analyzing the trends in our results of operations. Together with net income available to AHL's shareholders, we believe adjusted operating income provides a meaningful financial metric that helps investors understand our underlying results and profitability. Adjusted operating income should not be used as a substitute for net income available to AHL's shareholders.\nROE excluding AOCI and adjusted operating ROE excluding AOCI are non-GAAP measures used to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impacts of AOCI. AOCI fluctuates period to period in a manner inconsistent with our underlying profitability drivers as the majority of such fluctuation is related to the market volatility of the unrealized gains and losses associated with our AFS securities. Once we have reinvested acquired blocks of businesses, we typically buy and hold AFS investments to maturity throughout the duration of market fluctuations. Therefore, the period-over-period impacts in unrealized gains and losses are not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals or future performance. Accordingly, we believe using measures which exclude AOCI is useful in analyzing the trends of our operations. To enhance the ability to analyze these measures across periods, interim periods are annualized. ROE excluding AOCI and adjusted operating ROE excluding AOCI should not be used as a substitute for ROE. However, we believe the adjustments to equity are significant to gaining an understanding of our overall results of operations.\nAdjusted operating earnings per share, weighted average shares outstanding - adjusted operating, and book value per share excluding AOCI are non-GAAP measures used to evaluate our financial performance and financial condition. The non-GAAP measures adjust the number of shares included in the corresponding GAAP measures to reflect the conversion or settlement of all shares and other stock-based awards outstanding. We believe using these measures represents an economic view of our share counts and provides a simplified and consistent view of our outstanding shares. Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated as the adjusted operating income over the weighted average shares outstanding - adjusted operating. Book value per share excluding AOCI is calculated as the ending AHL shareholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by the adjusted operating common shares outstanding. Our Class B common shares are economically equivalent to Class A common shares and can be converted to Class A common shares on a one-for-one basis at any time. Our Class M common shares are in the legal form of shares but economically function as options as they are convertible into Class A shares after vesting and settlement of the conversion price. In calculating Class A diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, we are required to apply sequencing rules to determine the dilutive impacts, if any, of our Class B common shares, Class M common shares and any other stock-based awards. To the extent our Class B common shares, Class M common shares and/or any other stock-based awards are not dilutive they are excluded. Weighted average shares outstanding - adjusted operating and adjusted operating common shares outstanding assume conversion or settlement of all outstanding items that are able to be converted to or settled in Class A common shares, including the impacts of Class B common shares on a one-for-one basis, the impacts of all Class M common shares net of the conversion price and any other stock-based awards, but excluding any awards for which the exercise or conversion price exceeds the market value of our Class A common shares on the applicable measurement date. For certain historical periods, Class M shares were not included due to issuance restrictions which were contingent upon our IPO. Adjusted operating earnings per share, weighted average shares outstanding - adjusted operating and book value per share excluding AOCI should not be used as a substitute for basic earnings per share - Class A common shares, basic weighted average shares outstanding - Class A or book value per share. However, we believe the adjustments to the shares and equity are significant to gaining an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestment margin is a key measurement of the financial health of our Retirement Services core deferred annuities. Investment margin on our deferred annuities is generated from the excess of our net investment earned rate over the cost of crediting to our policyholders. Net investment earned rate is a key measure of investment returns and cost of crediting is a key measure of the policyholder benefits on our deferred annuities. Net investment earned rate, cost of crediting and investment margin on deferred annuities are non-GAAP measures we use to evaluate the profitability of our core deferred annuities business. We believe measures like net investment earned rate, cost of crediting and investment margin on deferred annuities are effective in analyzing the trends of our core business operations, profitability and pricing discipline. While we believe net investment earned rate, cost of crediting and investment margin on deferred annuities are meaningful financial metrics and enhance our understanding of the underlying profitability drivers of our business, they should not be used as a substitute for net investment income and interest sensitive contract benefits presented under GAAP.\nNet investment earned rate is a non-GAAP measure we use to evaluate the performance of our invested assets that does not correspond to GAAP net investment income. Net investment earned rate is computed as the income from our invested assets divided by the average invested assets for the relevant period. To enhance the ability to analyze these measures across periods, interim periods are annualized. The adjustments to arrive at our net investment earned rate add alternative investment gains and losses, gains and losses related to trading securities for CLOs, net VIE impacts (revenues, expenses and noncontrolling interest) and the change in reinsurance embedded derivatives. We include the income and assets supporting our assumed reinsurance by evaluating the underlying investments of the funds withheld at interest receivables and we include the net investment income from those underlying investments which does not correspond to the GAAP presentation of reinsurance embedded derivatives. We exclude the income and assets supporting business that we have exited through ceded reinsurance including funds withheld agreements. We believe the adjustments for reinsurance provide a net investment earned rate on the assets for which we have economic exposure. Cost of crediting is the interest credited to the policyholders on our fixed strategies as well as the option costs on the index annuity strategies. With respect to FIAs, the cost of providing index credits includes the expenses incurred to fund the annual index credits, and where applicable, minimum guaranteed interest credited. The interest credited on fixed strategies and option costs on indexed annuity strategies are divided by the average account value of our deferred annuities. Our average account values are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to obtain our cost of crediting for such period. To enhance the ability to analyze these measures across periods, interim periods are annualized.\nIn managing our business we analyze invested assets, which do not correspond to total investments, including investments in related parties, as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Invested assets represent the investments that directly back our policyholder liabilities as well as surplus assets. Invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which allows us to analyze the profitability of our investment portfolio. Invested assets includes (a) total investments on the consolidated balance sheets with AFS securities at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) the consolidated VIE assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest, (f) net investment payables and receivables and (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments). Invested assets also excludes assets associated with funds withheld liabilities related to business exited through reinsurance agreements and derivative collateral (offsetting the related cash positions). We include the underlying investments supporting our assumed funds withheld and modco agreements in our invested assets calculation in order to match the assets with the income received. We believe the adjustments for reinsurance provide a view of the assets for which we have economic exposure. Our invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute our net investment earned rate for such period.\nSales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures to understand our business performance as it relates to deposits generated during a specific period of time. Our sales statistics include deposits for fixed rate annuities and FIAs and align with the LIMRA definition of all money paid into an individual annuity, including money paid into new contracts with initial purchase occurring in the specified period and existing contracts with initial purchase occurring prior to the specified period (excluding internal transfers).\nSafe Harbor for Forward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and certain oral statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exercise Act of 1934, as amended.
