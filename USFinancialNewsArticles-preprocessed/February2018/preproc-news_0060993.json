    "text": "18 COMMENTS The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell for the second straight session Wednesday, snapping their 10-month winning streaks as investors continued to weigh the impact of higher interest rates on the nearly nine-year bull market.\nThe Dow closed down 382 points, or 1.5%, at 25028, after earlier rising as much as 166 points. The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.8%, with losses for all three indexes accelerating toward the end of the session. The blue-chip index and the S&P 500 were off about 4% for the month, while the Nasdaq ended down 1.9%.\nAlthough major indexes around the world have recovered a chunk of their losses from a big selloff that sent the S&P 500 and Dow into correction territory on Feb. 8, February was the worst month in at least a year for many stock benchmarks. After a record-setting January, a raft of misfired bets on market calm and interest-rate concerns have helped spark volatility.\nSome investors have said declines are a buying opportunity, with global earnings and the economic backdrop looking stronger than they have in years. Others aren’t so sure, though, fearing a pickup in inflation might encourage central banks to tighten monetary policy more quickly than anticipated.\n“I think what we’re going to see is something of a tug of war between those different forces,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is likely to continue for some time.”\nStocks got a slight boost after the opening bell Wednesday as official data showed that U.S. economic growth had been revised down in the fourth quarter of last year, in line with what economists expected.\nThe revision came after new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s upbeat assessment of the economy a day earlier pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note back near a four-year high and sent the S&P 500 and Dow to their worst day since Feb. 8.\nSome analysts think Mr. Powell’s tenure will be marked by higher market uncertainty . The S&P 500 had 12 trading days with moves of at least 1% in either direction in February, its most since January 2016.\nRoughly 35% of investors now expect that the Fed will raise interest rates at least four times this year, compared with about 28% a week ago, according to CME Group data. The central bank has previously projected three rate increases for this year.\nRelated\nFed’s Powell Says His Economic Outlook Has Improved U.S. Stocks Sell Off After Powell’s Remarks Heard on the Street: Powell’s First Problem Is Taming the Job Market Oil Drops With Stocks as Dollar Gains “People were so certain about the future a few months ago, you now have uncertainty about what growth and inflation will do,” said François Savary, chief investment officer at Geneva-based advisory firm Prime Partners, who has taken some risk off his holdings in recent months. “Suddenly people realize we are moving into the late stage of the economic cycle.”\nOn Wednesday, the 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 2.870% from 2.910%. Yields fall as prices rise.\nA key issue that analysts are grappling with is the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s tax cut. Stock markets initially reacted positively to the new tax bill—which is seen as a boon for corporate earnings—but investors are now treading more carefully. They fear additional spending while unemployment remains at multiyear lows will stoke inflation.\nMr. Powell suggested Tuesday that fiscal stimulus was one of the reasons that could drive the Fed to lift rates faster.\nThis could mean ending a two-year stretch dubbed the “goldilocks phase,” when stocks were boosted by a combination of improving growth and low inflation expectations, said Stéphane Monier, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier Private Bank.\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell made his first Capitol Hill appearance on Tuesday since taking over as Fed chief, where he underscored the improvement in economic prospects. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images “We go to a phase we call ‘overheating,’” added Mr. Monier, who thinks stocks can still deliver sizable returns this year, but with greater bouts of volatility.\nAmong individual stocks, Amazon shares rose less than 0.1% after reports that the e-commerce giant has acquired Ring , a maker of video doorbells, in a deal valued at more than $1 billion.\nLowe’s was among the biggest decliners after the home-improvement chain reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Shares fell 6.5%.\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 declined 0.7%. Utility stocks, considered to be bond proxies because of their steady dividends, were among the worst performers.\nAsian stocks and commodities dropped after China’s official manufacturing survey of purchasing managers fell to a 19-month low and Japanese factory output and retail sales came in weak.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite closed down 1.4% and 1%, respectively, while Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average declined 1.4%.\n—Kenan Machado and Suryatapa Bhattacharya contributed to this article.\nWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com",
