Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream. “Their commitment to our vision to improve the quality of healthcare ensured that the voice of the patient was heard. We are grateful for their contributions to HealthStream and the industry.”\n“Press Ganey is passionate about advancing patient-centered care supported by a high performing workplace,” said Patrick T. Ryan, Chief Executive Officer, Press Ganey Associates. “We have great respect for the partnerships that HealthStream has developed with its patient experience and engagement clients and look forward to adding these organizations to Press Ganey’s transformative platform. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition and to partnering in their mission to deliver safe, high-quality, patient-centered care.”\nHealthStream first entered the PX business in 2005 when it acquired Data Management & Research Company and has grown the business both organically and inorganically since that time. HealthStream expects after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $50.0 million, $6.55 million of which is subject to an indemnification escrow under the terms of the purchase agreement with Press Ganey. The Company anticipates recording a book gain of the sale of its PX business of between $20.0 million to $23.0 million. HealthStream will provide 2018 financial guidance in its fourth quarter 2017 earnings release. Brentwood Capital Advisors LLC acted as HealthStream’s financial advisor and Bass, Berry & Sims acted as HealthStream’s legal advisor in this transaction.\nThe proceeds received from this transaction provide an ideal opportunity for HealthStream to return value directly to its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has declared a $1.00 per common share special cash dividend payable on April 3, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 6, 2018.\nRobert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream, said, “Although we are divesting our PX business to Press Ganey Associates, we are entering into a new strategic collaboration with them. In a separate press release today, we are announcing a new seven-year agreement to provide the technology infrastructure as the exclusive gateway to Press Ganey’s content. We look forward to advancing patient-centered care through this strategic collaboration.”\nAbout HealthStream\nHealthStream (NASDAQ: HSTM) is dedicated to improving patient outcomes through the development of healthcare organizations' greatest asset: their people.
