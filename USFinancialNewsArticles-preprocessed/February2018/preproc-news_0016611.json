    "text": "DUBLIN, Ohio, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) today reported second-quarter fiscal year 2018 revenue of $35.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent. The company also reported a decline in GAAP operating earnings of 26 percent to $399 million and an increase in GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 226 percent to $3.33. GAAP EPS included, among other items, $2.83 of transitional tax benefits related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform discussed below. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 4 percent to $730 million, while non-GAAP EPS increased 13 percent to $1.51. Excluding a $0.20 benefit from a lower tax rate applied to year-to-date non-GAAP pre-tax earnings due to U.S. tax reform, non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.31, a 2 percent decrease from non-GAAP EPS in the prior-year quarter.\n\"Overall, we are very pleased with the quarter,\" said Mike Kaufmann, CEO of Cardinal Health. \"Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed better than expected, and we continue to see strong growth in Specialty Solutions. In the Medical segment, the integration of the Patient Recovery business is progressing as planned, and we are excited by the opportunities in that business. In addition, we remain encouraged by how well our value proposition is resonating with customers.\n\"As we look to the remainder of the year,\" Kaufmann continued, \"we anticipate our overall operating performance to be as expected.\"\nQ2 FY18 summary\nQ2 FY18\nQ2 FY17\nY/Y\nRevenue\n$ 35.2 billion\n$33.1 billion\n6%\nOperating earnings\n$399 million\n$542 million\n(26)%\nNon-GAAP operating\nearnings\n$730 million\n$701 million\n4%\nNet earnings attributable to\nCardinal Health, Inc.\n$1.1 billion\n$324 million\n225%\nNon-GAAP net earnings\nattributable to Cardinal\nHealth, Inc.\n$478 million\n$427 million\n12%\nDiluted EPS attributable to\nCardinal Health, Inc.\n$3.33\n$1.02\n226%\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS\nattributable to Cardinal\nHealth, Inc.\n$1.51\n$1.34\n13%\nU.S. tax reform\nThe enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. tax reform\") has two primary components impacting Cardinal Health's financial results. First, there is a tax benefit included in earnings that reflects the impact of applying a lower federal tax rate to U.S. earnings. Given the company's June 30 fiscal year end, the lower tax rate will be phased in across fiscal years 2018 and 2019, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28 percent for fiscal year 2018. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, the application of this lower tax rate to fiscal year-to-date U.S. earnings resulted in a benefit of $0.20 per share. Any impact on the tax benefit from future changes in the estimated effective tax rate will be reflected in the applicable period of the change in estimate.\nSecond, as part of U.S. tax reform, the company recorded transitional tax benefits totaling $2.83 per share. These benefits reflected the re-measurement of Cardinal Health's net U.S. deferred tax liabilities and assets at the lower federal rate of 21 percent, partially offset by the required U.S. repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. As these tax reform benefits are estimated, the company may record adjustments to these amounts during the next 12 months. These transitional tax benefits are excluded from the company's reported non-GAAP earnings.\nFiscal year 2018 outlook\nThe company does not provide GAAP EPS outlook because it is unable to reliably forecast most of the items that are excluded from GAAP EPS to calculate non-GAAP EPS. These items could cause EPS to differ materially from non-GAAP EPS. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Measures\" following the attached schedules for additional explanation.\nThe company is raising its outlook for fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS to $5.25-$5.50 to reflect $0.40 per share of benefit from the lower federal rate due to U.S. tax reform.\nSegment results\nPharmaceutical segment\nSecond-quarter revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 5 percent to $31.1 billion due to sales growth from pharmaceutical and specialty distribution customers, which was partially offset by the previously announced expiration of a large, mail-order customer contract.\nSegment profit for the quarter decreased 4 percent to $514 million, which was driven by costs related to the company's ongoing investment in its Pharmaceutical IT platform, as well as the company's generics program performance. These were partially offset by strong performance in the Specialty Solutions business.\nQ2 FY18\nQ2 FY17\nY/Y\nRevenue\n$31.1 billion\n$29.7 billion\n5%\nSegment profit\n$514 million\n$537 million\n(4)%\nMedical segment\nSecond-quarter revenue for the Medical segment increased 19 percent to $4 billion, which was driven by contributions from the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business and, to a lesser extent, new and existing customers.\nSegment profit increased 38 percent to $220 million, driven by contributions from the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, which were partially offset by performance in Cardinal Health Branded products, including Cordis. Segment profit for the quarter included the impact of the Patient Recovery business inventory fair value step-up expense. Excluding the $22 million step-up in the quarter, year-over-year Medical segment profit growth was 52 percent.\nQ2 FY18\nQ2 FY17\nY/Y\nRevenue\n$4.0 billion\n$3.4 billion\n19%\nSegment profit\n$220 million\n$159 million\n38%\nAdditional second-quarter and recent highlights\nThe Cardinal Health board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of Cardinal Health common shares, which will expire on Dec. 31, 2020. With this new authorization, Cardinal Health is now authorized to repurchase up to $1.3 billion of its common shares. The company closed its divestiture of its Cardinal Health China distribution business on Feb. 1 with net proceeds of approximately $800 million. Cordis and Medinol announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the EluNIRâ„¢ drug-eluting stent for the treatment of patients with narrowing or blockages to their coronary arteries. The companies also announced treatment of the first patients in the United States with the device following its approval. The company launched the Opioid Action Program , aimed at helping communities in four of the nation's hardest-hit states combat the opioid epidemic. The pilot program will deliver much needed front-line assistance to help prevent opioid abuse and support first responders in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia.\nWebcast\nCardinal Health will host a webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to discuss second-quarter results.

Corporate includes, among other things, LIFO charges/(credits), restructuring and employee severance, amortization and other acquisition-related costs, impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net and certain investment spending that are not allocated to the segments.\nSchedule 7\nCardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nGAAP / Non-GAAP Reconciliation 1\nOperating\nEarnings\nProvision for/\nEarnings\nBefore\n(Benefit from)\nNet\nDiluted\nOperating\nGrowth\nIncome\nIncome\nNet\nEarnings 2\nDiluted\nEPS 2\n(in millions, except per common share amounts)\nEarnings\nRate\nTaxes\nTaxes\nEarnings 2\nGrowth Rate\nEPS 2\nGrowth Rate\nSecond Quarter 2018\nGAAP\n$\n399\n(26)\n%\n$\n317\n$\n(736)\n$\n1,053\n225\n%\n$\n3.33\n226\n%\nRestructuring and employee severance\n21\n21\n(2)\n23\n0.07\nAmortization and other acquisition-related costs\n184\n184\n41\n143\n0.46\nImpairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net\n68\n68\n(43)\n111\n0.35\nLitigation (recoveries)/charges, net\n58\n58\n17\n41\n0.13\nTransitional tax benefit, net 3\nâ€”\nâ€”\n894\n(894)\n(2.83)\nNon-GAAP\n$\n730\n4\n%\n$\n648\n$\n171\n$\n478\n12\n%\n$ 1.51 4\n13\n%\nSecond Quarter 2017\nGAAP\n$\n542\n(4)\n%\n$\n491\n$\n167\n$\n324\nâ€”\n%\n$\n1.02\n4\n%\nLIFO charges/(credits)\n9\n9\n4\n5\n0.02\nRestructuring and employee severance\n7\n7\n2\n5\n0.01\nAmortization and other acquisition-related costs\n115\n115\n39\n76\n0.24\nImpairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net\n9\n9\n3\n6\n0.02\nLitigation (recoveries)/charges, net\n19\n19\n7\n12\n0.04\nNon-GAAP\n$\n701\n(4)\n%\n$\n650\n$\n222\n$\n427\n(1)\n%\n$\n1.34\n3\n%\nOperating\nEarnings\nProvision for/\nEarnings\nBefore\n(Benefit from)\nNet\nDiluted\nOperating\nGrowth\nIncome\nIncome\nNet\nEarnings 2\nDiluted\nEPS 2\n(in millions, except per common share amounts)\nEarnings\nRate\nTaxes\nTaxes\nEarnings 2\nGrowth Rate\nEPS 2\nGrowth Rate\nYear-to-Date 2018\nGAAP\n$\n661\n(39)\n%\n$\n495\n$\n(675)\n$\n1,168\n85\n%\n$\n3.68\n87\n%\nRestructuring and employee severance\n153\n153\n45\n108\n0.34\nAmortization and other acquisition-related costs\n368\n368\n98\n270\n0.85\nImpairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net\n68\n68\n(43)\n111\n0.35\nLitigation (recoveries)/charges, net\n90\n90\n30\n60\n0.19\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nâ€”\n2\n1\n1\nâ€”\nTransitional tax benefit, net 3\nâ€”\nâ€”\n894\n(894)\n(2.82)\nNon-GAAP\n$\n1,340\n(2)\n%\n$\n1,175\n$\n350\n$\n823\nâ€”\n%\n$ 2.60 4\n1\n%\nYear-to-Date 2017\nGAAP\n$\n1,076\n(9)\n%\n$\n985\n$\n351\n$\n633\n(11)\n%\n$\n1.97\n(8)\n%\nLIFO charges/(credits)\n9\n9\n4\n5\n0.02\nRestructuring and employee severance\n16\n16\n6\n10\n0.03\nAmortization and other acquisition-related costs\n237\n237\n79\n158\n0.49\nImpairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, net\n12\n12\n4\n8\n0.02\nLitigation (recoveries)/charges, net\n20\n20\n8\n12\n0.04\nNon-GAAP\n$\n1,370\n(6)\n%\n$\n1,279\n$\n452\n$\n826\n(7)\n%\n$\n2.57\n(4)\n%\n1 For more information on these measures, refer to the Use of Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions schedules.\n2 attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.\n3 Reflects the estimated net transitional benefit from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by the one-time repatriation tax on cash and earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We have not yet completed our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act and, as such, these amounts are provisional estimates and we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to the provisional amounts in future periods.\n4 Non-GAAP EPS for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 includes a $0.20 benefit from applying a lower federal tax rate to our year-to-date U.S. pre-tax non-GAAP earnings. Excluding this benefit, non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.31 and $2.40 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding.\nWe generally apply varying tax rates depending on the item's nature and tax jurisdiction where it is incurred.\nCardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nIn addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated.\nExclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this earnings release for its own and for investors' assessment of the business for the reasons identified below:\nLIFO charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out (\"LIFO\") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. The exclusion of LIFO charges from non-GAAP metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies' financial results.\nRestructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they relate to programs in which we fundamentally change our operations and because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business.\nAmortization and other acquisition-related costs are excluded primarily for consistency with the presentation of the financial results of our peer group companies. Additionally, costs for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets are non-cash amounts, which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. We also exclude other acquisition-related costs, which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity's initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. These costs are also significantly impacted by the timing, complexity and size of acquisitions.\nImpairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and in the case of impairments, are non-cash amounts, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results.\nLitigation recoveries or charges, net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions.\nTransitional tax benefit, net related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is excluded because it results from the one-time impact during the one-year measurement period of a very significant change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and, due to the significant size of the benefit, obscures analysis of trends and financial performance. The transitional tax benefit includes the estimate for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings, both of which are subject to adjustment during an up to 12 month measurement period.\nThe tax effect for each of the items listed above, other than the transitional tax benefit item, is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.\nForward Looking Non-GAAP Measures\nIn this earnings release, the Company presents its outlook for fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS. The Company does not provide EPS outlook, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP EPS, because changes in the items that the Company excludes from EPS to calculate non-GAAP EPS, described above, can be dependent on future events that are less capable of being controlled or reliably predicted by management and are not part of the Company's routine operating activities. Additionally, due to their unpredictability, management does not forecast many of the excluded items for internal use and therefore cannot create or rely on an EPS outlook.\nThe timing and amount of any of the excluded items could significantly impact the Company's fiscal 2018 EPS. Over the past five fiscal years, the excluded items have lowered the Company's EPS from $0.47 to $2.76, which includes a goodwill impairment charge of $2.32 per share related to our Nuclear Pharmacy Services division that we recognized in fiscal 2013. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the excluded items have increased the Company's EPS by $1.82, which includes a $2.83 transitional tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nDefinitions\nGrowth rate calculation: growth rates in this earnings release are determined by dividing the difference between current-period results and prior-period results by prior-period results.\nNon-GAAP operating earnings : operating earnings excluding (1) LIFO charges/(credits), (2) restructuring and employee severance, (3) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (4) impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets and (5) litigation (recoveries)/charges, net.\nNon-GAAP earnings before income taxes : earnings before income taxes excluding (1) LIFO charges/(credits), (2) restructuring and employee severance, (3) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (4) impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, (5) litigation (recoveries)/charges, net and (6) loss on extinguishment of debt.\nNon-GAAP effective tax rate : (provision for income taxes adjusted for (1) LIFO charges/(credits), (2) restructuring and employee severance, (3) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (4) impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, (5) litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, (6) loss on extinguishment of debt, and (7) transitional tax benefit, net) divided by (earnings before income taxes adjusted for the first six items).\nNon-GAAP net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. : net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. excluding (1) LIFO charges/(credits), (2) restructuring and employee severance, (3) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (4) impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, (5) litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, (6) loss on extinguishment of debt, each net of tax, and (7) transitional tax benefit, net.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. : non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cardinal-health-reports-second-quarter-results-for-fiscal-year-2018-300595730.html\nSOURCE Cardinal Health",
