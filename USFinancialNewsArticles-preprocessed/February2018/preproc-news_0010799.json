    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Credium, the company who builds the enterprise blockchain solution for the global credit industry, announces that Cryptocurrency Expert, David Drake (currently Chairman at LDJ Capital) is joining the Credium team as an in-house advisor, guiding the company on its journey to create the next-gen infrastructure for the credit industry and to achieve Credium's goal in revolutionizing the way assets move within the industry. Drake will provide counsel on partnership and business development, marketing and strategy.\n\"I'm very excited to join Credium's team on their mission to make the credit industry more connected, transparent and efficient. I'm familiar with the need first hand, as most of my partners are credit industry's investors, and that includes huge hedge funds, banks, family offices and lending platforms. They're all constantly struggling with the industry's biggest pain-point, which is the fact that buying as east is east, but selling them is limited, costly and heavily intermediated.\nCredium is now building an elegant solution for that exact problem, focusing on Blockchain technology that is designed and custom-made for the credit industry investors. Credium's success will be a big win for everyone in the industry - making the credit business more efficient while attracting more and more investors. This will eventually connect new borrowers with more funding, ultimately driving down rates, creating a more accessible credit market and contributing to global growth\".\nGilad Woltsovich, Credium's Co founder and CEO adds: \"Although credit is the world's most important financial engine, its investors still suffer from this major pain-point - selling their credit assets outside the securitization markets. More than $8 Trillion of non securitized debt assets are the initial market of our play and we're very excited by the fact that both respected investors and blockchain experts, such as Mr. Drake, will be supporting our solution\".\nAbout Credium\nFounded in 2016 and located in NYC, SF and TLV, Credium is the world's first enterprise blockchain solution design for the global credit industry. Its solution will allow any credit entity holding and buying non-securitized debt to accurately price and exchange their credit assets in a Blockchain based marketplace, revolutionizing the way assets move within the credit industry. The Company is led by a team of serial entrepreneurs from the Fintech and Blockchain industries and will launch its TGE at Q2 of 2018.\nAbout David Drake\nDavid Drake is the Founder and Chairman at LDJ Capital - a multi-family office, managing and dealing various funds worldwide with an estimate of over $1.5 Trillion in assets. LDJ Capital also maintains over 50 global directors and family office partners.\nMore recently, Mr. Drake has also been seen as a leader in the Cryptocurrency field. Drake recognized the value of digital assets, at a time when the financial community was avoiding it completely. His journey began in 2011, during a collaboration between Drake and the JOBS Act. The two created new ground rules and laws, underlying all fundraising in the U.S. for all ICOs. His Crypto hedge funds hold Crypto, ICOs, and Fintech equity as seed investments, in order to help the create a new currency via ICOs. His company also offers bridge financing to seed upcoming ICO's.\nDavid Drake was born in Sweden and is fluent in six languages. He holds an MBA in Finance and an MA in International Law and Economics from George Washington University in DC, where he was awarded the Wallenberg Scholarship for academic merit.\nFor more details contact:\nDan Eblagon, Co founder // CMO // Dan@credium.org\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fintech-investor-and-blockchain-advocate-david-drake-joins-crediums-advisory-board-300594043.html\nSOURCE Credium",
