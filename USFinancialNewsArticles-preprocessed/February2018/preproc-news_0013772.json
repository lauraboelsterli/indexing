In 2017, we reported record net sales, gross margin, and operating income.\"\n\"We are particularly encouraged by the strong results we achieved in Europe-direct in 2017, completing a third consecutive year of double-digit constant-currency net sales growth and continued improvement in operating margin. A relentless focus also drove 2017 net sales growth in the United States, with expansion of direct-to-consumer (DTC) offsetting challenges in wholesale resulting from the effect of bankruptcies, liquidations and stores closures.\"\nBoyle concluded, \"We look forward to a year of continued revenue and earnings growth in 2018 as well as continued execution of our strategic priorities. Our 2018 outlook anticipates revenue growth of 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent, and non-GAAP revenue growth of 4 percent to 6 percent. We anticipate diluted earnings per share of $2.88 to $2.98, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.17 to $3.27, driven by growth in the Columbia, SOREL, and prAna brands, and in all four of our geographic regions.\nWith record cash and short-term investment balances of $768.1 million exiting 2017, and no long-term debt, we have the flexibility to adapt our business as our major markets continue to evolve. It is from this position of strength that we are investing in our strategic priorities to:\ndrive brand awareness and sales growth through increased, focused demand creation investments; enhance consumer experience and digital capabilities in all our channels and geographies; expand and improve global DTC operations with supporting processes and systems; and invest in our people and optimize our organization across our portfolio of brands.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\n(All comparisons are between fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016, unless otherwise noted).\nNet Sales\nConsolidated fourth quarter net sales increased 8 percent to a record $776.0 million with growth in all regions.\nGeographies (See \"Geographical Net Sales\" table below)\nU.S. net sales increased 8 percent to $492.6 million, reflecting growth in DTC and benefits from a shift in the timing of shipments of Fall 2017 advance wholesale orders from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.

Full year 2016 net income totaled $191.9 million, or $2.72 per diluted share.\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow and Share Repurchase Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated $341.1 million in operating cash flow, invested $53.4 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of $50.9 million, and repurchased 665,095 shares for a total of $35.5 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and short-term investments totaled $768.1 million, compared to $551.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, $378.4 million of cash and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries where a repatriation of those funds to the United States would have resulted in significant tax expense before the enactment of the TCJA.\nIn light of increased cash balances, strong cash flow generation in 2017, and our expectation under revised U.S. tax laws to repatriate approximately $200 million of cash currently held in foreign jurisdictions, the company has chosen to provide additional insight into priorities for use of cash, found in the \"CFO Commentary on Fourth Quarter, Full Year 2017 Financial Results and 2018 Financial Outlook\", available on the company's investor relations website: http://investor.columbia.com/results.cfm .\nConsolidated inventories decreased 6 percent to $457.9 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $488.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $137.9 million remained available under the current share repurchase authorization, which does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares or to acquire shares over any specified period of time.\nDividend\nThe board of directors authorized a 16 percent increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.19 to $0.22 per share, payable on March 22, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018.\nFull Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nAll projections related to anticipated future results are forward-looking in nature and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially. Projections are predicated on normal seasonal weather globally. In addition, our 2018 outlook assumes that current macro and market conditions in key markets do not worsen.\nThe company's annual net sales are weighted more heavily toward the Fall/Winter season, while operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year, resulting in a highly seasonal profitability pattern weighted toward the second half of the year.\nThe company currently expects 2018 net sales growth of approximately 5.5 to 7.5 percent, compared with 2017 net sales of $2.47 billion. The company expects non-GAAP net sales growth of approximately 4.0 to 6.0 percent, which excludes approximately $40 million in net sales associated with changes in revenue accounting standards.\nThe company expects full year 2018 gross margin to improve by up to 140 basis points and non-GAAP gross margin to improve by up to 60 basis points, excluding an approximately $40 million benefit to gross profit associated with changes in revenue accounting standards.\nThe company expects SG&A expenses to increase at a rate faster than net sales, resulting in approximately 170 to 190 basis point of SG&A expense deleverage, and non-GAAP SG&A expense deleverage of approximately 40 to 50 basis points, excluding approximately $40 million in SG&A expenses associated with changes in revenue accounting standards, and approximately $27 million in Project CONNECT program expenses and discrete costs.\nBased on the above assumptions, the company expects 2018 operating income between approximately $263 million and $273 million, and non-GAAP operating income between approximately $290 million and $300 million, resulting in operating margin between approximately 10.1 percent and 10.3 percent, and non-GAAP operating margin between approximately 11.3 percent and 11.5 percent.\nThe change in revenue accounting standards is expected to have a 15 to 20 basis point negative effect on reported operating margin rate for 2018, but no effect on reported operating income.\nThe company expects an estimated full-year effective income tax rate of approximately 22 percent, which reflects a lower U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA and may be materially affected by further refinement of our 2017 TCJA provisional estimates as well as changes in our geographic mix of pre-tax income and other discrete events that may occur during the year.\nThe company expects 2018 net income between approximately $203 million and $211 million, and non-GAAP net income between approximately $224 million and $231 million, or diluted earnings per share between approximately $2.88 and $2.98, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $3.17 and $3.27.\nWith respect to our 2018 financial outlook, non-GAAP financial measures exclude net sales of approximately $40 million, with an offsetting increase in SG&A expenses of approximately $40 million related to changes in revenue accounting standards, as well as Project CONNECT program expenses and discrete costs of approximately $27 million, $21 million net of tax, or $0.29 per diluted share.\nA more detailed version of the company's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and 2018 outlook can be found in the \"CFO Commentary on Fourth Quarter, Full Year 2017 Financial Results and 2018 Financial Outlook\", available on the company's investor relations website: http://investor.columbia.com/results.cfm .\nCFO's Commentary on Fourth Quarter, Full Year 2017 Financial Results and 2018 Financial Outlook Available Online\nAt approximately 4:15 p.m. ET today, a commentary by Jim Swanson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reviewing the company's fourth quarter, full year 2017 financial results and 2018 financial outlook will be furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and published on the company's website at http://investor.columbia.com/results.cfm . Analysts and investors are encouraged to review this commentary prior to participating in the conference call.\nConference Call\nThe company will host a conference call on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET to review its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and 2018 outlook. Dial 877-407-9205 to participate. The call will also be webcast live on the Investor Relations section of the company's website at http://investor.columbia.com where it will remain available until approximately February 8, 2019.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nSince Columbia Sportswear Company is a global company, the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. To supplement financial information reported in accordance with GAAP, the company discloses constant-currency net sales information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a framework to assess how the business performed excluding the effects of changes in the exchange rates used to translate net sales generated in foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. The company calculates constant-currency net sales by translating net sales in foreign currencies for the current period into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates that were in effect during the comparable period of the prior year. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional and useful way of viewing an aspect of our operations that, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results, provides a more comprehensive understanding of our business and operations. In particular, investors may find the non-GAAP measures useful by reviewing our net sales results without the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management's internal comparisons to our historical net sales results and comparisons to competitors' net sales results.\nAdditionally, this document includes references to other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude program expenses, discrete costs and associated tax effects related to Project CONNECT and TCJA-related income tax expense. The related tax effects of program expenses and discrete costs related to Project CONNECT were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for applicable jurisdictions. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures in our 2018 financial outlook exclude increased net sales and offsetting increased SG&A expenses related to changes in revenue accounting standards that took effect beginning January 1, 2018. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable useful and meaningful comparisons of our operating performance from period to period because they exclude the effects of the aforementioned items above that may not be indicative of our core operating results.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, including constant-currency net sales, should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See \"Supplemental Financial Information\" tables included below. The non-GAAP financial measures and constant-currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding anticipated results, net sales and net sales growth, gross margin, operating expenses, licensing income, operating income, operating margins, net income, earnings per share, income tax rates and the effects of tax reform, SG&A expenses, including deleverage and SG&A expenses associated with changes in revenue accounting standards, and Project CONNECT program expenses and discrete costs, projected growth or decline in specific geographies and brands, the effect of changes in revenue accounting standards on our financial results, and our ability to adapt our business and realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in our strategic priorities.

The related tax effects of these charges were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for applicable jurisdictions.\n(3) In fiscal year 2018, the Company will adopt new revenue accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASC 606), which changes the presentation of fees paid to third parties in conjunction with certain concession-based retail arrangements. These fees have historically been recognized in net sales, and will be classified as a component of selling, general and administrative expense upon adopting ASC 606. As a result, the Company's non-GAAP Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook adjusts for the approximate $40 million revenue gross-up and offsetting $40 million increase in selling, general and administrative expense resulting from the adoption ASC 606 to enable meaningful comparisons of our operating performance compared to fiscal year 2017.\n(4) The Company's Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook anticipates an estimated full year effective income tax rate of approximately 22 percent, which may be affected by further refinement of our 2017 provisional TCJA estimates as well as changes in our geographic mix of pre-tax income and other discrete events that may occur during the year.\nCOLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY Supplemental Financial Information Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Constant-currency Net Sales Growth (In millions, except percentage changes) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Adjust for Constant- Constant- Reported Foreign currency Reported Reported currency Net Sales Currency Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales\nNet Sales 2017 Translation 2017 (5) 2016 % Change % Change (5) Geographical Net Sales: United States $ 492.6 $ — $ 492.6 $ 455.4 8% 8% LAAP 154.3 1.4 155.7 151.9 2% 3% EMEA 83.5 (3.5 ) 80.0 70.1 19% 14% Canada 45.6 (2.1 ) 43.5 40.0 14% 9% Total $ 776.0 $ (4.2 ) $ 771.8 $ 717.4 8% 8% Brand Net Sales: Columbia $ 602.4 $ (2.8 ) $ 599.6 $ 552.3 9% 9% SOREL 113.9 (1.3 ) 112.6 103.8 10% 8% prAna 30.4 — 30.4 28.2 8% 8% Mountain Hardwear 28.4 (0.2 ) 28.2 31.3 (9)% (10)% Other 0.9 0.1 1.0 1.8 (50)% (44)% Total $ 776.0 $ (4.2 ) $ 771.8 $ 717.4 8% 8% Categorical Net Sales: Apparel, Accessories and Equipment $ 578.3 $ (2.7 ) $ 575.6 $ 535.8 8% 7% Footwear 197.7 (1.5 ) 196.2 181.6 9% 8% Total $ 776.0 $ (4.2 ) $ 771.8 $ 717.4 8% 8% (5) Constant-currency net sales information is a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar between comparable reporting periods.
