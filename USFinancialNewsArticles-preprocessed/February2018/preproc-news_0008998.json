    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 8:26 AM / Updated 11 minutes ago Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong walks free after court ruling Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s highest court on Tuesday said three young leaders of the city’s pro-democracy movement, including Joshua Wong, could walk free, in a stark reversal of an earlier ruling. \nThe decision was made by a panel of five judges on Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal, led by Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma. Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow had served roughly two months in jail before they were granted bail last November.
