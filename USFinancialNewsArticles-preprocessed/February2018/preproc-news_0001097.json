    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. The hot-take machines whirred into action Monday after reports suggested PepsiCo was about to launch “lady Doritos.” Speaking on the Freakonomics podcast in January, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi had suggested some ladies “don’t like to crunch their chips too loudly in public” and want to be able to fit their snacks into their dainty purses. But on Monday, seeking to put out the social media blazes , PepsiCo issued a statement saying, “The reporting on a specific Doritos product for female consumers is inaccurate. We already have Doritos for women—they’re called Doritos.”\nSlip ‘n’ Slide Don’t think we’re done with the Super Bowl yet! The ratings are now in. This weekend’s game was the least-watched football championship since 2009, marking a 7.1% drop from last year to 103.4 million viewers , according to Nielsen. This year’s game was still the 10th-most-watched program in U.S. television history, however, showing why it’s such a draw for advertisers, who shelled out more than $5 million for 30 seconds of commercial airtime. Kantar Media estimates NBC generated $414 million in ad revenue , slightly down from the $419 million last year’s Super Bowl brought in (although that game went into overtime).\n--Key Chart--\nThe record Super Bowl audience was set at 114.4 million when the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in 2015 on NBC. (Nielsen says out-of-home viewing numbers for this year’s Super Bowl, which will capture the many people who watched in bars and restaurants, are coming Thursday.)\nAlexa, Which Ad Won the Super Bowl? On the ads front, marketing experts have warned viewers could become fatigued over time with ads trumpeting social-advocacy messages —a key theme of many of Sunday’s commercials, CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports. Ad Age and Morning Consult polled marketing professionals about the entertainment value and perceived effectiveness of this year’s Super Bowl crop and found comedy won the day, with Amazon’s “Alexa Loses Her Voice” grabbing the top spot . The Amazon ad also appeared atop USA Today’s annual Ad Meter , which sees thousands of consumers voting for their favorite national big game ads each year. Viewers gave the spot an average rating of 7.18 out of 10. The ad was created by Lucky Generals, a small U.K.-based agency that was founded in 2013 and has just under 70 staff members. (Omnicom’s TBWA Worldwide acquired a majority stake in the agency last year.) Lucky Generals co-founder Andy Nairn tells me its analysis of the past 30 years of Ad Meter winners suggests Lucky Generals is the first non-U.S. agency to clinch the top spot, and the youngest, too. Super Bowl MVP: Not bad for a toddler.\nThe past 5 USA Today Ad Meter winners and how old their agencies were at the time (with thanks to Lucky Generals for the data)\n2017 - Kia (David & Goliath, 18 at the time)\n2016 - Hyundai (Innocean, 7)\n2015 - Budweiser (Anomaly, 11)\n2014 - Budweiser (Anomaly, 10)\n2013 - Budweiser (Anomaly, 9)\nWatch Me Now. Work, Work Facebook has commissioned dozens of shows from big-name publishers to appear on its dedicated Watch video section. The idea was to create “anchor content” to kick-start the section, but the long-term goal was to build a more sustainable revenue share model for video, the company’s executives said on a May earnings call last year. Now CNBC reports Facebook is speaking to media agencies about making Watch more like YouTube . Instead of just buying upfront rights to shows, Facebook wants to build more of an ad-funded system, where more individual creators can upload their own shows and earn a cut of the ad revenue their content generates. Advertisers considering Watch surely will have brand safety questions, given YouTube’s troubles last year. To that end, sources tell CNBC Facebook is considering letting advertisers buy ads against specific shows, similar to how they advertise on TV, and it’s also thinking about creating a Google Preferred-like tied advertising system.\n(Vid)Con Air Something of a video theme today. Variety reports Viacom is in talks to acquire VidCon , the huge annual California convention that draws tens of thousands of big-name video creators and their young fans. The event, founded in 2010 by YouTube’s “Vlogbrothers” John and Hank Green, has since expanded to Europe and Australia and is increasingly drawing involvement from marketers and big-name media and movie companies . Acquiring VidCon would assist in Viacom’s pursuit of ever-digital youth audiences and bolster its influencer marketing offering to advertisers. You may recall Viacom acquired influencer marketing firm WhoSay last month, which the media company is using to scale its branded content operation.\nBest of the rest The Justice Department’s move to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner is putting the brakes on other big media deals—to the benefit of tech companies, which are free to spend billions on original content. [ CNBC ]\nNBCUniversal and BuzzFeed are partnering to create a parenting channel called Playfull, which launches Tuesday on Facebook. NBCUniversal has invested $400 million in BuzzFeed since 2015. [ Digiday ]\nA poll of senior U.S. ad buyers conducted by financial services firm Cowen and Company found Google search is ranked in the highest regard when it comes to return on investment among digital platforms. [ EMarketer ]\nA handy guide to Amazon’s ad business. [ AdExchanger ]\nGoogle says only around 1% of publishers aren’t compliant with the advertising standards that will govern which ads the new version of the Chrome web browser will block when it launches next week. [ Axios ]\nRussian search giant Yandex has built in ad blocking by default to the latest version of its browser. The filter won’t block ads that meet IAB Russia’s guidelines.
