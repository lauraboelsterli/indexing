    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tahoe Resources Inc. (\"Tahoe\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: THO, NYSE: TAHO) today announced solid financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company's balance sheet remains strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $125.7 million at December 31, 2017 and very little debt.\nRon Clayton, President and CEO of Tahoe, commented: \"Tahoe achieved record gold production of 445,900 ounces in 2017, realizing the high end of its annual gold production guidance range of 400,000 to 450,000 ounces. The strong gold production for the year was driven primarily by La Arena. The outstanding performance from the gold business in 2017 underscores the increasingly meaningful contribution of the gold segment to the overall financial performance of the Company. Despite the challenges in Guatemala during the second half of 2017, I am very pleased to report earnings of $81.8 million for the year, or $0.26 per share. Looking forward, I expect 2018 will be a pivotal year for the Company. We remain optimistic that based on legal precedent, the Guatemalan Constitutional Court will issue a favorable ruling reinstating the Escobal mining license. We are focused on a positive resolution at the Casillas roadblock, located 16 kilometers from the mine, which, in conjunction with a favorable court ruling, will put us in position to resume operations at Escobal. In the meantime, we are executing on our strategy to complete our two near-term development projects in Canada and Peru by late summer, which will position us to achieve our target of 500,000 ounces of gold production in 2019.\"\nKey Financial and Operating Results\n$ millions unless otherwise indicated\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenue\n$\n117.7\n$\n189.4\n$\n733.6\n$\n784.5\nEarnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) (4)\n$\n(18.0)\n$\n0.3\n$\n81.8\n$\n117.9\nEarnings (loss) per share\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n—\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.41\nAdjusted earnings (loss) (1)(4)\n$\n(17.7)\n$\n18.4\n$\n84.0\n$\n180.4\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n18.1\n$\n107.8\n$\n234.3\n$\n249.5\nCash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital\n$\n24.0\n$\n74.7\n$\n287.0\n$\n385.9\nSilver production (moz)\n—\n4.8\n9.9\n21.3\nGold production (koz)\n105.8\n119.9\n445.9\n385.2\nTotal cash cost per silver oz produced ($/oz) (1)(2)\n$\n—\n$\n6.48\n$\n6.15\n$\n5.84\nAISC per silver oz produced ($/oz) (1)(2)\n$\n—\n$\n9.76\n$\n8.91\n$\n8.06\nTotal cash cost per gold oz produced ($/oz) (1)(2)\n$\n648\n$\n594\n$\n641\n$\n620\nAISC per gold oz produced ($/oz) (1)(2)\n$\n1,033\n$\n945\n$\n973\n$\n943\nSustaining capital (incl. capitalized drilling)\n$\n32.1\n$\n41.9\n$\n124.0\n$\n118.4\nProject capital\n$\n29.9\n$\n19.2\n$\n99.1\n$\n93.0\nExploration expense\n$\n3.9\n$\n6.9\n$\n18.5\n$\n14.4\nCorporate G&A (3)\n$\n11.0\n$\n9.5\n$\n45.8\n$\n47.5\nWeighted average shares outstanding (basic, in millions)\n313.19\n311.65\n312.80\n289.73\n(1)\nSee \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this press release.\n(2)\nTotal cash costs and AISC are presented net of by-product credits; costs per ounce silver are through June 30, 2017 as cessation of mining activities occurred in June at the Escobal mine.\n(3)\nCorporate G&A includes non-cash, stock-based compensation.\n(4)\nIncludes adjusted depreciation for Peru mines. See segmented operational results in MD&A.\nQ4 2017 Summary & Highlights:\nStrong operating and financial results from gold segments – Q4 2017 gold production totaled 105.8 thousand ounces. Production and costs in Q4 2017 reflected strong results at all of the Company's gold mines, with total cash costs and AISC of $648 and $1,033 per ounce, respectively.\nQ4 2017 earnings were impacted by Escobal and a one-time non-cash depreciation charge – Q4 2017 earnings were negatively impacted by the cessation of mining activities at the Escobal mine which resulted in no material revenue for the quarter from the mine and care and maintenance costs of $11.1 million ($0.04 per share) and a one-time pre-tax $11 million cumulative adjustment ($0.04 per share) during the quarter to true-up the depletion related to the purchase price on the acquisition of the Peruvian mines in 2015. Except for these items, reported earnings for the quarter would have been positive on the strength of the gold segment alone.\nNear-term expansion projects remain on time and in-line with guidance – Both major expansion projects - the Shahuindo crushing and agglomeration expansion and the Bell Creek shaft project - remained on track during the quarter and within their respective estimated total project spend of $80 million each.\n2017 Summary & Highlights:\nRecord gold production of 445.9 thousand ounces – The Company achieved record gold production of 445.9 thousand ounces in 2017, achieving the high end of the annual gold production guidance range of 400,000 to 450,000 ounces, which was revised upward in September 2017. The strong gold production for the year was driven primarily by La Arena in Peru, which exceeded its guidance due to on-going positive mine plan reconciliation with both higher grade and additional ore tonnes mined. The outstanding performance from the gold business in 2017 underscores the increasingly meaningful contribution of the gold segment to the overall financial performance of the Company.\nGold operations met or exceeded 2017 revised guidance including lower costs\n$ millions unless otherwise indicated\nInitial 2017\nGuidance\nRevised 2017\nGuidance\n2017 Year-end Actual\nGold Production (koz)\n375 - 425\n400 - 450\n445.9\nTotal cash cost per gold oz produced ($/oz) (1)(2)\n$\n700 - 750\n$\n650 - 700\n$\n641\nAISC per gold oz produced ($/oz) (1)(2)\n$\n1,150 - 1,250\n$\n1,050 - 1,150\n$\n973\nSustaining Capital (incl. capitalized drilling)\n$\n125 - 137\n$\n100 - 135\n$\n124\nProject Capital\n$\n150 -175\n$\n100 - 115\n$\n99\nExploration Expense\n$\n35 - 43\n$\n14 - 20\n$\n19\nCorporate G&A (3)\n$\n45 - 55\n$\n45 - 55\n$\n46\n(1)\nSee \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this press release.\n(2)\nTotal cash costs and AISC are presented net of by-product credits.\n(3)\nCorporate G&A includes non-cash, stock-based compensation.\nSilver production reflects suspension at Escobal – The Company produced 9.9 million ounces of silver during 2017 at total cash costs of $6.15 per silver ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $8.91 per silver ounce. Silver production reflects the impact of the Escobal suspension, where no production has been recorded since July 2017.\nPositive cash flow and earnings – Cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in working capital totaled $287.0 million for 2017, despite the ongoing suspension at Escobal in Guatemala. The Company generated positive earnings of $81.8 million, or $0.26 per share, for 2017. Earnings reflected the impact of the suspension at the Escobal mine, where no material revenues have been recorded since July 2017, and $24.9 million ($0.08 per share) in care and maintenance costs have been incurred during the second half of the year.\nShahuindo expansion remains on track – Construction of leach Pad 2B continued in Q4 2017 as planned and is scheduled to be placed into production in Q3 2018. Commissioning of the 12,000 tpd crushing and agglomeration circuit was substantially completed in early February 2018 and the production ramp-up was initiated. Construction of the 24,000 tpd circuit has begun with commissioning of the full 36,000 tpd plant scheduled for mid-year 2018. Of the $80 million guidance for the crushing and agglomeration circuit, approximately $48.8 million has been spent through December 31, 2017. The project remains on schedule and within guidance.\nBell Creek shaft expansion in-line with guidance – The Bell Creek shaft project remains on track for commissioning in mid-year and on track with its $80 million budget. Excavation of the third and final pilot raise from the shaft bottom is complete and slashing of this raise to the final dimensions has begun. Pilot raises for the underground ore and waste bins are complete and slashing of the raises is underway. Surface construction is focused primarily on the hoist room and headframe. Mechanical installation of the hoists started in early February and the headframe civil work is progressing with a projected start of steel installation by the end of Q1 2018. Of the $80 million guidance for the Bell Creek shaft project, approximately $51.6 million has been spent to December 31, 2017. The project remains on schedule and within guidance.\nStrong cash position with $125.7 million at year-end – Despite the on-going interruption of mining operations at Escobal, Tahoe ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $125.7 million.\nStrengthened Financial Position with Amended $175 Million Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 16th 2018, the Company closed its revised revolving credit facility with its bank syndicate. The Company now has access to a $175 million revolving credit facility plus a $25 million accordion feature, for total access of $200 million in capital. The revised facility matures on July 19, 2021. This facility is structured on the strength of Tahoe's gold business alone, and access to the facility does not rely on, nor have covenants related to, the operation of Escobal. The Bank of Nova Scotia and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. are the co-leads for the facility.\nIn addition, on February 20, 2018, the Company repaid the $35 million in debt in Peru that was due on April 9, 2018 from existing cash balances. Subsequent to this repayment, the company has no debt outstanding and approximately $8 million in capital leases.\n2018 Gold Guidance and Long-term Outlook\nTahoe Resources' gold guidance for 2018 and multi-year gold outlook is provided below. While Tahoe expects the Guatemalan Constitutional Court to rule in favor of reinstating the Escobal mining license based on existing legal precedent, the Company will not be providing guidance or long-term outlook for silver production or costs until steady operations at Escobal resume and the export credential is issued.\n2018 Gold Guidance by Mine\nProduction\n(gold - koz)\nCash Costs\n($/oz)\nAll-in\nSustaining\nCosts\n($/oz)\nProject Capital\n($ millions)\nSustaining\nCapital\n($ millions)\nExploration\n($ millions)\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nLa Arena\n160\n185\n650\n700\n950\n1,050\n—\n—\n35\n40\n1\n2\nShahuindo\n80\n110\n750\n800\n1,050\n1,100\n80\n100\n15\n20\n8\n10\nTimmins Mines\n160\n175\n800\n850\n1,050\n1,150\n45\n50\n40\n55\n6\n12\nGold total\n400\n475\n725\n775\n1,000\n1,100\n125\n150\n90\n115\n15\n25\n(1)\nSee \"Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\" and \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this press release.\n(2)\nAll per ounce costs are based on gold ounces recovered.\n(3)\nThe top end of the gold production range includes approximatively 5 thousand ounces from Escobal.\n(4)\nNumbers may not calculate due to rounding.\nKey Highlights for 2018 Guidance:\n2018 gold production guidance has shifted downward by 25,000 ounces at either end of the range compared to the initial 2018 guidance provided in January 2017. This change reflects the higher risk of the growth profile related to the timing of the commissioning of the Bell Creek shaft project mid-year and the ramp up of the Shahuindo expansion to 36,000 tonnes per day by the end of 2018. 2018 guidance is also impacted by the initial 144 Gap Mineral Reserve estimate issued on September 21, 2017 which, although increasing the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Timmins West Mine from 233,000 to 738,000 ounces of gold, was at a lower grade than expected. The production forecasts at Shahuindo and Timmins are weighted to the second half of 2018, with the commissioning of the complete crushing and agglomeration circuit at Shahuindo and the Bell Creek shaft expected to begin in the third quarter. The operational ramp up to 36,000 tpd and the completion of the Shahuindo expansion is expected by the end of 2018. Production at La Arena is also weighted in the second half of the year. 2018 will be a transition year and the Company anticipates seeing higher total cash costs in 2018 than we saw in 2017 at a range of $725 to $775 per ounce. This increase is being driven by the lower grade in the 144 Gap deposit, along with more ounces coming from Shahuindo, both of which have higher cost profiles than La Arena. As expected, the lower cost La Arena will make up a smaller proportion of total production in 2018 than in previous years which will also impact costs. Tahoe is continuously focused on finding ways to increase the profitability of all its mines and lower costs, however this focus is a priority in 2018 at the Timmins operations given the lower grade profile. Higher unit costs per ounce of gold produced in 2018 are expected as a result of lower anticipated production levels at La Arena, the increased proportion of production from Shahuindo, as well as a stronger forecasted Canadian dollar impacting the Timmins operations. 2018 reflects peak project capital expenditure levels to complete the two near-term expansion projects - with the Shahuindo expansion (including the 36,000 tpd crushing and agglomeration plant) accounting for approximately 65% of the total and the remainder the Bell Creek shaft project. Project capital at the Shahuindo expansion is associated with the completion of the crushing and agglomeration plant, process plant expansion, leach Pad 2B (stated as sustaining capital in previously issued guidance), waste dumps and the power substation. Project capital in Canada relates primarily to the Bell Creek shaft and tailings pond expansion. Approximately $60 million in project capital was deferred from 2017 and is now expected to be spent in 2018. Despite this shift in timing of spending, both projects remain within their original guidance. Sustaining capital expenditures in 2018 are targeted at $90 to $115 million for the gold operations. Canada will account for approximately 45% of total gold sustaining capital expenditures in 2018, while La Arena is approximately 30%. A significant proportion of these expenditures relate to the underground drilling and development in Canada, as well as leach pad and waste dump construction at La Arena. Exploration expenses (excluding capitalized drilling in the mines) are anticipated to be between $15 and $25 million in 2018, including drilling programs designed to expand Mineral Resources at existing operations and to advance longer-term projects in Canada and Peru.\n2018 gold cost guidance was calculated based on certain commodity and currency assumptions. The table below includes a sensitivity of the impact of a change in these assumptions on total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs:\n2018 Guidance\nChange (+/-)\nImpact (+/-)\nCommodity assumptions\nSilver ($/oz)\n$17.50\n$1.00/oz\nnil\nDiesel (US$/gal)\n$2.40\n10%\n$6/oz gold\nCurrency assumptions\nCAD/USD\n$1.20\n1%\n$9/oz gold\nPeruvian sol/USD\n3.3\n1%\n$2/oz gold\nLong-term outlook\nAs outlined below, the Company is on track to achieve annual gold production of over a half million ounces in 2019. At that time, total cash costs net of by-product credits and all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced are also projected to improve.\nMulti-Year Gold Guidance\n2018\n2019\n2020\nGold ounces produced (000's)\n400-475\n500-550\n500-550\nTotal cash costs per ounce gold produced net of by-product credits\n$\n725-775\n$\n650-700\n$\n650-750\nAll-in sustaining costs per ounce gold produced net of by-product credits\n$\n1,000-1,100\n$\n950-1,050\n$\n900-1,000\nTotal corporate G&A ($millions)\n$\n45-55\n$\n45-55\n$\n45-55\nExploration ($millions)\n$\n15-25\n$\n15-25\n$\n15-25\nSustaining capital - gold ($millions)\n$\n90-115\n$\n100-125\n$\n80-100\nProject capital ($millions)\n$\n125-150\n$\n50-70\n$\n0-10\n(1)\nSee \"Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\" and \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this press release.\n(2)\nCommodity and currency price assumptions used in the calculation of 2019 and 2020 guidance are the same as those used in the calculation of 2018 guidance. Refer to the \"2018 Guidance by mine\" section of this press release.\n(3)\nThe top end of the gold production range includes approximately 5,000 ounces from Escobal in 2018.\n(4)\nAll per ounce costs are based on gold ounces recovered.\n(5)\nGuidance does not include inflation adjustments.\nKey Highlights for Long-term Outlook:\nThe Company anticipates that a favorable Constitutional Court ruling would enable it to resume operations at the Escobal mine and that, over a period of 3 to 6 months, it will be able to ramp up its annual silver production to 2014-2016 levels. The Company's goal is to reach and sustain 18-21 million ounces of silver production and 500-550 thousand ounces of gold production annually. Meeting this goal for gold production depends on exploration success in delivering additional resources and reserves to replace those mined annually. Sustaining capital expenditures for the gold segment are targeted at $90 to $115 million for 2018, $100 - $125 million in 2019 and $80 to $100 million in 2020. Once production is restored to normal levels at the Escobal mine, the Company anticipates annual sustaining capital expenditures for the silver segment targeted at $30 to $40 million. Although Tahoe expects to continue its evaluation of the La Arena II project with the intent of advancing the project to the prefeasibility or feasibility stage at the appropriate time, the timeline and estimated capital required to progress the project to the next stage are under review. As such, no additional spending has been considered in the multi-year guidance. Until the Company decides to commence the development of any significant new projects, growth capital expenditures will be substantially complete in 2019. Exploration expenditures are likely to remain between $15 and $25 million annually over the next two years as the Company works to advance its exploration targets to increase gold Mineral Resources and to convert existing gold Mineral Resources into Mineral Reserves. With exploration programs being largely success driven, future expenditure targets will be developed following completion of 2018 drilling programs.\nMineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Update\nOn February 15, the Company released updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves effective January 1, 2018, including updated resources for the La Arena II project and increased resources and reserves at Shahuindo that resulted from exploration successes at the La Chilca, San Jose, San Lorenzo and El Sauce areas proximal to the current Shahuindo pit. The Company's updated Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources are summarized by the following tables:\nTOTAL MINERAL RESERVES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018\nReserve Classification\nGold\n(koz)\nSilver\n(koz)\nCopper\n(mlbs)\nLead\n(ktonnes)\nZinc\n(ktonnes)\nProven\n1,356\n54,288\n0\n26\n44\nProbable\n2,366\n233,345\n0\n170\n276\nProven + Probable\n3,721\n287,633\n0\n196\n320\nTOTAL MINERAL RESOURCES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018\nResource Classification\nGold\n(koz)\nSilver\n(koz)\nCopper\n(mlbs)\nLead\n(ktonnes)\nZinc\n(ktonnes)\nMeasured\n3,101\n74,911\n1,279\n33\n58\nIndicated\n10,904\n327,642\n4,511\n224\n369\nMeasured + Indicated\n14,005\n402,552\n5,790\n256\n427\nInferred\n8,816\n57,726\n349\n4\n8\n(1)\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n(2)\nPlease refer to the Technical Disclosure of this press release for inputs and assumptions used for the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates for each deposit.\nFor full details, please refer to the February 15, 2018 press release and available on the Company's website at www.tahoeresources.com . Details of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates for each operating mine and for each exploration/development project are included in the Technical Information section of this press release and in the MD&A.\nLa Arena II Preliminary Economic Assessment\nOn February 20th, the Company released a new NI 43-101 technical report for the La Arena property which includes an update of the existing La Arena Mine oxide gold heap leach operation and a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") of the La Arena II copper-gold porphyry project.\nTahoe expects to continue its evaluation of the La Arena II project with the intent of advancing the project to the prefeasibility or feasibility stage at the appropriate time. The timeline and estimated capital required to progress the project to the next stage are under review by management. The project will be evaluated in the context of existing operations and pipeline opportunities. Tahoe intends to progress the project responsibly and to maximize value for its shareholders.\nFor full details, please refer to the February 20, 2018 press release and the NI 43-101 technical report which is available on the Company's website at http://www.tahoeresources.com/operations/la-arena-mine/ and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR ( www.sec.gov ).\nUN Global Compact and 2018 CSR Initiatives\nOn February 5, 2018, Tahoe announced that it has joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. As an official participant of the UNGC, Tahoe joins other international businesses, including a number of industry-leading mining companies, in committing to align its strategies and operations with the ten principles of the UNGC on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance these societal goals. As part of its commitment, Tahoe will make the UN Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, policy, culture and day-to-day operations of the company, and continue to engage collaboratively on programming that advances the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Tahoe will also participate in the Global Compact's Canada Local Network to work with other companies, with the aim to scale the impact of sustainability efforts on a global level.\nGuatemala Update\nUpdate on Escobal mining license and export credential - On July 5, 2017, the Company was notified that the Supreme Court of Guatemala issued a temporary decision to provisionally suspend the Escobal mining license of Minera San Rafael (\"MSR\") in response to an action brought by CALAS, an anti-mining NGO, against the Ministry of Energy and Mines (\"MEM\"). On September 10, 2017, the Guatemalan Supreme Court issued a definitive decision that reinstated the Escobal mining license. The ruling also ordered MEM to consult with the Xinka indigenous communities within certain geographic areas within 12 months. The ruling allows Escobal to restart operations immediately and to continue to operate during the consultation process. Although Tahoe believes that MEM complied with ILO Convention 169 before it issued the Escobal license, it will fully support MEM in any of its future indigenous engagement to the extent permitted.\nCALAS and other interested parties appealed the Supreme Court's decision reinstating the Escobal mining license to the Constitutional Court, the highest court in Guatemala, which heard the matter on October 25, 2017. According to Guatemalan law, the Constitutional Court was required to have issued its ruling within 5 calendar days of the public hearing, however, the Constitutional Court has yet to rule.\nIn June 2017, the Company filed its annual request to renew the export credential with MEM. However, MEM did not renew the credential because its renewal had become contingent on the Supreme Court's reinstatement of the Escobal mining license. The credential therefore expired in August 2017. After the Supreme Court reinstated the mining license in September 2017, MEM publicly stated to local press that the export credential could be legally renewed. However, contrary to such public declaration, in December MEM indicated in a written communication to MSR that it will not renew the credential given the pending ruling from the Constitutional Court. The Company expects that MEM will renew the export credential upon a favorable ruling of the Constitutional Court on the appeal reinstating the license.\nUpdate on Guatemala Road Block - Since June 7, 2017, a group of protesters near the town of Casillas has blocked the municipal road that connects Guatemala City to San Rafael Las Flores and the Escobal mine. Operations were reduced between June 8 and June 19 to conserve fuel and were further curtailed on June 19.\nWhile some of the protestors come from Casillas, which is 16 kilometers from the mine, many more are from outside the municipality. The Company has reason to believe that the blockade is politically motivated and is being substantially funded by anti-mining groups.\nMSR representatives have been pursuing engagement with community leaders, indigenous groups, government agencies, and international mediation experts to positive effect. The Company's dialogue process is making headway in bringing communities together with an aim to peaceably resolve the roadblock.\nEscobal Workforce Reduction - Tahoe has been committed to maintaining Escobal's full workforce since the July 5, 2017 mining license suspension. Given the delay and the inability of the Company to resume mining operations, the Company terminated 250 Minera San Rafael employees on January 15, 2018. Prior to the license suspension, Minera San Rafael employed 1,030 people, 97% of whom are Guatemalan and 50% of whom are from the Santa Rosa region.\nDespite this difficult decision, Tahoe remains optimistic that based on legal precedent, the Constitutional Court will issue a favorable ruling reinstating the mining license and that Escobal will resume operations. At such time, Tahoe will seek to restore its workforce.\nAssuming that the Supreme Court ruling is confirmed by the Constitutional Court and the export credential is renewed, the Company anticipates it will take approximately one month to resume production at Escobal. Once the mine resumes steady operations for a period of time, the Company will seek to establish guidance outlook for Escobal.\nConference Call\nTahoe's senior management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the Q4 2017 and year-end 2017 results on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET (7:00 a.m. PT).\nDial-in:\n1-800-319-4610 (toll free from Canada and the U.S.)\n+1-604-638-5340 (from outside Canada and the U.S.)\nThe webcast will be available on the Company's website at http://www.tahoeresources.com/investor-relations/ as will a recording of the call later in the day.

For a reconciliation to cash costs before by-product credits, refer to the \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\n(4)\nNumbers may not calculate due to rounding.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures throughout this document which include total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs per silver and per gold ounce (\"all-in sustaining costs\"), adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital. These measures are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company's Escobal mine primarily produces silver in concentrates with other metals (gold, lead and zinc), produced simultaneously in the mining process, the value of which represents a small percentage of the Company's revenue from Escobal and is therefore considered \"by-product\". The Company's La Arena, Shahuindo and Timmins mines primarily produce gold with other metals (primarily silver), produced simultaneously in the mining process, the value of which represents a small percentage of the Company's revenue from these mines and is therefore considered \"by-product\". The Company believes these measures may provide investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying earnings, cash costs of operations, the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and its ability to generate cash flow, as well as providing a meaningful comparison to other mining companies. Accordingly, these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be substituted for GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently by other companies depending on the underlying accounting principles and policies applied.\nThe Company also reports total operating costs (cost of sales) per ounce. The Company believes that this metric is important in assessing the performance of each of the Company's sold metals and as a meaningful GAAP-based comparison to other mining companies. Total operating costs (cost of sales) per ounce sold is calculated by dividing total the operating costs by gold ounces sold. Total operating costs (cost of sales) includes production costs, depreciation and depletion and royalties. The reconciliation of total operating costs (cost of sales) to total cash costs is included in the total cash cost and total production cost tables below. Comparative periods have been updated to reflect current period presentation. There is no impact to current or prior period disclosed numbers due to the inclusion of this metric.\nConsolidated adjusted earnings and consolidated adjusted earnings per share\nThe Company has adopted the reporting of consolidated adjusted earnings (\"adjusted earnings)\" and consolidated adjusted earnings per share (\"adjusted earnings per share\") as a non-GAAP measure of a precious metals mining company's operating performance. This measure has no standardized meaning and the Company's presentation of adjusted measures are not meant to be substituted for GAAP measures of consolidated earnings or consolidated earnings per share and should be read in conjunction with such GAAP measures. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are calculated as earnings excluding i) non-cash impairment losses and reversals on mineral interests and other assets, ii) unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses related to the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities on non-monetary items, iii) unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses related to other items, iv) unrealized gains or losses on derivatives other than provisionally priced trade receivables, v) loss on extinguishment of the Lake Shore Debentures, vi) gains or losses on sale of assets and vii) costs related to the acquisition of Lake Shore Gold and the related tax impact of these adjustments calculated at the statutory effective rate for the same jurisdiction as the adjustment. Non-recurring adjustments from unusual events or circumstances are reviewed periodically based on materiality and the nature of the event or circumstance.\nThe Company calculates adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share on a consolidated basis.\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n2017\n2016\nEarnings (loss)\n$\n(18,010)\n$\n315\n$\n81,793\n$\n117,876\nUnrealized foreign exchange loss\n$\n332\n$\n(1,284)\n$\n2,218\n$\n539\nAcquisition costs (2)\n—\n$\n49\n—\n$\n11,134\nDeferred tax (3)\n—\n$\n19,335\n—\n$\n19,335\nLoss on conversion of debentures\n—\n—\n—\n$\n32,304\nLoss (gain) on derivative instruments (currency swap)\n—\n—\n—\n$\n(803)\nAdjusted earnings (loss)\n$\n(17,678)\n$\n18,415\n$\n84,011\n$\n180,385\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\nBasic (000's)\n313,193\n311,653\n312,804\n289,727\nDiluted (000's)\n313,200\n311,786\n312,834\n289,988\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share\nBasic\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n0.06\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.62\nDiluted\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n0.06\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.62\n(1)\nResults of the Timmins mines prior to the date of acquisition of Lake Shore Gold on April 1, 2016 were excluded.\n(2)\nCosts related to the acquisition of Lake Shore Gold on April 1, 2016.\n(3)\nAdjustment to reflect the impact of a non-cash deferred tax charge resulting from a change in enacted rates in Peru.\nTotal cash costs before and net of by-product credits\nThe Company reports total cash costs on a silver ounce and a gold ounce produced basis for the Escobal mine and the La Arena, Shahuindo and Timmins mines, respectively. The Company follows the recommendation of the cost standard as endorsed by the Silver Institute (\"The Institute\") for the reporting of total cash costs (silver) and the generally accepted standard of reporting total cash costs (gold) by precious metal mining companies. The Institute is a nonprofit international association with membership from across the silver industry and serves as the industry's voice in increasing public understanding of the many uses and values of silver. This remains the generally accepted standard for reporting cash costs of silver production by silver mining companies. The Company believes that these generally accepted industry measures are realistic indicators of operating performance and are useful in performing year over year comparisons. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered together with other data prepared in accordance with IFRS, and these measures, taken alone, are not necessarily indicative of operating costs or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Total cash costs are divided by the number of silver ounces contained in concentrate or gold ounces recovered from the leach pads to calculate per ounce figures. When deriving the total cash costs associated with an ounce of silver or gold, the Company deducts by-product credits from sales which are incidental to producing silver and gold.\nTotal cash costs per ounce of produced silver net of by-product credits incorporate all production costs, including adjustments to inventory carrying values, adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation which are non-cash in nature, and include by-product gold, lead and zinc credits, and treatment and refining charges included within revenue.\nIn addition to conventional measures, the Company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of silver production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs per ounce of produced silver net of by-product credits to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of silver, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the silver is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the silver production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of silver production.\nTotal cash costs (silver)\nTotal cash costs per ounce of produced silver, net of by-product credits\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal operating costs (cost of sales) (1)\n$\n—\n$\n52,524\n$\n95,854\n$\n200,497\nDepreciation and depletion\n—\n$\n(12,903)\n$\n(29,052)\n$\n(53,204)\nChange in product inventory\n—\n$\n(2,558)\n$\n6,329\n$\n(1,139)\nTreatment and refining charges\n—\n$\n8,173\n$\n16,205\n$\n32,600\nTotal cash costs before by-product credits\n$\n—\n$\n45,236\n$\n89,336\n$\n178,754\nBy-product credits (2)\n—\n$\n(14,121)\n$\n(29,740)\n$\n(54,925)\nTotal cash costs net of by-product credits\n$\n—\n$\n31,115\n$\n59,596\n$\n123,829\nSilver ounces sold in concentrate (000's)\n—\n4,470\n9,773\n18,996\nSilver ounces produced in concentrate (000's)\n—\n4,801\n9,692\n21,189\nTotal operating costs (cost of sales) per ounce sold\n$\n—\n$\n11.75\n$\n9.81\n$\n10.55\nTotal cash costs per ounce produced before by-product credits\n$\n—\n$\n9.42\n$\n9.22\n$\n8.44\nTotal cash costs per ounce produced net of by-product credits\n$\n—\n$\n6.48\n$\n6.15\n$\n5.84\n(1)\nTotal operating costs (cost of sales) includes production costs, depreciation and depletion and royalties.

This measure has no standardized meaning and the Company has utilized an adapted version of the guidance released by the World Gold Council (\"WGC\"), the market development organization for the gold industry. The WGC is not a regulatory industry organization and does not have the authority to develop accounting standards or disclosure requirements.\nAll-in sustaining costs include total cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, exploration and evaluations costs, and reclamation and closure accretion. The Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing silver and gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. AISC, as a key performance measure, allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. This information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions.\nAll-in sustaining costs (silver)\nTotal all-in

Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by NI 43-101. The definitions used in NI 43-101 are incorporated by reference from the CIM Definition Standards adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the \"CIM Definition Standards\"). U.S. reporting requirements are governed by the SEC Industry Guide 7 (\"Industry Guide 7\") under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but embody difference approaches and definitions. For example, the terms \"Mineral Reserve\", \"Proven Mineral Reserve\" and \"Probable Mineral Reserve\" are Canadian mining terms as defined in in NI 43-101, and these definitions differ from the definitions in Industry Guide 7. Under Industry Guide 7 standards, a \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to report reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. Further, under Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.\nWhile the terms \"Mineral Resource\", \"Measured Mineral Resource\", \"Indicated Mineral Resource\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101, these terms are not defined terms under Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. United States readers are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. In addition, \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an Inferred Mineral Resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian regulations, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. United States readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations if such disclosure includes the grade or quality and the quantity for each category of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.\nAccordingly, information contained in this press release containing descriptions of the Company's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS\nSelected quarterly and YTD consolidated financial information from continuing operations is as follows:\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\n2017\n2016\nMetal Sold\nSilver (000's ozs)\n46.2\n4,496\n10,113\n19,065\nGold (000's ozs) (2)\n92.9\n100.7\n435.2\n358.2\nLead (000's t)\n—\n2.3\n4.0\n9.0\nZinc (000's t)\n—\n2.8\n5.6\n12.3\nRealized Price\nSilver in concentrate (per oz)\n$\n—\n$\n14.45\n$\n17.71\n$\n17.57\nGold in doré (per oz)\n$\n1,272\n$\n1,197\n$\n1,246\n$\n1,245\nLead (per t)\n$\n—\n$\n2,036\n$\n2,379\n$\n1,886\nZinc (per t)\n$\n—\n$\n2,872\n$\n2,864\n$\n2,268\nLBMA/LME Price (3)\nSilver (per oz)\n$\n16.84\n$\n17.19\n$\n17.16\n$\n17.14\nGold (per oz)\n$\n1,278\n$\n1,220\n$\n1,251\n$\n1,250\nLead (per t)\n$\n2,334\n$\n2,149\n$\n2,259\n$\n1,872\nZinc (per t)\n$\n2,963\n$\n2,517\n$\n2,783\n$\n2,095\nRevenues\n$\n117,734\n$\n189,398\n$\n733,557\n$\n784,503\nTotal operating costs\n$\n122,997\n$\n141,552\n$\n541,587\n$\n480,378\nEarnings from operations\n$\n(20,219)\n$\n31,466\n$\n191,970\n$\n242,268\nEarnings (loss) (6)(7)\n$\n(18,010)\n$\n315\n$\n81,793\n$\n117,876\nEarnings (loss) per common share\nBasic\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n—\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.41\nDiluted\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n—\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.41\nAdjusted earnings (loss) (4)\n$\n(17,678)\n$\n18,415\n$\n84,011\n$\n180,385\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per common share (4)\nBasic (4)\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n0.06\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.62\nDiluted (4)\n$\n(0.06)\n$\n0.06\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.62\nWeighted average shares outstanding - Basic\n313,193\n311,653\n312,804\n289,726\nWeighted average shares outstanding - Diluted\n313,200\n311,786\n312,834\n289,988\nDividends paid\n$\n—\n$\n18,672\n$\n43,686\n$\n69,402\nCash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n18,081\n$\n107,021\n$\n234,264\n$\n249,454\nCash flow provided by operating activities before changes in working capital (4)\n$\n23,988\n$\n74,669\n$\n287,014\n$\n385,926\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n125,665\n$\n163,368\n$\n125,665\n$\n163,368\nTotal assets\n$\n3,080,638\n$\n3,071,253\n$\n3,080,638\n$\n3,071,253\nTotal long-term liabilities\n$\n299,920\n$\n348,663\n$\n299,920\n$\n348,663\nCosts per silver ounce produced\nTotal cash costs net of by-product credits (4)\n$\n—\n$\n6.48\n$\n6.15\n$\n5.84\nAll-in sustaining costs per silver ounce net of by-product credits (4)\n$\n—\n$\n9.76\n$\n8.91\n$\n8.06\nCosts per gold ounce produced\nTotal cash costs net of by-product credits (4)\n$\n648\n$\n594\n$\n641\n$\n620\nAll-in sustaining costs per gold ounce net of by-product credits (4)(5)\n$\n1,033\n$\n945\n$\n973\n$\n943\n(1)\n2016 numbers include operational and financial information from the Timmins mines beginning April 1, 2016, the date of acquisition of Lake Shore Gold and operational and financial information from Shahuindo beginning May 1, 2016, the commencement of commercial production.\n(2)\nIncluded in the 358.2 thousand gold ounces sold for 2016 are 44.3 thousand gold ounces sold at Shahuindo which include four months of pre-commercial production ounces sold (7.6 thousand ounces of gold in doré sold in the period January through April 2016).\n(3)\nLondon Bullion Market Association (LBMA)/London Metal Exchange (LME) average closing prices for each period presented.\n(4)\nRefer to the \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\n(5)\nAll-in sustaining costs net of by-product credits per gold ounce produced for 2016 exclude the impact of $11.1 million in non-recurring transaction costs related to the acquisition of Lake Shore Gold.\n(6)\nEarnings of $0.3 million for Q4 2016 were negatively impacted by the change in enacted tax rates in Peru, resulting in a charge of approximately $19.3 million to deferred income tax expense. Refer to the Company's adjusted earnings described and calculated in the \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\n(7)\nEarnings of $117.9 million for 2016 were impacted by the result of a change in enacted tax rates in Peru for $19.3 million, a non-cash loss on the redemption of the Lake Shore Gold debentures of $32.3 million and non-recurring transaction costs of $11.1 million related to the acquisition of Lake Shore Gold. Refer to the Company's adjusted earnings described and calculated in the \"Cautionary Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\n(8)\nNumbers may not calculate due to rounding.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tahoe-reports-strong-2017-financial-results-and-updates-2018-and-multi-year-gold-guidance-300603135.html\nSOURCE Tahoe Resources Inc.",
