Sorrento, which acquired Ztlido when it bought a majority stake in privately-owned SCILEX Pharmaceuticals Inc in November 2016, said it plans to launch the drug later this year. The FDA had previously rejected the treatment in 2016. Reporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur",
