    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CVI) today announced full year 2017 net income of $234.4 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, on net sales of $5,988.4 million, compared to net income for full year 2016 of $24.7 million, or 28 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $4,782.4 million. Full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $258.4 million compared to full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $181.6 million.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported net income of $200.5 million, or $2.31 per diluted share, on net sales of $1,593.1 million, compared to net income of $7.1 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1,353.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $49.4 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $22.8 million for the same period a year earlier.\n\"CVR Refining delivered solid 2017 full year and fourth quarter results led by stronger crack spreads and record operating rates,\" said Dave Lamp, CVR Energy's chief executive officer. \"The Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery processed more than 131,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil during the year and the Wynnewood, Oklahoma, refinery successfully completed its major scheduled plant turnaround in the fourth quarter.\n\"Low nitrogen fertilizer pricing continued to dampen CVR Partners' 2017 full year and fourth quarter results,\" Lamp said. \"Fertilizer pricing has improved in the 2018 first quarter mostly due to continued steady demand for product and lower imports into the U.S. market.\n\"Looking forward, we will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations while increasing shareholder value by implementing self-help initiatives and developing capital improvements that will meaningfully improve our return on capital employed,\" he concluded.\nPetroleum Business\nThe petroleum business, which is operated by CVR Refining and includes the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries, reported fourth quarter 2017 operating income of $46.5 million on net sales of $1,516.7 million, compared to operating income of $15.3 million on net sales of $1,269.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $11.87 in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to $7.32 during the same period in 2016. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), including major scheduled turnaround expenses, per crude oil throughput barrel, for the 2017 fourth quarter were $7.78, compared to $4.96 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 throughputs of crude oil and all other feedstocks and blendstocks totaled 203,263 bpd, compared to fourth quarter 2016 throughputs of crude oil and all other feedstocks and blendstocks of 223,266 bpd.\nNitrogen Fertilizers Business\nThe fertilizer business, which is operated by CVR Partners and includes the Coffeyville and East Dubuque fertilizer facilities, reported a fourth quarter 2017 operating loss of $10.8 million on net sales of $78.2 million, compared to operating income of $1.0 million on net sales of $84.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $132 per ton and $264 per ton, respectively. Consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $147 per ton and $352 per ton, respectively, for the same period in 2016.\nCVR Partners' fertilizer facilities produced a combined 199,500 tons of ammonia during the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 64,100 net tons were available for sale while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 306,100 tons of UAN. In the 2016 fourth quarter, the fertilizer facilities produced 207,600 tons of ammonia, of which 62,600 net tons were available for sale while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 330,700 tons of UAN.\nCash, Debt and Dividend\nConsolidated cash and cash equivalents was $481.8 million at Dec. 31, 2017. Consolidated total debt was $1,166.5 million at Dec. 31, 2017. The company had no debt exclusive of CVR Refining's and CVR Partners' debt.\nCVR Energy also announced a fourth quarter 2017 cash dividend of 50 cents per share. The dividend, as declared by CVR Energy's Board of Directors, will be paid on March 12, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 5, 2018. CVR Energy's fourth quarter cash dividend brings the cumulative cash dividends paid or declared for the 2017 full year to $2.00 per share.\nToday, CVR Refining announced a 2017 fourth quarter cash distribution of 45 cents per common unit. CVR Partners announced that it will not pay a cash distribution for the 2017 fourth quarter.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nCVR Energy previously announced that it will host its fourth quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, Feb. 22, at 3 p.m. Eastern.

The Company is required to reflect the impact of tax law changes in its consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment. As a result, our net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 were remeasured to reflect the lower tax rate that will be in effect for the years in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities will be realized. A benefit of approximately $200.5 million was recognized as a result of the remeasurement.\nAs of December 31,\n2017\n2016\n(audited)\n(in millions)\nBalance Sheet Data:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n481.8\n$\n735.8\nWorking capital\n550.5\n749.6\nTotal assets\n3,806.7\n4,050.2\nTotal debt, including current portion\n1,166.5\n1,164.6\nTotal CVR stockholders' equity\n918.8\n858.1\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\nCash Flow Data:\nNet cash flow provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n(159.9)\n$\n48.6\n$\n166.9\n$\n267.5\nInvesting activities\n(114.6)\n(29.4)\n(195.0)\n(201.4)\nFinancing activities\n(92.8)\n(46.0)\n(225.9)\n(95.4)\nNet cash flow\n$\n(367.3)\n$\n(26.8)\n$\n(254.0)\n$\n(29.3)\nSegment Information\nOur operations are organized into two reportable segments, Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer.

Following the Linde outage, the Coffeyville Facility UAN unit experienced a number of operational challenges, resulting in approximately 11 days of UAN downtime during the second quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the Linde air separation unit outage at the Coffeyville Facility, the UAN unit on-stream factors at the Coffeyville Facility would have been 94.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEast Dubuque Facility\nExcluding the impact of approximately 14 days of downtime associated with the 2017 full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Nitrogen Fertilizer Facility, the on-stream factors would have been 94.2% for ammonia and 94.0% for UAN for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExcluding the impact of approximately 28 days of downtime associated with the 2016 full facility turnaround at the East Dubuque Nitrogen Fertilizer Facility, the on-stream factors would have been 97.8% for ammonia and 97.1% for UAN for the post-acquisition period ended December 31, 2016.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our actual results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") for the applicable periods, we also use the non-GAAP financial measures noted above, which are reconciled to our GAAP-based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP results. The adjustments are provided to enhance an overall understanding of our financial performance for the applicable periods and are indicators management believes are relevant and useful for planning and forecasting future periods.\nAdjusted net income is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) as a measure of our performance, but rather should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Management believes that adjusted net income provides relevant and useful information that enables external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. Adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income represents net income (loss), as adjusted, that is attributable to CVR Energy stockholders.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except per share data)\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income:\nIncome (loss) before income tax benefit\n$\n(61.6)\n$\n(28.1)\n$\n—\n$\n(10.9)\nAdjustments:\nFIFO impact, favorable\n(30.4)\n(22.4)\n(29.6)\n(52.1)\nMajor scheduled turnaround expenses\n43.0\n—\n83.0\n38.1\nLoss on derivatives, net\n65.0\n14.6\n69.8\n19.4\nCurrent period settlement on derivative contracts(1)\n(17.7)\n1.2\n(16.6)\n36.4\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt(2)\n—\n(0.2)\n—\n4.9\nExpenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger(3)\n—\n—\n—\n3.1\nInsurance recovery - Business interruption(4)\n—\n—\n(1.1)\n(2.1)\nAdjusted net income (loss) before income tax benefit and noncontrolling interest\n(1.7)\n(34.9)\n105.5\n36.8\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributed to noncontrolling interest\n7.5\n15.5\n(18.8)\n(4.1)\nIncome tax benefit, as adjusted\n218.8\n23.8\n189.7\n8.8\nNet tax benefit related to the TCJA(5)\n(200.5)\n—\n(200.5)\n—\nAdjusted net income\n$\n24.1\n$\n4.4\n$\n75.9\n$\n41.5\nAdjusted net income per diluted share\n$\n0.28\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.87\n$\n0.48\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other. Refining margin is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating the refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above their cost of materials and other at which they are able to sell refined products. Each of the components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of materials and other) can be taken directly from our Petroleum segment's Statements of Operations. Our calculation of refining margin may differ from similar calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the Petroleum segment's ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between the Petroleum segment's net sales and cost of materials and other adjusted for FIFO impact. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating the refineries' performance as a general indication of the amount above their cost of materials and other (taking into account the impact of the utilization of FIFO) at which they are able to sell refined products. Our calculation of refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices decrease. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the petroleum business' ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nThe calculation of refining margin, refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact, refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel (each a non-GAAP financial measure), including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nPetroleum Segment Operating Data\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions)\nNet sales\n$\n1,516.7\n$\n1,269.4\n$\n5,664.2\n$\n4,431.3\nCost of materials and other\n1,281.0\n1,107.5\n4,804.7\n3,759.2\nDirect operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization as reflected below)\n91.5\n94.7\n363.4\n361.9\nMajor schedule turnaround expenses\n43.0\n—\n80.4\n31.5\nDepreciation and amortization\n32.5\n32.6\n129.3\n126.3\nGross profit\n68.7\n34.6\n286.4\n152.4\nAdd:\nDirect operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization as reflected below)\n91.5\n94.7\n363.4\n361.9\nMajor schedule turnaround expenses\n43.0\n—\n80.4\n31.5\nDepreciation and amortization\n32.5\n32.6\n129.3\n126.3\nRefining margin\n235.7\n161.9\n859.5\n672.1\nFIFO impact, favorable\n(30.4)\n(22.4)\n(29.6)\n(52.1)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n205.3\n$\n139.5\n$\n829.9\n$\n620.0\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels per day\n187,996\n207,422\n204,748\n198,042\nDays in the period\n92\n92\n365\n366\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels\n17,295,632\n19,082,824\n74,733,020\n72,483,372\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin\n$\n235.7\n$\n161.9\n$\n859.5\n$\n672.1\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n17.3\n19.1\n74.7\n72.5\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n13.63\n$\n8.49\n$\n11.50\n$\n9.27\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n205.3\n$\n139.5\n$\n829.9\n$\n620.0\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n17.3\n19.1\n74.7\n72.5\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n11.87\n$\n7.32\n$\n11.10\n$\n8.55\nCoffeyville Refinery\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels per day\n133,243\n132,351\n131,569\n124,169\nDays in the period\n92\n92\n365\n366\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels\n12,258,356\n12,176,292\n48,022,685\n45,445,854\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin\n$\n181.1\n$\n104.1\n$\n582.0\n$\n435.0\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n12.3\n12.2\n48.0\n45.4\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n14.77\n$\n8.55\n$\n12.12\n$\n9.57\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n159.4\n$\n88.7\n$\n561.8\n$\n397.2\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n12.3\n12.2\n48.0\n45.4\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n13.00\n$\n7.29\n$\n11.70\n$\n8.74\nWynnewood Refinery\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels per day\n54,753\n75,071\n73,179\n73,873\nDays in the period\n92\n92\n365\n366\nTotal crude oil throughput barrels\n5,037,276\n6,906,532\n26,710,335\n27,037,518\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin\n$\n53.3\n$\n56.7\n$\n272.4\n$\n232.6\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n5.0\n6.9\n26.7\n27.0\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n10.58\n$\n8.20\n$\n10.20\n$\n8.60\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in millions, except for $ per barrel data)\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact\n$\n44.6\n$\n49.7\n$\n263.0\n$\n218.4\nDivided by: crude oil throughput barrels\n5.0\n6.9\n26.7\n27.0\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel\n$\n8.85\n$\n7.19\n$\n9.85\n$\n8.07\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net income attributable to CVR Energy stockholders before consolidated (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization, less the portion of these adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for, as applicable, consolidated (i) FIFO impact (favorable) unfavorable; (ii) major scheduled turnaround expenses (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA); (iii) (gain) loss on derivatives, net; (iv) current period settlements on derivative contracts; (v) (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vi) expenses associated with the East Dubuque Merger and (vii) business interruption insurance recovery, less the portion of these adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flow from operations. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.

EBITDA by operating segment represents net income (loss) before (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) as a measure of performance. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment enable investors to better understand CVR Refining's and CVR Partners' ability to make distributions to their common unitholders, help investors evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance.
