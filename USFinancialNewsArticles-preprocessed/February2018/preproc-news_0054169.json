    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nUniversal Forest Products, Inc. (Nasdaq:UFPI) today announced record net earnings and net sales and full year 2017. The Company posted these results in a quarter and year that had one less operational week compared to 2016. In 2016, the extra week accounted for over $60 million in net sales and over $2 million in operating profit.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights (comparisons on a year-over-year basis, 13 weeks over 14 weeks):\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.51, an increase of 50 percent Net earnings attributable to controlling interest were $31.1 million, up 50 percent; changes to the corporate tax rate contributed $6.4 million or 10 cents per diluted share. Even excluding the tax benefit, net earnings for the quarter and year were records. EBITDA of $57 million, up 16 percent Net sales of $966.1 million represent a 12 percent increase Unit sales accounted for 5 percent of the Company’s gross sales growth due to acquired businesses; price increases accounted for almost 8 percent\nFiscal 2017 Highlights (comparisons on a year-over-year basis, 52 weeks over 53 weeks):\nDiluted earnings per share were $1.94, an increase of 18 percent Net earnings attributable to controlling interest were $119.5 million, up 18 percent EBITDA of $238 million, up 13 percent Net sales of $3.94 billion, up 22 percent Unit sales accounted for 15 percent of the Company’s gross sales growth (this includes 11 percent from acquired businesses); price increases accounted for 6 percent Generated cash from operating activities of almost $137 million\n“The employees of Universal did a great job managing our business through a challenging lumber market that pressured margins for our products at different periods throughout the year,” said CEO Matthew J. Missad. In 2017, average prices for framing lumber and southern yellow pine rose 20 percent and 7 percent, respectively, over 2016, but fell during the Company’s peak selling times, reducing margins on certain products.\n“We experienced terrific growth with new products in 2017, making significant inroads in the Retail market with new products such as our UFP-Edge profile lines and several product introductions in our Deckorators line,” Matt added. For the year, new product sales grew 23.5 percent to $418.4 million, compared to $338.6 million in 2016. “Despite the challenges that remain in the lumber market, we are optimistic about our strategic initiatives for 2018 and beyond. To support those initiatives, we are investing a portion of the income we will save from the tax reform bill in capital expenditures.”\nBy market, the Company reported the following 2017 results.\nRetail\nFourth Quarter: $330.6 million in gross sales, up 20 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016. Unit sales contributed 13 percent of the growth; price increases accounted for 7 percent. Acquisitions accounted for 10 percent of the increase. Full Year: $1.49 billion in gross sales, up 15 percent over 2016, led by a 10 percent increase in unit sales and a 5 percent increase in selling prices. Acquisitions contributed 7 percent of the sales growth. Sales to this market were affected by a record hurricane season, which resulted in a temporary increase in sales of low-margin commodity products.\nConstruction\nFourth Quarter: $305.8 million in gross sales, up 10 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016, mostly due to price increases as a result of the lumber market. Unit sales to manufactured housing customers grew 4 percent during the period, while sales to residential and commercial construction customers fell 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Residential construction sales were likely affected by project delays associated with higher lumber prices. Full Year: $1.18 billion in gross sales, up 16 percent over the previous year, driven by a 7 percent increase in unit sales and a 9 percent increase in prices. Residential construction unit sales grew 7 percent, and unit sales to manufactured housing customers rose 9 percent over 2016.\nIndustrial\nFourth Quarter: $345.1 million in gross sales, up 9 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016; price increases accounted for 7 percent of the growth while unit increases accounted for 2 percent. Full Year: $1.33 billion in gross sales, up 35 percent over the previous year. Unit sales increased 29 percent, primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of idX Corporation in September of 2016. Excluding acquisitions, the Company’s organic unit sales grew 4 percent over 2016.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nUniversal Forest Products will conduct a conference call to discuss information included in this news release and related matters at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, February 23, 2018.
