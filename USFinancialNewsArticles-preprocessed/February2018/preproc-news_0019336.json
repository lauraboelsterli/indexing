Non-food prices rose 2.0 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in December. \nSources have told Reuters that China’s government will maintain a 3 percent consumer inflation target for 2018, suggesting policymakers are not foreseeing any sharp price rises that could force the central bank to change course and tighten policy more quickly. \nGlobal stock markets began to tumble   labour   fears   Reporting by Lusha Zhang, Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao;  ",
