Operating income rose 8% to $686 million and included a $54 million pension charge as described in the supplemental schedules. Adjusted operating income, which excludes noteworthy items as presented in the attached supplemental schedules, increased 12% to $755 million. Earnings per share declined to $0.06 reflecting a charge of $460 million related to the changes in U.S. tax reform as well as the pension charge noted above.

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThree Months Ended December 31\n(Millions) (Unaudited) Overview\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (referred to in this release as \"GAAP\" or “reported” results). The Company also refers to and presents below certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, adjusted income, net of tax and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the following tables.\nThe Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods. Management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income or loss. The following tables identify these noteworthy items and reconcile adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income or loss, on a consolidated and segment basis, for the three and twelve months ended 2016. The following tables also present adjusted operating margin. For the three and twelve months ended 2016, adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by consolidated or segment GAAP revenue less, where applicable, the net gain on the deconsolidation of Marsh's India subsidiary and the proceeds related to the disposal of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business.\nRisk &\nInsurance\nServices\nConsulting Corporate/\nEliminations\nTotal Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Operating income (loss) $ 416 $ 321 $ (51 ) $ 686 Add impact of Noteworthy Items: Restructuring (a) 4 1 3 8 Adjustments to acquisition related accounts (b) 5 1 — 6 Pension settlement charge (c) 47 7 — 54 Other 1 — — 1 Operating income adjustments 57 9 3 69 Adjusted operating income (loss) $ 473 $ 330 $ (48 ) $ 755 Operating margin 21.2 % 18.5 % N/A 18.6 % Adjusted operating margin 24.1 % 19.0 % N/A 20.5 % Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Operating income (loss) $ 413 $ 265 $ (45 ) $ 633 Add impact of Noteworthy Items: Restructuring (a) 1 33 1 35 Adjustments to acquisition related accounts (b) 5 1 — 6 Deconsolidation of business (d) 1 — — 1 Other 1 — — 1 Operating income adjustments 8 34 1 43 Adjusted operating income (loss) $ 421 $ 299 $ (44 ) $ 676 Operating margin 23.0 % 16.8 % N/A 18.8 % Adjusted operating margin 23.5 % 18.9 % N/A 20.1 % (a) Includes severance and related charges from restructuring activities, adjustments to restructuring liabilities for future rent under non-cancellable leases and other real estate costs, and restructuring costs related to the integration of recent acquisitions.\n(b) Primarily includes the change in fair value as measured each quarter of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.

Recognition of these payments as a partial settlement was required because in each respective plan the lump sum payments exceeded the total of interest and service cost for the year. (e) Relates to a net gain on the deconsolidation of Marsh India and contingent proceeds related to the disposal of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. The amounts are excluded from GAAP revenue in the calculation of adjusted operating margin. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThree and Twelve Months Ended December 31\n(Millions) (Unaudited) Adjusted income, net of tax and Adjusted Earnings per Share\nAdjusted income, net of tax is calculated as the Company's GAAP income from continuing operations, adjusted to reflect the after-tax impact of the operating income adjustments set forth in the preceding tables and the impact related to recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the Company’s adjusted income, net of tax, by MMC's average number of shares outstanding-diluted for the relevant period.

Under the new standard, the service cost component of net benefit cost will continue to be included in compensation and benefit costs in operating income. All other components of net benefit cost, which include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of gains and losses and settlements costs or credits, will be reported in a separate line item below operating income. This change in presentation will have no impact on income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or cash flow. To aid investors in their understanding of these presentation changes, the tables below provide the restatements of both 2017 and 2016 results that will be reflected when the Company files its 2018 financial statements.\n2016 2017 Consolidated Income Statements FY Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY Revenue $ 13,211 $ 3,503 $ 3,495 $ 3,341 $ 3,685 $ 14,024 Expense: Compensation and Benefits As Reported 7,461 1,945 1,935 1,906 2,098 7,884 Add: Other Net Benefit Credits (a) 233 60 63 62 16 201 Compensation and Benefits As Restated 7,694 2,005 1,998 1,968 2,114 8,085 Other Operating Expenses 3,086 749 796 838 901 3,284 Operating Expenses As Restated 10,780 2,754 2,794 2,806 3,015 11,369 Operating Income As Restated 2,431 749 701 535 670 2,655 Other Net Benefit Credits (a) 233 60 63 62 16 201 Interest Income 5 2 2 2 3 9 Interest Expense (189 ) (58 ) (60 ) (60 ) (59 ) (237 ) Investment Income (Loss) — — 5 (2 ) 12 15 Income Before Income Taxes $ 2,480 $ 753 $ 711 $ 537 $ 642 $ 2,643 Operating Income and Margin Risk and Insurance Services GAAP Operating Income Originally Reported $ 1,753 $ 613 $ 528 $ 314 $ 416 $ 1,871 Other Net Benefit Credits (a) (172 ) (45 ) (46 ) (46 ) (3 ) (140 ) As Restated $ 1,581 $ 568 $ 482 $ 268 $ 413 $ 1,731 GAAP Operating Margin Originally Reported 24.5 % 30.8 % 27.5 % 17.8 % 21.2 % 24.5 % As Restated 22.1 % 28.6 % 25.2 % 15.2 % 21.0 % 22.7 % Consulting GAAP Operating Income Originally Reported $ 1,103 $ 241 $ 283 $ 329 $ 321 $ 1,174 Other Net Benefit Credits (a) (65 ) (16 ) (18 ) (18 ) (12 ) (64 ) As Restated $ 1,038 $ 225 $ 265 $ 311 $ 309 $ 1,110 GAAP Operating Margin Originally Reported 18.1 % 15.8 % 17.8 % 20.7 % 18.5 % 18.2 % As Restated 17.0 % 14.7 % 16.6 % 19.6 % 17.8 % 17.2 % Consolidated GAAP Operating Income Originally Reported $ 2,664 $ 809 $ 764 $ 597 $ 686 $ 2,856 Other Net Benefit Credits (a) (233 ) (60 ) (63 ) (62 ) (16 ) (201 ) As Restated $ 2,431 $ 749 $ 701 $ 535 $ 670 $ 2,655 GAAP Operating Margin Originally Reported 20.2 % 23.1 % 21.9 % 17.9 % 18.6 % 20.4 % As Restated 18.4 % 21.4 % 20.1 % 16.0 % 18.2 % 18.9 % (a) The net benefit credit in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the U.K. pension settlement charge of $54 million, which is excluded from our adjusted results.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201005590/en/\nMedia:\nMarsh & McLennan Companies\nLaura Schooler, +1 212-345-0370\nlaura.schooler@mmc.com\nor\nInvestors:\nMarsh & McLennan Companies\nDan Farrell, +1 212-345-3713\ndaniel.farrell@mmc.com\nSource: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.",
