    "text": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - Australian casino operator Crown Resorts on Thursday reported a marginal rise in first-half profit as better performance in Melbourne, slightly outweighed declines elsewhere.\nNormalised net profit before one-off items was A$192.4 million for the six months to Dec. 31, the company said in a statement, compared with A$191.3 million last year. This beat expectations of A$178 million according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal turnover from high-end tourists on casino package holidays to Australia rose 16 percent to A$22.6 billion.\nReporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates and\n ",
