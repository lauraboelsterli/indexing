    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - An explosion in the boiler room of a building rocked the Turkish capital Ankara on Thursday but there were no immediate reports of casualties, the local governor said on Twitter. \n“An explosion has occurred in the gas boiler room of a building in (the district of) Cukurambar, the cause of which is currently undetermined,” Ankara governor Ercan Topaca said. \n“According to first reports, there are no dead or injured.” \nAmbulances rushed to the scene following the sound of the explosion, a Reuters witness said. \nImages from the scene showed extensive damage to the building’s facade. Windows of buildings and cars were blown out and debris was strewn in the street. \nThe building had been empty except for security personnel at the time of the explosion, local media said. \nWriting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
