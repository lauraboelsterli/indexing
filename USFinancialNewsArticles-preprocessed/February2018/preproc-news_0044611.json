    "text": "FREDERICK, Md., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SLCA) today announced net income of $72.0 million or $0.89 per basic share and $0.88 per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $6.9 million or $(0.09) per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter results included a deferred income tax benefit of $35.8 million or $0.44 per basic share as a result of U.S. tax reform legislation passed in December 2017. The fourth quarter results were also negatively impacted by $9.9 million or $0.07 per basic share of business development-related expense, resulting in adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.52 per basic share.\n\"We sold a record 3.2 million tons in Oil & Gas during the quarter, with relatively flat total contribution margin dollars sequentially, as we experienced some cost increases and lower Sandbox crew utilization due to a transitory slowdown in customer activity around the holidays and periodic disruptions to our business from the extreme winter weather,'' said Bryan Shinn, president and chief executive officer.\n\"The Industrial & Specialty Products business continued to outperform the market,'' Shinn noted. \"Quarterly contribution margin for ISP of $21.3 million was up 12% on a year-over-year basis. We believe the ISP business can continue to grow its bottom line results at multiples of GDP as it benefits from an increasing mix of higher margin products,'' he said.\n\"Looking back at 2017 in total, I am very pleased with the record results we delivered across the company and the significant progress the U.S. Silica team made toward our stated goal of substantially growing the profitability of our enterprise,\" he concluded.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nTotal Company\nRevenue totaled $1.24 billion compared with $559.6 million for the full year of 2016, an increase of 122%. Net income of $145.2 million or $1.79 per basic and $1.77 per diluted share compared with net loss of $41.1 million or $(0.63) per basic and diluted share for the full year 2016. Overall tons sold totaled 15.1 million tons compared with 9.9 million tons for the full year 2016. Contribution margin was $390.8 million, compared to $90.4 million for the full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $307.7 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $39.6 million for the full year 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal Company\nRevenue totaled $360.6 million compared with $182.4 million for the same period last year, an increase of 98% on a year-over-year basis and an increase of 5% sequentially over the third quarter of 2017. Overall tons sold totaled 4.022 million, up 40% compared to 2.872 million tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and relatively flat sequentially with the third quarter of 2017. Contribution margin for the quarter was $117.1 million, up 212% compared with $37.5 million in the same period of the prior year and down 2% sequentially from the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $93.2 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $20.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $96.7 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nOil and Gas\nRevenue totaled $306.0 million compared with $137.0 million for the same period of 2016, up 123% on a year-over-year basis and an increase of 7% sequentially from the third quarter of 2017. Tons sold totaled 3.171 million, an increase of 52% over the 2.081 million tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and up slightly from the 3.147 million tons sold in the third quarter of 2017. 62% of tons sold were in basin compared with the 66% sold in basin in the third quarter of 2017. Segment contribution margin was $95.8 million versus $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and essentially flat with the $96.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nIndustrial and Specialty Products\nRevenue in totaled $54.5 million, an increase of 20% over the fourth quarter of 2016, and down 7% over the third quarter of 2017 due to normal seasonality. Tons sold totaled 0.851 million, an increase of 7% compared to the 0.792 million tons sold in the same period of 2016, and down 8% compared with the third quarter of 2017. Segment contribution margin was $21.3 million compared to $19.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 12% on a year-over-year basis and down 11% sequentially from the third quarter of 2017.\nCapital Update\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, the Company had $384.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $45.5 million available under its credit facilities. Total debt at Dec. 31, 2017 was $511.2 million. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $95.1 million, and were associated largely with engineering, procurement and construction of the Company's growth projects and maintenance and cost improvement capital projects. During fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased approximately $25 million in common shares and paid $20 million in dividends.\nOutlook and Guidance\nThe Company anticipates that its capital expenditures for 2018 will be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, mostly due to the completion of capacity expansion projects started in 2017 and continued investments in Sandbox. The Company's full year 2018 tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%.\nFor the first quarter, we expect that volumes and pricing in Oil & Gas will be flat compared with . Many of our customers were slow to restart completions after the holidays. Additionally, severe winter weather, especially early in the quarter, slowed completions activity and in some cases caused disruptions in customer supply chains. We believe these issues are transitory and in fact, have already seen a pickup in activity in February in both sand sales and Sandbox.\nFor ISP, we expect first quarter volumes may be up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2018 with the restart of a large customer's plant and some additional new business. We also believe we will see some positive impact on margins from the previously announced price increases put into effect January 1 st on about 50% of ISP total sales.\nConference Call\nU.S. Silica will host a conference call for investors today, Feb. 21, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.

Segment contribution margin excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of the segment. These unallocated costs include costs related to corporate functional areas such as sales, production and engineering, corporate purchasing, accounting, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to segment contribution margin.\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales:\nOil & Gas Proppants\n$ 306,020\n$ 286,369\n$ 136,977\nIndustrial & Specialty Products\n54,546\n58,654\n45,396\nTotal sales\n360,566\n345,023\n182,373\nSegment contribution margin:\nOil & Gas Proppants\n95,823\n96,087\n18,486\nIndustrial & Specialty Products\n21,319\n23,978\n19,021\nTotal segment contribution margin\n117,142\n120,065\n37,507\nOperating activities excluded from segment cost of sales\n(11,282)\n(2,965)\n(3,545)\nSelling, general and administrative\n(29,637)\n(29,602)\n(19,167)\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n(27,335)\n(24,673)\n(21,194)\nInterest expense\n(7,244)\n(8,347)\n(7,998)\nOther income (expense), net, including interest income\n1,525\n1,502\n867\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n28,783\n(14,707)\n6,588\nNet income (loss)\n$ 71,952\n$ 41,273\n$ (6,942)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales:\nOil & Gas Proppants\n$ 1,020,365\n$ 362,550\nIndustrial & Specialty Products\n220,486\n197,075\nTotal sales\n1,240,851\n559,625\nSegment contribution margin:\nOil & Gas Proppants\n301,972\n11,445\nIndustrial & Specialty Products\n88,781\n78,988\nTotal segment contribution margin\n390,753\n90,433\nOperating activities excluded from segment cost of sales\n(17,417)\n(8,103)\nSelling, general and administrative\n(107,592)\n(67,727)\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n(97,233)\n(68,134)\nInterest expense\n(31,342)\n(27,972)\nOther income (expense), net, including interest income\n(643)\n3,758\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n8,680\n36,689\nNet income (loss)\n$ 145,206\n$ (41,056)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance, cash flows as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized, and excludes certain non-recurring charges that may recur in the future. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and by using Adjusted EBITDA only supplement ally. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet income (loss)\n$ 71,952\n$ 41,273\n$ (6,942)\nTotal interest expense, net of interest income\n6,019\n6,900\n7,048\nProvision for taxes\n(28,783)\n14,707\n(6,588)\nTotal depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses\n27,335\n24,673\n21,194\nEBITDA\n76,523\n87,553\n14,712\nNon-cash incentive compensation (1)\n6,531\n6,567\n3,032\nPost-employment expenses (excluding service costs) (2)\n308\n194\n260\nBusiness development related expenses (3)\n9,904\n2,355\n2,571\nOther adjustments allowable under our existing credit agreements (4)\n(23)\n7\n96\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 93,243\n$ 96,676\n$ 20,671\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet income (loss)\n$ 145,206\n$ (41,056)\nTotal interest expense, net of interest income\n25,871\n25,779\nProvision for taxes\n(8,680)\n(36,689)\nTotal depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses\n97,233\n68,134\nEBITDA\n259,630\n16,168\nNon-cash incentive compensation (1)\n25,050\n12,107\nPost-employment expenses (excluding service costs) (2)\n1,231\n1,040\nBusiness development related expenses (3)\n15,288\n8,206\nOther adjustments allowable under our existing credit agreements (4)\n6,504\n2,033\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 307,703\n$ 39,554\n(1)\nReflects equity-based compensation expense.\n(2)\nIncludes net pension cost and net post-retirement cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations during the applicable period, but in each case excluding the service cost relating to benefits earned during such period.
