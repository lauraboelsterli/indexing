    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Luminex Corporation (NASDAQ:LMNX) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. Financial and operating highlights for the quarter and full-year include:\nFourth quarter and full-year 2017 consolidated revenue was $78.2 million and $306.6 million, an increase of 8% and 13%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. Assay revenue was $41.8 million and $154.9 million for the quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017, representing a 14% and 27% increase over assay revenue for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2016. Total sample-to-answer molecular product revenue of $12.9 million; growth of 31% compared to $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For 2017, this product line generated $46.5 million, or 47% growth over 2016. Placed 88 sample-to-answer molecular systems under contract, bringing the total number of active customers to more than 425. 288 multiplexing analyzers were shipped during the quarter; a combination of MAGPIX ® systems, LX systems, and FLEXMAP 3D ® systems. Fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $3.0 million, or a loss of $0.07 per diluted share, driven by necessary adjustments to expected company tax obligations, and deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Non-GAAP net income was $8.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP reconciliation). Received FDA clearance for the ARIES ® Group A Strep Assay. This is the sixth assay the FDA has cleared for use on the ARIES ® system in the last 24 months.\n\"Luminex delivered a strong performance again in 2017 growing revenues more than 13% to a record $307 million. Management's focus on the expansion of our molecular business is paying off as our sample-to-answer offerings, VERIGENE and ARIES, are experiencing rapid market adoption,\" said Homi Shamir, President and Chief Executive Officer of Luminex. \"We remain confident about the continued growth of our molecular sample-to-answer business as well as our very solid partner business, creating a well-diversified company with a strong balance sheet, positive cash flow, regular cash dividends and significant growth opportunities ahead of it.\"\nREVENUE SUMMARY\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nVariance\n2017\n2016\n($)\n(%)\n(unaudited)\nSystem sales\n$ 10,342\n$ 9,611\n$ 731\n8%\nConsumable sales\n10,005\n11,107\n(1,102)\n-10%\nRoyalty revenue\n11,329\n10,157\n1,172\n12%\nAssay revenue\n41,830\n36,697\n5,133\n14%\nService revenue\n2,876\n2,924\n(48)\n-2%\nOther revenue\n1,817\n1,775\n42\n2%\n$ 78,199\n$ 72,271\n$ 5,928\n8%\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nVariance\n2017\n2016\n($)\n(%)\n(unaudited)\nSystem sales\n$ 38,651\n$ 37,416\n$ 1,235\n3%\nConsumable sales\n49,319\n48,596\n723\n1%\nRoyalty revenue\n44,704\n44,045\n659\n1%\nAssay revenue\n154,907\n122,064\n32,843\n27%\nService revenue\n11,470\n10,816\n654\n6%\nOther revenue\n7,520\n7,702\n(182)\n-2%\n$ 306,571\n$ 270,639\n$ 35,932\n13%\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE\nThe Company intends to provide annual revenue guidance, to be updated, as appropriate, at each quarterly reporting period.

Company makes reference in this release to \"non-GAAP net income\" which excludes costs associated with legal proceedings, acquisition costs, severance costs, and the impact of restructuring costs; some of which are unpredictable and can vary significantly from period to period; and certain other recurring and non-recurring expenses. The Company believes that excluding these items and their related tax effects from its financial results reflects operating results that are more indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance while improving comparability to prior periods, and, as such may provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the Company's past financial performance and prospects for the future. In addition, the Company's management uses such non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate and assess its core operations and to make ongoing operating decisions. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income, net income per share or expense information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nContacts:\nHarriss T.
