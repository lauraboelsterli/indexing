    "text": "CHICAGO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - K.C. hard red winter wheat futures volume soared to a record of 148,457 traded contracts on Tuesday, CME Group data showed on Wednesday, as prices for the grain rose sharply amid deteriorating crop conditions in the southern U.S. Plains.\nThe volume surpassed the previous record of 137,038 trades on Nov. 9, 2017, according to exchange records dating back to 1980.\nK.C. wheat futures delivered in March gained more than 3 percent to a four-month high during Tuesdayâ€™s session and reached a new peak of $4.71-1/4 per bushel on Wednesday, before settling at $4.67-1/4, down 2-1/2 cents.\nSome traders were exiting short bets in wheat futures as crop conditions worsened, traders and analysts said. K.C. wheat open interest reached an all-time high of 342,096 contracts on Jan. 25, before easing amid the short-covering this week.\nA lack of moisture was stressing wheat plants that were seeded last autumn in the top U.S. growing state of Kansas and in Oklahoma and Texas. HRW wheat primarily is used to make flour for bread.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture this week rated the Kansas wheat crop 14 percent good to excellent condition, down from 37 percent at the end of December.
