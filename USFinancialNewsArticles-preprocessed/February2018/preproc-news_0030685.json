    "text": "LAKE ZURICH, Ill., Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ACCO Brands Corporation (NYSE: ACCO), one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded academic, consumer and business products, today reported its fourth quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We delivered great results in 2017, and exceeded our gross margin, profit and cash flow expectations for the quarter and the year,\" said Boris Elisman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACCO Brands. \"Our strategy is working and we are poised for another good year in 2018.\n\"In light of our financial results, and the confidence our board of directors has in our ability to sustain and improve performance, we are initiating a regular dividend program beginning in the first quarter,\" added Elisman. \"This is an important milestone for our company in continuing to enhance shareholder returns.\"\nThe company also announced that its board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2017, the company had $84.0 million remaining of its prior authorizations. With the new authorization, the company has a combined $184.0 million available for share repurchases.\nFourth Quarter Results\nNet sales increased 30% to $566.8 million from $437.6 million in the prior-year quarter driven by the Esselte acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition and foreign exchange, comparable sales decreased 3%. Net income was $74.0 million, or $0.68 per share, including a $23.8 million tax benefit and $7.4 million of restructuring and integration charges. This compared to net income of $6.1 million, or $0.06 per share, in the prior-year quarter, which included $31.5 million of refinancing-related charges and $5.1 million of transaction, integration and restructuring charges. Adjusted net income increased to $52.7 million, or $0.48 per share, from $35.6 million, or $0.32 per share, in the prior-year quarter. The increase in adjusted net income was primarily driven by the acquisition, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.\nBusiness Segment Highlights\nACCO Brands North America - Sales increased 0.4% to $253.2 million from $252.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The Esselte acquisition added 1.2% to sales, or $3.0 million, and foreign exchange added 0.6%. Comparable sales decreased 1%, or $3.5 million. Operating income increased to $46.1 million from $40.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income increased to $47.0 million from $40.8 million in the prior year due to improved gross margin and lower expenses.\nACCO Brands EMEA - Sales increased 249% to $177.5 million from $50.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The Esselte acquisition added $127.8 million, or 251%, and foreign exchange increased sales by 8%. Comparable sales decreased 10%, or $5.0 million, due to lower volume in the legacy ACCO Brands business. Operating income increased to $22.6 million from $7.9 million in the prior-year quarter, and adjusted operating income increased to $26.4 million from $7.9 million, both primarily due to the acquisition.\nACCO Brands International - Sales increased 1% to $136.1 million from $134.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The Esselte acquisition added 1%, or $1.6 million, and foreign exchange added 2%. Comparable sales declined 2%, or $2.2 million, primarily due to lower sales in Australia. Operating income increased to $25.6 million from $24.8 million in the prior-year quarter, due to lower acquisition-related charges. Adjusted operating income decreased to $25.7 million from $27.0 million in the prior-year quarter, due to the lower sales volume in Australia, as well as higher distribution costs associated with warehouse and systems consolidation driven by the Pelikan Artline integration in Australia, partially offset by improved profitability in Latin America.\nTwelve Month Results\nNet sales increased 25% to $1,948.8 million from $1,557.1 million in the prior-year twelve-month period. The Pelikan Artline and Esselte acquisitions contributed $438.8 million, or 28%. Comparable sales declined 4%, primarily due to expected declines with office superstores, customer inventory reductions and lost placements. Net income was $131.7 million, or $1.19 per share, and included $35.5 million of restructuring, integration, transaction and other charges. This compared to net income of $95.5 million, or $0.87 per share, in the prior-year period, which included $21.1 million of transaction, integration, restructuring and other charges. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted net income increased 38% to $131.6 million, or $1.19 per share, from $95.1 million, or $0.87 per share, in the prior-year period. The improvement was primarily the result of acquisitions, gross margin expansion, lower interest expense and a lower normalized tax rate. During the year, the company repurchased shares which reduced the fully diluted share count by 4.0 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe company is introducing its outlook for 2018 revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. The company expects 2018 sales growth of approximately 2% and adjusted EPS growth of 12-15%, a range of $1.33-$1.37 per share, assuming a normalized tax rate of 28%. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $180 million.\nWebcast\nAt 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today, ACCO Brands Corporation will host a conference call to discuss the company's results. The call will be broadcast live via webcast. The webcast can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of www.accobrands.com . The webcast will be in listen-only mode and will be available for replay for one month following the event.\nAbout ACCO Brands Corporation\nACCO Brands Corporation is one of the world's largest designers, marketers and manufacturers of branded academic, consumer and business products.

More information about ACCO Brands, the Home of Great Brands Built by Great People, can be found at www.accobrands.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow, normalized tax rate and comparable net sales at constant currency. We have included a description of each of these measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the tables attached to this press release.\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures both in the internal evaluation and management of our business and to explain our results to shareholders and the investment community. Senior management's incentive compensation is derived, in part, using certain of these measures. We believe these measures provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends, facilitate meaningful comparisons and enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and our future prospects. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that we considered to be outside our core operating results.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results such as unusual income tax items, restructuring and integration charges, acquisition-related expenses, foreign currency fluctuation, and other one-time or non-recurring items. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the directly comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read in connection with the company's financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThis press release also provides forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share, adjusted free cash flow and normalized tax rate. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted earnings per share or tax rate to GAAP because the GAAP financial measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis as reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such a reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, integration and acquisition-related expenses, the variability of our tax rate and other charges reflected in our historical numbers. The probable significance of each of these items is high and, based on historical experience, could be material.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth, operating strategies and similar matters are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are generally identifiable by the use of the words \"will,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" and similar expressions, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no duty or obligation to update them. Because actual results may differ materially from those suggested or implied by such forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on them when deciding whether to buy, sell or hold the company's securities.\nOur business outlook is based on certain assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These include, without limitation, assumptions regarding the timing, cost and synergies expected from integration of acquisitions; impact of the recent changes in U.S. tax laws; changes in the macro environment; fluctuations in foreign currency rates and share count; changes in the competitive landscape and consumer behavior; as well as other factors described below.\nAmong the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are: the concentration of our business with a relatively limited number of large and sophisticated customers; changes in our customers' business models and the consolidation of our customers; risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations; shifts in the channels of distribution of our products; challenges related to the highly competitive business environments in which we operate; our ability to develop and market innovative products that meet end-user demands; business, commercial and consumer spending decisions during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness; the failure, inadequacy or interruption of our information technology systems or supporting infrastructure or a cybersecurity incident or information security breach; risks associated with the changes to current U.S. government policies, including changes in trade relations and policies and/or changes to U.S. tax laws; our ability to successfully expand our business in emerging markets which generally involves more financial, operational, legal and compliance risks and creates more exposure to economic volatility, unstable political conditions and civil unrest; our ability to grow profitably through acquisitions; our ability to realize the synergies, growth opportunities and other potential benefits from acquisitions; our ability to successfully compete in a rapidly changing and highly competitive computer products market; the impact of litigation or other legal proceedings; the risks associated with outsourcing production of certain of our products, information systems and other administrative functions; the continued decline in the use of certain of our products; risks associated with seasonality and raw material, labor and transportation cost fluctuations; increased cost of compliance with environmental, product safety, privacy, and other laws; the impact of pension costs; any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets; risks associated with our indebtedness, including our debt service obligations, limitations imposed by restrictive covenants and our ability to comply with financial ratios and tests; our failure to comply with customer contracts; the insolvency, bankruptcy or financial instability of our customers and suppliers; our ability to secure, protect and maintain our intellectual property rights; product liability claims or regulatory actions; our ability to attract and retain key employees; the volatility of our stock price; material disruptions at one of our or our suppliers' major manufacturing or distribution facilities resulting from circumstances outside our control; and other risks and uncertainties described in \"Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in other reports we file with the SEC.\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCondensed Consolidated

Unsecured Notes.\nii.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the fair value gain upon acquisition of the Pelikan Artline joint venture of $28.9 million and the foreign currency gain of $1.0 million related to the settlement of certain intercompany transactions, which offset the \"make-whole\" call premium of $25.0 million and the $4.9 million charge for the write-off of debt issuance costs noted above.\n6.\nRepresents the foreign currency gain of $2.3 million related to the settlement of certain intercompany transactions in the second quarter of 2017 and the write-off of $0.3 million in debt issuance costs and other costs associated with the Company's refinancing in the first quarter of 2017 related to the Esselte acquisition.\n7.\nPrimarily reflects the tax effect of the adjustments outlined in items A.1-6 above and adjusts the company's effective tax rate to a normalized rate of 32% for 2017 and 35% for 2016. The lower normalized tax rate for 2017 is primarily due to the acquisition of Esselte. The Company's estimated long-term rate remains subject to variations from the mix of earnings across the Company's operating jurisdictions and changes in tax laws.\nACCO Brands Corporation and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited)\n(In millions of dollars)\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" represents net income after adding back depreciation; stock-based compensation expense; amortization of intangibles; interest expense, net; other (income) expense, net; and income tax (benefit) expense.
