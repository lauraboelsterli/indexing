    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Caltius Equity Partners (“Caltius Equity”) announced today the sale of its portfolio company Vision Technology Solutions LLC (“Vision”; visioninternet.com ), a premier provider of website solutions for government organizations in the U.S. and Canada, to Granicus ( granicus.com ), the largest provider of cloud-based software solutions to government. Caltius Equity will maintain an interest in the business through an equity position in Granicus.\nGranicus’ strategic acquisition of Vision creates a single, integrated provider of website, communication and legislative management solutions for governments, enabling them to serve citizens effectively through digital platforms. Granicus previously acquired GovDelivery and Novusolutions to expand its technology solutions.\nCaltius Equity partnered with Vision CEO David Nachman to acquire Vision in 2014. During its ownership period, Caltius Equity supported Vision’s efforts to invest in the company’s staff and operational infrastructure to enhance client service, and to develop new product features and functionality to meet its clients’ evolving content management needs.\n“It has been very rewarding to partner with the Caltius Equity team to grow Vision,” said David Nachman, CEO of Vision. “Combining Vision with Granicus creates exceptional synergies and is the logical next-step to our growth. There is tremendous need for the end-to-end solutions our combined company provides, simplifying government agencies’ transition to cost-effective digital platforms.”\n“From the beginning, David impressed us with his knowledge and perspective to broaden Vision’s end markets and complementary products,” said Garrick Ahn, managing director at Caltius Equity. “We are excited to support him and the entire Granicus team as they continue to revolutionize government’s use of technology tools for forward-facing communications.”\nVaquero Capital LLC served as financial advisor to Vision.\nAbout Caltius Equity Partners\nCaltius Equity, founded in 1999, buys and builds lower middle market companies in the business services, industrial services, IT and managed services and consumer services industries.
