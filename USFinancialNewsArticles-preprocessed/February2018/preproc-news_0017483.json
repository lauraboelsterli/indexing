    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said on Wednesday it has signed a memorandum of understanding with car-hailing service company Didi Chuxing to explore future business cooperation on a new electric car-sharing service in China.\nA person familiar with the matter said the new potential partnership is about looking at the possibility of supplying all-electric battery car models for Didi’s new service.\nThe alliance, however, will also likely explore broader business opportunities with Didi’s new energy vehicle sharing service, the person said without elaborating.\nNew energy vehicles (NEVs) in China refer to all-electric battery cars as well as plug-in electric hybrid cars.
