    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - The growth of purchasing activity in Canada slowed in January as supplier deliveries slipped, while inventories climbed, according to Ivey Purchasing Managers Index data released on Tuesday.\nThe seasonally adjusted index fell to 55.2 from 60.4 in December, short of analystsâ€™ expectations for 61.0. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in activity.\nThe gauge of supplier deliveries fell to 46.4 from 48.2, while inventories climbed to 58.4 from 49.1.\nThe unadjusted index rose to 51.3 from 49.3.\nReporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ",
