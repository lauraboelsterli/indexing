    "text": "Tyler Myers scored with 2:25 left in overtime and the Winnipeg Jets ended their first two-game home losing streak of the season with a 4-3 victory over the Washington Capitals at Bell MTS Place on Tuesday.\nMark Scheifele scored twice, including a game-tying, short-handed goal with 14.4 seconds left, for the Jets, who outshot Washington 44-27.\nNicklas Backstrom, Andre Burakovsky and John Carlson had goals for the Capitals, who have lost four straight overtime decisions.\nWashington extended its lead to 3-1 on an unassisted goal by Carlson with 12:59 left in regulation. Seconds later, Carlson went to the penalty box for a slash on Joel Armia, but the Jets could not capitalize.\nWinnipeg cut the margin to 3-2 on a long-distance goal by Bryan Little with 8:30 remaining. About a minute later, Washington was lucky when Josh Morrissey’s shot caromed off the post.\nThe Jets tied the game on the goal by Scheifele that forced overtime. Capitals goalie Braden Holtby finished with 32 saves.\nWashington took a 2-1 lead on a goal by Burakovsky with 8:38 remaining in the second period. Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck (27 saves) made the initial stop on a shot by Lars Eller, but Burakovsky was able to knock in the rebound. It was Burakovsky’s first goal since Jan. 3 and fifth on the season.\nThe Jets dominated the rest of the period but could not convert several chances in front of the goal.\nJets center Matt Hendricks went to the locker room early in the second period with an injury and did not return.\nWinnipeg, which was playing the seventh of 10 straight home games, is the league’s highest-scoring team in the first period. The Jets maintained that dominance when Dustin Byfuglien spun around a defenseman and made a deft pass to Scheifele, who had an easy tip-in with 5:19 left.\nBackstrom tied the game 1-1 when he scored off a rebound on a shot by Alex Ovechkin with 22 seconds remaining.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
