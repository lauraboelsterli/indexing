Our new beta products launched in October 2017, Criteo Customer Acquisition and Criteo Audience Match, generated approximately $3 million in Revenue ex-TAC in Q4. We added a total of 820 net clients in the quarter, ending the year with over 18,000 commerce and brand clients, while maintaining the client retention rate at close to 90% for all products. Clients giving us permission to share their data within the Interest Map generated 43% of Revenue ex-TAC. Criteo Direct Bidder, our header bidding technology, is now connected to 1,500 large publishers. We launched Criteo Reseller Program, allowing marketplaces to offer Criteo Dynamic Retargeting to their own sellers.\nRevenue and Revenue ex-TAC\nQ4 2017\nRevenue grew 19%, or 16% at constant currency, to $674 million (Q4 2016: $567 million). Revenue ex-TAC grew 23%, or 20% at constant currency, to $277 million (Q4 2016: $225 million). This increase was primarily driven by continued innovation, improved access to publisher inventory and new clients across regions and products. Revenue ex-TAC margin as a percentage of revenue was 41%, in line with expectations and the prior year.\nIn the Americas, Revenue ex-TAC grew 22%, or 22% at constant currency, to $121 million and represented 44% of total Revenue ex-TAC. In EMEA, Revenue ex-TAC grew 24%, or 16% at constant currency, to $100 million and represented 36% of total Revenue ex-TAC. In Asia-Pacific, Revenue ex-TAC grew 23%, or 25% at constant currency, to $55 million and represented 20% of total Revenue ex-TAC.\nFiscal Year 2017\nRevenue grew 28%, or 27% at constant currency, to $2,297 million (2016: $1,799 million). Revenue ex-TAC grew 29%, or 29% at constant currency, to $941 million (2016: $730 million). Revenue ex-TAC margin as a percentage of revenue was 41%, in line with expectations and growing by one percentage point compared with the prior year.\nIn the Americas, Revenue ex-TAC grew 33%, or 32% at constant currency, to $371 million and represented 39% of total Revenue ex-TAC. In EMEA, Revenue ex-TAC grew 25%, or 24% at constant currency, to $359 million and represented 38% of total Revenue ex-TAC. In Asia-Pacific, Revenue ex-TAC grew 29%, or 31% at constant currency, to $211 million and represented 22% of total Revenue ex-TAC.\nNet Income and Adjusted Net Income\nQ4 2017\nNet income increased 29% to $52 million (Q4 2016: $41 million). Net income available to shareholders of Criteo S.A. was $53 million, or $0.78 per share on a diluted basis (Q4 2016: $39 million, or $0.60 per share on a diluted basis). Adjusted net income, or net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of these adjustments, increased 47% to $82 million, or $1.21 per share on a diluted basis (Q4 2016: $55 million, or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis).\nFiscal Year 2017\nNet income increased 11% to $97 million (2016: $87 million). Net income available to shareholders of Criteo S.A. was $91 million, or $1.34 per share on a diluted basis (2016: $82 million, or $1.25 per share on a diluted basis). Adjusted net income increased 34% to $183 million, or $2.70 per share on a diluted basis (2016: $137 million, or $2.08 per share on a diluted basis).\nAdjusted EBITDA and Operating Expenses\nQ4 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 45%, or 36% at constant currency, to $120 million (Q4 2016: $83 million). This increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the strong Revenue ex-TAC performance across all regions, as well as continued operating leverage and a stronger focus on productivity across the organization. Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Revenue ex-TAC was 43% (Q4 2016: 37%).\nOperating expenses increased 18% to $175 million (Q4 2016: $148 million). Operating expenses, excluding the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension costs, restructuring costs, depreciation and amortization and acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, which we refer to as Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, increased 10% to $141 million (Q4 2016: $128 million). This reflects a more selective investment approach and an effective management of operating expenses, with a stronger focus on productivity across the organization.\nFiscal Year 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 38%, or 35% at constant currency, to $310 million (2016: $225 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Revenue ex-TAC was 33% (2016: 31%).\nOperating expenses increased 30% to $682 million (2016: $524 million). Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, increased 23% to $566 million (2016: $459 million). This increase is primarily related to the year-over-year growth in headcount in Research and Development (16%), Sales and Operations (7%) and General and Administrative (14%).\nCash Flow and Cash Position\nQ4 2017\nCash flow from operating activities increased 10% to $79 million (Q4 2016: $72 million). Free Cash Flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, grew 10% to $54 million (Q4 2016: $49 million).\nFiscal Year 2017\nCash flow from operating activities increased 60% to $245 million (2016: $153 million). Free Cash Flow grew 80% to $137 million (2016: $76 million). Total cash and cash equivalents were $414 million as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: $270 million).\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Criteo's expectations as of February 14, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nWe expect Revenue ex-TAC to be between $230 million and $235 million. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be between $60 million and $65 million.\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance:\nWe expect Revenue ex-TAC growth for fiscal year 2018 to be between 3% and 8% at constant currency. We expect Adjusted EBITDA margin for fiscal 2018 to between 28% and 30% of Revenue ex-TAC.\nThe above guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, assumes the following exchange rates for the main currencies impacting our business: a U.S. dollar-euro rate of 0.813, a U.S. dollar-Japanese Yen rate of 110, a U.S. dollar-British pound rate of 0.72 and a U.S. dollar-Brazilian real rate of 3.26.\nThe above guidance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, assumes the following exchange rates for the main currencies impacting our business: a U.S. dollar-euro rate of 0.840, a U.S. dollar-Japanese Yen rate of 114, a U.S. dollar-British pound rate of 0.76 and a U.S. dollar-Brazilian real rate of 3.30.\nThe above guidance assumes no acquisitions are completed during the quarter ending March 31, 2018, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.\nReconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC and Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of equity awards compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and its attachments include the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"): Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region, Revenue ex-TAC margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share, Free Cash Flow and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses. These measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nRevenue ex-TAC is our revenue excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (\"TAC\") generated over the applicable measurement period and Revenue ex-TAC by Region reflects our Revenue ex-TAC by our geographies. Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region and Revenue ex-TAC margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of TAC from revenue can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business and across our geographies. Accordingly, we believe that Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region and Revenue ex-TAC margin provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.Adjusted EBITDA is our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short‑ and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that by eliminating equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted Net Income is our net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of these adjustments. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that by eliminating equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of these adjustments, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. Accordingly, we believe that Free Cash Flow permits a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our available cash flows.\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses are our consolidated operating expenses adjusted to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization, equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration. The Company uses Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-term and long-term operational plans, and to assess and measure our financial performance and the ability of our operations to generate cash. We believe Non-GAAP Operating Expenses reflects our ongoing operating expenses in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. As a result, we believe that Non-GAAP Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our core operating performance and trends in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across periods. In addition, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses is a key component in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the key measures the Company uses to provide its quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community.\nPlease refer to the supplemental financial tables provided in the appendix of this press release for a reconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC to revenue, Revenue ex-TAC by Region to revenue by region, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted Net Income to net income, Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to operating expenses, in each case, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (1) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; and (2) other companies may report Revenue ex-TAC, Revenue ex-TAC by Region, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently or over different regions, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these measures alongside our U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue and net income.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclosure\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including projected financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, our expectations regarding our market opportunity and future growth prospects and other statements that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region are not measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of TAC from revenue and review of these measures by region can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; (b) other companies may report Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region or similarly titled measures but define the regions differently, which reduces their effectiveness as a comparative measure; and (c) other companies may report Revenue ex-TAC or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Revenue ex-TAC and Revenue, Traffic Acquisition Costs and Revenue ex-TAC by Region alongside our other U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans.

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.

We believe Non-GAAP Operating Expenses reflects our ongoing operating expenses in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. As a result, we believe that Non-GAAP Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our core operating performance and trends in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across periods. In addition, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses is a key component in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the key measures we use to provide our quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community.\nCRITEO S.A.\nDetailed Information on Selected Items\n(U.S. dollars in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\nYoY\nChange\n2016\n2017\nYoY\nChange\nEquity awards compensation expense\nResearch and development\n$\n2,860\n$\n6,355\n122\n%\n$\n12,108\n$\n21,093\n74\n%\nSales and operations\n5,816\n8,377\n44\n%\n16,838\n31,386\n86\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n4,553\n5,732\n26\n%\n14,313\n19,872\n39\n%\nTotal equity awards compensation expense\n13,229\n20,464\n55\n%\n43,259\n72,351\n67\n%\nPension service costs\nResearch and development\n52\n162\n212\n%\n211\n621\n194\n%\nSales and operations\n37\n63\n70\n%\n144\n247\n72\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n44\n96\n118\n%\n169\n363\n115\n%\nTotal pension service costs\n133\n321\n141\n%\n524\n1,231\n135\n%\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nCost of revenue\n10,623\n15,575\n47\n%\n38,469\n53,988\n40\n%\nResearch and development\n2,106\n2,369\n12\n%\n7,211\n11,226\n56\n%\nSales and operations\n2,153\n4,856\n126\n%\n7,757\n19,844\n156\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n1,308\n1,770\n35\n%\n3,342\n5,738\n72\n%\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense\n16,190\n24,570\n52\n%\n56,779\n90,796\n60\n%\nAcquisition-related costs\nGeneral and administrative\n980\n—\n(100)\n%\n2,921\n6\n(100)\n%\nTotal acquisition-related costs\n980\n—\n(100)\n%\n2,921\n6\n(100)\n%\nAcquisition-related deferred price consideration\nResearch and development\n(3)\n—\n(100)\n%\n85\n—\n(100)\n%\nTotal acquisition-related deferred price consideration\n(3)\n—\n(100)\n%\n85\n—\n(100)\n%\nRestructuring\nCost of revenue\n—\n—\n—\n%\n—\n2,497\n100\n%\nResearch and development\n—\n2,911\n100\n%\n—\n2,911\n100\n%\nSales and operations\n—\n1,135\n100\n%\n—\n1,825\n100\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n—\n11\n100\n%\n—\n123\n100\n%\nTotal restructuring\n$\n—\n$\n4,057\n100\n%\n$\n—\n$\n7,356\n100\n%\nCRITEO S.A.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to Net Income\n(U.S. dollars in thousands except share and per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\nYoY\nChange\n2016\n2017\nYoY\nChange\nNet income\n$\n40,740\n$\n52,368\n29\n%\n$\n87,329\n$\n96,659\n11\n%\nAdjustments:\nEquity awards compensation expense\n13,229\n20,464\n55\n%\n43,259\n72,351\n67\n%\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets\n986\n3,852\n291\n%\n4,131\n17,731\n329\n%\nAcquisition-related costs\n980\n—\n(100)\n%\n2,921\n6\n(100)\n%\nAcquisition-related deferred price consideration\n(3)\n—\n(100)\n%\n85\n—\n(100)\n%\nRestructuring costs\n—\n4,057\n100\n%\n—\n7,356\n100\n%\nTax impact of the above adjustments\n(432)\n1,088\n(352)\n%\n(948)\n(10,792)\n1,038\n%\nTotal net adjustments\n14,760\n29,461\n100\n%\n49,448\n86,652\n75\n%\nAdjusted net income (1)\n$\n55,500\n$\n81,829\n47\n%\n$\n136,777\n$\n183,311\n34\n%\nWeighted average shares outstanding\n- Basic\n63,760,491\n65,919,533\n63,337,792\n65,143,036\n- Diluted\n66,145,704\n67,770,156\n65,633,470\n67,851,971\nAdjusted net income per share\n- Basic\n$\n0.87\n$\n1.24\n43\n%\n$\n2.16\n$\n2.81\n30\n%\n- Diluted\n$\n0.84\n$\n1.21\n44\n%\n$\n2.08\n$\n2.70\n30\n%\n(1) We define Adjusted Net Income as our net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring costs, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments. Adjusted Net Income is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Adjusted Net Income because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the elimination of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and deferred price consideration, restructuring costs and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments in calculating Adjusted Net Income can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Net Income provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) Adjusted Net Income does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation or the impact of certain acquisition related costs; and (b) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Net Income or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted Net Income alongside our other U.S. GAAP-based financial results, including net income.\nCRITEO S.A.\nConstant Currency Reconciliation\n(U.S. dollars in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\nYoY\nChange\n2016\n2017\nYoY\nChange\nRevenue as reported\n$\n566,825\n$\n674,031\n19\n%\n$\n1,799,146\n$\n2,296,692\n28\n%\nConversion impact U.S. dollar/other currencies\n(14,916)\n(4,809)\nRevenue at constant currency (1)\n566,825\n659,115\n16\n%\n1,799,146\n2,291,883\n27\n%\nTraffic acquisition costs as reported\n(341,877)\n(397,087)\n16\n%\n(1,068,911)\n(1,355,556)\n27\n%\nConversion impact U.S. dollar/other currencies\n8,260\n2,186\nTraffic Acquisition Costs at constant currency (1)\n(341,877)\n(388,827)\n14\n%\n(1,068,911)\n(1,353,370)\n27\n%\nRevenue ex-TAC as reported (2)\n224,948\n276,944\n23\n%\n730,235\n941,136\n29\n%\nConversion impact U.S. dollar/other currencies\n(6,657)\n(2,624)\nRevenue ex-TAC at constant currency (2)\n224,948\n270,287\n20\n%\n730,235\n938,512\n29\n%\nRevenue ex-TAC (2) /Revenue as reported\n40\n%\n41\n%\n41\n%\n41\n%\nOther cost of revenue as reported\n(24,309)\n(31,727)\n31\n%\n(85,260)\n(121,641)\n43\n%\nConversion impact U.S. dollar/other currencies\n(17)\n(990)\nOther cost of revenue at constant currency (1)\n(24,309)\n(31,744)\n31\n%\n(85,260)\n(122,631)\n44\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)\n82,995\n119,928\n45\n%\n224,572\n309,584\n38\n%\nConversion impact U.S. dollar/other currencies\n(6,844)\n(5,655)\nAdjusted EBITDA (3) at constant currency (1)\n$\n82,995\n$\n113,084\n36\n%\n$\n224,572\n$\n303,929\n35\n%\n(1) Information herein with respect to results presented on a constant currency basis is computed by applying prior period average exchange rates to current period results.
