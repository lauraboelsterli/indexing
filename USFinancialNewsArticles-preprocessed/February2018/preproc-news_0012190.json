    "text": "LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - South Africa’s sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Tuesay and the cost of insuring exposure to its debt rose to a fresh one-month high as political deadlock over President Jacob Zuma’s future continued.\nZuma summoned cabinet ministers to a meeting in Cape Town on Tuesday, eNCA television reported, as pressure builds on the embattled 75-year-old leader to quit.\nThe 2041 Eurobond issue fell more than 0.7 cents to 109.1 cents, its lowest since mid-December according to Thomson Reuters data.\nFive-year credit default swaps rose 5 basis points (bps) from Monday’s close to 154 bps, according to IHS Markit data.
