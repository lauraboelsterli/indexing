    "text": "ALEXANDRIA, Va., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium is pleased to announce that Cate Lockhart, PharmD, PhD, has been appointed BBCIC Program Director. In this role, she will lead the development and growth of the multi-stakeholder research collaborative.\nBBCIC was convened by the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) in 2015 to address anticipated needs for post-market surveillance of biosimilars and their corresponding novel biologics.\n\"Cate takes the helm of BBCIC at a crucial time in the evolution of biosimilars entering the U.S. market,\" says AMCP CEO Susan A. Cantrell, RPh, CAE. \"A handful of biosimilars have been approved, but many more are poised to enter the market soon, making the task of BBCIC more important than ever. Cate brings a combination of clinical, economic and scientific expertise that will allow BBCIC to advance its mission.\"\nLockhart replaces previous Program Director Bernadette Eichelberger, who retired last year. Before coming to BBCIC, Lockhart was the Health Economics and Outcomes Research expert at Omeros, a small biopharmaceutical company based in Seattle, Wash. She also served as Research Team Coordinator for the BBCIC for over a year, working directly with the former Program Director to support research activities conducted throughout the past year. Prior to working in the pharmaceutical industry, Lockhart served as a consultant preparing formulary dossiers on behalf of drug and device manufacturers.\nLockhart has been active in AMCP since she was a pharmacy student, including competing in the student pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) competitions, and serving as student chapter president at the University of Washington. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theatre Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree in Visual Communications from the University of Idaho, a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington. She also holds a Doctor of Pharmacy, Master of Science in health economics and outcomes research, and a PhD in pharmaceutics also from the University of Washington.\nAbout BBCIC\nThe BBCIC is the only multi-stakeholder research network dedicated to monitoring biosimilars, and draws on large sets of de-identified medical and pharmacy data (100 million lives). Managed care and integrated delivery organizations have devoted significant resources to develop an infrastructure that makes possible active surveillance of biosimilars and novel in distributed research networks. The BBCIC marshals these resources for the important public health benefit inherit in monitoring biosimilar safety and effectiveness, using ongoing sequential analyses to compare biosimilars to their innovator product.
