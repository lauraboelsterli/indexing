    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NOW Inc. (NYSE: DNOW) announced results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call\nFebruary 14, 2018 8:00 a.m. CST 1 (800) 446-1671 (North America) 1 (847) 413-3362 (Outside North America) Webcast: ir.distributionnow.com\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $669 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 24 percent year over year, and down 4 percent sequentially versus a reduction in billing days of 5 percent. Net loss was $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $71 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income excluding other costs was $1 million compared to a loss of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted loss per share was $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.66 a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding other costs was $0.01 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a loss per share of $0.29 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EBITDA excluding other costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13 million compared to a loss of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in the fourth quarter of 2017 results, but not characterized as other costs, was a pre-tax gain of $10 million from the sale of a property previously held for sale, consistent with our treatment of similar gains and losses in prior periods.\nRefer to Supplemental Information in this release for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.\nRobert Workman, President and CEO of NOW Inc., added, “Through the downturn, we emerged a stronger, leaner and more agile organization. The year 2017 was transformative for DNOW in that we added $541 million in revenues, while continuing to lower costs, becoming a business more than 25% larger than it was in 2016. Incrementals were greater than 30%, signifying a solid financial recovery for DNOW and positioning us to capitalize on a growing market in 2018.”\nPrior to the earnings conference call a presentation titled “NOW Inc., Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Review & Key Takeaways” will be available on the Company’s Investor Relations website.\nAbout NOW Inc.\nNOW Inc. is one of the largest distributors to energy and industrial markets on a worldwide basis, with a legacy of over 150 years.

The non-GAAP financial measures include: (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) excluding other costs, (ii) net loss excluding other costs and (iii) diluted loss per share excluding other costs. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain other costs and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the schedules herein.\n(2) Other costs primarily includes the transaction costs associated with acquisition activity, including the cost of inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting and severance expenses which are included in operating loss.\n(3) EBITDA % excluding other costs is defined as EBITDA excluding other costs divided by Revenue.\n(4) Other costs, net of tax, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, included expenses of $3 million, $21 million, $39 million and $78 million, after tax, respectively, for a valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets; as well as, $1 million, $2 million, $1 million and $7 million, respectively, after tax, in transaction costs associated with acquisitions, including the cost of inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting related to acquisitions, and severance expenses, which are included in operating loss. The Company has excluded the impact of a $69 million tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $3 million tax benefit related to previously disallowed deductions on its valuation allowance in computing net income (loss) excluding other costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(5) Totals may not foot due to rounding.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214005416/en/\nNOW Inc.\nDaniel Molinaro, 281-823-4941\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSource: NOW Inc.",
