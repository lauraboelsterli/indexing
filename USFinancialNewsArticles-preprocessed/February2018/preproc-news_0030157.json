    "text": "HELSINKI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Mobile game maker Supercell said on Wednesday its core profit fell 20.5 percent last year, due to falling revenue for its five-year old hit game Clash of Clans.\nThe Helsinki-based firm, majority owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to 729 million euros ($900.97 million) last year from 917 million in 2016.\nCompany revenue dropped by 14 percent to 1.8 billion euros from 2.1 bln in 2016.\nChief Executive Ilkka Paananen told a news conference the amount of players in the West was not growing as fast as in the past. “We also did not release new games last year,” he said.\nSupercell has a catalogue of four games, which have around 100 million daily active players in total. It derives a significant amount of its revenue from in-game purchases.\nResearch company App Annie ranked Supercell the world’s fifth-biggest mobile game publisher last year, down from the No. 2 spot in 2016, based on revenue collected on Apple’s iOS and Google Play stores.\n$1 = 0.8091 euros Reporting by Tuomas Forsell\n ",
