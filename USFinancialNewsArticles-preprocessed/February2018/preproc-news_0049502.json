    "text": "TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unit Corporation (NYSE: UNT) today reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and year end 2017. Fourth quarter and year end highlights include:\nFourth quarter net income of $89.2 million, which reflects an $81.3 million net tax benefit related to tax legislation enacted in the quarter, and adjusted net income of $11.3 million. Oil and natural gas segment production increased 6% over the third quarter of 2017. Total year-end 2017 proved oil and natural gas reserves increased 27% over 2016. Replaced 300% of 2017 production with new reserves. Contract drilling segment placed its 10th BOSS rig into service in 2017; all ten BOSS rigs continuously operated under contract during the year. Average drilling rigs used in 2017 increased 72% over 2016. Midstream segment increased liquids sold and gas processed volumes 10% and 6%, respectively, over the third quarter.\nFOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nUnit recorded net income of $89.2 million for the quarter, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.7 million, or $0.03 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter included an $81.3 million income tax benefit associated with the revaluation of the net deferred tax liability due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted during the quarter by the U.S. government. Adjusted net income (which excludes the effect of non-cash commodity derivatives and the effect of the Tax Act) for the quarter was $11.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP financial measures below). Total revenues for the quarter were $204.8 million (49% oil and natural gas, 23% contract drilling, and 28% midstream), compared to $174.3 million (51% oil and natural gas, 19% contract drilling, and 30% midstream) for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $91.2 million, or $1.75 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP financial measures below).\nFor 2017, Unit recorded net income of $117.8 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $135.6 million, or a loss of $2.71 per share, for 2016. Net income for the year included the $81.3 million income tax benefit associated with the revaluation of the net deferred tax liability due to the Tax Act. Unit recorded adjusted net income (which excludes the effect of non-cash commodity derivatives and the effect of the Tax Act) of $27.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP financial measures below). Total revenues for the year were $739.6 million (48% oil and natural gas, 24% contract drilling, and 28% midstream), compared to $602.2 million (49% oil and natural gas, 20% contract drilling, and 31% midstream) for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $315.7 million, or $6.10 per diluted share (see Non-GAAP financial measures below).\nOIL AND NATURAL GAS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nFor the quarter, total equivalent production was 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), a 6% increase over the third quarter of 2017. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production represented 46% of total equivalent production. Oil production was 7,877 barrels per day. NGLs production was 13,713 barrels per day. Natural gas production was 151.6 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day. Total production for 2017 was 16.0 MMBoe, a 7% decrease from 2016.\nUnit’s average realized per barrel equivalent price for the quarter was $23.25, a 13% increase over the third quarter of 2017. Unit’s average natural gas price was $2.38 per Mcf, an increase of 1% over the third quarter of 2017. Unit’s average oil price was $54.45 per barrel, an increase of 15% over the third quarter of 2017. Unit’s average NGLs price was $21.88 per barrel, an increase of 19% over the third quarter of 2017. All prices in this paragraph include the effects of derivative contracts.\nIn the Wilcox area, Unit continued its exploration and recompletion programs during the quarter. In the Cherry Creek prospect, production from the Trinity #1 well was brought online with an initial 30-day production (IP30) rate of 6 MMcfe per day. The Trinity is a discovery well with several additional zones to be developed. Unit is planning to drill the second well in the prospect later in 2018. In the Brandt prospect, Unit successfully drilled and completed a new discovery well, the Engel #1, with an IP30 rate of 8.3 MMcfe per day. In addition, there were 10 new behind pipe recompletions, increasing combined production for those wells 16 MMcf per day and 500 barrels of oil per day at a cost of $3 million. Unit's plan for 2018 is for 13-15 recompletions and 10 new wells (8 vertical and 2 horizontal).\nIn the Texas Panhandle Granite Wash area, during the quarter, Unit completed the Dixon 5554 CXL #5H well and the Dixon 5554 CXL #6H well. The Dixon 5554 CXL #6H is Unit's first extended length lateral well targeting the B interval of the Granite Wash and had an IP30 rate of 9.4 MMcfe per day, which is above type curve expectations. Unit also drilled three of its longest laterals to date, which range from 8,700 feet to 9,700 feet, targeting the C1 interval of the Granite Wash. The three wells were completed in January and are in the early stages of flowing back. Unit's plan is to continuously operate at least one drilling rig in the Granite Wash during 2018, which is planned to result in 11 new extended length lateral wells.\nIn the Southern Oklahoma Hoxbar Oil Trend (SOHOT) area, during the quarter, Unit completed two new Marchand horizontal wells. Production for both wells was brought online in late November. The Nina #1-22H had an IP30 rate of 1,114 Boe per day and the Schmidt #1-10H had an IP30 rate of 691 Boe per day, both of which are above type curve expectations. Unit began drilling its first extended lateral Marchand well, the Schenk Trust 1-17HXL, in late November. Production from this well was brought online in late January with strong results at an IP20 rate of 2,468 Boe per day. During 2018, Unit plans to continue with a one rig drilling program, which should result in nine new wells, with six being extended lateral wells.\nIn western Oklahoma, Unit owns approximately 17,000 net acres in the STACK play. Unit continues its effort to acquire and concentrate its acreage position to facilitate horizontal well development, and Unit plans to initiate drilling in this area during the first quarter of 2018.\nLarry Pinkston, Unit’s Chief Executive Officer and President, said: “Our oil and natural gas segment had its third consecutive quarter of production growth. We are very pleased to be on a solid production growth trajectory. We continue to be encouraged by the results in each of our three core areas. All three have provided rates of return that compare favorably with other active basins.\"\nThis table illustrates certain comparative production, realized prices, and operating profit for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nChange Dec 31,\n2017\nSept 30,\n2017\nChange Dec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nChange Oil and NGLs Production, MBbl 1,986 1,983 — % 1,986 1,876 6 % 7,453 7,988 (7 )% Natural Gas Production, Bcf 13.9 13.4 4 % 13.9 13.1 7 % 51.3 55.7 (8 )% Production, MBoe 4,310 4,209 2 % 4,310 4,057 6 % 15,996 17,277 (7 )% Production, MBoe/day 46.8 45.8 2 % 46.8 44.1 6 % 43.8 47.2 (7 )% Avg.

(2) Operating profit before depreciation is calculated by taking operating revenues for this segment less operating expenses excluding depreciation, depletion, amortization, and impairment. (See Non-GAAP financial measures below.) YEAR END 2017 ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES\nThe discount rate (PV-10) value of Unit’s estimated year end 2017 proved reserves increased 56% over 2016 to $897.5 million. Estimated year end 2017 proved oil and natural gas reserves were 149.8 MMBoe, or 898.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalents (Bcfe), as compared with 117.8 MMBoe, or 706.6 Bcfe, at year end 2016, a 27% increase. Estimated reserves were 13% oil, 30% NGLs, and 57% natural gas.\nThe following details the changes to Unit’s proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves during 2017:\nOil\n(MMbls)\nNGLs\n(MMbls)\nNatural Gas\n(Bcf)\nProved\nReserves\n(MMBoe)\nProved Reserves, at December 31, 2016 15.7 34.5 405.6 117.8 Revisions of previous estimates 0.7 4.3 38.4 11.4 Extensions, discoveries, and other additions\n3.9 10.3 101.6 31.1 Purchases of minerals in place 2.0 1.2 15.3 5.8 Production (2.7 ) (4.7 ) (51.3 ) (16.0 ) Sales (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.9 ) (0.3 ) Proved Reserves, at December 31, 2017 19.5 45.5 508.7 149.8 Estimated 2017 year-end proved reserves included proved developed reserves of 113.0 MMBoe, or 677.8 Bcfe, (13% oil, 30% NGLs, and 57% natural gas) and proved undeveloped reserves of 36.8 MMBoe, or 220.9 Bcfe, (13% oil, 33% NGLs, and 54% natural gas). Overall, 75% of the estimated proved reserves are proved developed.\nThe present value of the estimated future net cash flows from 2017 estimated proved reserves (before income taxes and using a PV-10), is approximately $897.5 million. The present value was determined using the required SEC's pricing methodology. The aggregate price used for all future reserves was $51.34 per barrel of oil, $31.83 per barrel of NGLs, and $2.98 per Mcf of natural gas (then adjusted for price differentials). Unit’s 2017 year-end proved reserves were independently audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Their audit covered properties accounting for 86% of the discounted future net cash flow (PV-10). See below for the reconciliation of PV-10 to the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined by GAAP.\nPinkston said: \"Our goal is to replace at least 150% of each year's production with new reserves. In 2017, we achieved our goal by replacing 300% of production with new reserves, our second highest production replacement percentage in the last 15 years. We achieved this growth while maintaining a capital expenditure program in line with cash flow.\"\nCONTRACT DRILLING SEGMENT INFORMATION\nUnit's average number of drilling rigs working during the quarter was 31.2, a decrease of 10% from the third quarter of 2017. Per day drilling rig rates averaged $16,645, a 1% increase over the third quarter of 2017. Average per day operating margin for the quarter was $5,550 (before elimination of intercompany drilling rig profit of $0.6 million). This compares to third quarter 2017 average operating margin of $5,495 (before elimination of intercompany drilling rig profit of $0.6 million), an increase of 1%, or $55.\nPinkston said: “Our contract drilling segment's level of utilization grew through the third quarter to a high of 36 operating rigs. Utilization pared back in the fourth quarter as operators approached the limits of their 2017 capital budgets. We have 95 drilling rigs in our fleet after adding our tenth BOSS rig during the second quarter. All 10 of our BOSS rigs are under contract, and we currently have a total of 32 drilling rigs operating. Long-term contracts (contracts with original terms ranging from six months to two years in length) are in place for nine of our drilling rigs. Of the nine contracts, four are up for renewal in the first quarter of 2018, three in the second quarter, one in the fourth quarter and one in 2019.”\nThis table illustrates certain comparative results for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nChange Dec 31,\n2017\nSept 30,\n2017\nChange Dec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nChange Rigs Utilized 31.2 19.5 60 % 31.2 34.6 (10 )% 30.0 17.4 72 % Operating Profit Before Depreciation (MM) (1) $ 15.3 $ 11.6 31 % $ 15.3 $ 16.9 (9 )% $ 52.1 $ 33.9 54 % (1) Operating profit before depreciation is calculated by taking operating revenues for this segment less operating expenses excluding depreciation. (See Non-GAAP financial measures below.) MIDSTREAM SEGMENT INFORMATION\nFor the quarter, gas processed and liquids sold volumes per day increased 6% and 10%, respectively, while gas gathered volumes per day remained relatively unchanged, as compared to the third quarter of 2017. Operating profit (as defined in the footnote below) for the quarter was $13.1 million, a decrease of 2% from the third quarter of 2017.\nFor 2017, per day gas gathered and gas processed volumes decreased 8% and 11%, respectively, while liquids sold volumes remained relatively unchanged as compared to 2016. Operating profit (as defined in the footnote below) for 2017 was $51.7 million, an increase of 7% over 2016.\nThis table illustrates certain comparative results for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nChange Dec 31,\n2017\nSept 30,\n2017\nChange Dec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nChange Gas Gathering, Mcf/day 383,319 423,669 (10 )% 383,319 383,787 — % 385,209 419,217 (8 )% Gas Processing, Mcf/day 148,422 140,719 5 % 148,422 140,246 6 % 137,625 155,461 (11 )% Liquids Sold, Gallons/day 581,874 535,253 9 % 581,874 530,028 10 % 534,140 536,494 — % Operating Profit Before Depreciation and Amortization (MM) (1) $ 13.1 $ 14.7 (11 )% $ 13.1 $ 13.3 (2 )% $ 51.7 $ 48.3 7 % (1) Operating profit before depreciation is calculated by taking operating revenues for this segment less operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization. (See Non-GAAP financial measures below.) Pinkston said: “Our midstream segment operated in ethane rejection mode during the quarter at all processing facilities except Bellmon and Cashion, where it is more beneficial to recover under the existing contracts. Processing and liquids sold volumes reflected quarter over quarter improvement due to increasing processing volumes at the Hemphill and Cashion facilities. Overall, our midstream segment continues to post solid results as operator activity levels increase; in fact, we set a new record operating profit before depreciation and amortization for the year.”\n2018 CAPITAL BUDGET AND PRODUCTION GUIDANCE\nPinkston said: \"The outlook for commodity prices continues to be volatile. We continue to be diligent with our capital expenditure plans to maintain our spending in line with anticipated cash flow plus any proceeds derived from non-core asset sales. Our focus is to continue to grow all three business segments while retaining the financial discipline our shareholders have grown to expect.\"\nUnit's 2018 capital expenditures budget is $352 million, which represents a 27% increase over 2017, excluding acquisitions. The capital expenditures plan by segment is: $272 million for the oil and natural gas segment, $47 million for the contract drilling segment, and $32 million for the midstream segment, representing an increase of 26%, 30% and 44%, respectively, over 2017. The budget for the year includes no costs for potential acquisitions and is based on prices, after applying differentials and hedges, averaging $53.19 per barrel for oil, $22.18 per barrel for NGLs, and $2.16 per Mcf for natural gas. As always, Unit's capital budget is subject to periodic review based on prevailing conditions.\nIn 2017, year over year production in Unit's oil and natural gas segment declined 7%; however, in each of the last three quarters of 2017 production grew sequentially. It is anticipated that 2018 production should grow to 17.1 to 17.4 MMBoe, or 7% to 9% year over year from 2017.\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION\nUnit ended the quarter with long-term debt of $820.3 million, consisting of $642.3 million of senior subordinated notes (net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs) and $178.0 million of borrowings under the company's credit agreement. During October, Unit's borrowing base was re-determined with no resulting change. Under the credit agreement, the amount Unit can borrow is the lesser of the amount it elects as the commitment amount ($475 million) or the value of its borrowing base as determined by the lenders ($475 million).\nWEBCAST\nUnit uses its website to disclose material nonpublic information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Those disclosures will be included on its website in the 'Investor Information' sections. Accordingly, investors should monitor that portion of the website, besides following the press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.\nUnit will webcast its fourth quarter earnings conference call live over the Internet on February 22, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern).

The adjusted net income is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standard Measure\nDecember 31, 2017\nPV-10 is the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent before giving effect to income taxes. Standardized Measure is the after-tax estimated future cash flows from proved reserves discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent, determined under GAAP. The company uses PV-10 as one measure of the value of its proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves among exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. The company believes that securities analysts and rating agencies use PV-10 in similar ways. The company’s management believes PV-10 is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike Standardized Measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend principally on the characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves.
