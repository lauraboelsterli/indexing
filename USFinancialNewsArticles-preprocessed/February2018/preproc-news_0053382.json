Forward-looking statements reflect current views with respect to future events, and therefore, cannot be guaranteed. Such statements are based on the current expectations and certain assumptions of the Company's management, and some or all of such expectations and assumptions may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual results. Actual results may also vary materially from forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and other factors, known and unknown, associated with such statements, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which could cause the actual results to be materially different than those that may be anticipated. Examples of such risks and uncertainties include factors described from time to time in the Company's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (including without limitation the \"Risk Factors\" discussed in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 14, 2017 for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on June 29, 2017 for the year ended March 31, 2017, Registration Statement Amendment No. 2 on Form S-4/A filed on November 9, 2017, and Rule 424(b)(3) prospectus filed on November 15, 2017). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any expectations or assumptions underlying the relevant forward-looking statements prove incorrect, the actual results may vary materially from those described in such statements as being expected, anticipated, intended, planned, believed, sought, estimated or projected. Investors and other readers, therefore, should not place reliance on any forward-looking statements or use any historical trends to anticipate or predicate results or trends in future periods. Any statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date hereof, except as required by law, and also undertakes no obligation to correct or update information prepared by third parties.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:\nGary Augusta\nPresident\nApollo Medical Holdings, Inc.\n(818) 839-5200\ngaugusta@apollomed.net\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apollo-medical-holdings-changed-its-fiscal-year-end-300603488.html\nSOURCE Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.",
