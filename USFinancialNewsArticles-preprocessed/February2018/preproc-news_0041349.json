    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Navigators Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NAVG) reported Net Income of $26.9 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $21.6 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. Net Operating Earnings1 were $24.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $17.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). As a result of the Tax Act, The Navigators Group, Inc. (“Navigators” or the “Company”) recognized additional income tax expense of $19.7 million which reduced Net Income in the fourth quarter.\nGross Written Premiums and Net Written Premiums for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $408.7 million and $304.9 million, respectively, increasing 11.2% and 7.8%, respectively, from the comparable period in 2016. Our Combined Ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 96.6%, compared to 96.7% for the same period in 2016.\nNet Investment Income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $23.0 million, an increase of 14.3% as compared to the same period in 2016. Our annualized pre-tax investment yield, excluding Net Realized Gains and Losses and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings, was 2.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.5% for the same period in 2016.\nOther Income (Loss) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(3.2) million, compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2016, and primarily consists of realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, our Company reported Net Income of $40.5 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared to $82.7 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. Net Operating Earnings were $35.0 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, for the full year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $71.2 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.\nGross Written Premiums and Net Written Premiums for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, increasing 9.2% and 7.2%, respectively, from the comparable period in 2016. Our Combined Ratio for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was 103.2%, compared to 96.7% for the same period in 2016.\nIn addition to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, the full year results also include Net Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses and related net reinsurance reinstatement premiums totaling $71.3 million from Hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey and the Puebla, Mexico Earthquake, as well as prior accident year reserve strengthening of $34.3 million.\nNet Investment Income for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $89.3 million, an increase of 12.4% as compared to the same period in 2016. Our pre-tax investment yield, excluding Net Realized Gains and Losses and Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings, was 2.7% for the full year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2.6% for the same period in 2016.\nOther Income (Loss) for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $(4.2) million, compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2016, and primarily consists of realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses.\nStan Galanski, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased to report solidly profitable results for the fourth quarter. Both the U.S. Insurance and Global Reinsurance segments produced excellent underwriting results, with combined ratios of 91.3% and 90.9% respectively. We grew Gross Written Premium by 11.2% and are well positioned to capitalize on anticipated growth opportunities emanating from the ongoing strength of the U.S. economy as well as targeted specialty niches globally. Net Investment Income was up 14.3% over fourth quarter 2017. In December, we opted to liquidate our actively managed common equity holdings, realizing pre-tax gains of $37.1 million. While the recently enacted Tax Act adversely impacted our fourth quarter results, we anticipate positive benefits of a lower corporate tax rate beginning in 2018. During the quarter, we announced the proposed acquisition of a Belgium-based specialty underwriting manager and insurance company, which we expect to close in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approval. This is an important part of our post-Brexit strategy.”\nOur Company’s investment portfolio mainly consists of fixed income securities with an average quality rating of “AA-/Aa3” as defined by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, with an effective duration of 3.5 years as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Net Unrealized Gains within our investment portfolio were $41.5 million, a decrease of $(45.8) million compared to September 30, 2017. We recognized $37.1 million of Net Realized Gains for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.0 million of Net Realized Gains for the same period in 2016. For the full year ended December 31, 2017 we recognized $43.0 million of Net Realized Gains (inclusive of Net Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings), compared to $9.0 million of Net Realized Gains (inclusive of Net Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings) for the same period in 2016. The increase in Net Realized Gains (inclusive of Net Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings) for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 was primarily related to the liquidation of our common equity portfolio in December 2017 as we reassess our actively managed common equity strategy.\nStockholders’ Equity was $1.2 billion, or $41.55 per share, as of December 31, 2017 compared to $41.49 per share, as of September 30, 2017 and $40.45 per share, as of December 31, 2016.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, our Company declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share of Common Stock.\nOn February 15, 2018 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our Company’s Common Stock of $0.07 per share, payable on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2018. This represents an increase of 16.7% over the prior quarter dividend.\nOur Company will hold a conference call on Friday, February 16, 2018 starting at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss the 2017 fourth quarter results. The call will be available via live webcast on Navigators’ website ( www.navg.com ).\nTo participate by telephone, the domestic dial-in number is 800-850-2903 and the international dial-in is 224-357-2399.
