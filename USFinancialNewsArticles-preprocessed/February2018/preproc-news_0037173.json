(NYSE: CBZ) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Reform Act\"), the Company reduced its net deferred tax liability by approximately $2.5 million. The information below includes reported results and results adjusted to eliminate the impact of the Tax Reform Act for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. A table outlining the impact of the Tax Reform Act is attached.\nFor the 2017 fourth quarter, CBIZ reported revenue of $195.1 million, an increase of $16.3 million, or 9.1%, over the $178.8 million reported in 2016. Same-unit revenue increased by $6.9 million, or 3.9%, for the quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. Acquisitions contributed $9.4 million, or 5.2%, to revenue in the quarter. CBIZ reported income from continuing operations of $4.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $0.6 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Eliminating the $2.5 million impact of the Tax Reform Act, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $8.9 million, compared with $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full-year ended December 31, 2017, CBIZ reported revenue of $855.3 million, an increase of $55.5 million, or 6.9%, over the $799.8 million recorded for 2016. Same-unit revenue increased by $17.5 million, or 2.2%, compared with the same period a year ago. Acquisitions contributed $38.0 million, or 4.7%, to revenue growth. Income from continuing operations was $51.0 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the full-year 2017, compared with $40.6 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Eliminating the impact of the Tax Reform Act, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.87 for the full year 2017, which is a 14.5% increase over the $0.76 for full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $104.0 million, compared with $94.8 million for 2016.\nJerry Grisko, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBIZ, said, \"We are very pleased with our fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2017. Total Company revenue grew by 9.1% in the fourth quarter, and 6.9% for the full year. Eliminating the one-time year-end impact of the Tax Reform Act, we reported a 14.5% increase in earnings per share for the year, which was within our guidance. We are also pleased with the performance of the four acquisitions we completed during 2017.\"\nGrisko continued, \"As we look ahead to 2018, the continued positive economic environment along with the recent changes to the tax law create favorable conditions for growth in demand for our services. In addition, the Tax Reform Act is expected to reduce our effective tax rate by approximately 10%. We expect all of these factors to contribute to enhanced earnings and cash flow in 2018, which will afford us an opportunity to accelerate investments in the business to enhance long-term growth,\" concluded Grisko.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects growth in total revenue within a range of 5% to 8%. The Company expects to report an effective tax rate of approximately 25% as a result of the Tax Reform Act, although a number of factors may impact the tax rate. The Company expects a weighted average fully diluted share count of approximately 56.0 million shares for full-year 2018. The Company expects to achieve growth in fully diluted earnings per share within a range of 13% to 17% over the $0.92 reported for 2017. Adjusted for the one-time 2017 impact of the Tax Reform Act, the Company expects to achieve growth within a range of 20% to 24% over the adjusted $0.87 reported for 2017.\nConference Call\nCBIZ will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. (ET) today to discuss its results.
