(NYSE:FBM), one of the largest specialty building product distributors of wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and mechanical insulation in North America, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“2017 was a milestone year for Foundation Building Materials as we completed our first year as a publicly traded company, posted record financial results, and significantly expanded our geographic footprint in the markets we serve,” said Ruben Mendoza, President and CEO. “We recorded solid fourth quarter financial performance, highlighted by year-over-year net sales growth of 11.8%, earnings per share of $1.77 compared to a net loss per share of $0.29 in the prior year period and adjusted earnings per share (1) of $0.19 compared to a loss of $0.09 per share in the prior year. While base business net sales expanded $4.0 million, or 2.1%, our sustained pricing discipline led to aggregate price increases across our business segments and consolidated gross margins of 29.7%, a record level of profitability for our company.”\n2017 Fourth Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $516.8 million compared to $462.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $54.6 million, or 11.8%. Net sales from acquired branches and those that were strategically combined with existing branches increased by $50.6 million period over period. Base business net sales increased $4.0 million, or 2.1%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $153.6 million compared to $132.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $21.3 million, or 16.2%. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and contributions from 2017 acquisitions. Gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was 29.7% compared to 28.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in margins in wallboard and suspended ceiling systems.\nSelling, general, and administrative, or SG&A, expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $117.5 million compared to $110.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $7.4 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 22.7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 23.8% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower transaction costs and improved operating efficiencies.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $75.9 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, which was an increase of $84.7 million, compared to a net loss of $8.8 million, or $0.29 net loss per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increased primarily due to the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, which decreased the Company’s undiscounted liability under its Tax Receivable Agreement by $68.0 million from $203.8 million at September 30, 2017 to $135.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $36.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) was 7.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Segment Results\nSpecialty Building Products (“SBP”). SBP net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $443.7 million compared to $400.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $43.2 million, or 10.8%. Net sales from acquired branches that were strategically combined with existing branches increased by $39.2 million period-over-period. The increase in SBP net sales is primarily due to contributions from acquisitions and higher net sales from wallboard and complementary and other products.\nSBP gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $133.2 million compared to $115.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $18.2 million, or 15.8%. SBP gross profit increased with higher sales volume and contributions from 2017 acquisitions. SBP gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was 30.0% compared to 28.7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in SBP gross margin was primarily due to the Company's disciplined pricing approach and improved purchasing power.\nMechanical Insulation (“MI”). MI net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $73.1 million compared to $61.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $11.4 million, or 18.4%. The increase was primarily due to higher net sales to industrial end markets.\nMI gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $20.5 million compared to $17.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $3.2 million, or 18.6%. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. MI gross margin was 28.0% for both the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\n2017 Full Year Results\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $2,060.9 million compared to $1,392.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $668.4 million, or 48.0%. Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined contributed $624.0 million of the increase. Base business net sales increased $44.4 million, or 5.8% year-over-year, due to continued organic growth initiatives.\nConsolidated gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $597.9 million compared to $396.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $201.1 million, or 50.7%. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in sales volume and contributions from acquisitions. Consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.0% compared to 28.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSG&A expenses were $461.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $328.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $132.8 million, or 40.4%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower transaction costs and improved operating efficiencies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $82.5 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, an increase of $110.9 million, compared to a net loss of $28.4 million, or $0.95 net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) was 7.3%.\n2017 Full Year Segment Results\nSBP. SBP net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $1,790.1 million compared to $1,293.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $496.6 million, or 38.4%. Net sales from acquired branches and existing branches that were strategically combined contributed $452.2 million of the net sales increase, primarily due to the acquisition of Winroc-SPI in August 2016. SBP base business net sales also increased by $44.4 million, or 5.8%, due to market share gains in the Company's wallboard and suspended ceiling systems and also in complementary and other products.\nSBP gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $522.2 million compared to $371.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $150.5 million, or 40.5%. SBP gross profit increased with higher sales volume from both acquired and base business branches. SBP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 29.2% compared to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to continued pricing discipline across the markets the Company serves and improved purchasing power.\nMI. MI net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $270.8 million compared to $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company entered the mechanical insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016; therefore, there was a shorter period of sales in this segment during the prior year.\nMI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $75.7 million compared to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $50.6 million. The increase in MI gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, is primarily due to the timing of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August 2016 and reflects a partial year of results in 2016. MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, was 27.9% as compared to 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the adjustment for fair market value adjustments of $0.1 million and $2.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, MI gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 28.0% as compared to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the fair value adjustments, the 30 basis point increase in MI gross margin was primarily due to operational efficiencies.\nAcquisitions\nFoundation Building Materials supplements organic growth with strategic acquisitions. During 2017, the Company completed 10 acquisitions totaling 19 branches. The 10 acquisitions contributed $78.4 million of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nExpected Debt Refinancing\nThe Company is actively exploring the refinancing of its $575.0 million senior secured term notes, or Notes, which currently carry a coupon rate of 8.25%. In the third quarter of 2018, the premium prepayment of these Notes will decrease, and the Company will have opportunities to refinance the Notes, which could provide estimated annual cash interest savings of $10.0 million to $15.0 million. As Foundation Building Materials continues to optimize its capital structure and operating efficiencies, the Company expects its generation of cash flow to improve, which will allow Foundation Building Materials to further reduce its leverage in the next couple of years.\nFourth Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call\nIn conjunction with this release, Foundation Building Materials, Inc. will host a conference call today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018, at 9:00 AM Eastern Time.

Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) Financial Measures\nIn addition to results under GAAP, this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), which are provided as supplemental measures of financial performance. These measures are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unrealized (gains) losses on derivative financial instruments, IPO and public company readiness expenses, stock-based compensation, non-recurring adjustments such as non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, hurricane related costs, transaction costs, management fees and changes in the value of the tax receivable agreement liability. We calculate Adjusted net income as net income (loss) before unrealized (gains) losses on derivative financial instruments, IPO and public company readiness expenses, stock-based compensation, non-recurring adjustments such as non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, hurricane related costs, transaction costs, management fees and changes in the value of the tax receivable agreement liability and the effect of income taxes related to these adjustments. We calculate Adjusted EPS as Adjusted net income on a per weighted average share outstanding basis.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are presented because they are important metrics used by management as a means by which it assesses financial performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, provides investors with an additional financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our company and its results of operations.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income and earnings per share, or as any other measure of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are not intended to be liquidity measures. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use these measures or may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure, net income (loss) (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 75,892 $ (8,804 ) Interest expense, net 15,851 15,303 Income tax benefit (7,239 ) (9,375 ) Depreciation and amortization 19,698 17,773 EBITDA 104,202 14,897 Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative financial instrument (14 ) 7,271 IPO and public company readiness expenses 157 — Stock-based compensation 220 — Non-cash purchase accounting effects (a) (127 ) 96 Loss on disposal of property and equipment 73 1,548 Transaction costs (b) 411 — Management fees (c) — 903 Decrease in TRA liability (d) (68,033 ) — Adjusted EBITDA $ 36,889 $ 24,715 Adjusted EBITDA margin (e) 7.1 % 5.3 % (a) Adjusts for the effect of the purchase accounting step-up in the value of inventory to fair value recognized in cost of goods sold as a result of acquisitions.
