    "text": "Liz Hoffman \nWall Street CEOs are getting paid the big bucks again. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.02% and Citigroup Inc. C, -0.34% said Friday that they gave their CEOs raises for 2017, meaning all five large U.S. banks with significant trading and investment-banking operations have done so. \nThe chief executives of the banks, which include JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.72% , Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.75% , and Morgan Stanley MS, -0.47% , were paid on average $25.3 million for their work last year, up 17% from 2016, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For the group as a whole, combined total compensation of about $126 million is the highest annual tally since before the financial crisis. \nThe gains mark the fifth consecutive year in which pay rose for Wall Street’s top CEOs. In 2017, the increases reflected stronger profits for banks driven by a growing economy, rising employment, loosening regulations under President Donald Trump and an improving interest-rate backdrop for lending.",
