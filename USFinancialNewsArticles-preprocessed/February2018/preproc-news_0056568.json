    "text": "(Adds further details from court)\nBy Nate Raymond\nBOSTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Four former employees at a firm that advises companies on shareholder votes went on trial on Monday, in a case that prosecutors say shows how secret corporate information can be misused for purposes other than insider trading.\nEmployees at Georgeson LLC, a leading proxy solicitation firm owned by Computershare Ltd, bribed someone working at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) for details about how the proxy adviser’s investor clients voted on shareholder proposals, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen told a federal jury in Boston.\nThe bribes to ISS employee Brian Bennett came in the form of $14,000 worth of tickets to events like a Boston Red Sox baseball game and a concert featuring the band U2, Rosen said in his opening statement.\nRosen said the goal of the Georgeson employees - Michael Sedlak, Donna Ackerly, Charles Garske and Richard Gottcent - was to gain an illegal edge in their work representing companies on shareholder votes.\n“The defendants bought secrets, secrets to which they were not entitled,” Rosen said.\nDefense lawyers argued their clients did not commit wire fraud or honest services wire fraud and said the information Bennett supplied was not materially different from what Georgeson could obtain from public sources or the investors themselves.\n“The government can’t just come in here and say that it’s confidential,” Justine Harris, Garske’s lawyer, told jurors. “Saying it so doesn’t make it so.”\nIn November, Georgeson agreed to pay $4.5 million and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve related charges.\nProsecutors said Bennett from 2007 to 2012 used his job at ISS to supply Sedlak with information about how shareholders voted.\nSedlak forwarded the information to Georgeson employees Ackerly, Garske, Gottcent and Keith Haynes, some of whom then provided it to their corporate clients, prosecutors said.\nRosen said Ackerly and Garske also arranged to have the bribes billed to clients using invoices that included false descriptions, such as “courier services.”\nWhile Rosen acknowledged Georgeson could have sought the information Bennett provided directly from investors, he said most institutional investors do not disclose such info and that other methods to predict a vote’s outcome were not exact.\nBennett and Haynes have pleaded guilty and are expected to testify for the prosecution. ISS in 2013 paid $300,000 to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it failed to safeguard client information.\nReporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
