(NASDAQ:LPLA) (the “Company”) today announced results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, reporting net income of $64 million, or $0.69 per share. This compares with $42 million, or $0.46 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $58 million, or $0.63 per share, in the prior quarter.\n“We delivered another solid quarter capping a year of consistent business and financial results,” said Dan Arnold, president and CEO. “We onboarded the first group of advisors from our NPH acquisition in December and the second group of advisors will join us in February. As we look forward to 2018, we remain focused on our strategic priorities of growing our core business and executing with excellence.”\n“We drove operating leverage, grew earnings, and created shareholder value in 2017,” said Matt Audette, CFO. “As we look ahead to 2018, the combined benefit of a strong macro environment, tax reform, and onboarding of NPH is likely to increase our cash flow generation and provide more flexibility to deploy capital. We will continue to be disciplined in our approach as we evaluate the best way to deploy this capital, with a focus on investing for organic growth, taking advantage of M&A opportunities if they arise, and returning capital to shareholders.”\nAdditional Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial and Business Highlights\nNPH Update\n• Onboarded $34.4 billion in Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets, including $26.7 billion in brokerage assets and $7.7 billion in advisory assets, and 953 advisors as of year-end.\n• Q4 onboarding expenses were $17 million, including $7 million of Core G&A expense and $10 million of promotional expense. These expenses, combined with $3 million of Core G&A expense in Q3, make $20 million of onboarding expense in 2017, which were included in the Company’s estimated total onboarding costs of approximately $40 to $60 million.\n• Q4 financial assistance was $44 million, including $32 million provided as forgivable loans and $12 million provided as cash assistance and expensed in Q4. This assistance was included in the Company’s estimated financial assistance of around $100 million.\n• Recorded $98 million in intangible assets and $62 million in goodwill in December related to the Wave 1 onboarding of NPH assets. This increased Q4 amortization of intangible assets expense by $1 million sequentially.\nCapital Management\nThe Company returned capital to shareholders totaling $53 million in Q4 2017 and $204 million in full-year 2017, translating to $0.57 per share for Q4 and $2.21 per share for 2017 respectively. Deployed $30 million of capital to repurchase 603 thousand shares at an average price of $49.76 per share in Q4 2017. This contributed to a total of $114 million of capital deployed to repurchase 2.6 million shares at an average price of $43.42 per share in 2017. Increased the Company’s share repurchase authorization up to an aggregate of $500 million of its issued and outstanding common stock. Paid dividends of $23 million on November 27, 2017. This contributed to $90 million of total dividends paid in 2017. Capital expenditures were primarily driven by technology spend and totaled $26 million in Q4 and $112 million for 2017. Cash available for corporate use was $439 million as of quarter-end, and Credit Agreement Net Leverage Ratio, which only applies to the revolving credit facility, was 2.81x, down 0.40x from the prior quarter. After applying $300 million of cash available for corporate use to Credit Agreement Net Debt, this left an additional $139 million of cash, which if applied to the debt, would further reduce the Credit Agreement Net Leverage Ratio to 2.63x.\nConference Call and Additional Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its results at 5:00 p.m. EST on Thursday, Feb. 1.

A Registered Investment Advisor, Member FINRA/SIPC.\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement believes that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures by excluding or including certain items can be helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use this information to analyze the Company’s current performance, prospects, and valuation. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures and metrics discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the performance of the Company.\nEPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets is defined as EPS plus Amortization of Intangible Assets expense, net of applicable tax benefit, divided by the number of shares outstanding for the applicable period. The Company presents EPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric to investors because it provides greater insight into the Company’s core operating performance by excluding non-cash items that management does not believe impact the Company’s ongoing operations. EPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP EPS or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of EPS Prior to Amortization of Intangible Assets to net income, please see footnote 31 on page 22 of this release.\nGross Profit is calculated as net revenues, which were $1,116 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, less commission and advisory expenses and brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees, which were $698 million and $15 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. All other expense categories, including depreciation and amortization, are considered general and administrative in nature. Because the Company’s gross profit amounts do not include any depreciation and amortization expense, the Company considers its gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP measures that may not be comparable to those of others in its industry. Management believes that Gross Profit can be useful to investors because it shows the Company’s core operating performance before indirect costs that are general and administrative in nature.\nCore G&A consists of total operating expenses, which were $1,008 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, excluding the following expenses: commission and advisory, regulatory charges, promotional, employee share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangible assets, and brokerage, clearing, and exchange. Management presents Core G&A because it believes Core G&A reflects the corporate operating expense categories over which management can generally exercise a measure of control, compared with expense items over which management either cannot exercise control, such as commission and advisory expenses, or which management views as promotional expense necessary to support advisor growth and retention including conferences and transition assistance. Core G&A is not a measure of the Company’s total operating expenses as calculated in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of Core G&A against the Company’s total operating expenses, please see footnote 3 on page 20 of this release. The Company does not provide an outlook for its total operating expenses because it contains expense components, such as commission and advisory expenses, that are market-driven and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Accordingly a reconciliation of the Company’s outlook for Core G&A to an outlook for total operating expenses cannot be made available without unreasonable effort. Prior to 2016, the Company calculated Core G&A as consisting of total operating expenses, excluding the items described above, as well as excluding other items that primarily consisted of acquisition and integration costs resulting from various acquisitions and organizational restructuring and conversion costs. Beginning with results reported for Q1 2016, Core G&A was presented as including these items that were historically adjusted out.\nEBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the Company’s EBITDA can differ significantly from EBITDA calculated by other companies, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.\nCredit Agreement EBITDA is defined in, and calculated by management in accordance with, the Company's credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) as “Consolidated EBITDA,” which is Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and other adjustments, including unusual or non-recurring charges and gains, and to include future expected cost savings, operating expense reductions or other synergies from certain transactions, including the NPH acquisition. The Company presents Credit Agreement EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company’s debt capacity and covenant compliance under its Credit Agreement. Credit Agreement EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the Company’s Credit Agreement-defined EBITDA can differ significantly from adjusted EBITDA calculated by other companies, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, capital investments, and types of adjustments made by such companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release regarding the Company's future financial and operating results, outlook, success in recruiting and onboarding advisors from the broker/dealer network of National Planning Holdings, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's historical performance and its plans, estimates, and expectations as of February 1, 2018. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “plans,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees that the future results, plans, intentions, or expectations expressed or implied by the Company will be achieved. Matters subject to forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including economic, legislative, regulatory, competitive, and other factors, which may cause actual financial or operating results, levels of activity, or the timing of events, to be materially different than those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include: changes in general economic and financial market conditions, including retail investor sentiment; fluctuations in the value of advisory and brokerage assets; fluctuations in levels of net new assets and the related impact on revenue; fluctuations in the number of retail investors served by the Company; effects of competition in the financial services industry and the success of the Company in attracting and retaining financial advisors and institutions; changes in the number of the Company's financial advisors and institutions, and their ability to market effectively financial products and services; whether the retail investors served by newly-recruited advisors choose to open accounts and/or move their respective assets to new accounts at the Company; changes in interest rates and fees payable by banks participating in the Company's cash sweep program, the Company's strategy and success in managing cash sweep program fees; changes in the growth and profitability of the Company's fee-based business; the effect of current, pending and future legislation, regulation and regulatory actions, including changes in the retail retirement savings area and disciplinary actions imposed by federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations; the costs of settling and remediating issues related to pending or future regulatory matters or legal proceedings; execution of the Company's capital management plans, including its compliance with the terms of its existing credit agreement and the indenture governing its senior notes; the price, the availability of shares, and trading volumes of the Company's common stock, which will affect the timing and size of future share repurchases by the Company; changes made to the Company’s offerings and services, and the effect that such changes may have on the Company’s gross profit streams and costs; execution of the Company's plans and its success in realizing the expense savings, service improvements, and/or efficiencies expected to result from its initiatives and programs; the Company's success in negotiating and developing commercial arrangements with third-party services providers; the performance of third-party service providers to which business processes are transitioned from the Company; the Company's ability to control operating risks, information technology systems risks, cybersecurity risks, and sourcing risks; and the other factors set forth in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in the Company's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as may be amended or updated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or subsequent filings with the SEC. In particular, the Company can provide no assurance that the assets reported as serviced by NPH financial advisors will translate into assets serviced at LPL Financial or that such financial advisors will join LPL Financial or remain at LPL Financial. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include: difficulties and delays in recruiting or transferring the licenses of NPH’s advisors and/or onboarding the clients or businesses of NPH’s advisors; disruptions of the Company’s business due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors making it more difficult to maintain relationships with its financial advisors and their clients, employees, other business partners or governmental entities; the choice by clients of NPH’s advisors not to open brokerage and/or advisory accounts at LPL Financial and/or move their respective assets from NPH to a new account at LPL Financial; and effects of competition in the financial services industry, including competitors’ success in recruiting NPH’s advisors. Except as required by law, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this earnings release, even if its estimates change, and you should not rely on statements contained herein as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nLPL Financial Holdings Inc.

Prior to Q4 2017, Management calculated OPEX ROA by dividing annualized operating expenses for the period by Total Brokerage and Advisory Assets at the end of the period. Amounts in this release reflect this new methodology. EBIT ROA is calculated as Gross Profit ROA less OPEX ROA. Reflects retention of commission and advisory revenues, calculated by deducting the prior year production of the annualized year-to-date attrition rate, over the prior year total production. Recurring Gross Profit Rate refers to the percentage of the Company’s gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, that was recurring for the period presented. Management tracks recurring gross profit, a characterization of gross profit and a statistical measure, which is defined to include the Company’s revenues from asset-based fees, advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep programs, and certain other fees that are based upon client accounts and advisors, less the expenses associated with such revenues and certain other recurring expenses not specifically associated with a revenue line. Management allocates such other recurring expenses, such as non-GDC sensitive production expenses, on a pro-rata basis against specific revenue lines at its discretion. Capital Allocation per Share equals the amount of capital allocated for share repurchases and cash dividends divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
