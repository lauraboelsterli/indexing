    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- J etty , whose products deliver speed, savings, and security for renters and property managers alike, today announced executive hires to support the Company's rapid nationwide growth.\nJetty Co-Founder & CEO Mike Rudoy said, \"To support our rapid growth in both consumer demand and property management partnerships, we're thrilled to add three industry leaders with a proven ability to scale organizations. Our new Vice President of Real Estate Sales, Kevin Murphy, will focus on accelerating new partnerships with some of the country's largest property managers and capture interest in our products proven to attract qualified tenants and quickly fill units. There's a tremendous opportunity for Jetty and Kevin will help us seize it.\" Rudoy continued, \"We're also delighted to welcome Kevin Dinnie as Senior Advisor to Jetty. Kevin's decades of managing real estate portfolios for The Blackstone Group, Lehman Brothers, and GE Capital represent an invaluable level of real estate expertise that we're lucky to have on board.\"\nJetty Co-Founder & President Luke Cohler said, \"Given how much of modern renters' income goes to rent, and how much more overall time they spend renting vs. owning—more than any generation to date—they have a real need to determine what products give them the best bang for their buck. Jetty's products and experience meet that need, which has inspired positive word of mouth among consumers and driven growth. To further capture demand and escalate awareness of Jetty we've hired Patrick Briggs, our new Vice President of Growth.
