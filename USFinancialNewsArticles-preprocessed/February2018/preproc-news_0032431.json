    "text": "TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trend Micro Incorporated ( TYO: 4704 ; TSE: 4704 ), a global leader in cybersecurity solutions, today announced earnings results for the fourth quarter and consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2017, ending December 31, 2017.\nIn 2017, the company had double-digit net revenue growth, evidence of Trend Micro’s continued leadership in the security industry and providing a strong platform to secure the connected world as we move into 2018.\n“I’m honored to share the results of our strong financial performance, strategic solution enhancements and impressive market validation,” said Eva Chen, chief executive officer for Trend Micro. “And in keeping with our core value of protecting our customers against the changing threat landscape, I’m also pleased to highlight innovation that enables us grow in new ways.”\nFor the fourth quarter, Trend Micro posted consolidated net sales of 41,028 million Yen (or US $363 million, 112.99 JPY = 1USD). The company posted operating income of 8,511 million Yen (or US $75 million) and net income attributable to owners of the parent of 5,175 million Yen (or US $45 million) for the quarter.\nFor 2017, Trend Micro posted consolidated net sales of 148,811 million Yen (or US $1,326 million, 112.22 JPY=1USD). The company also reported operating income of 36,441 million Yen (or US $324 million) and net income attributable to owners of the parent of 25,691 million Yen (or US $228 million).\nBased on information currently available to the company, consolidated net sales for the year ending December 31, 2018 is expected to be 164,800 million Yen (or US $1,484 million, based on an exchange rate of 111 JPY = 1 USD). Operating income and net income are expected to be 40,700 million Yen (or US $366 million) and 28,400 million Yen (or US $255 million), respectively.\nGrowth rate figures are calculated from Japanese Yen results. Some discrepancy may therefore be noted in US Dollar comparisons owing to fluctuations in currency conversion rates.\nQ4 2017 Business Highlights\nValued product development and strategic investments to protect our customers:\nA strategic relationship finalized with TELUS Security Labs in Q4 will help drive critical insights to navigate the North American threat landscape and protect against cyber threats. Trend Micro solutions grew with the Q4 acquisition of Montréal, Canada-based Immunio, which brought security experts and new capabilities to Trend Micro.\nContinued innovation and research to secure the evolving, connected world:\nAs companies build and deploy applications faster across everything from cloud to containers, any drag on the DevOps lifecycle can create drag on an entire business.
