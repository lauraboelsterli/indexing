    "text": "SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digerati Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB:DTGI) (\"Digerati\" or the \"Company\") today reported that the Company will retain the “Synergy Telecom” brand for its Texas operations and continue building on Synergy Telecom’s established name recognition and brand affinity in its high-growth market. Digerati announced its acquisition of Synergy Telecom, Inc. (“Synergy Telecom”) on December 5, 2017 and reported its plan to combine Synergy Telecom’s business with that of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Shift8 Networks, Inc. (“Shift8”). The Company will commence the transition from its Shif8 brand to the Synergy Telecom brand effective February 15, 2018 and phase out of the Shift8 name by May 1, 2018, including a corporate name change for the Texas corporation.\nThe name change and re-branding is in line with the Company's top-of-mind awareness strategy and ambitious growth plans aimed at expanding business in Texas, and across the U.S. The combined business of Shift8 and Synergy Telecom will market services to direct clients and its Value-Added Resellers (“VARs”) as Synergy Telecom and will continue using its “catchy” 210-GET-VOIP sales response line for communication with customers and VARs.
