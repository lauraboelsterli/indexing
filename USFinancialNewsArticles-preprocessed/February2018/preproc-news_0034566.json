    "text": "PARIS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - French luxury goods group Kering on Tuesday posted better-than-expected sales growth in the fourth quarter as its biggest label Gucci recorded another solid performance following a reinvention of the brand.\nKering said sales rose 21.4 percent year-on-year to 4.26 billion euros ($5.25 billion) between October and December, up 27.4 percent on a comparable basis.\nThat marked a slight slowdown in revenue growth from a quarter earlier, although analysts polled by Inquiry Financial for Reuters had forecast comparable sales growth of 24.3 percent for the fourth quarter.\n$1 = 0.8117 euros Reporting by Sarah White Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
