    "text": "Camposol' s 2017 Adj. EBITDA [1] amounted to USD 125.5 million, up 65.0% compared to previous year. Adj. EBITDA margin increased to 34.0% from 27.5% compared to 2016. Sales amounted to USD 368.4 million, up 33.2% compared to 2016, mainly due to higher volume and prices of avocadoes, higher volumes of blueberries and shrimps. As of December 31 st , 2017, the Company maintained a cash balance of USD 34.3 million, Net Debt was USD 142.9 million, resulting in a Net leverage ratio [2] of 1.1x.\nThe Company expects to continue its diversification strategy by; increasing production of the F&V Division (blueberries, avocados and tangerines), converting open ponds into intensive ponds in Marinasol, and strengthening relationship with clients adding value through commercial strategies, marketing and service initiatives.\nPerspectives of long-term growth of fresh and healthy products are excellent. Avocado and blueberry consumption is growing, with headroom for increased per capita consumption in key markets. The Company expects good demand for its products in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\"Our strategic decision to focus on fresh and healthy products and to develop a direct road to market has delivered a strong result on 2017. We had a great avocado campaign in volumes and prices. We successfully increased volumes on blueberries and shrimps from intensive ponds. We began the internationalization of our agricultural operations acquiring land in Colombia. We obtained the \"Supplier of the Year Award\" from Walmart on the \"Produce Category\", we opened a third commercial office in Shanghai and we introduced \"The Berry That Cares\" brand that emphasizes our social and environmental commitments.
