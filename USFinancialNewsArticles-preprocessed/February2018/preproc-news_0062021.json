    "text": "DANVILLE, Calif., Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A flagship for apartment owners and operators, Multihousing Pro magazine ( mhpmag.com ), has announced the expansion of its special-focus supplements, increased print and digital circulation, and strategic hires. The build-up reflects the continued growth of the U.S. apartment industry and the nation's voracious appetite for hyper-focused journalism.\n\"Apartment investments will maintain a positive outlook,\" states Marcus & Millichap's 2018 Multifamily forecast; a sentiment shared by most analysts. As rentals expand to a wider selection of products, classes and locations, the sector will continue its steady growth as profit centers for operators and their suppliers. The industry generated an estimated $163 billion in revenue from 2012-2017, with an annual growth of 4.3 percent according to an IBIS industry market report.\n\"The business of rentals has long fought for its own voice,\" said Linda Hoffman, publisher of Multihousing Pro. \"This counter culture⎼⎼independent of the campaign for homeownership⎼⎼has gathered a massive, dedicated group of owners and operators. Landlords need a focused source of the best methods for profitability and cash flow. Value-driven content, honest and equitable, is critical to today's rental operation, and essential to effectively navigating the changing commercial landscape.\"\nWhile the general print market has experienced compression, localized and industry-focused titles have expanded according to Folio, an industry group focused on media trends. Multihousing Pro has doubled both its digital and print circulation in the last months and will expand its special interest titles/supplements.\nThe organization has also brought in John Clemens as National Sales Manager. Clemens is a second-generation print media rep. He will leverage the magazine's loyal readership into value streams for industry suppliers seeking to offer products and services that elevate multifamily businesses.\nAbout Multihousing Pro\nCirculated to 25,000 professionals in the U.S. apartment and housing rental industry, Multihousing Pro delivers content on relevant trends, notable deals, products and services identified to increase profit and cash flow for owners and operators. Now in its 20 th year, the 60-plus-page print and digital periodical also covers news stories on major events, influencers and industry metrics through original and aggregated content. MHP is the only independently owned and operated print periodical focused on the apartment industry, having also showcased notable interviews with high-profile apartment owners as Donald Trump, Bon Jovi, and Brad Pitt. The print edition will expand to 50,000 subscribers in 2018.\nMedia contact:\nAndrew Nicks\n925.309.4440\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trade-magazines-fill-the-print-gap-multihousing-pro-expands-circ-and-special-interest-titles-300603698.html\nSOURCE Multihousing Pro magazine",
