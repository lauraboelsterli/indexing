Alibaba's founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma speaks at the China-UK business forum   REUTERS/Stringer \nMore than 1 billion pounds of deals and market access, and 890 jobs, were secured for Britain’s financial services industry, it said. \nMay ended her three-day visit to China in the country’s commercial capital Shanghai on Friday.
