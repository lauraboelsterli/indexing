    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ares Management, L.P. (NYSE:ARES) today reported its financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“The fourth quarter of 2017 concluded a record year for Ares as we generated year over year management fee and fee related earnings growth of 13% and 26%, respectively. We saw double digit growth in our assets under management and margin improvement from scale efficiencies in our business,” said Michael Arougheti, Chief Executive Officer of Ares. “Our after-tax economic net income growth of 37% reflected strong fund investment performance across our primary investment strategies. Going forward, we believe that Ares is well-positioned to capitalize on the industry growth for alternative investments and to continue to perform well for our investors.”\n“This morning, we announced that we have changed our corporate tax status which we believe will simplify our structure, broaden our potential investor base, improve our liquidity and trading volume and provide a more attractive currency for strategic acquisitions,” said Michael McFerran, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Ares. “In concurrence with this change, Ares will begin paying a steady, quarterly dividend for each calendar year based on the growth in our after-tax core fee related earnings. This dividend policy should reduce the historical volatility of our distributions, and allow us to retain a greater portion of our earnings for growth and potential share repurchases.”\nCommon Distribution\nAres declared a distribution of $0.40 per common unit for the five months ended February 28, 2018, inclusive of $0.25 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.15 per common unit for the first two months of the first quarter of 2018, payable on February 28, 2018 to common unitholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2018. The distribution represents a portion of the estimated after tax distributable earnings generated for the five month period ended February 28, 2018.\nCommon Dividend\nFor March 2018, the first month that Ares is taxed as a corporation, Ares declared a dividend of $0.0933 per common share payable on April 30, 2018 to holders of record on April 16, 2018.\nPreferred Distribution\nAres declared a distribution of $0.4375 per Series A Preferred Unit with a payment date of March 31, 2018 to preferred unitholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2018.\nRecent Developments\nAres elected to change its tax classification from a partnership to a C-Corporation to be effective March 1, 2018. Investors will receive a final Schedule K-1 for the period from January 1, 2018 through February 28, 2018. Investors receiving dividends after March 1, 2018 will receive Form 1099-DIV reporting.\nAdditional Information\nAres issued two detailed presentations regarding its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and its corporate status election, which can be viewed at www.aresmgmt.com on the Investor Resources section of our home page under Events and Presentations.
