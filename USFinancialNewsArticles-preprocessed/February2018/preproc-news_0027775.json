The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nRitchings was chosen based on his ability to successfully lead and drive continued growth and innovation in Trustwave’s global channel partner program, a program essential for disseminating leading-edge security products and managed security services.
