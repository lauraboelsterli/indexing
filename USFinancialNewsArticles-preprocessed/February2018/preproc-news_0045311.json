    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CognitiveScale, Inc., the leader in augmented intelligence, today announced the appointment of Jim Offerdahl to its advisory board. Most recently CFO of Bazaarvoice, Jim has significant experience in CEO, COO, CFO and board of director positions for high-growth technology companies. Jim will join a distinguished group of CognitiveScale advisory board members, including the former senior vice president and chief technology and innovation officer at USAA, Rickey Burks; retired senior vice president of IBM Cloud, Robert LeBlanc; and Kony chairman and CEO, Tom Hogan.\nWith more than 25 years of experience and significant expertise in working with both public and private companies, Offerdahl is known for his ability to grow revenue and profits both domestically and internationally. Currently, Offerdahl serves on the board for Q2 Holdings, a developer and provider of online banking software and services to community banks and credit unions, and Side by Side Kids, a non-profit that serves underprivileged children in Austin, Texas.\n“We are honored to have Jim join our advisory board, especially with his reputation for helping companies get to the next level,” said Akshay Sabhikhi, CEO of CognitiveScale. “Jim has led three initial public offerings and executed numerous mergers and acquisitions. We are excited to have access to his wealth of knowledge and expertise.”\n“Augmented intelligence is dramatically changing businesses around the world,” said Offerdahl. “CogntiveScale understands that now is the time for companies to move AI out of the lab and into operations to see real business impact.
