    "text": "The biggest threat to Google-parent Alphabet and other big-name tech companies is the U.S. government, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman told CNBC on Wednesday.\nThe government \"is just looking at them,\" said Cooperman, the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors hedge fund. \"They want to see if they can pick their pockets.\"\nCooperman, whose firm has approximately $3.8 billion in assets under management, said on Wednesday that 10 percent of his portfolio is in tech stocks.\nCooperman owns stakes in Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google, according to a recent SEC filing. Cooperman told CNBC on Wednesday he doesn't own shares of Apple .\nThe Omega chief likes Alphabet in particular, saying it has a fortress-like balance sheet.\n\"Google is 5 percent of our portfolio,\" Cooperman said. \"We've owned it for several years. It sells for around two times what we think it's going to earn this year.\"\nAlphabet reported disappointing fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings last Thursday.\nCooperman expects moderate gains for the tech sector in 2018. \nThis is a developing story.
