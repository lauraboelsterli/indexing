Our mobile game business has been a key beneficiary of the increasing smartphone penetration in the region. For instance, Arena of Valor has achieved 10 million daily active users (\"DAU\"). Moreover, we continue to complement this franchise through a growing e-sports league, video streaming options and other ancillary services.\nAnother important milestone this quarter was the launch of our fully self-developed game, Free Fire, on December 4, 2017. Free Fire is a \"battle royale\" type of mobile game developed in-house by Garena. The game was launched on both the iOS App Store and Google Play Store in many markets around the world and has achieved 6 million DAUs. We are committed to expanding our game development capabilities further, while continuing to build our position as the partner of choice in our markets for the world's leading game development studios.\nE-Commerce\nShopee achieved robust growth in both GMV and gross orders in each of our markets in the fourth quarter of 2017. This growth was driven primarily by our on-the-ground efforts to attract new buyers and sellers in our focus categories.\nShopee has focused much of its innovation on launching value-added services to our ever-expanding seller base, particularly for brands that use our Shopee Mall platform. We continue to expand our support for sellers by offering them integrated logistics and payments solutions as well as fulfilment and other services.\nWe have begun monetization by rolling out performance-based advertising tools in all of our markets. In Taiwan and in our cross-border transactions, we have also started to charge transaction-based commissions to sellers.\nDigital Financial Services\nWe continue to focus our efforts on building up the infrastructure to support our existing platforms and to improve user experience. One of our recent initiatives in this area is the deeper integration of AirPay with Shopee.\nOther Developments\nRetirement of Director and Group President and Election of New Director\nThe Company's Group President and Director, Nicholas A. Nash, plans to retire from his position as the Group President at the end of 2018. During the period before his retirement, Mr. Nash will continue to advise the Company's Group Chief Executive Officer on the Company's long-term strategic priorities. Concurrent with announcing his retirement, Mr. Nash has also retired from the Company's board as of February 23, 2018. On February 24, 2018, the Company's board elected Tony Tianyu Hou to serve as a director. Mr. Hou is also the Group Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nAmendment of Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Company has amended its Amended and Restated Incentive Plan (the \"Plan\"), effective on February 24, 2018, to increase the maximum number of its Class A ordinary shares (\"Ordinary Shares\") that may be delivered under the Plan from 53,000,000 shares to 83,000,000 shares (the \"ESOP Pool Size\"), and to increase the ESOP Pool Size on the first day of year 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 by 5% of the total number of Ordinary Shares outstanding on that day immediately before such annual increase. Sea intends to use such increases in the ESOP Pool Size to make equity grants to its management team and other employees, so as to better attract global talents and more closely align the interest of its employees with the Company and its shareholders.\nSummary of Financial Results\n(Amounts are expressed in thousands of US dollars \"$\")\nFor Three Month\nended December 31,\nFor Full Year\nended December 31,\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017\n$\n$\nYOY%\n$\n$\nYOY%\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nRevenue\nDigital Entertainment\n82,407\n106,323\n29.0%\n327,985\n365,167\n11.3%\nOthers\n6,054\n18,281\n202.0%\n17,685\n49,023\n177.2%\n88,461\n124,604\n40.9%\n345,670\n414,190\n19.8%\nCost of revenue\nDigital Entertainment\n(47,298)\n(60,240)\n27.4%\n(185,314)\n(217,986)\n17.6%\nOthers\n(15,879)\n(40,819)\n157.1%\n(47,284)\n(108,892)\n130.3%\n(63,177)\n(101,059)\n60.0%\n(232,598)\n(326,878)\n40.5%\nGross profit\n25,284\n23,545\n(6.9)%\n113,072\n87,312\n(22.8)%\nOther operating income\n415\n2,157\n419.8%\n2,103\n3,497\n66.3%\nSales and marketing expenses\n(61,763)\n(156,418)\n153.3%\n(187,372)\n(425,974)\n127.3%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(41,304)\n(51,754)\n25.3%\n(112,383)\n(137,868)\n22.7%\nResearch and development expenses\n(5,786)\n(8,671)\n49.9%\n(20,809)\n(29,323)\n40.9%\nTotal operating expenses\n(108,438)\n(214,686)\n98.0%\n(318,461)\n(589,668)\n85.2%\nOperating loss\n(83,154)\n(191,141)\n129.9%\n(205,389)\n(502,356)\n144.6%\nNon-operating income (loss), net\n15,150\n(62,283)\n(511.1)%\n8,503\n(46,153)\n(642.8)%\nIncome tax expense\n1,047\n(8,730)\n(933.8)%\n(8,546)\n(10,745)\n25.7%\nShare of results of equity\ninvestees\n(5,279)\n(986)\n(81.3)%\n(19,523)\n(1,912)\n(90.2)%\nNet loss\n(72,236)\n(263,140)\n264.3%\n(224,955)\n(561,166)\n149.5%\nAdjusted net loss (1)\n(61,981)\n(251,563)\n305.9%\n(196,114)\n(532,530)\n171.5%\nAdjusted revenue of Digital\nEntertainment (1)\n89,132\n141,883\n59.2%\n331,252\n495,878\n49.7%\nAdjusted revenue of E-Commerce (1)\n-\n9,319\n-\n-\n17,717\n-\nRevenue of Digital Financial Services\n1,709\n4,102\n140.0%\n5,892\n16,270\n176.1%\nRevenue of Other Services\n4,345\n9,213\n112.0%\n11,793\n23,719\n101.1%\nTotal adjusted revenue (1)\n95,186\n164,517\n72.8%\n348,937\n553,584\n58.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA for Digital\nEntertainment (1)\n16,626\n52,607\n216.4%\n85,492\n174,939\n104.6%\nAdjusted EBITDA for E-Commerce (1)\n(59,188)\n(175,414)\n(196.4)%\n(169,716)\n(444,280)\n(161.8)%\nAdjusted EBITDA for Digital\nFinancial Services (1)\n(9,240)\n(7,551)\n18.3%\n(33,682)\n(36,697)\n(9.0)%\nAdjusted EBITDA for Other Services (1)\n(2,495)\n(7,276)\n(191.6)%\n(9,276)\n(18,190)\n(96.1)%\nUnallocated expenses (2)\n(1,708)\n(2,579)\n(51.0)%\n(2,937)\n(7,887)\n(168.5)%\nTotal adjusted EBITDA (1)\n(56,005)\n(140,213)\n(150.4)%\n(130,119)\n(332,115)\n(155.2)%\n(1) For a discussion of the use of non-GAAP financial measures, see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n(2) Unallocated expenses are mainly relating to share-based compensation and general and corporate administrative costs such as professional fees and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to segments.

Our total adjusted revenue increased by 72.8% to US$164.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$95.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. These increases were mainly driven by the growth in each of the segments detailed as follows:\nDigital Entertainment: Revenue increased by 29.0% to US$106.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$82.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted revenue increased by 59.2% to US$141.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$89.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the growth of our QAUs to 87.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 50.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, as we launched new games and expanded our existing games into new markets, which in turn increased the number of our paying users. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we have revised our estimation on certain games' revenue recognition period (including Arena of Valor's), using average paying user lives instead of game licensing periods of the respective games. The change in estimation was based on management's best understanding of the user behaviours reflected in the data that management collected over time. The impact of such changes was accounted for prospectively and was not significant to our digital entertainment revenue had we not made such changes. We believe changing the estimation reflects the economic essence of the respective games better and provides better quality financial reporting. E-Commerce: We began monetizing our e-commerce business in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, our e-commerce revenue was US$5.0 million. Our e-commerce adjusted revenue was US$9.3 million in the same period. Digital Financial Services: Revenue increased by 140.0% to US$4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of use cases to our AirPay platform and a further deepening of our market penetration. Other Services: Revenue increased by 112.0% to US$9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to ancillary services we provide to our e-commerce platform users.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue increased by 60.0% to US$101.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$63.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was in line with the overall growth of our businesses:\nDigital Entertainment: Cost of revenue increased by 27.4% to US$60.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$47.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in royalty payments to game developers as well as in other costs directly associated with our digital entertainment segment which were largely in line with the revenue growth of our business. Others: Cost of revenue for our other segments combined increased by 157.1% to US$40.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$15.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to bank transaction fees driven by GMV growth from our e–commerce business, as well as higher staff compensation and benefit costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur total sales and marketing expenses increased by 153.3% to US$156.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was in line with the overall growth of our businesses. The table below sets forth the breakdown of our sales and marketing expenses of our two major reporting segments.

This increase was primarily due to the launch of new games and our continued efforts to expand our existing games into new markets, which in turn enlarged our user base and increased the number of our paying users.\nFor the Three Months\nended December 31,\n2016\n2017\nDigital Entertainment\n$\n(unaudited)\n$\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing expenses\n13,335\n16,854\nAdjusted revenue\n89,132\n141,883\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of adjusted revenue\n15.0%\n11.9%\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of adjusted revenue decreased to 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 15.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we continue to improve the efficiency of our marketing efforts.\nE-Commerce: Sales and marketing expenses increased by 206.8% to US$135.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$44.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in marketing efforts was aligned with our strategy to fully capture the market growth opportunity and was primarily driven by shipping and other promotions on our platform in order to increase user base and enhance user engagement.\nFor the Three Months\nended December 31,\n2016\n2017\nE-Commerce\n$\n(unaudited)\n$\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing expenses\n43,990\n134,961\nGMV\n515,791\n1,578,599\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV\n8.5%\n8.5%\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV was 8.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017. It improved from 9.7% in the third quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by 25.3% to US$51.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$41.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to an expansion of our staff force, an increase in office facilities and related expenses, as well as an increase in professional fees and other expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased by 49.9% to US$8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from US$5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in research and development staff force as we expanded and enriched our product offerings.\nNon-operating Income or Losses, Net\nNon-operating income or losses consists of interest income, interest expense, investment gain (loss), fair value change for convertible promissory notes and foreign exchange gain (loss). The amount was a net non-operating loss of US$62.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net non-operating gain of US$15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was primarily due to a charge of fair value loss of US$52.0 million from the fair value accounting treatment for the convertible promissory notes and interest expense on those convertible promissory notes recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017; while an investment gain was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the disposal of an associated company.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had an income tax expense of US$8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 which was primarily due to the corporate income taxes and withholding tax expenses recognized for our digital entertainment segment. The income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 was mainly driven by a reduction in statutory withholding tax rate in one of our markets.\nShare of Results of Equity Investees\nWe had share of losses of equity investees of US$1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with US$5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is primarily due to lower losses we picked up following the disposal of an associated company in 2017.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had net losses of US$263.1 million and US$72.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Loss\nAdjusted net loss, which is net loss adjusted to remove share-based compensation expenses, was US$251.6 million and US$62.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFull Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Full Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nThe table below sets forth revenue generated from our reported segments.

This increase was primarily due to ancillary services we provide to our e-commerce platform users.\nCost of Revenue\nOur total cost of revenue increased by 40.5% to US$326.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$232.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was in line with the overall growth of our businesses:\nDigital Entertainment: Cost of revenue increased by 17.6% to US$218.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$185.3 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in royalty payments to game developers as well as in other costs directly associated with our digital entertainment business which were in line with the increased revenue in this segment. Others: Cost of revenue for our other segments combined increased by 130.3% to US$108.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$47.3 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to bank transaction fees driven by GMV growth from our e-commerce business, as well as higher staff compensation and benefit costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur total sales and marketing expenses increased by 127.3% to US$426.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$187.4 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was in line with the overall growth of our businesses. The table below sets forth the breakdown of our sales and marketing expenses of our two major reporting segments. Amounts are expressed in thousands of US dollars (\"$\").\nFor the Full Year\nended December 31,\n2016\n2017\nYOY%\nSales and Marketing Expenses\n$\n(unaudited)\n$\n(unaudited)\nDigital Entertainment\n44,030\n61,472\n39.6%\nE-Commerce\n126,220\n339,768\n169.2%\nDigital Entertainment: Sales and marketing expenses increased by 39.6% to US$61.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$44.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to the launch of new games and our continued efforts to expand our existing games into new markets, which in turn enlarged our user base and increased the number of our paying users.\nFor the Full Year\nended December 31,\n2016\n2017\nDigital Entertainment\n$\n(unaudited)\n$\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing expenses\n44,030\n61,472\nAdjusted revenue\n331,252\n495,878\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of adjusted revenue\n13.3%\n12.4%\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of adjusted revenue decreased to 12.4% for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from 13.3% for the full year ended December 31, 2016 as we continue to improve the efficiency of our marketing efforts.\nE-Commerce: Sales and marketing expenses increased by 169.2% to US$339.8 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$126.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in marketing efforts was aligned with our strategy to fully capture the market growth opportunity and was primarily driven by shipping and other promotions on our platform in order to increase user base and enhance user engagement.\nFor the Full Year\nended December 31,\n2016\n2017\nE-Commerce\n$\n(unaudited)\n$\n(unaudited)\nSales and marketing expenses\n126,220\n339,768\nGMV\n1,150,270\n4,112,732\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV\n11.0%\n8.3%\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of GMV decreased to 8.3% for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from 11.0% for the full year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by 22.7% to US$137.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$112.4 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an expansion of our staff force, an increase in office facilities and related expenses, as well as an increase in professional fees and other expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses increased by 40.9% to US$29.3 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 from US$20.8 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in research and development staff force as we expanded and enriched our product offerings.\nNon-operating Income or Losses, Net\nNon-operating income or losses consists of interest income, interest expense, investment gain (loss), fair value change for convertible promissory notes and foreign exchange gain (loss). The amount was a net non-operating loss of US$46.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net non-operating gain of US$8.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily due to a charge of fair value loss of US$52.0 million from the fair value accounting treatment for the convertible promissory notes and interest expenses on those convertible promissory notes, partially offset by an investment gain arising from the disposal of and a net gain arising from re-measurement of our investments in 2017; while an investment gain was recognized in 2016 due to the disposal of an associated company.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe had an income tax expense of US$10.7 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017, compared with an income tax expense of US$8.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily due to higher corporate income tax and withholding tax expenses recognized for our digital entertainment segment in 2017 which was in line with the growth of the business.\nShare of Results of Equity Investees\nWe had share of losses of equity investees of US$1.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017, compared with US$19.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily due to lower losses we picked up following the disposal of an associated company in 2017.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, we had net losses of US$561.2 million and US$225.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Loss\nAdjusted net loss, which is net loss adjusted to remove share-based compensation expenses, was US$532.5 million and US$196.1 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGuidance\nFor the full year of 2018, we currently expect total adjusted revenue to be US$730 million to US$770 million, representing 31.9% to 39.1% growth from 2017.\nWe currently expect our e-commerce GMV to be between US$7.5 billion to US$8.0 billion for the full year of 2018, representing 82.4% to 94.5% growth from 2017.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMr. Forrest Li, Founder, Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Nick Nash, Group President; Mr. Tony Hou, Group Chief Financial Officer; and Mr. Alan Hellawell, Group Chief Strategy Officer, will host a conference call today to review Sea's business and financial performance.\nDetails of the conference call and webcast are as follows:\nDate and time:\n7:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time on 27 February\n8:00 AM Singapore/ Hong Kong Time on 28 February 2018\nWebcast link:\nhttp://mms.prnasia.com/SE/20180227/default.aspx\nDial in numbers:\nUS Toll Free: 1-888-317-6003\nHong Kong: 800-963-976\nInternational: 1-412-317-6061\nSingapore: 800-120-5863\nUnited Kingdom: 08-082-389-063\nPasscode for participants:\n0677787\nA replay of the conference call will be available at the Company's investor relations website ( http://www.seagroup.com/investor/financials ).

Our region includes the key markets of Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Sea operates three platforms across digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial services, known as Garena, Shopee, and AirPay, respectively.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains .

These can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"confident,\" \"guidance\" and similar statements. Among other things, statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Sea's beliefs and expectations, the business, financial and market outlook and projections from its management in this announcement, as well as Sea's strategic and operational plans, contain . Sea may also make written or oral in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: Sea's goals and strategies; its future business development, financial condition and results of operations; the growth in, and market size of, the digital entertainment, e-commerce and digital financial services industries in our region, including segments within those industries; changes in its revenue, costs or expenditures; its ability to continue to source, develop and offer new and attractive online games and to offer other engaging digital entertainment content; the growth of its digital entertainment, e-commerce and digital financial services platforms; the growth in its user base and their level of engagement; its ability to continue to develop new technologies and/or upgrade its existing technologies; growth of and trends of its markets and competition in its industry; government policies and regulations relating to its industry; and general economic and business conditions in the markets it has businesses. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in Sea's filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release, and Sea undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help evaluate our operating performance:\n\"Adjusted revenue\" of our digital entertainment segment represents revenue of the digital entertainment segment plus change in digital entertainment deferred revenue. This financial measure is used as an approximation of cash spent by our users in the applicable period that is attributable to our digital entertainment segment. Although other companies may present such measures related to gross billings differently or not at all, we believe that the adjusted revenue of our digital entertainment segment provides useful information to investors about the segment's core operating results, enhancing their understanding of our past performance and future prospects. \"Adjusted revenue\" of our e-commerce segment represents revenue (currently consisting of advertising income) of the e-commerce segment plus commission income (before deducting sales incentives from commission income). This financial measure enables our investors to follow trends in our e-commerce monetization capability over time and is a useful performance measure. \"Total adjusted revenue\" represents the sum of adjusted revenue of our digital entertainment segment, the adjusted revenue of our e-commerce segment, the revenue of our digital financial services segment, and the revenue of our other services. This financial measure enables our investors to follow trends in our overall group monetization capability over time and is a useful performance measure. \"Adjusted net loss\" represents net loss excluding share-based compensation expense. We believe that the adjusted net loss helps to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that are included in net loss. The use of adjusted net loss has its limitations in that it does not include all items that impact the net loss or income for the period, and share-based compensation is a recurring significant expense. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" for our digital entertainment segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation plus (a) depreciation and amortization expenses, and (b) net effect of changes in deferred revenue and its related cost for our digital entertainment segment. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" for our e-commerce segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation plus (a) depreciation and amortization expenses, and (b) e-commerce commission income before deducting sales incentives. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" for our digital financial services segment and other services segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation plus depreciation and amortization expenses. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects. \"Total adjusted EBITDA\" represents the sum of adjusted EBITDA of all our segments combined, plus unallocated expenses. Although other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not present it at all, we believe that the total adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future prospects.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. None of the above financial measures should be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net loss/income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to Sea's data. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP financial measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.\nThe tables below present selected financial information of our reporting segments and its non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between the financial measures .
