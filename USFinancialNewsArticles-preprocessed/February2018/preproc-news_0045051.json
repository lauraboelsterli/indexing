    "text": " 36 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago UPDATE 1-CIBC's first-quarter earnings beat market expectations Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Adds detail on U.S. plans and performance) TORONTO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported first-quarter earnings ahead of market expectations, with strong performance from all business units. Canada’s fifth-biggest lender has benefited from expansion in the United States to diversify from its core domestic market. Last year it completed the $5 billion acquisition of Chicago-based PrivateBancorp and CEO Victor Dodig said in December that he expects the U.S. contribution to earnings to nearly double in the next three years. The bank’s U.S. business had quarterly net income of C$134 million, more than four times the figure in the same period a year earlier. CIBC posted earnings per share excluding one-off items rose to C$3.18 in the quarter to Jan. 31, compared with C$2.89 a year earlier. Reported earnings per share were C$2.95, compared with C$3.50 a year ago. Analysts had on average forecast earnings per share of C$2.83, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. CIBC reported net income, excluding one-off items of C$1.4 billion ($1.10 billion), against C$1.2 billion a year ago.
