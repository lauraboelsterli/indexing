The NOK dividend per share is based on average USDNOK fixing rate from Norges Bank in the period plus/minus three business days from record date 9 February 2018, in total seven business days.\nAverage Norges Bank fixing rate for this period was 7.9005. Third quarter 2017 dividend per share is consequently NOK 1.7389.\nUnder the two-year scrip dividend programme (\"Scrip Dividend Programme\") approved by the Annual General meeting 11 May 2017, shareholders will have the option to receive dividend in newly issued dividend shares. The subscription period for third quarter 2017 shall commence on 26 February 2018 and end on 9 March 2018.
