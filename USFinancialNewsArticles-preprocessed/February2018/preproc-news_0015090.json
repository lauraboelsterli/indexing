    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Martin Schulz, the embattled leader of Germany’s Social Democrats, is slated to become foreign minister under the agreement reached with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives on Wednesday, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported.\nSome 464,000 SPD members must still approve the coalition deal in a mail ballot. Many left-wing and youth members of the party oppose a rerun of the “grand coalition” that has governed Germany since 2013.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Joseph Nasr\n ",
