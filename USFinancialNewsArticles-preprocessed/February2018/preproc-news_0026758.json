A vision beyond the seasons establishing a daily dialogue with consumers,” Milan-based Moncler said in a statement.\nMULTIPLE VOICES Moncler said it would kick off Milan’s popular fashion week with the new project on Feb. 20 and then launch its new products monthly. It will present eight new collections, representing “the multiple voices” of the brand, a spokesperson told Reuters.\nThe collections will be available one at a time, starting from June, the spokesperson said, adding that the idea was to make the collaborations with its creative directors permanent.\nThese include Valentino’s Pierpaolo Piccioli, former Gucci menswear designer Sandro Mandrino, Ireland’s Simone Rocha and Moncler’s own artistic director Francesco Ragazzi.\nFounded as a traditional skiwear brand in the French Alps in 1952, Moncler was turned into a trendy fashion label after now chairman and chief executive Remo Ruffini took control in 2003 and floated it on the Milan stock market in December 2013.\nMoncler posted a higher-than-expected 15 percent rise in 9 month sales and revenue in the same period was up 16 percent at constant exchange rates.\nShares in Moncler, which began trading at around 14 euros at the time of its IPO in 2013, were up 0.45 percent to 26.7 euros at 1135 GMT on Wednesday. The stock hit a lifetime high above 27 euros late last month. ($1 = 0.8085 euros) (Reporting by Giulia Segreti and Claudia Cristoferi; Editing by Kim Coghill/Dale Hudson/Alexander Smith)\n ",
