For the year, we grew revenue by 24% to a record $200 million. Our revenue growth continues to be driven by our Enterprise business, which delivered 37% growth in LTM Enterprise subscription revenue. Our strong enterprise growth and the operating leverage in our business model drove strong improvements to our bottom line, including operating cash flow of $11.1 million for the year. Additionally, we set an all-time record for Enterprise bookings in the fourth quarter and full year. We believe that our continued execution combined with our powerful, differentiated cloud contact center software positions Five9 extremely well in the customer experience market that is still in the early days of a massive shift to the cloud.”\n- Barry Zwarenstein, Interim CEO and Chief Financial Officer, Five9\nBusiness Outlook\nOn January 1, 2018, Five9 adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the modified retrospective transition method. The guidance below includes the expected impact of the adoption of this new revenue standard, which replaced ASC 605. For the full year and first quarter of 2018, we expect no material difference in revenue between ASC 606 and ASC 605. Under ASC 606, we expect to add approximately $5 million to $7 million to GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the full year 2018 and approximately $0.5 million to $1.5 million to GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the full year 2018, Five9 expects to report: Revenue in the range of $231 to $234 million. GAAP net loss in the range of $(13.4) to $(10.4) million, or $(0.23) to $(0.18) per basic share. Non-GAAP net income in the range of $12.6 to $15.6 million, or $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. For the first quarter of 2018, Five9 expects to report: Revenue in the range of $54.5 to $55.5 million. GAAP net loss in the range of $(4.5) to $(3.5) million, or a loss of $(0.08) to $(0.06) per basic share. Non-GAAP net income in the range of $1.3 to $2.3 million, or $0.02 to $0.04 per diluted share.\nConference Call Details\nFive9 will discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results today, February 21, 2018, via teleconference at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. To access the call (ID 6886112), please dial: 888-427-9411 or 719-325-4940. An audio replay of the call will be available through March 7, 2018 by dialing 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and entering access code 6886112. A copy of this press release will be furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Current Report on Form 8-K, and will be posted to our website, prior to the conference call.\nA webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://investors.five9.com/ .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate adjusted gross profit by adding back or removing the following items to gross profit: depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and the reversal of accrued federal fees. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by adding back or removing the following items to or from GAAP net income (loss): depreciation, amortization, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), stock-based compensation expense, extinguishment of debt, non-recurring litigation settlement costs, the reversal of interest and penalties on accrued federal fees, and interest income and other, which consists primarily of a non-cash adjustment on investment, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses. We calculate non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation expense, intangibles amortization, non-recurring litigation settlement costs, and the reversal of interest and penalties on accrued federal fees. We calculate non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation expense, intangibles amortization, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, extinguishment of debt, non-recurring litigation settlement costs, the reversal of interest and penalties on accrued federal fees, and non-cash adjustments on investment. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Five9 considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be important because they provide useful measures of the operating performance of the Company, exclusive of factors that do not directly affect what we consider to be our core operating performance, as well as unusual events. The Company’s management uses these measures to (i) illustrate underlying trends in the Company’s business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of income or expenses that are excluded from non-GAAP measures, and (ii) establish budgets and operational goals for managing the Company’s business and evaluating its performance. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented only as supplemental information for purposes of understanding the Company's operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures set forth herein and attached to this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including the statements in the Quote: from our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, including statements regarding Five9’s market position, business momentum, product positioning, the state of the cloud customer experience market, and the first quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial projections, including the expected impact of ASC 606, set forth under the caption “Business Outlook,” that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include, among others: (i) our quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our common stock; (ii) if we are unable to attract new clients or sell additional services and functionality to our existing clients, our revenue and revenue growth will be harmed; (iii) our recent rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and even if we continue to grow rapidly, we may fail to manage our growth effectively; (iv) failure to adequately expand our sales force could impede our growth; (v) if we fail to manage our technical operations infrastructure, our existing clients may experience service outages, our new clients may experience delays in the deployment of our solution and we could be subject to, among other things, claims for credits or damages; (vi) security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or our clients’ data, or other cyber attacks on our systems, could result in litigation and regulatory risk, harm our reputation and adversely affect our business; (vii) the markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed; (viii) if our existing clients terminate their subscriptions or reduce their subscriptions and related usage, our revenues and gross margins will be harmed and we will be required to spend more money to grow our client base; (ix) our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and our failure to successfully grow and manage these relationships could harm our business; (x) we are establishing a network of master agents and resellers to sell our solution; our failure to effectively develop, manage, and maintain this network could materially harm our revenues; (xi) we sell our solution to larger organizations that require longer sales and implementation cycles and often demand more configuration and integration services or customized features and functions that we may not offer, any of which could delay or prevent these sales and harm our growth rates, business and operating results; (xii) because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from existing clients, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern; (xiii) we rely on third-party telecommunications and internet service providers to provide our clients and their customers with telecommunication services and connectivity to our cloud contact center software, any increase in the cost thereof, reduction in efficacy or any failure by these service providers to provide reliable services could cause us to lose customers, increase our customers’ cost of using our solution and subject us to, among other things, claims for credits or damages; (xiv) we have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability; (xv) we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs; (xvi) failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business and our reputation; and (xvii) the other risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and readers should not unduly rely on such statements.
