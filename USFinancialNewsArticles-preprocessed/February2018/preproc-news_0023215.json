    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 9 (IFR) - Asian credits were weak on Friday as the sell-off in regional stock markets and rising US Treasury yields dented sentiment.\nInvestment-grade credits were seen 5bp-10bp wider at the long end of the curve, while the high-yield segment fell by 1-2 points.\n“Longer-dated bonds are facing more selling pressure as investors are worrying about the prospects of rising inflation and faster-than-anticipated monetary tightening in the US,” said a Hong Kong-based trader.\nA research report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggests that Indonesian BB rated property names, Chinese A rated internet names, Indonesian BBB rated and BB rated industrial names, are most vulnerable to rate increases while Chinese and Korean high yield are the least vulnerable.\nThe iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment-grade CDS index was spotted at 76bp/78bp, which was about 16bp wider than this year’s tight of 60.5bp on January 12.\nAsian primary issuance in dollars came to a halt due to the weak sentiment with no deals are marketed today.\nChinese property developer Fantasia Holdings’ US$300m 7.25% 364-day notes, priced at par last night, traded up and were Quote: d at 100.125/100.325 today.\nIndonesian coal producer Golden Energy and Resources’ newly priced US$150m 9.00% 5NC3, priced at 98.53 with a reoffer yield of 9.375%, were Quote: d at 98.50/98.75 but without liquidity.\nThis week’s new issue of Daegu Bank 3.75% 2023s, priced at 135bp over US Treasuries on Wednesday night, was wider at 121bp/117bp, from yesterday’s 117bp/116bp.\nMeanwhile, the Maldives’ 7.00% 2022s have fallen 4 points to 96.695/97.755 this week since President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency on Monday amid political unrest.\nFitch on Thursday said the political instability could hit the south Asian island country’s important tourism sector.\nReporting by Carol Chan; Editing by Vincent Baby\n ",
