(NASDAQ:MKSI), a global provider of technologies that enable advanced processes and improve productivity, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nGAAP Financial Results 1 Q4 Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenues ($ millions) $512 $405 $1,916 $1,295 Operating margin 23.4% 15.4% 21.2% 12.1% Net income ($ millions) $77.6 $45.5 $339.1 $104.8 Diluted EPS $1.41 $0.83 $6.16 $1.94 Non-GAAP Financial Results 1 Q4 Full Year 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenues ($ millions) $512 $405 $1,916 $1,295 Operating margin 25.9% 20.6% 24.6% 18.7% Net earnings ($ millions) $94.6 $57.2 $328.2 $164.0 Diluted EPS $1.71 $1.05 $5.96 $3.03 1 The full year 2016 results include the results of Newport Corporation (now the Light and Motion segment) since its acquisition on April 29, 2016. Fourth Quarter Financial Results\nSales were $512 million, an increase of 5% from $486 million in the third quarter of 2017, and an increase of 26% from $405 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter net income was $77.6 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, compared to net income of $76.0 million, or $1.38 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017, and $45.5 million, or $0.83 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net earnings, which exclude special charges and credits, were $94.6 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared to $85.9 million, or $1.56 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017, and $57.2 million, or $1.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSales to semiconductor customers were $284 million, an increase of 1% compared to a strong third quarter of 2017, and sales to advanced markets were $228 million in the quarter, an increase of 11% sequentially driven largely by strong growth from our Light and Motion Division.\nSales in the Vacuum and Analysis segment, the historic MKS business, set a quarterly record of $311 million, driven by very strong sales to semiconductor customers. Sales in the Light and Motion segment, the historic Newport business, also set a quarterly record of $201 million.\nAdditional Financial Information\nThe Company had $543 million in cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 and $398 million outstanding under its Term Loan. During the fourth quarter, the Company made another voluntary Term Loan repayment of $50 million and paid a dividend of $9.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share.\nFull Year Results\nSales were a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 30% from $1.47 billion in 2016 on a pro-forma basis (assuming the acquisition of Newport Corporation had occurred as of the beginning of 2016), driven by strong sales to both semiconductor customers as well as customers in thin film manufacturing, industrial manufacturing, and health and life sciences. Sales to semiconductor customers were $1.1 billion, an increase of 45% compared to 2016, also on a pro-forma basis, while sales to advanced markets were $820 million, an increase of 14%.\nSales in the Vacuum and Analysis segment were $1.2 billion, an increase of 38% from $872 million in 2016, driven by very strong sales to semiconductor customers, which increased nearly 50% from 2016.\nSales in the Light and Motion segment were $709 million, an increase of 18% from $602 million in 2016, on a pro-forma basis driven by both sales to semiconductor customers as well as industrial manufacturing customers.\n“We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, which set new records for revenue and profitability, in both of our segments,” said Gerald Colella, Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Colella added, “This strong performance reflects our focused strategy of achieving sustainable and profitable growth by providing customers with innovative technology solutions, continuing to streamline all aspects of our operations, and investing in high-growth solutions and markets. Moreover, our ability to successfully grow and integrate Newport into the existing MKS business helped us deliver these strong results and positions us for future success.”\n“The acquisition of Newport Corporation coupled with our organic growth has enabled us to nearly double non-GAAP EPS in 2017 compared to 2016,” said Seth Bagshaw, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Bagshaw added “These achievements are reflected in our newly published January 2018 Operating Model, which demonstrates our continued and long standing efforts to drive improvements in our operating leverage. Furthermore, recently enacted U.S. Federal tax reform legislation is positive for MKS and is expected to result in a significant reduction in our effective tax rate while providing more long term flexibility in our use of cash.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Outlook\nBased on current business levels, the Company expects that sales in the first quarter of 2018 may range from $510 to $550 million, and at these volumes, GAAP net income could range from $1.68 to $1.95 per diluted share and non-GAAP net earnings could range from $1.86 to $2.12 per diluted share. This financial guidance incorporates assumptions made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and may change as additional clarification and implementation guidance is issued.\nJanuary 2018 Operating Model\nThe Company also published an updated operating model, which reflects an illustrative revenue level of $2.2 billion, improvements in gross margin, lower interest expense, and the expected impact of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act. As a result of these improvements, non-GAAP EPS in the model increased by 33% to $8.55 compared to $6.42 in the prior operating model, published in October of 2017, and represents an improvement in non-GAAP EPS of more than 80% compared to the model entering 2017.\nA conference call with management will be held on Thursday, February 1, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).
