    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- It's official. Gold's Gym Franchising LLC is the best in the world.\nThe honor comes as Gold's Gym has been named a Global Franchise Award Winner for 2018 in the category of Best Health, Beauty and Fitness Franchise.\n\"This is a huge testament to the leadership of the Gold's Gym brand on an international stage and the track record we continue to build upon with more than 700 gyms in 28 countries across six continents,\" said Ken Phipps, Director of Global Franchising for Gold's Gym.\nThe 2018 Global Franchise Awards, sponsored by Global Franchise Magazine and chosen by a panel of judges of top franchise professionals from around the world, celebrate excellence in international franchising. Winners were selected on criteria including the brand's global intentions, the relationship fostered between franchisor and franchisee, how the brand is marketed, and the extent to which a brand has advanced the cause of international franchising.\n\"Those franchisors who do international franchising well, and who share their experience with others deserve to be recognized as wealth creators around the world,\" said Brian Duckett, Chairman of The Franchising Centre in the U.K. and a judge for the awards.\nMeanwhile, with a global footprint of more than 3 million members around the world, Gold's Gym has no plans to slow down its mission to help people achieve their potential through fitness.
