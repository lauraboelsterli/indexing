    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dallas-based Hilltop Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HTH), the holding company for PlainsCapital Bank, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held, Houston-based The Bank of River Oaks in an all-cash transaction. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Hilltop Holdings has agreed to pay cash in the aggregate amount of $85 million to the shareholders and option holders of The Bank of River Oaks.\nThe Bank of River Oaks operates three full-service branch locations in the Houston area and, as of December 31, 2017, reported total assets of approximately $454 million, total loans of approximately $344 million, total deposits of approximately $406 million and total equity capital of approximately $46 million.\n“We are pleased to announce the expansion of our Houston-area banking operations with the acquisition of The Bank of River Oaks,” Jeremy B. Ford, president and co-CEO of Hilltop Holdings, said. “The bank brings a valuable deposit franchise and a substantial commercial lending focus that are excellent complements to PlainsCapital Bank’s existing portfolio. This acquisition also fits well with our stated strategy of utilizing cash to acquire commercial-focused banks in key Texas markets, such as Houston, where we would like to grow significantly.”\nThe transaction brings together two like-minded, Texas-based community banks well known for their straightforward approach to banking and commitment to localized decision-making.\n“We are very excited to join a successful, community-focused, Texas-based organization like PlainsCapital that shares our way of doing business,” said R. Andy Lane, Jr., chairman and CEO of The Bank of River Oaks. “Our banks have a common relationship-focused culture and lending philosophy that make this partnership a natural fit. We’re pleased to be able to offer our customers access to the broader array of banking technologies and solutions that PlainsCapital provides.”\nSince entering the Houston market in 2013, PlainsCapital Bank has been focused on strategically increasing its presence in key locations throughout the area. In early 2017, PlainsCapital Bank celebrated the opening of its new flagship Houston office in the vibrant Upper Kirby District. With The Bank of River Oaks transaction, PlainsCapital Bank’s combined Houston branch network will grow to five locations with additions in the River Oaks, Uptown/Memorial and Medical Center areas.\n“The acquisition of The Bank of River Oaks represents the continuation of our planned growth in the Greater Houston area and our ongoing commitment to serving the Houston community,” said Alan B. White, vice chairman and co-CEO of Hilltop Holdings and chairman of PlainsCapital Bank. “We are excited to further expand our local expertise in commercial lending, healthcare lending, and private banking with the addition of the experienced River Oaks team to our PlainsCapital family.”\nThe transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018, pending approval by shareholders of The Bank of River Oaks and required regulatory approvals.\nHilltop Holdings was advised in the transaction by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz as legal counsel. The Bank of River Oaks was advised by Performance Trust Capital Partners, LLC as financial advisor and Parrott Sims McInnis & Foster, PLLC as legal counsel.\nHilltop Holdings Inc. will host a live webcast and conference call to discuss the transaction at 8:00 AM Central (9:00 AM Eastern) on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing 1-877-508-9457 (domestic) or 1-412-317-0789 (international).
