    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- bluebird bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLUE), a clinical-stage company committed to developing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer, today appointed Alison Finger as chief commercial officer. In this role, Alison will be responsible for shaping and delivering an integrated global commercial strategy to make bluebird’s gene therapies broadly accessible to patients. Alison will oversee all commercial strategy and operations, access management, including pricing, reimbursement and health outcomes, as well as patient operations.\n“Alison’s leadership in commercial planning and strategy has been a tremendous asset as we transition to a fully-integrated commercial-stage company,” said Nick Leschly, chief bluebird. “As bluebird continues to expand and anticipates regulatory filings for three programs in the next two years, Alison’s belief and commitment to our patient-driven mission, along with her outstanding commercial expertise, will help ensure our products find their way to patients who will potentially benefit from the transformational gene therapies we are developing.”\nAlison has been promoted to chief commercial officer after joining bluebird as senior vice president, marketing and product launch in August of 2015. Prior to joining bluebird, she spent 21 years at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). Alison began her tenure at BMS in consumer medicines before progressing to global leadership roles where she was responsible for launching global, regional and national brands in hematology/oncology, neurodegenerative diseases, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and migraine/pain. While at BMS, Alison was responsible for embedding marketing capabilities throughout the company as the executive sponsor for marketing excellence.\n“It’s truly inspirational to see our science moving from the clinic to becoming potential therapies for patients and their families living with severe genetic diseases and cancer,” said Ms. Finger. “I look forward to continuing to work with our outstanding team on this next phase of exciting development and growth for bluebird.”\nAlison is currently a member of the board of directors of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine Foundation which fosters education and research to support the development of transformational treatments and cures for patients worldwide. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in English writing from Saint Lawrence University and a Master of Business Administration from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.\nAbout bluebird bio, Inc.\nWith its lentiviral-based gene therapies, T cell immunotherapy expertise and gene editing capabilities, bluebird bio has built an integrated product platform with broad potential application to severe genetic diseases and cancer. bluebird bio's gene therapy clinical programs include its Lenti-D™ product candidate for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and its LentiGlobin® product candidate for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, also known as β-thalassemia major, and severe sickle cell disease. bluebird bio's oncology pipeline is built upon the company's leadership in lentiviral gene delivery and T cell engineering, with a focus on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T) and T cell receptor (TCR) therapies. bluebird bio's lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs partnered with Celgene. bluebird bio also has discovery research programs utilizing megaTALs/homing endonuclease gene editing technologies with the potential for use across the company's pipeline.\nbluebird bio has operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Seattle, Washington, Durham, North Carolina and Zug, Switzerland.\nLentiGlobin and Lenti-D are trademarks of bluebird bio, Inc.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the timing of potential regulatory approval and commercial launch of the Company’s product candidates.
