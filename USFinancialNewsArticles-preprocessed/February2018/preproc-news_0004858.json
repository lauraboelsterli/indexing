(NASDAQ: KLIC) (“Kulicke & Soffa”, “K&S” or the “Company”) today announced results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2017. The Company reported first quarter net revenue of $213.7 million, a diluted EPS of $(0.98) and a non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.54.\nQuarterly Results - U.S. GAAP Fiscal Q1 2018\nChange vs. Fiscal Q1 2017\nChange vs. Fiscal Q4 2017\nNet Revenue $213.7 million up 42.8% down 1.0% Gross Profit $99.0 million up 44.9% down 5.4% Gross Margin 46.3% up 60 bps down 220 bps Income from Operations $38.6 million up 123.1% up 4.6% Operating Margin 18.1% up 650 bps up 100 bps Net Loss $(69.3) million down 544.2% down 289.3% Net Margin (32.4)% down 4280 bps down 4940 bps EPS – Diluted (a) $(0.98) down 545.5% down 292.2% (a)\nGAAP diluted net earnings per share reflects any dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and stock options, but that effect is excluded when calculating GAAP diluted net (loss) per share because it would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended December 30, 2017, 1.2 million shares of restricted stock units and stock options were excluded due to the Company's net loss.\nQuarterly Results - Non-GAAP\nFiscal Q1 2018 Change vs. Fiscal Q1 2017\nChange vs. Fiscal Q4 2017\nIncome from Operations $41.8 million up 122.3% up 3.5% Operating Margin 19.6% up 700 bps up 90 bps Net Income $38.8 million up 126.9% down 3.2% Net Margin 18.2% up 680 bps down 40 bps EPS - Diluted $0.54 up 125.0% down 3.6% * A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results is provided in the financial tables included in this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results” section.\nDr. Fusen Chen, Kulicke & Soffa's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Strength during the December quarter was driven by our competitive automotive, LED, memory and image sensor solutions in addition to the ongoing strong business environment.\"\nDuring the December quarter the Company incurred a charge of $105 million due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Reform Act of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 125% over the same period in the prior year.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet revenue of $213.7 million. Gross margin of 46.3%. Non-GAAP net income of $38.8 million or $0.54 per share. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $649.7 million as of December 30, 2017.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently expects net revenue in the second fiscal quarter of 2018 ending March 31, 2018 to be approximately $205 million to $215 million. For the first fiscal half of 2018, this guidance represents an increase of 21% over the same period in the prior year.\nLooking forward, Dr. Fusen Chen commented, \"Our competitive positions and exposure to higher-growth segments provides additional upside beyond the already favorable semiconductor unit growth rate of 8.9%, calendar 2017 through 2021. In addition, we remain focused to further enhance these long-term growth prospects through traction with our growing advanced packaging offerings and share gains within our recurring revenue business.\"\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company's non-GAAP results exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired through business combinations, goodwill impairment, costs associated with restructuring, income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as well as tax benefits or expense associated with the foregoing non-GAAP items. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the Company’s operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s underlying operational performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s period-to-period financial results and the Company’s overall performance to that of its competitors.\nManagement uses both U.S. GAAP metrics as well as non-GAAP operating income, operating margin, net income, net margin and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP items is meant to supplement, but not substitute for, GAAP financial measures or information. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results in combination with GAAP results provides better transparency to the investment community when analyzing business trends, providing meaningful comparisons with prior period performance and enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached exhibit.\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nA conference call to discuss these results will be held today, January 31, 2018, beginning at 6:00 pm (EST).
