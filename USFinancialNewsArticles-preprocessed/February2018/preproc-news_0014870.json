    "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) â€” Wynn Resorts has hired a law firm to help investigate sexual misconduct allegations against casino mogul Steve Wynn, the company's chairman and CEO.\nA statement by Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP says it will assist the Wynn board's special committee of independent directors with the inquiry.\nThe statement released Friday says investigators will set up a phone and web-based reporting line for current and former Wynn employees to provide information.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Jan. 26 that a number of women said Wynn harassed or assaulted them and that one case led to a $7.5 million settlement.\nThe Las Vegas billionaire has vehemently denied the allegations, which he attributed to a campaign led by his ex-wife.\nHe also faces investigations by gambling regulators in two states.",
