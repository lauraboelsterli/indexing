    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Model N, Inc., (NYSE: MODN), the leading provider of cloud-based Revenue Management solutions to life sciences, technology and manufacturing companies, today announced financial results for the first quarter, which ended December 31, 2017.\n“Model N exceeded both revenue and profitability guidance and started fiscal year 2018 with record SaaS and Maintenance revenues, which is a testament to the progress we have made in transitioning our business model to SaaS,” said Zack Rinat, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Model N. “We are committed to completing the transformation of Model N to a 100% SaaS business model.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nRevenues : SaaS and maintenance revenues were $32.3 million compared to $22.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Total revenues were $39.1 million after the $0.6 million deferred revenue adjustment related to the purchase accounting for the Revitas acquisition, compared to $28.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 do not reflect the Revitas acquisition, which closed in January 2017. Gross Profit : Gross profit was $22.3 million compared to $14.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margins were 57% compared to 51% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP income from operations was $2.0 million compared to a Non-GAAP loss from operations of $(4.2) million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net loss : GAAP net loss was $(5.3) million compared to net loss of $(7.6) million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $(0.18) based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 29.4 million, as compared to net loss per share of $(0.27) for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 28.0 million. Non-GAAP net income (loss) : Non-GAAP net income was $0.8 million as compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $(4.1) million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.03 based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 29.4 million, as compared to Non-GAAP net loss per share of $(0.15) for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 28.0 million.

The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” and similar expressions are intended to identify . These are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. If the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these . Risks include, but are not limited to: (i) delays in closing customer contracts; (ii) our ability to improve and sustain our sales execution; (iii) the timing of new orders and the associated revenue recognition; (iv) adverse changes in general economic or market conditions; (v) delays or reductions in information technology spending and resulting variability in customer orders from quarter to quarter; (vi) competitive factors, including but not limited to pricing pressures, industry consolidation, entry of new competitors and new applications and marketing initiatives by our competitors; (vii) our ability to manage our growth effectively; and (viii) acceptance of our applications and services by customers; (ix) success of new products; (x) the risk that the strategic initiatives that we may pursue will not result in significant future revenues; (xi) changes in health care regulation and policy and tax in the United States and worldwide; and (xii) our ability to retain customers, and (xiii) acquisition-related risks from our acquisition of Revitas. Further information on risks that could affect Model N’s results is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and any current reports on Form 8-K that we may file from time to time. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could differ materially from expectations. Model N assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update any such after the date of this release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nOur reported results include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net (loss) income per share, and adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP gross profit excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition & integration related expenses, deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of intangible assets. Non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP net loss exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and acquisition & integration related expenses, deferred revenue adjustment and valuation allowance resulting from Revitas acquisition as they are often excluded by other companies to help investors understand the operational performance of their business and, in the case of stock-based compensation, can be difficult to predict and therefore we have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted Non-GAAP results with GAAP. In addition, stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period and company to company due to such things as differing valuation methodologies and changes in stock price. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss, adjusted depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition & integration related expenses, deferred revenue adjustment, interest (income) expense, net, and other (income) expenses, net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. Reconciliation tables are provided in this press release.\nModel N Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nAs of As of December 31, September 31, 2017 2017 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 48,324 $ 57,558 Accounts receivable, net 38,679 24,784 Prepaid expenses 2,800 3,733 Other current assets 1,202 1,013 Total current assets 91,005 87,088 Property and equipment, net 3,823 4,611 Goodwill 39,283 39,283 Intangible assets, net 38,738 40,156 Other assets 1,104 798 Total assets $ 173,953 $ 171,936 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 4,240 $ 3,002 Accrued employee compensation 9,143 14,996 Accrued liabilities 4,028 4,979 Deferred revenue, current portion 57,135 49,186 Long term debt, current portion 4,831 4,753 Total current liabilities 79,377 76,916 Long-term liabilities: Long term debt 52,610 52,452 Other long-term liabilities 1,266 1,307 Total long-term liabilities 53,876 53,759 Total liabilities 133,253 130,675 Stockholders' equity: Common Stock 4 4 Preferred Stock — — Additional paid-in capital 221,639 217,052 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (393 ) (502 ) Accumulated deficit (180,550 ) (175,293 ) Total stockholders' equity 40,700 41,261 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 173,953 $ 171,936 Model N Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nThree 2017 2016 Revenues: SaaS and maintenance $ 32,323 $ 22,640 License and implementation 6,744 5,423 Total revenues 39,067 28,063 Cost of Revenues: SaaS and maintenance 13,024 10,208 License and implementation 3,785 3,614 Total cost of revenues 16,809 13,822 Gross profit 22,258 14,241 Operating Expenses: Research and development 9,068 5,975 Sales and marketing 8,492 8,734 General and administrative 8,731 7,185 Total operating expenses 26,291 21,894 Loss from operations (4,033 ) (7,653 ) Interest expense (income), net 1,423 (33 ) Other expenses (income), net 125 (154 ) Loss before income taxes (5,581 ) (7,466 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (324 ) 134 Net loss $ (5,257 ) $ (7,600 ) Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic and diluted $ (0.18 ) $ (0.27 ) Weighted average number of shares used in computing net loss per share attributable to common stockholders: Basic and diluted 29,401 28,008 Model N Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree 2017 2016 Cash Flows From Operating Activities: Net loss $ (5,257 ) $ (7,600 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities Depreciation and amortization 2,265 1,094 Stock-based compensation 4,036 1,895 Amortization of debt discount and issuance cost 236 — Other non-cash charges (491 ) 49 Changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisition: Accounts receivable (13,846 ) 655 Prepaid expenses and other assets 363 843 Deferred cost of implementation services 191 701 Accounts payable 1,216 591 Accrued employee compensation (5,896 ) (898 ) Other accrued and long-term liabilities (703 ) (1,298 ) Deferred revenue 8,145 (4,261 ) Net cash used in operating activities (9,741 ) (8,229 ) Cash Flows From Investing Activities: Purchases of property and equipment, net (60 ) (194 ) Capitalization of software development costs — (275 ) Cash held in escrow for acquisition — (5,000 ) Net cash used in investing activities (60 ) (5,469 ) Cash Flows From Financing Activities: Proceeds from exercise of stock options 552 17 Net cash provided by financing activities 552 17 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 15 (22 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (9,234 ) (13,703 ) Cash and cash equivalents Beginning of period 57,558 66,149 End of period $ 48,324 $ 52,446 Model N Inc.

We believe these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future. These adjustments to our current period GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of Model N’s underlying operating results and trends and our marketplace performance. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance that are considered by management for the purpose of making operational decisions. In addition, these non-GAAP results are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating loss, net loss or basic and diluted net loss per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and are subject to limitations.\nWhile a large component of our expenses incurred in certain periods, we believe investors may want to exclude the effects of these items in order to compare our financial performance with that of other companies and between time periods:\n(a) Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash item. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(b) Amortization of intangible assets resulted principally from acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization is a non-cash item. As such, we believe exclusion of these expenses provides for a better comparison of our operation results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(c) In January 2017, we acquired Revitas, as part of the acquisition we incurred certain non-recurring integration costs. We believe that exclusion of these acquisition related adjustments and costs provides for a better comparison of our operation results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(d) Represents deferred revenue adjustment resulting from purchase price accounting that is related to the Revitas acquisition and is a non-cash item. As such, we believe exclusion of these expenses provides for a better comparison of our operation results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180206006324/en/\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nICR for Model N\nStaci Mortenson, 650-610-4998\ninvestorrelations@modeln.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\npr@modeln.com\nSource: Model N, Inc.",
