    "text": "BOSTON, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Burns & Levinson today announced that it represented Harvard Bioscience, Inc. in its approximately $70 million acquisition of Data Sciences International, Inc. (DSI). The deal, which was announced on January 22, 2018, closed on January 31, 2018. Simultaneously, Burns represented Harvard Bioscience in its sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Denville Scientific, Inc. to Thomas Scientific, LLC for approximately $20 million (including a $3 million earn-out provision).\nIn conjunction with the acquisition and sale, Burns also served as Harvard Bioscience's counsel for a $64 million credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the lenders.\nThe Burns deal team was led by partners Josef Volman and Chad Porter , who have represented Harvard Bioscience since 2009. Burns has represented Harvard Bioscience in three other acquisitions since 2014 – HEKA Electronik in 2015, and Triangle BioSystems, Inc. and Multi Channel Systems in 2014 – and the sale of Ahn Biotechnologie GmbH in 2016.\n\"It has been exciting to be involved with this company and its management team, and to watch it grow and evolve into a global leader in the life sciences research industry,\" said Volman. \"Closing three simultaneous transactions – the acquisition, the sale and the debt financing – made this an especially complex but rewarding project. We brought our best resources together to help our valued client achieve this transformative business event and look forward to continuing our great work together.\"\n\"Our entire organization has worked tirelessly over the last three years to build a foundation to be able to acquire and integrate a company like DSI. Burns & Levinson has been with us every step of the way, and their business savvy and technical expertise has played a significant role in helping Harvard Bioscience take this significant step forward in our strategic vision of the company,\" said Jeffrey A.
