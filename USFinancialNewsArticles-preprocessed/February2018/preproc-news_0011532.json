The source added Italo would hold a board meeting on Tuesday to discuss both the bid and a planned listing on the Milan bourse. \nGIP was not immediately available for comment. \nItalo, which runs high-speed trains in Italy, planned to offer up to 40 percent of capital in an initial public offering (IPO) in Milan by the end of this month. $1 = 0.8057 euros Reporting by Paola Arosio; Writing by Francesca Landini; Editing by Edmund Blair",
