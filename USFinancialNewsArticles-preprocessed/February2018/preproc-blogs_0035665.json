    "text": "Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, did say earlier this month that the company was \"targeting to become approximately net cash netural over time.\" \nMilunovich explains a couple of different ways Apple could do that. \nOne option is for the company to repurchase 10 percent of its shares each year until 2021, boosting earnings per share 30 percent from estimates. Another scenario is for Apple to spend between $30 billion and $60 billion per year on share repurchases and combine that with a dividend yield of 3 percent until 2023 — which he says is what Wall Street is currently leaning toward. \nSome investors have speculated that Apple might buy a big U.S. company with its new free-flowing capital, but Milunovich said: \"Don't hold your breath.\" \n\"On the M&A front we expect Apple to continue its strategy of filling technology or personnel gaps with small tuck-in acquisitions. Transformational M&A would result in a collision of different cultures and priorities, which Apple has thus far avoided,\" he wrote. \nDividend increases are not always a great sign for technology companies: \"A juicy yield can mask a company's shaky fundamentals, at least temporarily,\" as one Barron's reporter put it. Reuters points to Hewlett-Packard in the early 2000s as an example of buybacks that \"cannibalize innovation\" and \"slow growth.\" \nBut in this case, Milunovich said he doesn't see the capital structure weighing on Apple's valuation — he said investors are still watching Apple's ability to grow and turn capital into profits . \n— CNBC's Paayal Zaveri and Josh Lipton contributed to this report.",
