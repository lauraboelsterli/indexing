    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Hopes for a quick vote on legislation to keep the U.S. government operating beyond midnight hit a snag on Thursday when Republican Senator Rand Paul put up a roadblock to voting because he first wanted debate on his amendment to kill the measureâ€™s increased federal spending.\nIt was unclear whether the Senate and House of Representatives would be able to pass a funding bill by midnight, when existing federal funds expire. Without new funds, federal agencies would have to be ordered to partially shut down.\nReporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
