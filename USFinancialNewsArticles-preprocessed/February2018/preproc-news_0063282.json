    "text": "CINCINNATI, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017. At the end of the quarter, Radio operations were classified as held for sale, and its results are included in discontinued operations. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.\nScripps also is reporting results through its new segments, Local Media and National Media, which are reflected in all periods.\nFor the quarter, the net income from continuing operations was $11.5 million or 16 cents per share. In the prior-year quarter, net income from continuing operations was $36.3 million or 44 cents per share. The current-year quarter included a gain on the investment in Katz of $5.4 million, offset by $2 million of restructuring charges, which increased income from continuing operations by $2 million (net of taxes) or 2 cents per share.\nIn spite of a $52.8 million decline in political revenue due to the non-election year, total fourth-quarter 2017 revenue of $257 million stayed relatively equal to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBusiness highlights\nOn Feb. 15, the Scripps board initiated the company's first quarterly dividend in 10 years. The first-quarter dividend of 5 cents per share will be payable to shareholders of record on March 1 for payout on March 26.\nOn Jan. 25, the company said it expects its comprehensive restructuring work to yield more than $30 million in annual savings. The company also announced plans to sell its radio station group, with Kalil & Co. retained to handle the process.\nIn the Local Media division, core advertising was up 7 percent in the fourth quarter.\nThe company green-lit a second season of the daytime show Pickler & Ben, with 100 markets already committed to airing it compared to 38 in the first season. The show is growing audience in its time periods on Scripps stations.\nIn the National Media division, Newsy ended the year with contracts covering carriage into 26 million cable households, broadening its distribution into that lucrative marketplace after already being deployed on all the major over-the-top television platforms.\nFurther pursuing a more effective and efficient operating structure, the company reorganized its businesses to better focus on the marketplaces they serve: A Local Media division comprised of local media brands on all platforms and a National Media division made up of the businesses with national scale and reach focused on the national advertising market.\nCommenting on the business highlights, Scripps President and CEO Adam Symson said:\n\"Six months into our systematic work to optimize the company's performance – and with full confidence in our path ahead – the Scripps board decided the time was right to initiate our first quarterly dividend since 2008. Their decision is a tangible show of confidence in the state of our business and our strategies for the future.\n\"We've begun to see the positive impact of our comprehensive reorganization and restructuring with cost reductions that will drive meaningful margin and cash flow improvement.\n\"We also continue to move forward with our television station acquisition strategy – an aggressive plan to get deeper and even stronger in the markets where we operate and emerge with a higher-performing portfolio that has more revenue and profit-generating capacity.\n\"And we've made significant progress unlocking strong growth opportunities around the future of television while improving our financial foundation. Our fast-growing Katz networks are capitalizing on the resurgence of over-the-air viewership and their 90 percent national household reach, and Newsy is quickly marching toward 40 million pay TV homes by the end of 2018. Both are creating compelling platforms to attract national advertising revenue.\n\"This work in recent months demonstrates the company's commitment to two equally important opportunities: building near-term value through improved operating performance in our strong, stable local business and setting up our company for significant long-term value creation.\"\nFourth-quarter operating results\nRevenue was $257 million, an increase of 1.6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCosts and expenses for segments, shared services and corporate were $222 million, up from $172 million in the year-ago period, primarily driven by higher network programming fees and a quarter of expense from Katz.\nFourth-quarter results by segment compared to prior-year amounts were:\nLocal Media\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue from the Local Media group was $203 million, down about 17 percent from the prior-year quarter. Political advertising revenue was $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $56.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year.\nRetransmission revenue increased 4.9 percent to $63.5 million.\nCore advertising was up 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter.\nTotal segment expenses increased 6.5 percent to $157 million, driven by increases in programming fees tied to network affiliation agreements as well as the cost of producing Pickler & Ben.\nFourth-quarter segment profit was $45.4 million, compared to $95.1 million in the year-ago quarter.\nNational Media\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue from the National Media group was $53 million, up from $9 million in the prior-year period. Revenue from Katz, which we acquired on Oct. 2, 2017, was $41 million.\nExpenses for the National Media group were $50.3 million, up from $11.2 million from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of Katz, expenses increased 30 percent.\nFourth-quarter segment profit was $2.7 million, compared to a loss of $2.2 million in the 2016 quarter.\nFinancial condition\nAs of Dec. 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $149 million while total debt was $693 million.\nFrom Jan. 1, 2017, through Feb. 23, 2018, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $17.31. In November 2016, the board of directors authorized a $100 million share repurchase program that expires at the end of 2018.\nYear-to-date results\nThe following comparisons are for the year ending Dec. 31, 2017:\nIn 2017, revenue was $865 million compared to $868 million in 2016. Retransmission revenue increased $39 million. In the non-election year, political advertising was $8.7 million in 2017 compared to $101 million in 2016.\nCosts and expenses for segments, shared services and corporate were $770 million, an increase of $86 million, primarily driven by higher network programming fees as well as costs in the National Media businesses.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $12 million or 13 cents per share. In the prior year, net income from continuing operations was $59.9 million or 71 cents per share. The 2017 period includes a $2.4 million charge to write off deferred loan fees associated with refinanced debt, $11.6 million of other income associated with the gain on Scripps' 5 percent interest in Katz, the sale of a small business and an adjustment to a purchase-price earnout, $4.4 million of restructuring charges and a $35.7 million non-cash charge to write down goodwill and intangible assets.\nLooking ahead\nComparisons are to the same period of 2017 as reported in today's press release tables.\nFirst-quarter 2018\nLocal Media revenue\nUp mid-single digits\nRetransmission revenue\nUp about 10 percent\nLocal Media expense\nUp mid-single digits\nNational Media revenue\nIn the mid-to-high $50 million range\nNational Media expense\nIn the mid-to-high $50 million range\nShared services and\nCorporate\nIn the mid-teen millions\nInterest expense\nAbout $8 million\nPension expense\nAbout $2 million\nCapex\nIn the high-single-digit millions\nDepreciation & amortization\nAbout $15 million\nConference call\nThe senior management of The E.W.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe determine our business segments based upon our management and internal reporting structure, as well as the basis that our chief operating decision maker makes resource allocation decisions.\nEffective December 31, 2017, we realigned our businesses into a new internal organization and began reporting to reflect this new structure. Under the new structure we have the following reportable segments: Local Media, National Media and Other. We have recast the operating results for all periods to reflect this change.\nOur Local Media segment includes our local broadcast stations and their related digital operations. It is comprised of fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, one independent station and three Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. Our Local Media segment earns revenue primarily from the sale of advertising to local, national and political advertisers and retransmission fees received from cable operators, telecommunications companies and satellite carriers.\nOur National Media segment includes our collection of national brands. Our national media brands include Katz, Midroll Media (Midroll), Newsy and other national brands. These operations earn revenue primarily through the sale of advertising.\nWe allocate a portion of certain corporate costs and expenses, including information technology, certain employee benefits and shared services, to our business segments. The allocations are generally amounts agreed upon by management, which may differ from an arms-length amount. Corporate assets are primarily cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, property and equipment primarily used for corporate purposes and deferred income taxes.\nOur chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating performance of our business segments and makes decisions about the allocation of resources to our business segments using a measure called segment profit. Segment profit excludes interest, defined benefit pension plan expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, divested operating units, restructuring activities, investment results and certain other items that are included in net income (loss) determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nInformation regarding our business segments is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSegment operating revenues:\nLocal Media\n$\n202,566\n$\n242,634\n(16.5)\n%\n$\n779,205\n$\n836,154\n(6.8)\n%\nNational Media\n52,973\n9,033\n486.4\n%\n80,174\n27,929\n187.1\n%\nOther\n1,436\n1,286\n11.7\n%\n5,455\n4,737\n15.2\n%\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n256,975\n$\n252,953\n1.6\n%\n$\n864,834\n$\n868,820\n(0.5)\n%\nSegment profit (loss):\nLocal Media\n$\n45,431\n$\n95,089\n$\n156,890\n$\n243,298\nNational Media\n2,667\n(2,181)\n(9,260)\n(10,156)\nOther\n(123)\n(35)\n(2,361)\n(2,513)\nShared services and corporate\n(13,152)\n(12,031)\n(50,506)\n(46,162)\nAcquisition and related integration costs\n—\n—\n—\n(578)\nRestructuring costs\n(2,015)\n—\n(4,422)\n—\nDepreciation and amortization of\nintangible assets\n(14,926)\n(13,643)\n(56,343)\n(55,204)\nImpairment of goodwill and intangibles\n—\n—\n(35,732)\n—\nGains (losses), net on disposal of\nproperty and equipment\n7\n(436)\n(169)\n(480)\nInterest expense\n(8,534)\n(4,436)\n(26,697)\n(18,039)\nDefined benefit pension plan expense\n(3,627)\n(3,828)\n(14,112)\n(14,332)\nMiscellaneous, net\n5,225\n(1,401)\n10,636\n(2,646)\nIncome (loss) from continuing\noperations before income taxes\n$\n10,953\n$\n57,098\n$\n(32,076)\n$\n93,188\nOperating results for our Local Media segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSegment operating revenues:\nCore advertising\n$\n130,180\n$\n122,099\n6.6\n%\n$\n493,462\n$\n500,091\n(1.3)\n%\nPolitical\n3,396\n56,160\n(94.0)\n%\n8,651\n100,761\n(91.4)\n%\nRetransmission\n63,496\n60,542\n4.9\n%\n259,499\n220,723\n17.6\n%\nOther revenue\n5,494\n3,833\n43.3\n%\n17,593\n14,579\n20.7\n%\nTotal operating revenues\n202,566\n242,634\n(16.5)\n%\n779,205\n836,154\n(6.8)\n%\nSegment costs and expenses:\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n71,770\n69,902\n2.7\n%\n287,758\n281,956\n2.1\n%\nProgramming\n49,148\n41,477\n18.5\n%\n186,945\n162,821\n14.8\n%\nOther expenses\n36,217\n36,166\n0.1\n%\n147,612\n148,079\n(0.3)\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n157,135\n147,545\n6.5\n%\n622,315\n592,856\n5.0\n%\nSegment profit\n$\n45,431\n$\n95,089\n(52.2)\n%\n$\n156,890\n$\n243,298\n(35.5)\n%\nOperating results for National Media segment were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSegment operating revenues:\nKatz\n$\n40,975\n$\n—\n$\n40,975\n$\n—\nMidroll\n5,221\n4,283\n21.9\n%\n18,232\n14,093\n29.4\n%\nNewsy\n3,128\n1,712\n82.7\n%\n10,089\n4,806\n109.9\n%\nOther revenue\n3,649\n3,038\n20.1\n%\n10,878\n9,030\n20.5\n%\nTotal operating revenues\n52,973\n9,033\n486.4\n%\n80,174\n27,929\n187.1\n%\nSegment costs and expenses:\nEmployee compensation and benefits\n11,784\n6,080\n93.8\n%\n31,121\n20,767\n49.9\n%\nProgramming\n24,632\n1,742\n29,522\n4,165\nOther expenses\n13,890\n3,392\n309.5\n%\n28,791\n13,153\n118.9\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n50,306\n11,214\n348.6\n%\n89,434\n38,085\n134.8\n%\nSegment profit\n$\n2,667\n$\n(2,181)\n$\n(9,260)\n$\n(10,156)\n2.
