    "text": "TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) _ Motorcar Parts of America Inc. (MPAA) on Friday reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $6.8 million, after reporting a profit in the same period a year earlier.\nOn a per-share basis, the Torrance, California-based company said it had a loss of 36 cents. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs and pretax expenses, came to 34 cents per share.\nThe results missed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 49 cents per share.\nThe maker of remanufactured vehicle alternators and starters posted revenue of $100.1 million in the period, which also did not meet Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $113.7 million.\nMotorcar Parts expects full-year revenue in the range of $434 million to $440 million.\nMotorcar Parts shares have fallen nearly 2 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock has fallen 10 percent in the last 12 months.\nThis story was generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
