    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The majority owner of Britain’s Sky Bet, CVC, has chosen investment banks Citi ( C.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Barclays ( BARC.L ) to lead an initial public offering of the online betting company, two sources familiar with the matter said.\nNumis ( NUM.L ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) will act as joint bookrunners for the planned listing, which comes amid an expected clampdown on gambling machines in British betting shops that may make Sky Bet, which is online-only, relatively more attractive.\nCVC , Citi, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Numis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn January, Reuters reported Rothschild had been hired to examine a listing for the company, which was formed in 2001 and is headquartered in Leeds.\nPrivate equity firm CVC acquired an 80 percent stake in the betting business from pay-television operator Sky ( SKYB.L ) just over three years ago in a deal that at the time valued it at 800 million pounds.\nIn the year ended June 2017, Sky Bet’s revenue increased to 516 million pounds ($715.5 million) from 374 million pounds in the previous period. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 38 percent to 146 million pounds.\n($1 = 0.7211 pounds)\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ",
