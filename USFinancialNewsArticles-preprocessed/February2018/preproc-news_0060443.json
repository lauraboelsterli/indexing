    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 6:59 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Bayer fourth quarter profit edges lower as crop chems, consumer care weigh Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LEVERKUSEN, Germany (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer’s adjusted core earnings slipped 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, as it tries to overcome weak demand for crop protection products in Brazil and a drop in sales of consumer care products. Bayer’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 1.78 billion euros (1.57 billion pounds) for the quarter, slightly lower than the average forecast by analysts of 1.8 billion euros. It said 2018 adjusted EBITDA would be at the prior-year level, held back by a burden of about 300 million euros from a warning letter by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
