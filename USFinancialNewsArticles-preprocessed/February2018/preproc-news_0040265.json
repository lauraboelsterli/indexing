Patrick also said on Thursday the Swiss crop protection and seeds company was interested in assets coming up for sale via anti-trust disposals amid industry consolidation. But he said regulators “have been quite restrictive in terms of who can acquire what”. Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Michael Shields",
