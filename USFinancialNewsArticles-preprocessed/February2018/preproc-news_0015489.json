    "text": "A daily morning look at the financial stories you need to know to start the day. \nSTOCKS/ECONOMY \n-Stock futures are lower and trading volatile again after yesterday's late selling led to a flat close. We get more earnings reports on Thursday and the weekly jobless claims data. \n-The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is now up to 2.86 percent. The Bank of England has just called for rate hikes sooner and faster in a hawkish forecast. \n-Twitter shares are soaring in the pre-market after reporting its first ever net profit.",
