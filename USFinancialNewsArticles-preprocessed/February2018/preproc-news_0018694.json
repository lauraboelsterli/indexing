If the losses deepen into a bear market (down 20 percent), then it could be 22 months before we revisit these highs, history shows.\n\"The average bull market 'correction' is 13 percent over four months and takes just four months to recover,\" Goldman Sachs Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer said in a Jan. 29 report.\nSource: Goldman Sachs\nBut the pain lasts nearly two years on average if the S&P falls at least 20 percent from its record high — past 2,298 — into bear market territory, the report said. The average decline in a bear market is 30 percent, according to Goldman.\nThe last week of stock market drops has taken the S&P 500 into correction territory for the first time in two years\nStocks remain in an upward bull market trend, the second longest in history.\nS&P 500 corrections and bear markets since WWII\nSource: Goldman Sachs\nWATCH: Five strategies you should use to protect your portfolio show chapters 5 strategies you should use to protect your portfolio 8:32 AM ET Thu, 8 Feb 2018 | 01:55",
