    "text": "Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai \nAt a groundbreaking ceremony for a new data center in Tennessee, Google will flesh out the details of its plan to increase its investments across the United States. \nThe company is pouring money into 14 states across the country and hiring thousands of new employees, CEO Sundar Pichai will announce in Clarksville, Tennessee, on Friday afternoon. \nPichai described Alphabet's plans to expand its footprint outside the Bay Area during the company's Q4 earnings call, but today released new information as to where its new offices and data centers will be located. \nGoogle will invest $2.5 billion over the next few years to open or expand data centers in Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia and Oklahoma, and is constructing new offices or expanding existing ones in nine states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington. The company estimates that about 1,900 people work directly on its data center campuses. \nThese investments will bring Google's footprint to 21 states, with data centers in six. \nEarlier this year, fellow tech giant Apple also announced plans to increase its investment in the US economy, saying that it would create 20,000 new jobs and open a new campus . In his State of the Union speech, President Trump credited last year's tax reform with spurring Apple's plans, though it isn't clear how much of the new investment can actually be attributed to tax changes .
