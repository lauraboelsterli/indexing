Knowland is a globally recognized provider of meeting and group data that offers extensive insight into market analytics, group industry trends, and powerful benchmarking tools. The company is headquartered in Rosslyn, Virginia, right outside the nation's capital.\nSDR was founded in 2004 by Jeff Eastman. Headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, SDR provides reports to convention and visitors bureaus and hotel sales teams who use their self-reported future looking booked meeting data to benchmark key metrics such as booking pace versus their competitor markets. The bookings, provided by participating CVBs in markets across the US and Canada, are aggregated, analyzed, and configured into the TAP Report which has become an industry standard for CVBs. It serves as a critical tool used to continually check the success or shortcomings of their sales strategies. SDR also offers TAP Analytics, a cloud-based business intelligence solution built on the TAP Report data. SDR's TAP Hotel reports provide participating hotels a forward-looking tool for benchmarking group bookings pace versus their competitive set.
