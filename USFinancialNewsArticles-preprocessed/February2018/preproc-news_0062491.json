The costs incurred in 2017 associated with the tremendous progress we have made on both fronts are in line with our expectations and we believe we have sufficient funds to achieve our planned critical milestones through 2019,” said Michael MacLean, chief financial officer of Akcea.\nUpcoming Events\nApproval and launch of volanesorsen in mid-2018 in patients with FCS in US, EU and Canada.

Akcea’s 2017 revenue is entirely related to the Company’s collaboration with Novartis. In January 2017, Akcea and Novartis entered into a strategic collaboration and Novartis paid Akcea a $75 million upfront payment, which Akcea is amortizing into revenue. As part of the strategic collaboration, Novartis also purchased shares of Ionis’ common stock at a premium. Since Akcea is providing the services under the Novartis collaboration, Akcea is also amortizing into revenue the $33 million premium. Under its license agreement with Ionis, Akcea paid a $15 million sublicense fee to Ionis related to the $75 million upfront payment and recorded a $33 million non-cash charge related to the premium Novartis paid to acquire Ionis’ shares of common stock as described in Operating Expenses below.\nOperating Expenses\nAkcea’s operating expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 on a GAAP basis were $43 million and $164 million, respectively, and on a pro forma basis were $37 million and $146 million, respectively. These amounts compare to GAAP operating expenses of $34 million and $84 million, and pro forma operating expenses of $31 million and $73 million, respectively for the same periods in 2016. Akcea’s operating expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to $48 million of sublicensing expenses related to the Company’s collaboration with Novartis. The $48 million is comprised of $15 million the Company paid to Ionis related to the $75 million upfront payment and a $33 million non-cash charge related to the premium Novartis paid to acquire Ionis’ common stock. Akcea’s operating expenses related to development and support services Ionis provided to Akcea was $102 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet Loss\nAkcea reported a net loss of $23 million and $110 million on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $34 million and $83 million for the same periods in 2016.
