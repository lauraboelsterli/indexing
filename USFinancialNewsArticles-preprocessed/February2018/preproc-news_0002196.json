    "text": "Martínez-Valle Brings Formidable Industrial and Technology Leadership to the Company\nTLALNEPANTLA DE BAZ, Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mexichem, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: MEXCHEM*) (“The Company” or “Mexichem”) announced that it will appoint Daniel Martínez-Valle to the position of Chief Executive Officer, following the resignation of Antonio Carrillo, who has informed us that he is leaving to pursue other professional interests in the US at a public company. The Board of Directors of Mexichem will formally appoint Mr. Martínez-Valle in the coming days.\nMr. Martínez-Valle, 46, is currently CEO of Kaluz, an industrial and financial conglomerate, which he joined in 2010. Previously, he was the Director of Worldwide Strategy & Planning at Cisco, a worldwide technology leader. Prior to that, Mr. Martínez-Valle was the founding partner of a private equity firm and also served as CEO of Aquanima, a leading provider of global supply management for large corporations in Europe and Latin America. Earlier in his career, he was a consultant at McKinsey & Co., and served as Chief of Staff in the Mexican Ministry of Finance. Mr. Martínez-Valle earned an MBA from Stanford University, a B.S. from ITAM.\nCommenting on this upcoming appointment, Mr. Juan Pablo del Valle, Mexichem’s Chairman said, “We are fortunate to have a person of Daniel’s leadership style, vision and background. He is the right person to lead Mexichem in our development as a purpose driven, future fit organization. Daniel has been instrumental in the profitable growth and global expansion of Kaluz and brings tremendous industrial and technological leadership. Importantly, Daniel is current on all areas of Mexichem’s operations, having worked closely with the Company’s operating management teams in an advisory capacity, specifically around recent acquisitions, including the Netafim transaction.”\nMexichem’s Chairman continued, “We appreciate Antonio’s valuable contribution to all Mexichem’s stakeholders and his role in developing the organization’s talent and in positioning the Company for future growth. At the same time, we accept his decision to assume another leadership position, and we all wish him continued success in his new endeavor.”\n“This is a great honor for me, and I am pleased to be working together with the excellent global teams in place at Mexichem,” Mr. Martínez-Valle noted. “Mexichem has a unique growth platform, and I look forward to leveraging my experience to build upon the Company’s success to-date.”\n“This was a difficult decision for me personally. Mexichem is a fantastic company with strong fundamentals and a terrific management team. I am pleased to be leaving it in excellent hands, with strong growth prospects ahead and with tremendous potential coming from the Netafim acquisition” said Antonio Carrillo.\nThe Company takes this opportunity to re-affirm its guidance for 2017 full year EBITDA growth of 20%-25% above the $884 million in EBITDA reported in 2016. Mexichem expects to close the Netafim acquisition in early February.\nIn order to accommodate any questions from the financial community related to this announcement, the Company has decided to host a brief conference call at 4pm Mexico City Time/5pm US Eastern Time today, January 31, 2018, hosted by Mr. Carrillo and Mr. Martínez-Valle. The call will be open to analysts and investors.\nDetails are as follows:\nUSA Toll Free Dial-in: +1 (877) 883-0383 International Dial-in: +1 (412) 902-6506 Participant Elite Entry Number: 1593841 Click here for the webcast.\nMr. Carrillo and Mr. Martínez-Valle will work together during the upcoming transition period, and both will participate in the Company’s investment community conference call scheduled for Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 10 a.m. Mexico City Time/11 a.m. US Eastern Time, following the release of Mexichem’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nABOUT MEXICHEM\nMexichem is a global leader in plastic piping and one of the world’s largest chemical and petrochemical companies.
