    "text": "EVANSVILLE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Berry Global Group, Inc. (NYSE:BERY) today reported results for its first fiscal 2018 quarter, referred to in the following as the December 2017 quarter.\nHighlights\nNet income was $163 million. Net income per diluted share increased to $1.20 compared to $0.40 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income per diluted share up 34 percent to $0.67. Net sales increased 18 percent to $1.8 billion. Operating income increased by 12 percent to $163 million. Operating EBITDA was $310 million (17.5 percent of net sales), an increase of 12 percent. Cash flow from operations increased by 7% to $153 million. Increased guidance for fiscal year 2018 cash flow from operations to $1,007 million and adjusted free cash flow to $630 million.\n“I am proud to report we had another solid quarter of improved financial results. Milestones for both revenue and operating EBITDA were achieved for any December ended quarter.

These increases are partially offset by a 1% base volume decline.\nThe operating income increase of $17 million from the prior year quarter is primarily attributed to acquisition operating income of $26 million, and an $11 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses from cost reductions, and a $7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization. These increases are partially offset by an $18 million unfavorable impact from under recovery of higher cost of goods sold, a $5 million increase in business integration and restructuring costs, and a $4 million unfavorable impact from volume decline.\nThe performance of the Company’s divisions compared with the prior fiscal year quarter is as follows:\nEngineered Materials\nDecember Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $ 648 $ 383 $ 265 69 % Operating income 88 53 35 66 % Engineered Materials’ net sales increased by $265 million from the prior year quarter primarily attributed to acquisition net sales of $267 million and a $6 million increase in selling prices due to the pass through of higher resin prices, partially offset by a 2% base volume decline.\nThe operating income increase of $35 million from the prior year quarter is primarily attributed to acquisition operating income of $26 million, a $4 million favorable improvement in price cost spread, and a $4 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense.\nHealth, Hygiene, and Specialties December Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $ 577 $ 570 $ 7 1 % Operating income 37 59 (22 ) (37)\n%\nHealth, Hygiene, and Specialties’ net sales increased by $7 million from the prior year quarter primarily attributed to a $16 million favorable impact from currency translation, partially offset by a 1% base volume decline.\nThe operating income decrease of $22 million from the prior year quarter is primarily attributed to a $17 million negative impact from under recovery of cost of goods sold related to inflation and market pressure in South America, a $6 million increase in business integration and restructuring costs, and a slight increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nConsumer Packaging December Quarter (in millions of dollars) Current Prior $ Change\n% Change Net sales $ 551 $ 549 $ 2 - % Operating income 38 34 4 12 % Consumer Packaging’s net sales increased by $2 million from the prior year quarter primarily attributed to an $8 million impact from selling price increases due to the pass through of higher resin prices, partially offset by a 1% base volume decline.\nThe operating income increase of $4 million from the prior year quarter is primarily attributed to a $5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and a $5 million decrease in selling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by a $5 million unfavorable impact from under recovery of higher cost of goods sold.\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\nOur cash flow from operating activities was $153 million and $985 million for the quarter and last four quarters ended December 2017, respectively. The Company’s adjusted free cash flow for the quarter and last four quarters ended December 2017 was $25 million and $606 million, respectively. Our total debt less cash and cash equivalents at the end of the December 2017 quarter was $5,308 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the four quarters ended December 30, 2017 was $1,390 million.\nRecent Development\nOn February 6, 2018, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of the Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. (“Clopay”), a subsidiary of Griffon Corporation for a purchase price of $475 million, which is preliminary, unaudited and subject to adjustment. Clopay manufactures printed breathable films and is an innovator in the development of elastic films and laminates with product offerings uniquely designed for applications used in a number of markets including: hygiene, healthcare, construction and industrial protective apparel. Clopay will be operated within the Health, Hygiene and Specialties segment. The Company expects to realize annual cost synergies of approximately $20 million from the completion of the Clopay transaction. To finance the purchase, the Company used the proceeds from our new $500 million 4.5% second priority senior secured notes issued in January 2018.\nOutlook\nGiven the completion of our Clopay acquisition and recent tax reform, we have increased our fiscal year 2018 cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow to $1,007 million and $630 million, respectively. Additionally, our fiscal 2018 capital spending and cash interest costs are forecasted to be $340 million and $250 million, respectively. Within our adjusted free cash flow guidance, we are also assuming a working capital use of $40 million and cash taxes to be $160 million, including the $37 million payment made in the first fiscal quarter under the Company’s tax receivable agreement, along with other cash uses of $50 million related to items such as acquisition integration expenses and costs to achieve synergies.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, February 7, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its first fiscal 2018 quarter results.

(9) Includes $95 million of net adjustments for valuing and transition tax related to the recently passed tax reform legislation. (10) Supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities, in each case determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently by other companies, including other companies in our industry, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nWe define “adjusted free cash flow” as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment and payments under the tax receivable agreement. We believe adjusted free cash flow is useful to an investor in evaluating our liquidity because adjusted free cash flow and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in our industry to measure a company’s liquidity. We also believe adjusted cash flow is useful to an investor in evaluating our liquidity as it can assist in assessing a company’s ability to fund its growth through its generation of cash. We believe cash interest expense is useful to investors by providing information regarding interest expense without regard to non-cash interest expense recognition which may vary based on financing structure and accounting methods.\nAdjusted EBITDA is used by our lenders for debt covenant compliance purposes. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Operating EBITDA among other measures to evaluate management performance and in determining performance-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA and Operating EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, and other interested parties in our industry to measure a company’s performance. We also believe EBITDA and adjusted net income are useful to an investor in evaluating our performance without regard to revenue and expense recognition, which can vary depending upon accounting methods.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207005114/en/\nBerry Global Group, Inc.\nDustin Stilwell, +1 812-306-2964\nir@berryglobal.com\nSource: Berry Global Group, Inc.",
