GLOBAL TOP NEWS •U.S. Congress grapples with immigration, averting funding fight Legislation to help young \"Dreamer\" immigrants struggled to gain footing in the U.S. Congress on Monday, but there were no signs yet that failure to pass such a bill would trigger a rerun of January's three-day partial government shutdown. •Broadcom unveils $121 billion 'best and final' offer for Qualcomm Broadcom made a $121 billion \"best and final offer\" on Monday to acquire Qualcomm Inc ratcheting up pressure on its U.S. semiconductor peer to engage in talks on what would be the biggest ever technology acquisition. •Bayer offers to sell businesses to win EU approval for Monsanto deal Bayer has offered to sell seeds and pesticides businesses to try to address EU competition concerns over its $63.5 billion bid for U.S. rival Monsanto. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) •The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,335.50, trading down 3.31 percent from its previous close. •The Indian rupee will likely fall against the dollar in early trade, in line with Asian peers, as demand for the greenback surged on poor risk appetite amid another global equity rout. •Indian sovereign bonds are likely to edge higher in early trade, tracking a fall in U.S. Treasury yields as well as easing crude oil prices. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.56 percent-7.62 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with both the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials indices slumping more than 4.0 percent, as the Dow notched its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly 1,600-point drop and Wall Street erased its gains for the year. • Asian shares fell sharply after Wall Street suffered its biggest decline since 2011 as investors' faith in factors underpinning a bull run in markets began to crumble. • The dollar stood tall as a rout in global equities prompted anxious investors to seek shelter in the relative safety of the greenback, with peers like the euro on the defensive. • U.S. Treasury yields fell from four-year highs on Monday after a rapid selloff in equity markets sparked demand for the low risk debt. • Oil prices fell by more than 1 percent, extending falls from the previous session, as global financial markets headed south in the wake of Wall Street's biggest one-day decline since 2011. • Gold prices held steady, buoyed by a tumble in global equity markets but pressured by expectations for more U.S. interest rate hikes this year.
