    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12, 2018 /PR Newswire/ -- Port Logistics Group , the nation's leading provider of omnichannel logistics services, today announced key executive changes. Jeff Wolpov, former President and Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of Port Logistics Group, has been named its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Greg Morello, former Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer at Port Logistics Group, has assumed the role of President and CCO at the company. Bob Stull, former CEO of Port Logistics Group, has assumed the role of Chairman of the company's Board of Directors. All three executives are seasoned logistics industry veterans.\nThe management changes ensure continuity of Port Logistics Group's corporate culture and customer reputation. Wolpov and Morello will lead the company as it embarks on a new growth strategy. Notably, the company is broadening its offerings that serve its established customer base of leading national retailers and manufacturers to attract direct-to-consumer customers as emerging \"e-tailer\" (online-only) brands.\nJeff Wolpov appointed CEO\nWolpov is the founder of Distribution Solutions, the platform on which Stull co-founded Port Logistics Group in 2008. \"Jeff Wolpov's company was our first acquisition. He has built and nurtured the customer relationships which allowed us to grow from a regional collection of acquired businesses to a gateway logistics provider with a presence in all major U.S. port cities,\" Stull said. \"Jeff is personally committed to our business and employees, and has been instrumental in delivering year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 15 percent. As CEO, he will lead Port Logistics Group in the changing retail market and accelerate our position in omnichannel fulfillment .\"\nWolpov said: \"We have the best people in the business, and a unique customer-centric mentality. Our commitment to the success of our customers and the personal growth of our associates will continue to differentiate Port Logistics Group in the marketplace and will be the cornerstone of our success as a team.\"\nGreg Morello named President and CCO\nMorello joined the company in 2010, overseeing branding, marketing and strategic growth, and will continue to oversee these areas. \"Greg launched Port Logistics Group as a national brand and recently led our strategic shift toward omnichannel services and ecommerce fulfillment technology. Greg will have responsibility for growth, customer relationship management, product development and our new ecommerce platform,\" Stull said.\nBob Stull moves to Board\nIn addition to leading the company's Board of Directors, Stull will advise the new leadership team. He was instrumental in building Port Logistics Group into a premier provider of omnichannel logistics with more than $200 million in annual revenues. Prior to founding Port Logistics Group, Stull led Roadway Express Inc. as President after starting in an entry-level position decades earlier.\nAbout Port Logistics Group\nPort Logistics Group is the nation's leading provider of omnichannel logistics services, including value-added warehousing and distribution, transloading and crossdocking, ecommerce fulfillment and national transportation.
