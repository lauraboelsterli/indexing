The local share price index futures fell 45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,956, a 60-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark finished the previous session down 0.7 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was down 0.13 percent, or 10.68 points, to 8,363.14 at 2110 GMT.
