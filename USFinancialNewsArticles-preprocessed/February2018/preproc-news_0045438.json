( Teekay Offshore or the Partnership ) (NYSE:TOO), today reported the Partnership’s results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 (2) 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Revenues 295,728 273,626 274,920 1,110,284 1,152,390 Income (loss) from vessel operations 51,026 (273,707 ) 56,544 (116,005 ) 230,853 Equity income 2,126 4,416 4,087 14,442 17,933 Net income (loss) 16,037 (320,276 ) 96,266 (299,442 ) 44,475 Net income (loss) attributable to the partners and preferred unitholders 15,399 (317,491 ) 91,953 (303,206 ) 32,617 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Total cash flow from vessel operations ( CFVO ) (1) 144,903 124,181 134,839 544,972 584,322 Distributable cash flow ( DCF ) (1) 34,449 13,382 21,627 105,706 161,329 Adjusted net income attributable to the partners and preferred unitholders (1) 11,329 3,064 8,487 39,977 86,007 These are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to “Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the Appendices to this release for definitions of these terms and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures as used in this release to the most directly comparable financial measures under United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). Please refer to Appendices in the third quarter of 2017 release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP.\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, was impacted by pre-operational costs related to the transit of the shuttle tanker newbuildings, the Beothuk Spirit and Norse Spirit , to the East Coast of Canada during the fourth quarter of 2017, and a decrease in unrealized gains on derivative instruments. GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, were positively impacted by the commencement of operations of the Randgrid FSO and Pioneiro de Libra FPSO in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by non-recurring repair and maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to two of the Partnership's redelivered shuttle tankers.\nCEO Commentary\n“During the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated higher cash flow from vessel operations driven mainly by the delivery and contract start-up of two of our growth projects combined with lower G&A expenses,\" commented Ingvild Sæther, President and CEO of Teekay Offshore Group Ltd.\n“Recently, we finalized an agreement and are nearing completion of a second agreement in our FPSO segment which will extend the contract durations with existing customers on existing fields. We are pleased to report that we have entered into an agreement with Petrobras to extend the employment on the Ostras FPSO from January 2018 to May 2018, plus an extension option, and we are nearing completion of the previously-announced contract extension with Premier Oil for the Voyageur Spirit FPSO out to at least April 2019,” commented Ms. Sæther. \"In addition, ALP Maritime, our towage subsidiary, was recently awarded its largest contract to-date, which requires the use of five of its vessels.\"\n“Looking ahead, we expect our cash flows to continue to grow as we pivot from project execution to harvesting cash flows from our projects, which will also further strengthen our balance sheet as we naturally delever over time,” Ms. Sæther commented. “Over the past five months, the Randgrid FSO, Pioneiro de Libra FPSO and two East Coast Canada shuttle tanker newbuildings commenced their respective charter contracts and we completed the upgrades on our most challenging project, the Petrojarl I FPSO, which arrived at its Brazilian oil field in early January 2018. This FPSO is now undergoing field installation and testing activities and it is expected to commence its charter contract in April 2018. In aggregate, we expect these projects, along with our third East Coast Canada shuttle tanker, which is scheduled to commence its contract in May of this year, to generate approximately $200 million of annual cash flow from vessel operations on an annualized basis with a weighted average contract length of approximately 10 years.”\n\"2017 represented a challenging but ultimately transformative year for Teekay Offshore,\" continued Ms. Sæther. “We successfully closed our strategic partnership with Brookfield, which enhanced our financial position while positioning us to better service our customers and take advantage of future growth opportunities as the global energy markets recover.\"\nSummary of Recent Events\nGrowth Projects Update\nIn October 2017, the Randgrid FSO, which was converted from one of the Partnership’s shuttle tankers at Sembcorp’s Sembawang shipyard in Singapore, commenced its three-year charter contract with Statoil ASA ( Statoil ) on the Gina Krog oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. This contract has 12 additional one-year options to extend.\nIn late-November 2017, the 50%-owned Pioneiro de Libra FPSO, which was converted from one of the Partnership’s shuttle tankers at Sembcorp’s Jurong shipyard in Singapore, commenced its 12-year charter contract with a consortium of international oil companies, including Petrobras, Total S.A., Shell, China National Petroleum Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, on the giant Libra block in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil. This joint venture is equity accounted by the Partnership and contributed only one month of cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn late 2017, the Partnership took delivery of the first two East Coast of Canada shuttle tanker newbuildings, the Beothuk Spirit and the Norse Spirit, with the third vessel, the Dorset Spirit , scheduled to deliver in early-March 2018. The first two newbuildings commenced long-term charter contracts in December 2017 and January 2018 with a group of companies that includes Canada Hibernia Holding Corporation, Chevron Canada, Exxon Mobil, Husky Energy, Mosbacher Operating Ltd., Murphy Oil, Nalcor Energy, Statoil and Suncor Energy, with the third newbuilding scheduled to commence its long-term charter contract in May 2018. The Beothuk Spirit and Norse Spirit replaced existing in-chartered vessels servicing the East Coast of Canada, the first of which the Partnership redelivered to its owner while the second the Partnership repositioned to the North Sea to operate in the Partnership's contract of affreightment ( CoA ) portfolio.\nIn December 2017, the Partnership completed the upgrades of the Petrojarl I FPSO unit which arrived on the Atlanta field in Brazil in January 2018. The unit is now undergoing field installation and testing prior to commencing its five-year charter contract with Queiroz Galvão Exploração e Produção SA ( QGEP ), which is expected to occur in April 2018.\nIn October 2017 and February 2018, the Partnership took delivery of the last two of four state-of-the-art SX-157 Ulstein Design ultra-long distance towing and offshore installation newbuildings, the ALP Sweeper and ALP Keeper , constructed by Niigata Shipbuilding & Repair in Japan.\nRecontracting of FPSO Units\nIn January 2018, the Partnership entered into a contract extension with Petrobras to extend the employment of the Ostras FPSO for four months at a slightly lower fixed rate. Petrobras also has an option to extend the contract for an additional two months to July 2018.\nThe Partnership is nearing completion of the previously-announced contract extension with Premier Oil to extend the employment of the Voyageur Spirit FPSO unit on the Huntington field out to at least April 2019. The new contract, which will take effect in April 2018, will include a fixed charter rate component plus a component based on oil production and oil price.\nNew Growth Projects\nIn November 2017, the Partnership declared options with Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., to construct two additional Suezmax DP2 shuttle tanker newbuildings, for an aggregate fully built-up cost of approximately $265 million. These newbuildings will be constructed based on Teekay Offshore's New Shuttle Spirit design. Upon delivery in 2020, these vessels will join the Partnership’s CoA portfolio in the North Sea.\nALP Contract Award\nIn February 2018, ALP Maritime, the Partnership’s towage subsidiary, was awarded a contract to provide five vessels to perform mobilization and field installation services in spring 2018. The contract is expected to require approximately 330 vessel equivalent days to service the project.\nOperating Results\nThe following table highlights certain financial information for Teekay Offshore’s six segments: the FPSO segment, the shuttle tanker segment, the FSO segment, the UMS segment, the towage segment and the conventional tanker segment (please refer to the “Teekay Offshore’s Fleet” section of this release below and Appendices C through E for further details).\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) FPSO\nSegment Shuttle\nTanker\nSegment FSO\nSegment UMS\nSegment Towage\nSegment Conventional\nTanker\nSegment Eliminations (ii) Total GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Revenues 118,675 132,106 34,409 321 12,212 3,540 (5,535 ) 295,728 Income (loss) from vessel operations 39,304 13,582 12,119 (7,822 ) (5,114 ) (774 ) (269 ) 51,026 Equity income 2,126 — — — — — — 2,126 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON CFVO from (used for) consolidated vessels (i) 69,391 47,869 24,698 (6,163 ) (743 ) (774 ) — 134,278 CFVO from equity accounted vessels (i) 10,625 — — — — — — 10,625 Total CFVO (i) 80,016 47,869 24,698 (6,163 ) (743 ) (774 ) — 144,903 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 (in thousands of U.S. Dollars) (unaudited) FPSO\nSegment Shuttle\nTanker\nSegment FSO\nSegment UMS\nSegment Towage\nSegment Conventional\nTanker\nSegment Eliminations Total GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON Revenues 116,429 129,092 12,037 3,821 9,794 3,747 — 274,920 Income (loss) from vessel operations 33,310 32,677 1,576 (6,443 ) (3,863 ) (713 ) — 56,544 Equity income 4,087 — — — — — — 4,087 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL COMPARISON CFVO from (used for) consolidated vessels (i) 65,925 60,038 6,787 (4,820 ) (435 ) (713 ) — 126,782 CFVO from equity accounted vessels (i) 8,057 — — — — — — 8,057 Total CFVO (i) 73,982 60,038 6,787 (4,820 ) (435 ) (713 ) — 134,839 These are non-GAAP financial measures.

Includes revenues and expenses earned and incurred between segments of Teekay Offshore, during the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nFPSO Segment\nIncome from vessel operations and cash flow from vessel operations increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher operational bonuses earned in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, the commencement of operations of the Pioneiro de Libra FPSO in late-November 2017 and restructuring charges relating to the reorganization within the Partnership’s FPSO segment during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nShuttle Tanker Segment\nIncome from vessel operations and cash flow from vessel operations decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the redelivery of the Nordic Brasilia and Nordic Rio in August 2017 and October 2017, respectively, and approximately $6 million of non-recurring repairs and maintenance expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 to prepare these vessels for trade in the conventional tanker market, and pre-operational costs related to the transit of the Beothuk Spirit and Norse Spirit to the East Coast of Canada during the fourth quarter of 2017, which vessels commenced their respective charter contracts in December 2017 and January 2018, partially offset by higher charter renewal rates for the Petronordic and Petroatlantic from April 2017, higher average CoA rates, a decrease in crew costs due to changes in crew composition and fewer in-chartered vessel days during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFSO Segment\nIncome from vessel operations and cash flow from vessel operations increased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the Randgrid FSO commencing its charter contract in October 2017.\nUMS Segment\nIncome from vessel operations and cash flow from vessel operations decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the non-payment of charter hire since November 2016 and the subsequent termination by Petrobras of the charter contract for the Arendal Spirit UMS in April 2017, and non-recurring expenses related to the transit of the Arendal Spirit UMS to its lay-up location during the fourth quarter of 2017, including $3.5 million of internal towage costs which are eliminated in the Partnership's consolidated results.\nTowage Segment\nIncome from vessel operations decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same quarter of the prior year, reflecting the challenging towage markets.\nTeekay Offshore’s Fleet\nThe following table summarizes Teekay Offshore’s fleet as of February 1, 2018.\nNumber of Vessels Owned Vessels Chartered-in Vessels Committed Newbuildings /\nConversions / Upgrade Total FPSO Segment 7 (i) — 1 (ii) 8 Shuttle Tanker Segment 29 (iii) 2 5 (iv) 36 FSO Segment 6 — — 6 UMS Segment 1 — — 1 Towage Segment 9 — 1 (v) 10 Conventional Segment — 2 — 2 Total 52 4 7 63 Includes two FPSO units, the Cidade de Itajai and Pioneiro de Libra , in which Teekay Offshore’s ownership interest is 50 percent. Consists of the Petrojarl I FPSO upgrade project, which upgrade was completed in December 2017 and which FPSO is scheduled to commence operations in April 2018. Includes six shuttle tankers in which Teekay Offshore’s ownership interest is 50 percent and one HiLoad DP unit. Includes one Suezmax-size DP2 shuttle tanker newbuilding scheduled to commence employment under the East Coast of Canada charter contracts in May 2018 and four Suezmax-size DP2 shuttle tanker newbuildings scheduled for delivery in late-2019 through 2020, two of which will operate under Teekay Offshore's master agreement with Statoil and two of which will join Teekay Offshore's CoA portfolio in the North Sea. Consists of one long-distance towing and offshore installation vessel newbuilding, ALP Keeper , delivered in February 2018.\nLiquidity Update\nIn October 2017, as part of the previously announced transaction with Brookfield Business Partners L.P. and its affiliates, the Partnership exercised the call option to repurchase the remaining outstanding balances under each of the Partnership’s Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) 420 million senior unsecured bond agreement and the Partnership’s NOK 800 million senior unsecured bond agreement. These repurchases were settled in November 2017 in accordance with their respective terms.\nIn January 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of $120 million of its 8.875% Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units ( Series E Preferred Units ), including $5 million Series E Preferred Units sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option, raising total net proceeds of approximately $116 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had total liquidity of $221.9 million, excluding $24.3 million included in restricted cash relating to amounts deposited in escrow to pre-fund a portion of the remaining Petrojarl I FPSO upgrade project costs. Giving pro-forma effect to the issuance of the Series E Preferred Units completed in January 2018, the Partnership's total liquidity as at December 31, 2017 would have been approximately $338 million.\nConference Call\nThe Partnership plans to host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 12:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2017.

These non-GAAP financial measures, which include Cash Flow from Vessel Operations, Adjusted Net Income, and Distributable Cash Flow are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Partnership believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Partnership’s financial performance, as does management.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCash Flow From (Used For) Vessel Operations ( CFVO ) represents income (loss) from vessel operations before depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of in-process revenue contracts, vessel write-downs, gains or losses on the sale of vessels, write-off of deferred revenues and operating expenses and adjustments for direct financing leases to a cash basis, but includes realized gains or losses on the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts. CFVO from Consolidated Vessels represents CFVO from vessels that are consolidated on the Partnership’s financial statements. CFVO from Equity-Accounted Vessels represents the Partnership’s proportionate share of CFVO from its equity-accounted vessels. The Partnership does not control its equity-accounted vessels and as a result, the Partnership does not have the unilateral ability to determine whether the cash generated by its equity-accounted vessels is retained within the entities in which the Partnership holds the equity-accounted investments or distributed to the Partnership and other owners. In addition, the Partnership does not control the timing of such distributions to the Partnership and other owners. Consequently, readers are cautioned when using total CFVO as a liquidity measure as the amount contributed from CFVO from Equity-Accounted Vessels may not be available to the Partnership in the periods such CFVO is generated by its equity-accounted vessels. CFVO is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors and management to measure the operational financial performance of companies. Please refer to Appendices D and E of this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to income (loss) from vessel operations and income from vessel operations of equity-accounted vessels, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nAdjusted Net Income excludes items of income or loss from GAAP net income (loss) that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of the Partnership’s financial results. The Partnership believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Partnership’s financial performance, as does management. Please refer to Appendix A of this release for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure reflected in the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements.\nDistributable Cash Flow ( DCF ) represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, deferred income tax expense or recovery, vessel write-downs, gains or losses on the sale of vessels, vessel and business acquisition costs, distributions relating to equity financing of newbuilding installments and conversion costs, pre-operational expenses, distributions on the Partnership's preferred units, gains on extinguishment of contingent liabilities and losses on non-cash accruals of contingent liabilities, amortization of the non-cash portion of revenue contracts, estimated maintenance capital expenditures, unrealized gains and losses from non-designated derivative instruments, ineffectiveness for derivative instruments designated as hedges for accounting purposes, adjustments for direct financing leases to a cash basis and foreign exchange related items, including the Partnership's proportionate share of such items in equity-accounted for investments and non-controlling interests proportionate share of such interests. Maintenance capital expenditures represent those capital expenditures required to maintain over the long-term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, the Partnership's capital assets. DCF is a quantitative standard used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community and by management to assist in evaluating financial performance.

As a result, the Partnership incurred a $43.7 million write-down related to these two UMS newbuildings during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(2) Realized (loss) gain on derivative instruments relates to amounts the Partnership actually paid to settle derivative instruments, and the unrealized (loss) gain on derivative instruments relates to the change in fair value of such derivative instruments. During the three months ended September 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017, as part of the Brookfield Transaction, the Partnership amended certain interest rate swaps to lower the fixed rate interest rate on the swaps and recorded $38.0 million of related rate reset and transaction fees, which are included in the realized loss relating to interest rate swaps in the table below.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Realized (loss) gain relating to: Interest rate swaps (8,360 ) (48,974 ) (11,830 ) (78,296 ) (52,819 ) Foreign currency forward contracts 260 1,048 (769 ) 900 (7,153 ) (8,100 ) (47,926 ) (12,599 ) (77,396 ) (59,972 ) Unrealized gain (loss) relating to: Interest rate swaps 14,017 28,465 97,782 33,114 29,937 Foreign currency forward contracts (1,209 ) 229 (3,216 ) 1,429 9,722 12,808 28,694 94,566 34,543 39,659 Total realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments 4,708 (19,232 ) 81,967 (42,853 ) (20,313 ) (3) The Partnership entered into cross currency swaps to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure on the payment of interest and repayment of principal amounts of the Partnership’s Norwegian Kroner ( NOK ) bonds. In addition, the cross currency swaps economically hedge the interest rate exposure on the NOK bonds. The Partnership has not designated, for accounting purposes, these cross currency swaps as cash flow hedges of its NOK bonds and, thus, foreign currency exchange (loss) gain includes a realized loss relating to the amounts the Partnership paid to settle its non-designated cross currency swaps and an unrealized gain (loss) relating to the change in fair value of such swaps, partially offset by an unrealized (loss) gain on the revaluation of the NOK bonds, as detailed in the table below. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded realized losses of $33.3 million and $73.5 million, respectively, relating to the termination of certain cross currency swaps, which were offset by unrealized gains of $33.3 million and $73.5 million, respectively, which are included in the table below. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership recorded a $67.7 million realized foreign exchange gain on the settlement of certain NOK bonds which is not included in the table below. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Partnership's realized loss on cross currency swaps includes a $32.6 million loss on the maturity of the swap associated with the NOK 500 million bond which settled in January 2016, which was offset by a $32.6 million realized foreign currency exchange gain on the settlement of the bond which is not included in the table below.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Realized loss on cross currency swaps (34,704 ) (42,987 ) (12,221 ) (84,205 ) (53,497 ) Unrealized gain (loss) on cross currency swaps 24,936 54,488 (12,148 ) 91,914 46,127 Unrealized (loss) gain on revaluation of NOK bonds (57,937 ) (12,823 ) 21,910 (79,818 ) (39,897 ) (4) In September and October 2017, the Partnership settled certain claims from CeFront Technology AS and Sevan Marine ASA , respectively, and reversed related contingent liabilities recorded in June 2016 arising from the cancellations of two UMS newbuildings. As a result, a net gain of $15.0 million was reported in Other (expense) income - net for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring 2016, the Partnership accrued for potential damages resulting from the cancellations of the UMS newbuildings and reversed other contingent liabilities previously recorded that were subject to the delivery of the UMS newbuildings. This net loss provision of $23.4 million was reported in Other (expense) income - net for the year ended December 31, 2016. The UMS newbuilding contracts were held in separate subsidiaries of the Partnership and obligations of these subsidiaries were non-recourse to the Partnership.\nTeekay Offshore Partners L.P.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nAs at As at As at December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) ASSETS Current Cash and cash equivalents 221,934 416,346 227,378 Restricted cash -

Each item affecting net income (loss) is analyzed to determine whether any of the amounts originated from a consolidated non-wholly-owned subsidiary. Each amount that originates from a consolidated non-wholly-owned subsidiary is multiplied by the non-controlling interests’ percentage share in this subsidiary to arrive at the non-controlling interests’ share of the amount.

The following factors are among those that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, and that should be considered in evaluating any such statement: changes in exploration, production and storage of offshore oil and gas, either generally or in particular regions that would impact expected future growth, particularly in or related to North Sea, Brazil and East Coast of Canada offshore fields; significant changes in oil prices; variations in expected levels of field maintenance; increased operating expenses; potential early termination of contracts; shipyard delivery delays and cost overruns; delays in the commencement of charter contracts; the inability to negotiate final documentation related to the Voyageur Spirit FPSO heads of terms; the inability of charterers to make future charter payments; the inability of the Partnership to renew or replace long-term contracts on existing vessels; the ability to fund the Partnership’s remaining capital commitments and debt maturities; vessel demand under the new towage contract; and other factors discussed in Teekay Offshore’s filings from time to time with the SEC, including its Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The Partnership expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Partnership’s expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nSource:Teekay Offshore Partners L.P.",
