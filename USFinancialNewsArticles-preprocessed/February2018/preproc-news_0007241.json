Unsecured Installment loan revenues rose 45.1% and Secured Installment revenues rose 31.4% on related origination volume and loan growth. Single-Pay revenues were affected primarily by regulatory changes in Canada (rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia and product changes in Alberta). U.S. and U.K. Single-Pay revenues also decreased 8.7% and 2.1%, respectively, because of continued mix shift from Single-Pay to Installment and Open-End products. Ancillary revenues increased 18.1% versus the same quarter a year ago primarily due to insurance revenue in Canada, partially offset by a decline in check cashing fees.\nFull Year 2017\nThe following table summarizes revenue by product, including CSO fees, for the periods indicated.\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands) U.S. Canada U.K. Total U.S. Canada U.K. Total Unsecured Installment $ 435,745 $ 19,013 $ 25,485 $ 480,243 $ 318,460 $ 1,143 $ 11,110 $ 330,713 Secured Installment 100,981 — — 100,981 81,453 — — 81,453 Open-End 73,308 188 — 73,496 66,945 — 3 66,948 Single-Pay 107,553 147,617 13,624 268,794 117,609 173,779 21,888 313,276 Ancillary 20,142 19,591 386 40,119 22,332 13,155 719 36,206 Total revenue $ 737,729 $ 186,409 $ 39,495 $ 963,633 $ 606,799 $ 188,077 $ 33,720 $ 828,596 For full year 2017, total lending revenue (excluding revenues from ancillary products) grew $131.1 million, or 16.5%, to $923.5 million, compared to the prior year period. Growth was driven predominantly by Unsecured and Secured Installment loan revenue. Unsecured Installment loan revenues rose 45.2% on related origination increase of 46.4%. Secured Installment revenues increased 24.0%, on related origination increase of 33.2%. Single-Pay revenues were affected primarily by regulatory changes in Canada (rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia and product changes in Alberta). U.S. and U.K. Single-Pay revenues also decreased 8.6% and 37.8%, respectively, because of continued mix shift from Single-Pay to Installment and Open-End products. Ancillary revenues increased 10.8% versus the same period a year ago primarily due to insurance revenue in Canada, partially offset by a decrease in check cashing fees.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue generated through the online channel was 38% and 33%, respectively, of consolidated revenue.\nLoan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis\nThe following table summarizes Company-owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP balance sheet measure, and reconciles it to gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure including loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements but from which we earn revenue and for which we provide a guarantee to the lender:\nThree Months Ended (in millions) December 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nSeptember 30,\n2016\nJune 30,\n2016\nMarch 31,\n2016\nCompany-owned gross loans receivable $ 432.8 $ 393.4 $ 350.3 $ 304.8 $ 286.2 $ 244.6 $ 233.1 $ 220.7 Gross loans receivable guaranteed by the Company 78.8 71.2 62.1 57.8 68.0 58.7 52.6 45.4 Gross combined loans receivable $ 511.6 $ 464.6 $ 412.4 $ 362.6 $ 354.2 $ 303.3 $ 285.7 $ 266.1 Gross combined loans receivable were $511.6 million and $354.2 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was a result of Installment loan growth from higher originations and the Q1 Loss Recognition Change that is further detailed in the Prospectus filed with the S.E.C. pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on December 8, 2017. For 2017, Installment loans that are up to 90 days past due are included in gross combined loans receivable. Excluding the year-over-year effect of such past-due loans, gross combined loans receivable increased $83.4 million or 23.5% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nUnsecured Installment Loans\nUnsecured Installment revenue and gross combined loans receivable increased from the prior year quarter due to growth in the United States, primarily in Texas and California; growth in Canada, primarily in Alberta; and growth in the United Kingdom. Gross combined Unsecured Installment Loan balances (excluding past due loans) grew $49.6 million, or 30.1%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nLoss provision rates as a percentage of originations (or loss provision rates) for Company Owned loans increased sequentially from 21.1% to 22.1%, reflecting normal seasonal trends and allowance coverage evaluation. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rate was consistent with the prior year provision rate of 22.0%. The effect of the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017 was offset by improved underwriting and credit scoring, and seasoning.\nLoss provision rates for loans Guaranteed by the Company decreased sequentially from 43.3% to 40.0%. This is primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey relief during the third quarter of 2017 on Texas operations. Fourth quarter 2017 provision rates increased compared to the prior year quarter of 31.1%, primarily due to the Q1 Loss Recognition Change, which caused higher provision rates in 2017, as well as loan performance.\nUnsecured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Unsecured Installment CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company both declined from the end of the third quarter of 2017. This was a result of realization of the impacts of Hurricane Harvey, seasonal patterns in net charge-offs and evaluation of year-end allowance coverage based on underlying vintage performance. Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable and Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans Guaranteed by the Company remained consistent quarter over quarter.\n2017 2016 (dollars in thousands, except average loan amount, unaudited)\nFourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter Fourth Quarter Unsecured Installment loans: Revenue - Company Owned $ 67,800 $ 61,653 $ 52,550 $ 51,206 $ 39,080 Provision for losses - Company Owned 29,917 29,079 17,845 19,309 24,557 Net revenue - Company Owned $ 37,883 $ 32,574 $ 34,705 $ 31,897 $ 14,523 Net charge-offs - Company Owned $ 32,894 $ 23,858 $ 18,858 $ (4,918 ) $ 18,836 Revenue - Guaranteed by the Company $ 69,078 $ 67,132 $ 52,599 $ 58,225 $ 55,234 Provision for losses - Guaranteed by the Company 32,915 36,212 23,575 19,940 22,364 Net revenue - Guaranteed by the Company $ 36,163 $ 30,920 $ 29,024 $ 38,285 $ 32,870 Net charge-offs - Guaranteed by the Company $ 31,898 $ 34,904 $ 27,309 $ 17,088 $ 21,144 Unsecured Installment gross combined loans receivable: Company owned $ 196,306 $ 181,831 $ 156,075 $ 131,386 $ 102,090 Guaranteed by the Company (1) (2) 75,156 67,438 58,289 53,978 62,360 Unsecured Installment gross combined loans receivable (1) (2)\n$ 271,462 $ 249,269 $ 214,364 $ 185,364 $ 164,450 Unsecured Installment Allowance for loan losses (3) $ 43,755 $ 46,938 $ 41,406 $ 42,040 $ 17,775 Unsecured Installment CSO guarantee liability (3) $ 17,072 $ 16,056 $ 14,748 $ 18,482 $ 15,630 Unsecured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable 22.3 % 25.8 % 26.5 % 32.0 % 17.4 % Unsecured Installment CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Unsecured Installment gross loans guaranteed by the Company 22.7 % 23.8 % 25.3 % 34.2 % 25.1 % Unsecured Installment past-due balances: Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable (4) $ 44,963 $ 41,353 $ 33,534 $ 28,913 — Unsecured Installment gross loans guaranteed by the Company (4) $ 12,480 $ 10,462 $ 8,204 $ 11,196 — Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans receivable -- percentage (2) (4) 22.9 % 22.7 % 21.5 % 22.0 % — Past-due Unsecured Installment gross loans guaranteed by the Company -- percentage (2) (4) 16.6 % 15.5 % 14.1 % 20.7 % — Unsecured Installment other information: Originations - Company owned (5) $ 135,284 $ 137,618 $ 119,636 $ 98,691 $ 111,412 Average loan amount - Company owned $ 714 $ 730 $ 697 $ 687 $ 646 Originations - Guaranteed by the Company (1) (5) $ 82,326 $ 83,680 $ 68,338 $ 55,112 $ 71,858 Average loan amount - Guaranteed by the Company $ 526 $ 526 $ 485 $ 482 $ 478 Unsecured Installment ratios: Provision as a percentage of originations - Company Owned 22.1 % 21.1 % 14.9 % 19.6 % 22.0 % Provision as a percentage of gross loans receivable - Company Owned 15.2 % 16.0 % 11.4 % 14.7 % 24.1 % Provision as a percentage of originations - Guaranteed by the Company 40.0 % 43.3 % 34.5 % 36.2 % 31.1 % Provision as a percentage of gross loans receivable - Guaranteed by the Company 43.8 % 53.7 % 40.4 % 36.9 % 35.9 % (1)\nIncludes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP measure.\n(3)\nAllowance for loan losses is reported as a contra-asset reducing gross loans receivable while the CSO guarantee liability is reported as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(4)\nAs part of the Q1 Loan Loss Recognition Change past-due receivables remain on the balance sheet until charged off.

Secured Installment Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Secured Installment gross loans receivable settled at a more normalized range in the fourth quarter and improved slightly over the same quarter a year ago on underlying vintage performance. The Past-due Secured Installment gross loans receivable rate was consistent sequentially with third quarter.\n2017 2016 (dollars in thousands, except average loan amount, unaudited) Fourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter Fourth Quarter Secured Installment loans: Revenue $ 27,732 $ 26,407 $ 23,173 $ 23,669 $ 21,107 Provision for losses 10,051 6,512 4,955 7,436 7,159 Net revenue $ 17,681 $ 19,895 $ 18,218 $ 16,233 $ 13,948 Net charge-offs $ 10,802 $ 11,597 $ 6,481 $ (2,235 ) $ 6,588 Secured Installment gross combined loan balances: Secured Installment gross combined loans receivable (1)(2) $ 92,817 $ 88,730 $ 80,077 $ 71,213 $ 67,738 Secured Installment Allowance for loan losses and CSO guarantee liability (3) $ 14,194 $ 14,945 $ 20,030 $ 21,557 $ 11,885 Secured Installment Allowance for loan losses and CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Secured Installment gross combined loans receivable 15.3 % 16.8 % 25.0 % 30.3 % 17.5 % Secured Installment past-due balances: Secured Installment past-due gross loans receivable and gross loans guaranteed by the Company (4) $ 16,554 $ 15,265 $ 12,630 $ 10,186 $ — Past-due Secured Installment gross loans receivable and gross loans guaranteed by the Company -- percentage (2)(4) 17.8 % 17.2 % 15.8 % 14.3 % — % Secured Installment other information: Originations (1)(5) $ 48,577 $ 52,526 $ 45,596 $ 37,641 $ 43,803 Average loan amount (1)(5) $ 1,303 $ 1,299 $ 1,231 $ 1,326 $ 1,197 Secured Installment ratios: Provision as a percentage of originations 20.7 % 12.4 % 10.9 % 19.8 % 16.3 % Provision as a percentage of gross combined loans receivable 10.8 % 7.3 % 6.2 % 10.4 % 10.6 % (1)\nIncludes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP measure.\n(3)\nAllowance for loan losses is reported as a contra-asset reducing gross loans receivable while the CSO guarantee liability is reported as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(4)\nAs part of the Q1 Loan Loss Recognition Change past-due receivables remain on the balance sheet until charged off.

The provision for losses and Open-End Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Open-end gross loans receivable decreased due to improved collection trends and portfolio performance for existing markets, seasoning of the Tennessee loan book and the effect on mix of converting LendDirect to Open-End - as with our experience with other products in Canada, the LendDirect Open-End portfolio is expected to perform better relative to U.S. products.\n2017 2016 (dollars in thousands, except average loan amount, unaudited) Fourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter Fourth Quarter Open-End loans: Revenue $ 21,154 $ 18,630 $ 15,805 $ 17,907 $ 17,085 Provision for losses 8,334 6,348 4,298 3,265 6,283 Net revenue $ 12,820 $ 12,282 $ 11,507 $ 14,642 $ 10,802 Net charge-offs $ 6,799 $ 5,991 $ 4,343 $ 3,876 $ 6,085 Open-End gross loans receivable $ 47,949 $ 32,133 $ 26,771 $ 25,626 $ 30,462 Allowance for loan losses $ 6,426 $ 4,880 $ 4,523 $ 4,572 $ 5,179 Open-End Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of Open-End gross loans receivable 13.4 % 15.2 % 16.9 % 17.8 % 17.0 % Open-End other information: Originations (1) $ 20,313 $ 9,388 $ 6,646 $ 5,463 $ 9,880 Average loan amount (1) $ 579 $ 463 $ 451 $ 454 $ 459 Open-End ratios: Provision as a percentage of originations 41.0 % 67.6 % 64.7 % 59.8 % 63.6 % Provision as a percentage of gross combined loans receivable 17.4 % 19.8 % 16.1 % 12.7 % 20.6 % (1)\nWe have revised previously-reported origination statistics to conform to current year methodology.\nSingle-Pay\nSingle-Pay revenue, provision and combined loans receivable during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were affected primarily by regulatory changes in Canada (rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia and product shift from Single-Pay to Installment in Alberta). Single-Pay revenue in the United States also declined compared to the prior year due to the continued shift toward Installment and Open-End products. The improvement in the provision for losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a lower proportion of Single-Pay loans in the U.K. where loan loss rates are higher than in the U.S. and Canada.\n2017 2016 (dollars in thousands, unaudited) Fourth Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter First Quarter Fourth Quarter Single-Pay loans: Revenue $ 70,868 $ 70,895 $ 63,241 $ 63,790 $ 77,617 Provision for losses 17,952 20,632 14,289 11,399 19,655 Net revenue $ 52,916 $ 50,263 $ 48,952 $ 52,391 $ 57,962 Net charge-offs $ 17,362 $ 20,515 $ 13,849 $ 12,499 $ 20,468 Single-Pay gross combined loans receivable (1) (2) $ 99,400 $ 94,476 $ 91,230 $ 80,423 $ 91,579 Single-Pay Allowance for loan losses and CSO guarantee liability (3) $ 5,915 $ 5,342 $ 5,313 $ 4,736 $ 5,775 Single-Pay Allowance for loan losses and CSO guarantee liability as a percentage of Single-Pay gross loans receivable 6.0 % 5.7 % 5.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % (1)\nIncludes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP measure.\n(3)\nAllowance for loan losses is reported as a contra-asset reducing gross loans receivable while the CSO guarantee liability is reported as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nResults of Operations - CURO Group Consolidated Operations\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change $ Change % 2017 2016 Change $ Change % Revenue $ 266,990 $ 218,904 $ 48,086 22.0 % $ 963,633 $ 828,596 $ 135,037 16.3 % Provision for losses 99,703 80,987 18,716 23.1 % 326,226 258,289 67,937 26.3 % Net revenue 167,287 137,917 29,370 21.3 % 637,407 570,307 67,100 11.8 % Advertising costs 16,459 14,996 1,463 9.8 % 52,058 43,921 8,137 18.5 % Non-advertising costs of providing services 58,664 59,724 (1,060 ) (1.8 )% 236,112 233,130 2,982 1.3 % Total cost of providing services 75,123 74,720 403 0.5 % 288,170 277,051 11,119 4.0 % Gross margin 92,164 63,197 28,967 45.8 % 349,237 293,256 55,981 19.1 % Operating (income) expense Corporate, district and other 51,176 29,270 21,906 74.8 % 154,973 124,274 30,699 24.7 % Interest expense 21,990 16,155 5,835 36.1 % 82,684 64,334 18,350 28.5 % Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt — 0 0 #\n12,458 (6,991 ) 19,449 #\nRestructuring costs — 651 (651 ) # 7,393 3,618 3,775 # Total operating expense 73,166 46,076 27,090 58.8 % 257,508 185,235 72,273 39.0 % Net income before income taxes 18,998 17,121 1,877 11.0 % 91,729 108,021 (16,292 ) (15.1 )% Provision for income taxes 12,588 7,536 5,052 67.0 % 42,576 42,577 (1 ) 0.0 % Net income 6,410 9,585 (3,175 ) (33.1 )% 49,153 65,444 (16,291 ) (24.9 )% # - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful.

For year ended December 31, 2016, the $7.0 million gain resulted from the Company’s purchase of CURO Intermediate’s 10.75% Senior Secured Notes in September 2016. (2) Restructuring costs of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented the elimination of certain corporate positions in the Canadian headquarters and the costs incurred related to the closure of seven underperforming stores in Texas. Restructuring costs of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 were due to the closure of the remaining 13 U.K. stores. (3) Legal settlements of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $2.3 million for the settlement of Harrison, et al v. Principal Investments, Inc. et al., and $2.0 million for our offer to reimburse certain bank overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees because of possible borrower confusion about certain electronic payments we initiated on their loans. See related discussion in the Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on December 8, 2017 for further information. (4)\nTransaction-related costs include professional fees paid in connection with potential transactions, expenses related to the Company's Initial Public Offering on December 7, 2017 and expenses related to issuance of $135.0 million of the Company's addition Senior Notes due 2022 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the original issuance of $470.0 million of these notes in the first quarter of 2017. (5)\nThe Company approved the adoption of a share-based compensation plan during 2010 for key members of its senior management team. The estimated fair value of share-based awards is recognized as non-cash compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, the underlying option holders were paid a bonus in conjunction with dividends paid during the respective quarters (“Special Bonuses”). The expense recognized during each quarter related to the payment of the Special Bonuses on vested options. All deferred and unvested Special Bonus amounts were accelerated upon the completion of the Company’s IPO in December 2017 so no further expense will be incurred in future periods relating to the Special Bonuses. (6)\nAs a result of the 2017 Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company revalued the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to reflect expected value at utilization, resulting in a $3.5 million net tax benefit. In addition, in accordance with this law, the Company recognized an $8.1 million tax expense related to the tax now assessed on un-repatriated earnings from the Company's operations in Canada. (7)\nOther adjustments include deferred rent and the intercompany foreign exchange impact. Deferred rent represents the non-cash component of rent expense. Rent expense is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue and Net Revenue\nRevenue increased $48.1 million, or 22.0%, to $267.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $218.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. U.S. revenue increased 25.7% on volume growth, U.K. revenue increased by 32.5%, and revenue in Canada increased 7.1% where volume growth overcame regulatory impacts on rates and product mix.\nProvision for losses increased $18.7 million, or 23.1%, to $99.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $81.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 because of related Unsecured Installment originations increase of 18.7% and Secured Installment originations increase of 10.9%. This is explained more fully in the segment analysis that follows.\nCost of Providing Services\nThe total cost of providing services increased $0.4 million, or 0.5%, to $75.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $74.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016 because of higher customer acquisition spend.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expense increased $21.9 million, or 74.8% primarily due to items described previously in the \"Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, non-GAAP measures\" as well as increases in payroll primarily from increased headcount in technology and analytics. Interest expense is higher because of increased debt outstanding.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 66.3% compared to 44.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, this quarter’s effective tax rate includes a net one-time charge of $4.6 million from adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognition of tax expense related to Canadian earnings that have not been repatriated. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 41.8%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue and Net Revenue\nRevenue increased $135.0 million, or 16.3% to $963.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $828.6 million for the prior year period. U.S. revenue increased $130.9 million on volume growth, the U.K. increased $5.8 million, and Canada declined $1.7 million because of regulatory impacts on rates and product mix.\nProvision for losses increased $67.9 million, or 26.3% to $326.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $258.3 million for the prior year because of higher origination volumes and higher loan balances.\nCost of Providing Services\nThe total cost of providing services increased $11.1 million, or 4.0%, to $288.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $277.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to 18.5% higher marketing spend as well as increases in occupancy, office and other operating expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expenses increased $30.7 million primarily due to debt extinguishment costs, share-based cash and non-cash compensation, IPO-related costs and legal settlement costs as described above in the reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income as well as increases in payroll, collections, office and technology-related costs.\nInterest expense in the current year period increased by approximately $18.4 million which was the result of accrued interest on the retired notes through the redemption notice period, and increased debt outstanding.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 46.4% compared to 39.4% for the prior year. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the full year effective tax rate includes a net one-time charge of $4.6 million from adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognition of tax expense related to Canadian earnings that have not been repatriated. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the effective tax rate for full-year 2017 was 41.3%.\nThe remaining change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to U.K. operations. In the 2017, U.K. results include $7.4 million of restructuring costs related to the closure of the remaining 13 U.K. stores. We recorded a 100% valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset and therefore did not recognize the related tax benefit.\nSegment Analysis\nWe report financial results for three reportable segments: the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

U.S. Segment Results - For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFourth quarter U.S. revenues grew by $42.1 million or 25.7% to $205.8 million.\nU.S. revenue growth was driven by a $49.4 million, or 18.0%, increase in gross combined loans receivable (excluding past due loans) to $323.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $274.2 million in the prior year period. We experienced strong volume growth in Unsecured Installment originations, which increased year-over-year $131.9 million, or 27.4%. Secured Installment originations grew $45.9 million, or 33.2%, compared to the same period a year ago.\nThe increase of $21.7 million, or 33.3%, in provision for losses was primarily driven by the increase in combined loans receivable above, but was also affected by the Q1 Loss Recognition Change as further described in the Prospectus filed with the S.E.C. pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on December 8, 2017. Core increases in origination volumes for installment loans increased provision year over year by approximately $10 million. The Q1 Loss Recognition Change requires higher provision rates to compensate for accrued interest on delinquent loans through charge off (the ‘rate effect’). The rate effect and performance of past due receivable at the time of the change in estimate increased provision by approximately $12 million.\nU.S. cost of providing services remained consistent with the same period in the prior year. The total cost of providing services for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $53.1 million, a slight decrease of $0.7 million, or 1.3% compared to $53.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAll other U.S. operating expenses were $64.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $25.1 million, compared to $39.4 million in the prior year period. Excluding the effects of the items discussed previously in \"Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, non-GAAP measures\" applicable to the U.S. as indicated in the Segment table above, Corporate, district and other operating expenses rose $6.4 million. This increase includes year-over-year incremental variable compensation expense of $2.6 million for 2017 performance versus the Company's Annual Operating Plan. Remaining operating expenses increased $3.6 million or 16.5% primarily due to increased technology and analytics headcount. Interest expense increased because of higher debt balances.\nU.S. Segment Results - For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nFull year U.S. revenues grew by $130.9 million, or 21.6% to $737.7 million. U.S. revenue growth was driven by a $49.4 million, or 18.0%, increase in gross combined loans receivable (excluding past due loans) to $323.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $274.2 million in the prior year period. We experienced strong volume growth in Unsecured Installment originations, which increased year-over-year $131.9 million, or 27.4%. Secured Installment originations grew $45.9 million, or 33.2%, compared to the same period a year ago.\nThe increase of $59.7 million, or 28.8%, in provision for losses was primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in gross combined loans receivable and related origination volumes as well as the Q1 Loss Recognition Change.\nU.S. cost of providing services for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $203.0 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 4.3% compared to $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was due primarily to $5.8 million (19.1%) higher marketing spend, as well as increases in volume-driven expenses and increases in store security and maintenance costs.\nAll other U.S. operating expenses were $215.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $68.2 million, or 46.2%, compared to $147.6 million in the prior year period. Excluding the effects of the items discussed previously in \"Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, non-GAAP measures\" applicable to the U.S. as indicated in the Segment table above, Corporate, district and other operating expenses rose $13.6 million, or 15.6%, primarily due to increased technology and analytics headcount.\nCanada Segment Results Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Change Change (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % Revenue $ 50,589 $ 47,226 $ 3,363 7.1 % $ 186,408 $ 188,078 $ (1,670 ) (0.9 )% Provision for losses 8,829 12,124 (3,295 ) (27.2 )% 45,075 39,917 5,158 12.9 % Net revenue 41,760 35,102 6,658 19.0 % 141,333 148,161 (6,828 ) (4.6 )% Advertising costs 3,471 2,375 1,096 46.1 % 10,415 8,695 1,720 19.8 % Non-advertising costs of providing services 16,250 15,038 1,212 8.1 % 62,968 60,827 2,141 3.5 % Total cost of providing services 19,721 17,413 2,308 13.3 % 73,383 69,522 3,861 5.6 % Gross margin 22,039 17,689 4,350 24.6 % 67,950 78,639 (10,689 ) (13.6 )% Corporate, district and other 4,545 3,481 1,064 30.6 % 16,952 17,174 (222 ) (1.3 )% Interest expense 59 12 47 # 201 85 116 # Restructuring and other costs — (35 ) 35 # — 898 (898 ) # Total operating expense 4,604 3,458 1,146 33.1 % 17,153 18,157 (1,004 ) (5.5 )% Segment operating income 17,435 14,231 3,204 22.5 % 50,797 60,482 (9,685 ) (16.0 )% Interest expense 59 12 47 # 201 85 116 # Depreciation and amortization 1,157 1,065 92 8.6 % 4,546 4,827 (281 ) (5.8 )% EBITDA 18,651 15,308 3,343 21.8 % 55,544 65,394 (9,850 ) (15.1 )% Restructuring and other costs — (35 ) 35 # — 898 (898 ) # Share-based cash and non-cash compensation 156 — 156 # 156 — 156 # Other adjustments (417 ) (14 ) (403 ) # (1,071 ) (373 ) (698 ) # Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,390 $ 15,259 $ 3,131 20.5 % $ 54,629 $ 65,919 $ (11,290 ) (17.1 )% # - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful. Canada Segment Results - For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue in Canada was affected by product transition in Alberta from Single-Pay loans to Unsecured Installment loans and the impact of regulatory rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia.\nNon-Alberta Single-Pay revenue increased $0.2 million, or 0.5% to $38.9 million for 2017 and was affected by lower rates from provincial regulatory changes effective January 1, 2017. The impact of the rate changes was offset by higher origination volumes resulting in a modest increase in related revenue. Single-Pay ending receivables (excluding Alberta) increased $9.1 million, or 20.9%, to $52.6 million from $43.5 million in the prior year period.\nBecause of regulatory changes in Alberta, we converted Single-Pay customers to Unsecured Installment loans during the first week of December 2016, resulting in $22.7 million of Unsecured Installment loans outstanding at the end of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, $43.7 million of Unsecured Installment and Open-End receivables were outstanding in Alberta.\nThe provision for losses decreased $3.3 million or 27.2% to $8.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to relative loan growth (December 2016 included provisioning on the conversion of $8.9 million of Single-Pay to $18.1 million of Unsecured Installment loan balances). In addition, Unsecured Installment provision rates and allowance coverage has normalized as the portfolio has seasoned and we have better insight into payment performance.\nThe cost of providing services in Canada increased $2.3 million, or 13.3%, to $19.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17.4 million in the prior year period. The increase was due primarily to $1.1 million, or 46.1% of higher marketing expense compared to the prior year period, as well as an increase in occupancy expense, based on a higher number of stores in operation during 2017.\nOperating expenses increased $1.1 million, or 33.1%, to $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $3.5 million in the prior year period, due to $0.4 million of incremental bonus expense for 2017 performance, $0.2 million of share-based compensation and elevated spend on third party collections.\nCanada Segment Results - For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue in Canada was affected by product transition in Alberta from Single-Pay loans to Unsecured Installment loans and the impact of regulatory rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia.\nNon-Alberta Single-Pay revenue decreased $1.1 million, or 0.8% to $146.2 million for 2017 and was affected by lower rates from provincial regulatory changes effective January 1, 2017. The impact of the rate changes was offset by higher origination volumes resulting in a modest decrease in related revenue. Single-Pay ending receivables (excluding Alberta) increased $9.1 million, or 20.9%, to $52.6 million from $43.5 million in the prior year period.\nBecause of regulatory changes in Alberta, we converted Single-Pay customers to Unsecured Installment loans during the first week of December 2016, resulting in $22.7 million of Unsecured Installment loans outstanding at the end of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, $43.7 million of Unsecured Installment and Open-End receivables were outstanding in Alberta.\nThe provision for losses rose $5.2 million or 12.9% to $45.1 million for full year 2017 compared to $39.9 million in the prior year period. As in the U.S., the increase was due to higher loan origination volume and the shift in Alberta from Single Pay to Unsecured Installment loans.\nThe cost of providing services in Canada increased $3.9 million, or 5.6%, to $73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $69.5 million in the prior year period due primarily to an increase in occupancy expense, based on a higher number of stores in operation during 2017 as compared to the prior year, as well as an increase in store maintenance costs and higher marketing spend.\nOperating expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 5.5%, to $17.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, from $18.2 million in the prior year period, due to the consolidation of certain back-office functions during the third quarter of 2016.\nU.K. Segment Results Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Change Change (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % Revenue $ 10,584 $ 7,987 $ 2,597 32.5 % $ 39,496 $ 33,720 $ 5,776 17.1 % Provision for losses 4,041 3,713 328 8.8 % 13,660\n10,624\n3,036\n28.6 % Net revenue 6,543 4,274 2,269 53.1 % 25,836 23,096 2,740 11.9 % Advertising costs 1,436 1,228 208 16.9 % 5,495 4,886 609 12.5 % Non-advertising costs of providing services 843 2,264 (1,421 ) (62.8 )% 6,269 7,921 (1,652 ) (20.9 )% Total cost of providing services 2,279 3,492 (1,213 ) (34.7 )% 11,764 12,807 (1,043 ) (8.1 )% Gross margin 4,264 782 3,482 # 14,072 10,289 3,783 36.8 % Corporate, district and other 4,127 2,782 1,345 48.3 % 17,218 18,561 (1,343 ) (7.2 )% Interest income (1 ) (6 ) (5 ) (83.3 )% (12 ) (27 ) (15 ) (55.6 )% Restructuring and other costs — 488 (488 ) # 7,393 994 6,399 # Total operating expense 4,126 3,264 862 26.4 % 24,599 19,528 5,071 26.0 % Segment operating income (expense) 138 (2,482 ) 2,620 # (10,527 ) (9,239 ) (1,288 ) 13.9 % Interest income (1 ) (6 ) (5 ) (83.3 )% (12 ) (27 ) (15 ) (55.6 )% Depreciation and amortization 117 201 (84 ) (41.8 )% 648 882 (234 ) (26.5 )% EBITDA 254 (2,287 ) 2,541 # (9,891 ) (8,384 ) (1,507 ) (18.0 )% Other adjustments (7 ) 15 (22 ) # (35 ) 242 (277 ) # Restructuring and other costs — 488 (488 ) # 7,393 994 6,399 # Adjusted EBITDA $ 247 $ (1,784 ) $ 2,031 # $ (2,533 ) $ (7,148 ) $ 4,615 64.6 % # - Variance greater than 100% or not meaningful U.K. Segment Results - For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nU.K. revenue improved $2.6 million, or 32.5% to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $8.0 million in the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up $1.9 million, or 24.0%. Provision for losses increased $0.3 million, or 8.8%, and increased $0.5 million, or 15.8% on a constant currency basis, due to growth in Installment Loan receivables.\nThe cost of providing services in the U.K. decreased $1.2 million, or 34.7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to prior year period. The decrease is primarily because the 13 remaining stores in the U.K. were closed in the third quarter of 2017. On a constant currency basis the cost of providing services decreased $1.4 million, or 38.9%.\nCorporate, district and other expenses of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 are consistent with quarterly run rates for the full year 2017 and represent normal baseline costs for the U.K.\nU.K. Segment Results - For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nU.K. revenue improved $5.8 million, or 17.1% to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $33.7 million in the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up $7.8 million, or 23.0%. Provision for losses increased $3.0 million, or 28.6%, and increased $3.7 million, or 34.5% on a constant currency basis, due to growth in Installment Loan receivables.\nThe cost of providing services in the U.K. decreased slightly from the prior year period because of third quarter 2017 store closures. On a constant currency basis the cost of providing services decreased $0.4 million, or 3.1%.\nOperating expenses increased $5.1 million, or 26.0%, from the prior year period, and on a constant currency basis increased $6.3 million, or 32.4%, due to restructuring costs from closure of the 13 remaining stores during the third quarter of 2017. Excluding the store closure costs, operating expenses decreased $1.3 million (7.2%) because of reduced headquarters and contact center headcount and lower professional fees.\nCURO GROUP HOLDINGS CORP.

On February 15, 2017, CURO Financial Technologies Corp. (\"CFTC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $470.0 million of 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022. The proceeds, along with $122.5 million of company cash, were used to redeem the $539.9 million outstanding of Former Senior Secured Notes (including accrued interest, original-issue discount, prepayment premium and transaction costs). The decrease in cash from this refinancing was offset partially by cash generated by operations during 2017 and net proceeds after transaction costs of $81.1 million from the Company’s initial public offering of 6,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $14.00 per share. On November 2, 2017, CFTC issued $135.0 million of additional 12.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2022. The proceeds of the notes offering and related issuance premium were used to pay a $140.0 million cash dividend to the Company and, ultimately, the Company's stockholders.\nGross Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses - The Company originated $780.7 million and $184.3 million of Unsecured and Secured Installment Loans, respectively, during 2017 as compared to $533.4 million and $138.4 million in the prior year. As explained in the Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis section above, changes in Gross Loans Receivable and related Allowance for Loan Losses were due to high customer demand and loan origination volumes during 2017 that were concentrated in Installment Loans.\nOther Assets - Other assets increased primarily because of the equity investment in Cognical Holdings, Inc. We made a $5.0 million investment on April 20, 2017 and an additional $0.6 million investment in October 2017 that increased the Company's equity ownership from 8.9% to 9.4%. Cognical Holdings, Inc. operates as a business under an online website, www.zibby.com , that facilities the purchase of household items and by underbanked consumers.\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) and Accrued Interest - Changes from year-end 2016 are due to the refinancing of the Former Senior Secured Notes and the conversion of the ABL Facility to the Non-Recourse U.S. SPV Facility. For more information about the Company's long term debt, see Note 11, “Long-Term Debt” of the Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in the prospectus dated December 8, 2017.\nAbout CURO\nCURO Group Holdings Corp.

These statements may include, without limitation, any statements preceded by, followed by or including words such as “target,” “believe,” “expect,” “aim,” “intend,” “may,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “budget,” “continue,” “estimate,” “future,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “will,” “can have,” “likely,” “should,” “would,” “could” and other words and terms of similar meaning or the negative thereof. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors beyond the Company’s control, as discussed by the Company’s filings with SEC, that could cause the Company’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the expected results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the Company’s present and future business strategies and the environment in which it will operate in the future. Any forward-looking statement made in this press release speaks only as the date hereof.\nForward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events, results or outcomes. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect. In addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could result in our expectations not being realized or otherwise materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nOur forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual events, results and outcomes may differ materially from our expectations suggested in any forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, among others, those set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on December 8, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” including:\nAdjusted Net Income (Net Income minus certain non-cash and other adjusting items) Adjusted Earnings per share (Earnings per share minus the per share impacts of certain non-cash and other adjusting items) EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization); Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus or minus certain non-cash and other adjusting items); and Gross Combined Loans Receivable (includes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs which are not included in the consolidated financial statements).\nWe believe that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of the Company's operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business.\nWe believe that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income, Adjusting Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in the business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we believe that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these income or expense items. In addition, we believe that Adjusted Net Income, Adjusting Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of public companies in the Company's industry, many of which present Adjusted Net Income, Adjusting Earnings per Share, EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results.\nIn addition to reporting loans receivable information in accordance with GAAP, we provide Gross Combined Loans Receivable consisting of owned loans receivable plus loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which we guarantee but do not include in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes this analysis provides investors with important information needed to evaluate overall lending performance.\nWe provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of the GAAP consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusting Earnings per Share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Combined Loans Receivable should not be considered as alternatives to income from continuing operations, segment operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, U.S. GAAP results. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nDescription and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusting Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's income or cash flows as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthey do not include cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; they do not include changes in, or cash requirements for working capital needs; they do not include the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; depreciation and amortization are non-cash expense items reported in the statements of cash flows; and other companies in the Company's industry may calculate these measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nWe evaluate stores based on revenue per store, provision for losses at each store and store-level EBITDA, with consideration given to the length of time a store has been open and its geographic location. We monitor newer stores for their progress to profitability and their rate of revenue growth.\nWe believe Adjusted Net Income, Adjusting Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate the Company's ability to incur and service debt and the capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors to help assess the Company's estimated enterprise value. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies.\n(CURO-NWS)\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201006717/en/\nCURO Group Holdings Corp.\nInvestor Relations:\nRoger Dean, 844-200-0342\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nIR@curo.com\nSource: CURO Group Holdings Corp.",
