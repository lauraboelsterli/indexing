    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Outreach , the leading sales engagement platform, has hired Anna Baird as COO and Mike Zinne as Senior Vice President of Customer Success, rounding out the company's management team and positioning Outreach to continue the rapid growth trajectory it has been on since its founding in 2014.\nIn just two years (FY2015-2017), Outreach, which late last year was recognized by Forbes as one of its \"Next Billion Dollar Startups\" , went from zero to a $10 million run rate and just closed FY2018 up another 100+ percent. The company has also seen significant increases in headcount, doubling the number of employees from FY2018 to FY2019. Headcount growth for FY2019 will focus on investments in engineering, sales and customer success.\nAnna Baird brings a wealth of financial and operational leadership experience to her new role as Outreach COO. Before joining Outreach, Baird was responsible for providing financial and strategic leadership as CFO of Livongo Health, a consumer digital health company. Prior to her tenure at Livongo, she served as President and CFO of RadiumOne, a data driven marketing platform that was recently acquired by RhythmOne. She has also held senior-level financial and operational positions at Say Media, McAfee and KPMG. As COO of Outreach, Baird will lead the company's Finance, Business Intelligence, Sales Operations, Security and IT efforts.\nMike Zinne, Outreach's new SVP of Customer Success, will be a key part of future growth, providing services and training to existing customers and the Outreach employees that support them. Zinne has deep experience building and optimizing customer delivery teams for SaaS companies. Prior to joining Outreach, Zinne spent several years as Vice President of Customer Experience for Zendesk as well as in sales and support roles at Kyriba, Oracle and RightNow.\n\"Like most startups, a major key to our success has been – and continues to be – finding the right people to join our team, challenge us and ultimately propel us forward,\" said Manny Medina, CEO of Outreach. \"These hires represent the best of the best in terms of experience, skill set and a deep understanding of what it takes to strategically grow. We are excited to welcome Anna and Mike to Outreach.\"\nIn the recent months, Outreach has secured numerous new marquee customers, including MINDBODY, Splunk, and The San Francisco Chronicle. What's more, the company has successfully expanded into new verticals, building on its base of technology customers. In Q4 FY2018 alone, more than half of Outreach's new accounts came from verticals outside of technology, primarily financial services, telecom and healthcare.\nAbout Outreach\nOutreach, the leading sales engagement platform , automates and prioritizes customer touch points throughout the sales process, resulting in increased productivity for sales teams.
