    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 8:34 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago Bangladesh ex-PM jailed for five years for graft; plans to appeal Ruma Paul 3 Min Read \nDHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh opposition leader and former prime minister Khaleda Zia was jailed on Thursday for corruption, but plans to appeal against her five-year term, her lawyer said, as thousands of supporters took to the streets to protest her innocence. \nKhaleda, her son and aides were convicted of stealing 21 million taka ($253,000) in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister, from 2001 to 2006, lawyers said. \n“She was given a shorter term considering her health and social status,” Judge Mohammad Akhteruzzaman said, as he passed sentence in a packed courtroom amid tight security. \nKhaleda plans to appeal against her conviction, lawyers said, and is likely to be freed on bail during that process. \n“We didn’t get justice. We’ll go to the higher court,” Khandker Mahbub Hossain, the leader of Khaleda’s legal team, told reporters. \nAfter the verdict, Khaleda was escorted to the central jail in the capital, a three-storey red-brick structure with barred windows surrounded by trees, to begin serving her sentence in two rooms set aside for her, jail officials said. \nKhaleda’s son, Tarique Rahman, and four others were jailed for 10 years at the end of a case that lasted nearly 10 years. \nKhaleda and her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) say the charges are part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics. Party leaders said more than 3,500 supporters have been detained over the past few days.

REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain \nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda, both related to former national leaders, have nursed a long and bitter rivalry as they have dominated politics in poverty-stricken Bangladesh for more than two decades. \nThe renewed tension between them raises the specter of a long, destabilizing spell of unrest for Bangladesh and its economy. Khaleda is due to run in parliamentary polls set for December and can still do so if an appeal is pending. \nBNP senior leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi denounced the sentence, calling it “an attempt to eliminate the opponent”.
