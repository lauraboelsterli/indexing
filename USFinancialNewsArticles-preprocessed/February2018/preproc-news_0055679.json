    "text": "WHEELING, W.Va., WesBanco, Inc. (Nasdaq: WSBC), a diversified, multi-state bank holding company announced today that its Board of Directors has approved an 11.5% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.29 per common share from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.26 per common share. The higher dividend rate will be payable on April 2, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018. This is the eleventh increase in the quarterly dividend since 2010, and represents a cumulative increase of 107% over that period.\nThe WesBanco Board of Directors approved this most recent cash dividend increase based in part on the Company's record earnings achieved during 2017, strong regulatory capital and liquidity positions, solid execution on well-defined long-term operational and growth strategies, and the recent change in Federal tax law. The new cash dividend represents an annualized cash dividend rate of $1.16 per common share. Based upon yesterday's closing common stock price of $42.37, the new dividend equates to a yield of approximately 2.7%.\nAbout WesBanco, Inc.\nFounded in 1870, WesBanco, Inc.
