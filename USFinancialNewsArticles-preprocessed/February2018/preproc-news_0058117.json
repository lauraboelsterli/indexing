    "text": "(Adds monthly package restructure, subscription revenue, background on competition)\nFeb 28 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s Sky Network Television on Wednesday posted a 12 percent rise in half-year net profit, as lower operational costs resulting from a dwindling subscriber base came to its rescue.\nThe subscription television provider attributed its shrinking customer base to the spike in popularity of digital media platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon.com Inc , which have eaten away at the market share of traditional pay television providers.\nThe company on also said on Wednesday it would restructure its monthly subscription to a cheaper NZ$24.91 a month package with the option to add premium channels at an additional NZ$25, effectively providing a more affordable entry point to its services.\nThe earlier basic package was priced at NZ$49.91.\n“Our total subscriber count declined because we didn’t attract enough new customers who find the new On Demand models appealing,” Chief Executive John Fellet said in a statement.\nRevenue fell 5.5 percent during the half-year to NZ$433.1 million.\nOperating costs declined 8 percent to NZ$330.8 million.\nSky’s satellite subscription revenue, the largest contributor to its top line, shed 5.5 percent, while advertising revenue dipped 10 percent to NZ$31.5 million.\nThe subscription television provider posted an interim net profit of NZ$66.6 million ($48.24 million) in the six months to Dec. 31, compared with NZ$59.3 million last year.\nThe company cut its interim dividend to NZ$0.075, from the NZ$0.15 payout in the previous year to reduce debt, it said in a statement.
