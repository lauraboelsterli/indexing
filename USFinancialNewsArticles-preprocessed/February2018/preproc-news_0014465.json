    "text": "0 COMMENTS XPO Logistics Inc., XPO -2.32% the biggest North American provider of home delivery for bulky items like washing machines and exercise equipment, is bringing that service to Europe.\nThe expansion comes as XPO reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday, bolstered by a robust holiday peak for e-commerce and improved profitability across its transportation units.\nThe company had $4.19 billion in revenue that quarter, a 14% year-over-year rise driven by gains in freight brokerage, last-mile delivery and demand for contract logistics in Europe and North America. Adjusted earnings were $59.2 million, or 45 cents per share, excluding a $169.6 million benefit from the tax overhaul and other costs. The average analyst forecast was for 43 cents per share, according to FactSet. XPO reported earnings of 24 cents per share in the same quarter in 2016.\nGreenwich, Conn.-based XPO has grown rapidly by acquiring U.S. and European companies that specialize in trucking, freight brokerage and online fulfillment. Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs has said the company is looking to spend up to $8 billion on deals in Europe and North America. XPO’s last major acquisition was for the trucking company Con-way Inc. in September 2015.\nHowever, the company plans to grow its last-mile service organically in Europe, where the market is fragmented, Mr. Jacobs said in an interview Wednesday\n“Many of our North American customers are interested in seeing us replicate our last-mile service in Europe,” he said. “In Europe, there’s no one to buy like that, so we’re really bootstrapping it.”\nOver the past year, the company has built a European delivery network of subcontractors, and is also doing some deliveries of furniture, home electronics and heavy appliances with its own trucks. The service is the most developed in the U.K. and Ireland, and is ramping up in the Netherlands, France and Spain, Mr. Jacobs said. He declined to name retailers now using XPO for last-mile delivery there.\nClients for other XPO services include retailers such as IKEA and Inditex SA’s Zara.\nOnline sales are growing in western Europe, where many urban consumers lack cars and depend on delivery to get big purchases such as refrigerators home. Some of the biggest retailers have dedicated delivery fleets, while consumer-products companies that sell direct to consumers often rely on networks of independent operators, said Gary Hanifan, a managing director at Accenture Strategy.\nOther logistics companies are also eyeing the European market. Seko Logistics, which competes with XPO to provide last-mile delivery for heavy items in the U.S., is considering joining with local companies in Europe, said Chief Executive James Gagne.\n“The potential market for this type of home delivery [in Europe] is in the multi-multi billion dollars,” he said.\nIn the U.S., XPO’s results were boosted by surging prices and tight capacity in the freight market, where many shippers are having trouble finding enough trucks. Revenue in the company’s freight brokerage was up 33% last quarter, and XPO is adding more salespeople in its less-than-truckload segment “to capitalize on the strong LTL environment,” Mr. Jacobs said.\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com",
