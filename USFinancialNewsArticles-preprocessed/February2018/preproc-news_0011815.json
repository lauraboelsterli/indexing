Oxford will own a 52.5% interest and manage the development on behalf of the Oxford-CPPIB partnership. CPPIB will own the remaining 47.5% interest.\nThe 3.25 acre site features 600 feet of Hudson River frontage in the Hudson Square submarket of Midtown South. The existing St. John's Terminal structure, built in 1934 as the rail freight terminus to the High Line, features soaring ceiling heights and over-sized floorplates.\nThe Northern portion of the site is not part of this transaction and will be developed separately.\nOxford and CPPIB are long-standing joint venture partners who together own over 14 million square feet of commercial office and retail real estate, have jointly developed four office towers, and hold three sites for future development.\nOxford and CPPIB expect to announce further details of the St. John's Terminal development in the second half of 2018.\nOxford was advised on debt and equity capitalization by Cushman and Wakefield's New York Capital Markets team.\nAbout Oxford Properties Group\nOxford Properties Group is one of the world's premier real estate investment, development and management companies.
