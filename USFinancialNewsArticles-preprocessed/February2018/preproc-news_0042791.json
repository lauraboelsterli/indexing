    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 10:43 AM / in 37 minutes EU to task officials to draw up sanctions on Myanmar generals: diplomats Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers will formally request to prepare a list of senior military figures in Myanmar that could be targeted with sanctions, two diplomats said on Thursday. The request for a list of names takes the bloc a step closer to imposing travel bans and asset freezes on Myanmar generals over the massacre of Rohingya Muslims, the diplomats said. Foreign ministers will also ask the EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to look at ways to strengthen the blocâ€™s 1990s-era arms embargo on Myanmar that is still in place.
