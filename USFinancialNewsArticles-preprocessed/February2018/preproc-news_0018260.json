    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 2:06 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Deals of the day-Mergers and acquisitions Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nFeb 8 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1400 GMT on Thursday: \n** Swiss Re said it is in preliminary talks to sell a minority stake to SoftBank Group - a deal that reportedly could be worth $10 billion or more, in what would be the Japanese firm’s biggest financial services deal to date. \n** Bahrain-based private equity firm Investcorp is in the advanced stages of merger and acquisition deals in the Gulf, the United States and Europe, the co-chief executive said. \n** Norwegian fertiliser-maker Yara International is focusing on integrating recent acquisitions in India and Brazil, rather than doing more deals, Chief Executive Svein Tore Holsether told Reuters. \n** Shares in Danish telecoms operator TDC surged after it rejected a reported $6 billion takeover approach from Australia’s Macquarie and three Danish pension funds. \n** Canadian oil sands producer MEG Energy said it had agreed to sell some pipeline and storage assets in Alberta to Wolf Midstream Inc for C$1.61 billion ($1.28 billion) to pay down debt and fund its flagship project in Athabasca. \n** Spanish toll operator Abertis, at the centre of a 17.1-billion-euro ($21 billion) takeover battle, is seeking to sell a majority stake in its satellite business Hispasat to Spanish power grid operator Red Electrica for 656 million euros ($803 million).
