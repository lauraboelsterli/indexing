This acquisition expands the capabilities of Varian's 360 Oncology ™ care management platform by tightly integrating clinical workflow, decision support, and adherence tracking based on leading cancer care guidelines.\nThe Evinance Decision Support ™ platform is designed to improve quality of care by providing clinicians access to the latest clinical information for making evidence-based treatment decisions while empowering patients throughout their cancer journey. Varian is integrating the Evinance platform within 360 Oncology to provide visual care pathways and compliance tracking based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ® (NCCN ® ) and other evidence-based guidelines.
