    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks bounced sharply on Wednesday morning after crumbling to their biggest percentage fall in 15 months the previous day, with all sectors in the black as Wall Street pulled ahead following a punishing sell-off in the preceding days.\nThe Nikkei 225 share average jumped 3.2 percent to 22,303.88 in midmorning trade, after stumbling 4.7 percent on Tuesday amid a global equities rout.\nToyota Motor Corp gave the market something to cheer, rallying more than 5 percent after the automaker said that it expects a record net profit this year.\nAll of the Topixâ€™s 33 subsectors were in positive territory, with mining companies, drugmakers and automakers outperforming.\nEisai Co rose 5.4 percent, Astellas Pharma 4.5 percent, Inpex Corp 4.0 percent and Honda Motor 3.3 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 3.3 percent to 1,800.12.
