    "text": "Two advertising agencies in Philadelphia and Boston entered into a $4,000 Super Bowl bet. After the Eagles defeated the New England Patriots Sunday, the Boston agency made good on its promise and ponied up the cash for an ad congratulating the Philadelphia Eagles on their victory against the New England Patriots.\nWilmington, Del. marketing agency Aloysius Butler & Clark earlier this month entered into a wager with Boston's Small Army where the agency whose NFL team wins Super Bowl LII will get a paid congratulatory, full-page advertisement in their city's major newspaper, courtesy of the losing city's agency.\nRead more from Philadelphia Business Journal:\nStandoff in Harrisburg: Pennsylvania's 'constitutional crisis' over court's redistricting decision \nEagles fans take over Center City for Super Bowl victory parade \nTransit agencies score on Eagles Parade day \nThe Philadelphia Eagles came, saw, conquered and were named Super Bowl victors, besting the Patriots in a 41-33 game. \nThe black-and-white ad, out Friday in the Philadelphia Inquirer — the agencies agreed to run it in a daily newspaper — features William Penn atop City Hall donning an underdog mask, created earlier this year to represent the Eagles' season-long underdog status.\nWith the ad, AB&C wanted to showcase the Eagle's ability to \"silence 'non-believers.'\" Agencies traditionally show their best during the Super Bowl, including paying $5 million for a 30-second commercial aired during the game.\n\"AB&C has always been one to do things a little differently,\" President Paul Pomeroy said. \"We knew it would be more meaningful to the winning agency and its community to have an ad that built on the momentum of city pride after the Super Bowl victory.\"\nPomeroy optimistically said the agency looks forward to making the same wager with the next city that faces off against the Eagles in 2019.",
