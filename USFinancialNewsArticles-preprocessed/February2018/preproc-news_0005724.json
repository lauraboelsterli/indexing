In addition, Michael Reger has agreed in his role as Chairman Emeritus to serve as an advisor to the Board in connection with the equity raise and potential acquisitions described below. The company also announced that it has accepted the resignation of Thomas Stoelk, Northern's previous Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In connection therewith, Brandon Elliott has been appointed Interim President in addition to his current role as EVP, Corporate Development and Strategy, and Chad Allen has been appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer in addition to his current role as Chief Accounting Officer.\nBahram Akradi, Northern's Chairman, commented, \"The exchange agreement with our bondholders is a significant step to allow us to advance the execution of our growth strategy. Northern already has an excellent liquidity position and is experiencing exceptional operational results. With the added benefit of the transactions contemplated by the exchange agreement, we expect to accelerate our growth strategy as the natural consolidator and clearing house of non-operated working interest in the Williston Basin. I am incredibly excited about Northern's future and look forward to continuing my work with the team. This team has done a phenomenal job, as evidenced by the outstanding preliminary fourth quarter results that are also being announced by the Company today.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nDaily production in the fourth quarter increased 9.3% sequentially and 22.3% year over year to average 16,742 barrels of oil equivalent (\"Boe\") per day, for a total of 1,540,237 Boe Northern beat its prior expense guidance with lower production expenses, production taxes, and general and administrative expenses on a per Boe basis Fourth quarter oil differential was $3.51 per barrel, an improvement of $2.71 per barrel compared to the third quarter\nEXCHANGE AGREEMENT\nUnder the terms of the exchange agreement, Northern has agreed to exchange approximately $497 million aggregate principal amount of its 8% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the \"Existing Notes\") for a combination of approximately $344 million aggregate principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due 2023 (the \"New Notes\") and approximately $155 million of Northern's common stock. The New Notes are expected to mature on April 30, 2023. The New Notes will bear cash interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum, and additional interest at a rate of 1% per annum that is payable in kind (PIK), provided that the PIK interest shall cease to accrue if Northern achieves specified total debt-to-EBITDAX metrics. The New Notes will be secured by second priority lien security interests in substantially the same collateral that secures Northern's obligations under its $400 million first lien credit facility with TPG Sixth Street Partners (the \"First Lien Facility\").\nClosing under the exchange agreement is conditioned upon, among other things, (i) shareholder approval of the issuance of common stock in the exchange and the equity raise, (ii) the reincorporation of Northern in the State of Delaware (from Minnesota), (iii) consent of the lenders under the First Lien Facility and (iv) definitive documentation for the New Notes. Closing under the exchange agreement is also conditioned on Northern raising $156 million of additional equity in the form of (i) cash contributions from the sale of equity and/or (ii) additional assets acquired by Northern in exchange for equity (limited to 50% of the total equity raise). The price of the common stock to be issued in the exchange and the equity raise is targeted for $3.00 per share.\nContemporaneously with the execution of the exchange agreement, Northern received equity commitments totaling $40 million of the equity raise at a price of $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment) from certain investors, including TRT Holdings, Inc. (the company's largest shareholder and largest noteholder, who also agreed to exchange all of its Existing Notes pursuant to the exchange agreement), Bahram Akradi (the company's Chairman), and Michael Reger (the company's founder and Chairman Emeritus). These equity commitments are conditioned upon, among other things, closing of the transactions under the exchange agreement.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of any securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nEvercore is serving as financial advisor to Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. and Jones Day is acting as legal counsel.\nABOUT NORTHERN OIL AND GAS\nNorthern Oil and Gas, Inc. is an exploration and production company with a core area of focus in the Williston Basin Bakken and Three Forks play in North Dakota and Montana.
