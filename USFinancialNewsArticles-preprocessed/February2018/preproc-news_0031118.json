    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Strong winds swirling around Pyeongchang caused further chaos as the Olympic Nordic combined event, already running 15 minutes late due to a delay in the ski jumping, was set back by another 15 minutes ahead of the cross-country skiing.\nWith the scheduled evening competition at the biathlon center already postponed, organizers had hoped to get the combined event back on track but they were forced to push back the start to 6 p.m. local time (0900 GMT).\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
