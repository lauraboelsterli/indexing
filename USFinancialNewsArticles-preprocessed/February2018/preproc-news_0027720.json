    "text": "VANCOUVER, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd. (TSX:GQM | OTCQX:GQMNF) (\"Golden Queen\" or \"the Company\") reminds shareholders of the upcoming expiry on February 20, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern time of the previously announced rights offering (\" Rights Offering \").\nAll shareholders of the Company's common shares as at the close of business (Eastern Time) on December 1, 2017, were issued one right for every common share held. Eligible shareholders that may exercise the rights are those shareholders resident in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario and the United States, except for the states of California, Ohio, Arizona, Arkansas, Minnesota and Wisconsin.\nWhy a Rights Offering?\nA Rights Offering was chosen to give the opportunity to all existing eligible shareholders to participate and avoid dilution of their position in the Company. Proceeds from the offering will provide capital necessary to:\nreduce the Company's corporate debt; make the required cash contribution to Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC in connection with the joint venture; fund the Company's budgeted 2018 operating expenses; and fund unallocated expenses and contingencies.\nRights Terms\nFor each right, the holder will be entitled to subscribe for 1.7 common shares at the subscription price of US$0.1325 per common share; no fractional common shares will be issued.\nAdditional Subscription Privilege\nThe rights offering includes an additional subscription privilege under which holders of rights who fully exercise their rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional common shares, if available, that were not otherwise subscribed for in the rights offering. If a shareholder does not exercise all of its rights pursuant to the basic subscription right, the shareholder's equity in the Company will be diluted by the issuance of common shares upon the exercise of rights by other shareholders.\nStandby Purchasers\nThe trustee of the Landon T. Clay 2009 Irrevocable Trust Dated March 6, 2009, affiliates of the trustee, and affiliates of the holders of The Masters 1, LLC (the \"Standby Purchasers\" ) have control and direction over an aggregate of 30,926,536 shares. If none of the other holders of rights exercise such rights, and the Standby Purchasers acquire the standby shares pursuant to a standby guarantee agreement dated November 10, 2017, the Standby Purchasers will acquire 188,952,761 Common Shares under the standby guarantee and will own approximately 73.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company.\nIf a shareholder does not exercise all of their rights pursuant to the basic subscription rights, the shareholder's equity in the Company will be diluted by the issuance of common shares upon the exercise of rights by other shareholders, or pursuant to the purchase of the standby shares by the Standby Purchasers.\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions relating to the rights offering, please contact the information agent, Laurel Hill Advisory Group at 1-877- 452-7184 (toll-free in North America), 1-416-304-0211 (outside North America), or by email at assistance@laurelhill.com .\nThe Company has registered the offer and sale of the shares issuable on exercise of the rights pursuant to an effective Registration Statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"). Shareholders should review a copy of the Registration Statement and U.S. Prospectus contained therein which can be found on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or are available upon request to the Company at Corporate Secretary, Golden Queen Mining Company, #2300 â€“ 1066 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC V6E 3X2, telephone: 778.373.1557 or by email to info@goldenqueen.com .\nThis news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The standby shares issuable pursuant to the standby guarantee have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws and are being offered and will be issued, if applicable, pursuant to an exemption.\nAbout Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd.:\nGolden Queen is a gold and silver producer holding a 50% interest in an open pit, heap leach mining operation on the Soledad Mountain property, located just outside the town of Mojave in Kern County in southern California.
