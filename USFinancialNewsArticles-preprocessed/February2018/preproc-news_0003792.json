    "text": " 16 p.m. ET Share \nAt least 2 killed, more than 100 injured in Sunday morning crash Reuters Emergency responders respond to the scene after an Amtrak passenger train collided with a freight train and derailed in Cayce, S.C., on Sunday. \nBy Scott Calvert Cameron McWhirter \nWEST COLUMBIA, S.C. — At least two people were killed and more than 100 injured early Sunday when an Amtrak passenger train slammed into a stationary CSX Corp. freight train outside Columbia, S.C., officials said. \nTwo Amtrak workers died in the crash, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news briefing. A coroner identified the deceased as the train’s engineer and its conductor. \n”It appears to me that the CSX was on the track that it was supposed to be on, and that appears to be a loading track or a switch track,” McMaster said. “It appears Amtrak was on the wrong track.” \nThe National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation of the crash. The Federal Railroad Administration’s investigative team is on site to assist, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Amtrak said CSX CSX, -2.35% owns and controls the track where the accident happened, and that CSX is responsible for maintenance of track and signals there as well as for the dispatching of all trains.",
