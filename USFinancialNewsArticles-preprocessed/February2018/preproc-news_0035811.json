We are back to normal operations in our MOCVD business,” concluded Mr. Peeler.\nGuidance and Outlook\nThe following guidance is provided for Veeco’s first quarter 2018:\nRevenue is expected in the range of $140 million to $165 million Non-GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $2 million to $10 million GAAP earnings (loss) per share are expected in the range of ($0.50) to ($0.32) Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are expected in the range of ($0.04) to $0.14\nPlease refer to the tables at the end of this press release for further details.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call reviewing these results has been scheduled for today, February 12, 2018 starting at 5:00pm ET.
