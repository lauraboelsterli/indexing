    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he is considering a range of options to address steel and aluminum imports that he said are unfairly hurting U.S. producers, including “tariffs and/or quotas.”\nTrump made his comments during a meeting with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators and representatives - some who favored curbs on imports, others who cautioned him on the impact on U.S. manufacturers.\n“What we’re talking about it tariffs and/or quotas,” Trump said to the group.\n”Part of the options would be tariffs coming in. As they dump steel, they pay tariffs, substantial tariffs, which means the United States would actually make a lot of money.
