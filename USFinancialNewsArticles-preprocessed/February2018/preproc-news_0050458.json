Prices continue to rise and we expect to see an increase of approximately 25% in 2H FY18 prices on those received in the 1H FY18.\n\"Our plans to expand production at our Olaroz facility have been increased to total production of 42,500 tonnes per annum and we continue work on a 10,000 tonne per annum lithium hydroxide plant to be constructed with our partner Toyota Tsusho Corporation in Japan.\n\"Both of these projects are now fully funded,\" he said.\nOutlook and guidance and data\nSubject to market and operating conditions Orocobre provides the following guidance:\nOlaroz Lithium Facility\nApproximately 14,000 tonnes of production of lithium carbonate for FY18 2H FY18 prices up 25% on 1H FY18 Capital expenditure of US$12-15 million (for FY18) including CO2 recovery equipment, additional spare parts, process optimisation projects and previously noted pond management and control systems Overall pond inventory increased to approximately 45,500 tonnes.\nBorax Argentina\nProduction forecast of 35,000 - 40,000 tonnes for FY18 Capital expenditure of ~US$2-4 million for FY18\nCorporate\nCorporate costs of ~US$6 million for FY18\nProforma financials\nThe Orocobre Group achieved a net profit after tax of US$8.2 million 1 (31 December 2016: US$7.4 million profit), which included its share of net gains/(losses) of the SDJ joint venture of US$13.1 million (31 December 2016: US$9.7 million profit) and an impairment at Borax Argentina of US$1.9 million.\nSales de Jujuy PTE and hence the Olaroz Lithium Facility, recorded positive EBITDAIX 2 of US$37.2 million for the six months to 31 December 2017.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial data in this release is Quote: d in US dollars 3 .\n1 Statutory profit (loss) is profit after tax attributable to owners of the Company.\n2 Orocobre's results are reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This report also includes certain non-IFRS financial information, including the following:\n'Underlying profit' is a profit after tax before significant items attributable to owners of the Company. 'Proportional consolidation' is a method of including items of income, expense, assets and liabilities in proportion to the company's percentage of participation in the joint venture. \"NCI\" is the Non Controlling Interest which represents the portion of equity ownership in the Joint Venture not attributable to Orocobre Limited. 'EBITDAIX is 'Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, impairment and foreign exchange gains (losses)'. 'EBITIX is 'Earnings before interest, tax, impairment and foreign exchange gains (losses)'. 'EBTIX is 'Earnings before tax, impairment and foreign exchange gains (losses)'.\n3 Financial data has been translated to US dollars using average exchange rates for the relevant period in the income statement.\nAbout Orocobre Limited\nOrocobre Limited is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange (ASX: ORE) (TSX: ORL), and is building a substantial Argentinian-based industrial chemicals and minerals company through the construction and operation of its portfolio of lithium, potash and boron projects and facilities in the Puna region of northern Argentina. The Company has built, in partnership with Toyota Tsusho Corporation and JEMSE, the first large-scale, greenfield brine based lithium project in approximately 20 years at the Salar de Olaroz with production capacity of 17,500 tonnes per annum of low-cost lithium carbonate. Plans are underway to expand the Olaroz operations to a total of 42,500 tonnes per annum and to build a 10,000 tonne per annum lithium hydroxide plant in Japan with Toyota Tsusho Corporation.\nThe Olaroz Lithium Facility has a low environmental footprint because of the following aspects of the process:\nThe process is designed to have a high processing recovery of lithium. With its low unit costs, the process will result in low cut-off grades, which will maximise resource recovery. The process route is designed with a zero liquid discharge design. All waste products are stored in permanent impoundments (the lined evaporation ponds). At the end of the project life the ponds will be capped and returned to a similar profile following soil placement and planting of original vegetation types. Brine is extracted from wells with minimum impact on freshwater resources outside the salar. Because the lithium is in sedimentary aquifers with relatively low permeability, drawdowns are limited to the salar itself. This is different from halite hosted deposits such as Salar de Atacama, Salar de Hombre Muerto and Salar de Rincon where the halite bodies have very high near surface permeability and the drawdown cones can impact on water resources around the Salar affecting the local environment. Energy used to concentrate the lithium in the brine is solar energy. The carbon footprint is lower than other processes. The technology developed has a very low maximum fresh water consumption of <20 l/s, which is low by industry standards. Sales de Jujuy S.A. is also committed to the ten principles of the sustainable development framework as developed by The International Council on Mining and Metals. The company has an active and well-funded \"Shared Value\" program aimed at the long term development of the local people.\nThe Company continues to follow the community and shared value policy to successfully work with suppliers and the employment bureau to focus on the hiring of local people from the communities of Olaroz, Huancar, Puesto Sey, Pastos Chicos, Catua, Susques, Jama, El Toro, Coranzulí, San Juan and Abrapampa. The community and shared value policy continues to be a key success factor, training local people under the supervision of high quality experienced professionals.\nThe Company also wholly-owns Borax Argentina, an important regional borate producer.\nFor further information, please visit www.orocobre.com .\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/orocobre-limited-reports-first-half-net-profit-after-tax-of-us82m-300603189.html\nSOURCE Orocobre Limited",
