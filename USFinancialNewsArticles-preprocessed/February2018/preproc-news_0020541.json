These are neither promises nor guarantees of future performance, and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Sage's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these including, without limitation: the uncertainties related to market conditions and Sage's ability to complete the public offering on accepted terms or at all; the risk that Sage may not be able to satisfy the customary closing conditions related to the proposed offering; the potential that our completed, ongoing and future clinical and non-clinical data may not be sufficient to file for or gain regulatory approval to launch and commercialize our product candidates; the potential that future pre-clinical and clinical results may not support further development of Sage's product candidates or that Sage may not be able to successfully demonstrate the efficacy and safety of its product candidates at each stage of development in a manner sufficient to obtain approval; the risk that actions or decisions of regulatory agencies may affect the initiation, timing and progress of clinical trials; the potential for unexpected adverse events in the conduct of one of Sage's clinical trials to impact its ability to continue the clinical trial or further development of a product candidate; the risk that Sage may encounter other unexpected hurdles or issues in the development and manufacture of its product candidates that may impact its timing or progress, as well as those risks more fully discussed in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Sage's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as well as discussions of potential risks, uncertainties, and other important factors in Sage's subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, any represent Sage's views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. Sage explicitly disclaims any obligation to update any\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006213/en/\nSage Therapeutics\nInvestor Contact:\nPaul Cox, 617-299-8377\npaul.cox@sagerx.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nMaureen L.
