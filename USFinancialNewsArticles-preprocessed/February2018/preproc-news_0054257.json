    "text": "ST. LOUIS, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stifel Financial Corp. (NYSE:SF) today announced the launch of its new Shareholder Activism Defense practice, led by Juan Bonifacino, who joins the firm as Managing Director in New York. The offering aims to help companies effectively respond to activist campaigns and contested elections as well as to prepare proactive defense strategies.\nAs part of this service, Stifel will offer strategic and tactical advice and logistical support to companies currently dealing with shareholder activists. The Stifel team will also advise boards and management teams on ways to manage and reduce activism risk, including preparedness planning, vulnerability assessments, and strategies for institutional investor outreach and engagement.\n“Activism has become a critical part of the capital markets and M&A toolkit,” said Brad Raymond, Head of Investment Banking at Stifel. “There are significant dollars flowing into activist funds, and institutional investors are increasingly supporting activist strategies. All companies should be prepared to face an activist situation, and we’re glad to have Juan on board to help guide them, especially as we approach proxy season.”\nThe number of companies publicly subjected to activist demands has jumped by 41 percent since 2013, according to Activist Insight. The same data shows no companies are immune, regardless of size. Roughly two-thirds of activist targets last year were companies with market capitalizations under $2 billion.\n“Many institutional investors see activism as a mechanism for information discovery in the market, to spur a debate about a board’s track record of stewardship,” noted Mr. Bonifacino. “Having strong relationships with these shareholders is a fundamental part of a robust defense.”\nPrior to joining Stifel in late 2017, Mr. Bonifacino was a Principal at CamberView Partners, a corporate governance advisory firm that advises public company boards and management teams dealing with proxy contests, shareholder activism, and other complex and contested shareholder matters and helps build strong, productive relationships with institutional investors.\nMr. Bonifacino previously spent six years at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), where he served as a Vice President of M&A and Proxy Contest Research. In that role, he evaluated the financial and strategic implications of proxy contests, contested mergers, and other economic-focused shareholder election proposals for institutional investor clients.\nStifel Company Information\nStifel Financial Corp.
