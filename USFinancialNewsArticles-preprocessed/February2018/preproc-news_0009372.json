John brings extensive knowledge in manufacturing from the pharmaceutical industry and will drive all our development and commercial manufacturing activities, and will report to me.”\n“Jason is a seasoned corporate finance executive and brings nearly 20 years of experience at public revenue-generating companies. He will drive SEC reporting and accounting, and will report to our CFO,” continued Mr. Schelling. “Kim will lead our global marketing plans and will help us drive Acer’s pre-commercial activities.

Acer’s late-stage clinical pipeline includes two candidates for severe genetic disorders for which there are few or no FDA-approved treatments: EDSIVO™ (celiprolol) for vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), and ACER-001 (a fully taste-masked, immediate release formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate) for urea cycle disorders (UCD) and Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD). There are no FDA-approved drugs for vEDS and MSUD and limited options for UCD, which collectively impact more than 4,000 patients in the United States. Acer’s product candidates have clinical proof-of-concept and mechanistic differentiation, and Acer intends to seek approval for them in the U.S. by using the regulatory pathway established under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, that allows an applicant to rely for approval at least in part on third-party data, which is expected to expedite the preparation, submission, and potential approval of a marketing application.\nFor more information, visit www.acertx.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” that involve substantial risks and uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
