    "text": "BOSTON, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston-based cancer company Partner Therapeutics, Inc. (PTx) announced today that it appointed Colleen Mockbee to serve as the company's Chief Development Officer. In her role as CDO, Ms. Mockbee will oversee development, regulatory and quality activities and serve on the Company's executive management team.\nMs. Mockbee joins PTx following a 20-year career as a leader and executive overseeing multiple areas of drug development at Eli Lilly and Company. Her most recent role was as Global Product Development Leader overseeing the development, approval and launch of the CDK 4&6 inhibitor VerzenioÂ® (abemaciclib) for metastatic breast cancer. Prior to her role as development leader, Ms. Mockbee was the Senior Director of Global Regulatory Oncology where she was instrumental in NDA/BLA submissions and approvals for Gemzar, Alimta, and Cyramza. In addition, she provided regulatory direction for the overall oncology portfolio including the integration of ImClone regulatory capacity following Lilly's acquisition of the company. Previous roles include Senior Director of Global Health Outcomes as well as experience across various functional areas including global product safety and medical information. Prior to joining Lilly, Ms. Mockbee worked as a staff pharmacist at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital and a sales representative at Merck & Co. She received her B.S. in Chemistry and B.S. in Pharmacy from Butler University in 1990 and 1994. She received her MBA from Purdue's Krannert School of Business in 2016.\n\"We are pleased to welcome Colleen to our team to lead the development of our portfolio,\" said Debasish Roychowdhury, PTx's Chief Medical Officer. \"She is a truly multi-faceted executive who provides our team deep expertise in drug development and has a proven ability to bring important medicines to patients.\"\n\"I am excited to work with my new colleagues at PTx to build a pipeline that can make a significant contribution to cancer care and possibly other areas of high unmet need,\" said Ms. Mockbee. \"I believe our first program, Leukine, has great potential, as a differentiated immune-stimulant, to positively impact the lives of many more patients as we pursue a breadth of development opportunities including combinations with immuno-oncology, the treatment and prevention of infections, pulmonary disease, and neurologic disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinson's disease.\"\nOn February 1 st , PTx announced it acquired the global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Leukine from Sanofi. Leukine is a multi-lineage immune-stimulant that has been demonstrated to promote growth and activation of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells. It is the only FDA-approved recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). It is currently indicated for the treatment of AML in older adults to reduce the incidence of severe and life-threatening infections resulting in death; use in the treatment of allogeneic bone marrow transplants to reduce the incidence of bacteremia and other culture positive infections and shorten the median duration of hospitalization; and to prolong the survival of patients who are experiencing bone marrow transplant failure or delay.\nLeukine is currently being tested in over 100 clinical studies to assess its ability to increase the efficacy of immuno-oncology therapies, improve the treatment of pulmonary and neurological disorders, and improve the treatment of infections.\nAbout Partner Therapeutics, Inc.:\nPTx is an integrated commercial stage biotech company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics that improve health and economic outcomes in the treatment of cancer. PTx's development focus spans the entire range of cancer therapy from primary treatments to supportive care. The company believes in delivering great products in support of medical teams with the purpose of creating the best possible outcomes for patients and their families.\nwww.partnertx.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/partner-therapeutics-ptx-announces-the-appointment-of-colleen-mockbee-as-chief-development-officer-300602476.html\nSOURCE Partner Therapeutics, Inc.",
