Our platforms provide a measurable, digital solution for CPG brands and retailers to influence shoppers, wherever and however they shop,” said Mir Aamir, President and CEO of Quotient. “We believe this is a pivotal time for the CPG and retail industry as they face increasing competitive pressures. Efforts around shopper marketing are growing as brands look to spend dollars more efficiently to drive profitable sales. We believe Quotient provides a suite of digital commerce marketing solutions that fit perfectly with this new frontier in digital marketing, and will serve as a catalyst for transformational change going forward.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $93.1 million in Q4 2017, an increase of 23% over Q4 2016. Revenues from promotions and media were $63.4 million and $29.7 million, respectively, compared to Q4 2016 revenues of $58.5 million and $16.9 million, respectively. GAAP net income for Q4 2017 was $4.2 million, compared to $3.5 million in Q4 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million in Q4 2017, an increase of 23% over Q4 2016. Transactions totaled 971 million in Q4 2017, up 40% over Q4 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $322.1 million in 2017, an increase of 17% over 2016. Revenues from promotions and media were $237.2 million and $84.9 million, respectively, compared to 2016 revenues of $212.1 million and $63.1 million, respectively. GAAP net loss for 2017 was $15.1 million, compared to loss of $19.5 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $47.0 million in 2017, an increase of 45% over 2016. Transactions totaled 3.5 billion in 2017, up 45% over 2016. Generated $48.5 million in cash from operations in 2017, up from $21.8 million over 2016\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure at the end of this release.\n2017 Business Highlights\nCPG brands shifted more dollars to digital\nTotal savings distributed on our network in 2017 was approximately $5.4 billion, a 50% increase over 2016. Revenue from Retailer iQ, our digital paperless platform, grew 32% in Q4 2017 and 57% for full year 2017, over comparable year-over-year periods. CPG promotion revenue, which excludes specialty retail, grew 20% in Q4 2017 and 22% for full year 2017, over comparable year over year periods.\nExpanded audience reach, approaching half of all U.S. households\nAbout 60 million shoppers are now registered to savings programs powered by Retailer iQ, which represents about half of U.S. households. Quotient ended the year with 28 retail banners live on Retailer iQ, with 23 of those banners marketing their branded digital savings programs. Through Retailer iQ, retailers can create a direct digital relationship with their shoppers, sending them personalized and targeted digital savings and media. Early last year, we rolled out a new version of our Coupons.com app, giving shoppers another way to add digital coupons directly to their retailer savings accounts, and also giving them the ability to redeem coupons by scanning receipts. According to ComScore, monthly average visitors to Coupons.com mobile web and app were 18 million in the back half of 2017. Engagement on Coupons.com properties provides another important source of shopper data, including purchase intent, which is valuable for targeting coupons and ads.\nMedia revenue accelerated in 2017, growing 35% over 2016\nWith our data-driven QMX platform and acquisition of Crisp Mobile, a shopper marketing digital ad company, we have become a full-service media solution for CPG brands and retailers, providing the technology, creative design, and robust analytics that advertisers require to measure campaign performance and ROI. Our verified buyer audience grew to approximately 100 million, adding more shopper data and insights that continually improve our targeting capabilities to reach consumer segments based on brand preferences, location, frequency and hundreds of other factors.\nBusiness Outlook\nAs of today, Quotient is providing the following business outlook.\nFor the first quarter 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $83 million to $87 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2018 is expected to be in the range of $11 million to $13 million.\nFor the full year 2018, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $379 million to $394 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $65 million to $73 million.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP guidance measure, to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility of certain income and expenses items that are excluded in calculating Adjusted EBITDA.\nConference Call Information\nManagement will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss the Company's financial results and business outlook today at 4:30 p.m. EDT/ 1:30 p.m. PDT. Questions that investors would like to see asked during the call should be sent to ir@quotient.com .\nTo access the call, please dial (844) 579-6824, or outside the U.S. (763) 488-9145, with Conference ID# 2588629 at least five minutes prior to the 1:30 p.m. PDT start time. The live webcast and accompanying presentation can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the Company website at: http://investors.quotient.com/ . A replay of the webcast will be available on the website following the conference call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nQuotient has presented Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in this press release, because it is a key measure used by Quotient’s management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget, to develop short and long-term operational plans, and to determine bonus payouts. In particular, Quotient believes that the exclusion of certain income and expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial metric used by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, Quotient believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Quotient’s operating results in the same manner as Quotient’s management and Board of Directors.\nQuotient defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning Software implementation costs, certain acquisition related costs, and restructuring charges.\nQuotient's use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Quotient’s financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (i) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; (iii) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Quotient; (iv) the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other interest expense, other (income) expense net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, net change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs, certain acquisition related costs, and restructuring charges; and (v) other companies, including companies in its industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss), and Quotient’s other GAAP financial results.\nFor a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, see \"Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\" included in this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements concerning the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting its business. Forward looking statements in this press release include the Company’s current expectations with respect to revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter and fiscal year 2018; the Company’s expectations for the continued scaling and growth of the Retailer iQ digital platform, including expectations on its ability to grow, perform, and meet the expectations of consumers, retailers and CPGs; the Company’s expectations regarding the future demand and behavior of consumers, retailers and CPGs, including the shift to digital; the Company’s expectations for Quotient Media Exchange, including expectations regarding the potential audience reach of our platforms; the Company’s expectations regarding its targeted promotions and targeted media offerings; the Company’s expectation regarding the success of expanding our shopper marketing and media business; the Company’s expectations for the Coupons.com mobile app; and the Company’s expectations with respect to its future investments and growth and ability to leverage its investments and operating expenses.
