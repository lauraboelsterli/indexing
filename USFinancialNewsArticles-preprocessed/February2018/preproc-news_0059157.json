    "text": "112 COMMENTS JAKARTA—Two Indonesian Christians were publicly whipped for gambling, a rare case of non-Muslims being punished here under Islamic law, as the country shifts toward a more politicized brand of the religion associated with the Middle East.\nThe man and woman are residents of Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra island, a province that has imposed strict Shariah law . They were whipped at least six times each on Tuesday by a robed man wearing a mask and wielding a rattan cane. Hundreds of onlookers jeered them as the punishment was carried out on a stage next to a mosque in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh.\nIndonesia, the world’s most-populous Muslim-majority country, has long been known for its more moderate form of the religion. It has laws protecting the rights of Christians and other groups, a robust democracy and an open economy attracting investors including Toyota Motor Co. to Samsung Electronics Co. The capital Jakarta has restaurants with female staff in skimpy outfits.\nBut hard-line Islamic groups have been using the country’s democratic system to promote an Islamic agenda, building support among citizens with charity work and public preaching.\nHard-line Islamic groups are challenging Indonesia’s tradition of religious tolerance and secular law.

Lawmakers are now negotiating a revision of the criminal code, including provisions pushed by Islamic parties that would imprison gay people or unmarried cohabiting heterosexuals.\nAceh is the only province in Indonesia governed by Shariah law, under a measure of autonomy allowed to settle a separatist conflict in the country of 250 million people.\nPolicemen held an Indonesian man after he was publicly caned for having gay sex in Banda Aceh last year.

They can face flogging for offenses including drinking alcohol, adultery, gay sex, gambling or having romantic relationships before marriage. The province’s Shariah courts are imposing hundreds of whippings a year.\nThe minority in Aceh who aren’t Muslims have a choice of being punished under either the civil code or Shariah. Some choose flogging to avoid lengthy prison terms. In January, a Christian was sentenced to 36 lashes for selling alcohol.\nThe two Christians flogged on Tuesday were punished for playing a game at a children’s entertainment complex in a way authorities say amounted to gambling, said Yusnardi, head of Banda Aceh’s Shariah police force, which enforces laws rooted in Islamic faith . A Muslim man also involved in the case received at least 19 strokes. Details on what the game entailed weren’t immediately clear. Gambling is illegal across the whole country.\nSeparately on Tuesday, an unmarried Muslim man and woman received more than 20 lashes each for the offense of being intimate together.\nThe sentences brought swift condemnation from human-rights groups. “Corporal punishment is torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture , which Indonesia has ratified,” said Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch.\nIndonesia has long struggled with a minority of extremists. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, terrorists affiliated with al Qaeda killed hundreds of people in bombings—and the country has been on the lookout for possible returnees among the Indonesians who joined Islamic State in the Middle East.\nProminent groups of the country’s bombing survivors declined this week to participate in meetings orchestrated by officials to allow reformed terrorist convicts to make formal, face-to-face apologies to victims.\nWrite to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com",
