    "text": "U.S. stock index futures posted solid gains ahead of Friday's open, lifted by positive sentiment in domestic and international markets.\nAround 8:30 a.m. ET, Dow futures were up 13 points, indicating a rise of 61.63 points at the open. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures also pointed to a higher open for their respective markets.\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday morning on Feb. 9, 2018 in New York City. The positive uptick in U.S. futures comes after Wall Street posted solid gains Thursday , with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up more than 300 points, securing a five-day winning streak.\nDespite the market recovery, investors remain on edge as the prospect of higher interest rates continues to rattle sentiment across the globe.\nIn economic news, consumer sentiment and the Quarterly Services Survey are set to come out at 10 a.m. ET.\nHousing starts for January rose 9.7 percent, easily topping estimates. Import prices, meanwhile, gained 1 percent, while export prices advanced 0.8 percent.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nIn politics, the U.S. Senate barred a number of immigration proposals Thursday, leaving the debate on how best to protect young immigrants from deportation in a state of limbo.\nâ€”CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report",
