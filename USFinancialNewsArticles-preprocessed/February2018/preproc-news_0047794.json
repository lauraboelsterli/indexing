Shown here, President Trump and King Salman met in May 2017. \nBy Timothy Puko Summer Said \nThe Trump administration is pursuing a deal to sell nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia despite the kingdom’s refusal to accept the most stringent restrictions against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, U.S. officials say. \nSaudi Arabia’s nuclear energy ambitions could open a new market worth tens of billions of dollars, drawing countries including Russia, South Korea and China to compete for the business. Administration officials consider it too important to overlook, especially when the U.S. nuclear power industry is on the decline. ‘I told [the Saudi ambassador] that I would demand a vote and debate on the Senate floor on any proposed 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia. It seems crazy to loosen important nonproliferation standards just to try to secure an uncertain commercial deal.’ Sen. Ed Markey, Massachusetts Democrat \nBut Saudi Arabia’s resistance to the toughest proliferation controls—a ban on enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel—already is stirring concern among U.S. lawmakers, who must review any accord to transfer U.S. nuclear technology, known as a 123 agreement. \nThe impending debate has confronted the administration with a dilemma: If it lowers standards in the hope of securing the Saudi deal it will spur criticism about its commitment to fighting proliferation. Critics of reducing standards say it will send a signal at a time more countries across the volatile region aspire to acquire nuclear technology. But supporters of a deal with Saudi Arabia argue there are other ways to address nonproliferation concerns and that if the U.S. isn’t willing to sell nuclear technology, other nations will. \nThe kingdom is playing competitors, especially the U.S. and Russia, against one another.

U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited in the autumn, and 17 U.S. companies, including Westinghouse Electric Co. and Exelon Corp. EXC, +0.75% , followed.",
