    "text": "DENVER, Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Black Creek Group, a Denver-based real estate investment management firm, today announced the appointment of Heather Grubbs as Managing Director – Chief Marketing Officer. Ms. Grubbs will oversee all aspects of the firm’s marketing strategy, with an emphasis on positioning Black Creek’s investment products to investment professionals for use in their client’s portfolios.\n“Heather is a strategic thinker who has a deep understanding of the retail segment and intermediary distribution channels, which will be a key growth driver for firms investing in commercial real estate over the next several years,” said Raj Dhanda, President of Black Creek Group. Mr. Dhanda explained that while institutional investors will remain a major force in the commercial real estate market and an important constituency for Black Creek, many have already allocated to the asset class: “We’re delivering institutional-quality real estate investment products that are tailored for individual investors and I’m confident Heather can help us share that message.”\nMs. Grubbs most recently served as V.P.-Marketing for a division of Fidelity Investments based in Denver, where she was responsible for firm-wide marketing of its sector investment products and oversaw marketing for the launch of its ETF division and proprietary ETF products. She previously held senior positions at Janus Capital Group (now Janus Henderson), Old Mutual Investment Partners and Transamerica.\nAbout Black Creek Group\nBlack Creek Group is an experienced real estate investment management firm with more than $17 billion of investments over its 25-year history. The company manages diverse investment offerings across the spectrum of commercial real estate – including office, industrial, retail and multifamily – and has a track record of creating long-term value for its investors. The company has nine offices across North America with more than 300 professionals. Black Creek Group offers a range of investment solutions for both institutional and wealth management channels.
