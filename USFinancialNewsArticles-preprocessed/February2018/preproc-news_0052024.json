Garberding, EnLink President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our team executed tremendously well throughout 2017, resulting in extensions of our footprint, further integration of our systems, improvements in our strong balance sheet position, and solid growth in cash flows. Our performance in 2017 sets the stage for a strong 2018.\n\"The industry has been through three years of a downturn, and EnLink's strategic actions have positioned us for continued growth. We're in the right places with the right partners, and we are executing the right plan, all of which will drive strong results for 2018 and beyond.\"\nEnLink Midstream Partners, LP: Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results\nThe Partnership reported net income attributable to ENLK of $75.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $148.9 million for the full-year 2017. Net income includes a $24.9 million tax benefit recorded as a result of the recently enacted tax reform law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Comparatively, the Partnership reported a net loss attributable to ENLK of $28.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $565.2 million for the full-year 2016. The full-year 2016 net loss was primarily due to a non-cash expense of $566.3 million related to impairments. The Partnership achieved $238.7 million of adjusted EBITDA net to ENLK for the fourth quarter of 2017, and achieved $872.8 million for the full-year 2017. Comparatively, the Partnership achieved $194.7 million of adjusted EBITDA net to ENLK for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $774.6 million for the full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" The Partnership achieved net cash provided by operating activities of $173.5 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and $706.5 million for the full-year 2017.

Debt to adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2017 was 3.58x, compared to 3.70x as of December 31, 2016. Growth capital expenditures net to ENLK for the full-year 2017 were approximately $610 million (excluding capitalized interest), in-line with the 2017 guidance range of $505 million to $645 million. As of February 14, 2018, there were 350,022,931 ENLK common units outstanding.\nEnLink Midstream, LLC: Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results\nThe General Partner reported net income attributable to ENLC of $202.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $212.8 million for full-year 2017. Net income includes a $210.6 million tax benefit recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Comparatively, the General Partner reported a net loss attributable to ENLC of $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 2016 full-year net loss of $460.0 million. As noted above, the net losses were primarily due to non-cash expenses related to impairments. The General Partner's cash available for distribution was $58.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $216.5 million for the full-year 2017. Comparatively, the General Partner's cash available for distribution was $52.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $201.7 million for the full-year 2016. Cash available for distribution is a non-GAAP measure and is explained in greater detail under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\" Distribution coverage was 1.23x for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 1.16x for full-year 2017. Growth capital expenditures net to ENLC for full-year 2017 were approximately $65 million (excluding capitalized interest), in-line with the 2017 guidance range of $60 million to $70 million. As of February 14, 2018, there were 180,883,369 ENLC common units outstanding.\nOperational Update:\nOklahoma: EnLink's Oklahoma segment achieved growth of more than 40 percent in segment profit and average processing volumes for full-year 2017 as compared to full-year 2016, and average gas gathering and transmission volumes increased by approximately 30 percent. EnLink's Oklahoma segment is expected to achieve approximately 50 percent growth in both average volumes and segment profit for full-year 2018, as compared to full-year 2017. EnLink increased gas processing capacity at its Chisholm complex in Central Oklahoma by 400 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) during 2017. With these completed expansions, EnLink now operates 1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of processing capacity in Central Oklahoma, and remains one of the largest full-service midstream providers in the STACK. EnLink's previously announced plans to construct the Thunderbird plant, will add 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity in Central Oklahoma. The Thunderbird facility is expected to be operational during the first quarter of 2019. The construction of EnLink's previously announced Black Coyote crude oil gathering system is progressing well, and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2018. Once the Black Coyote system is operational, EnLink will generate revenue by serving the full range of products produced by Devon Energy's multi-zone large-scale developments, including natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL) and crude oil. Midland Basin: EnLink's Midland Basin natural gas system, achieved 15 percent growth in average volumes for the full-year 2017, as compared to full-year 2016. EnLink expects additional volume growth on its system, as producer customers are expected to bring large scale developments on-line during 2018, resulting in average volume growth of around 40 percent for full-year 2018 as compared to full-year 2017. EnLink expects to achieve around 80 percent processing capacity utilization of its processing capacity by the end of 2018. EnLink also placed into full service the Greater Chickadee crude oil gathering system during 2017. Volumes on the system increased steadily throughout 2017, and EnLink expects to achieve continued growth on the system throughout 2018. Delaware Basin: EnLink's Delaware Basin Joint Venture (JV) achieved significant volume growth during 2017, with full-year 2017 average gas gathering and processing volumes increasing by approximately 300 percent as compared to the full-year 2016 average. EnLink expects to achieve continued volume growth throughout 2018, with average volumes expected to increase by approximately 150 percent for full-year 2018 as compared to the full-year 2017 average. To support continued volume growth across the Delaware Basin footprint, the Delaware Basin JV expanded its Lobo II facility by 60 MMcf/d during 2017, and plans to further expand the facility by 15 MMcf/d in 2018. Additionally, EnLink previously announced the construction of Lobo III, a new 200 MMcf/d expansion expected to be fully operational around year-end 2018. Today, EnLink's Delaware Basin JV operates a total of 155 MMcf/d of processing capacity, with 370 MMcf/d of processing capacity expected to be operational around the end of 2018. Louisiana: NGL fractionation volumes experienced 10 percent growth on average for the full-year 2017 as compared to full-year 2016. EnLink expects throughput on its Cajun-Sibon pipeline to reach full capacity during 2018, largely driven by the completion of the Chisholm II and III expansions during 2017. NGLs produced from EnLink's Chisholm complex are preferentially shipped to EnLink's Gulf Coast operations for further transportation, fractionation and downstream value creation. Record gas gathering and transmission volumes of over 2 Bcf/d were achieved on EnLink's Louisiana gas system during the second half of 2017, as demand across the footprint remained robust and EnLink continued to enhance operational capacity and capture new business. Barnett Shale: Producer customers have become increasingly active in the Barnett Shale, with one to two rigs expected to be operating on EnLink's dedicated acreage throughout 2018. Redevelopment activity, new well drilling, and pressure optimization initiatives are projected to reduce annual volume decline for 2018, as compared to 2017. EnLink's key producer customer in the Barnett Shale, Devon recently announced results related to its 6-well drilling pilot that leveraged an improved completion design. Initial 30-day production rates from this 6-well pilot program attained per-well rates as high as 6.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with capital costs of approximately $3 million per well. Devon also announced its 2018 capital outlook, and plans to allocate $50 million to Barnett operations during 2018. Additionally, Devon provided an update regarding its intent to divest select portions of its Barnett Shale position, with a focus on Johnson County and surrounding areas. EnLink holds acreage dedication rights related to Devon's East Johnson County operations, with current midstream services provided in this area representing approximately seven percent of EnLink's total North Texas gross operating margin for both 2017 and 2018. Devon announced that it is currently in advanced negotiations with a preferred buyer, and a sale announcement is expected by March 31, 2018.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results Call Details\nThe General Partner and the Partnership will hold a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results on Wednesday, February 21, 2018, at 9 a.m. Central Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time).

The General Partner's distribution coverage is calculated by dividing cash available for distribution by distributions declared by the General Partner.\nGrowth capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our asset base, operating income or operating capacity over the long-term.\nMaintenance capital expenditures generally include capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of the assets and to extend their useful lives.\nSegment profit (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, impairments and (gain) loss on litigation settlement. Segment profit (loss) includes non-cash compensation expenses reflected in operating expenses. See \"Item 1. Financial Statements- Note 14 Segment Information\" in ENLK's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and, when available, \"Item 1. Financial Statements- Note 15 Segment Information\" in ENLK's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, for further information about segment profit (loss).\nThe Partnership and General Partner believe these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and previously reported results and a meaningful measure of the Partnership's and the General Partner's cash flow after satisfaction of the capital and related requirements of their respective operations. In addition, adjusted EBITDA achievement is a primary metric used in the Partnership's credit facility and short-term incentive program for compensating its employees.\nGross operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and cash available for distribution, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of the Partnership's and the General Partner's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods that are presented in this press release are included in the following tables. See ENLK's and ENLC's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
