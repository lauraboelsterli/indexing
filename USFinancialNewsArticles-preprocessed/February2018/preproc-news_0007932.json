    "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Two Kenyan television channels shut down by the government over their coverage of the opposition resumed partial broadcasting on Monday although a third channel remained off the air.\nNTV resumed broadcasting on pay-to-view channels, it announced on its Twitter feed, and KTN News resumed on free-to-air terrestrial channels. Citizen television, which was also shut down last week, remained off-air.\nThe three had been shut down after trying to live stream an event held by opposition leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday, where he symbolically inaugurated himself as president.\nReporting by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ",
