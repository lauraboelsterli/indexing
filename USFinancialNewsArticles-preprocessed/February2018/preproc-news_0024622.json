    "text": "HONOLULU, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barnwell Industries, Inc. (NYSE American:BRN) today reported a net loss of $1,017,000, $0.12 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net earnings of $1,641,000, $0.20 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nMr. Alexander Kinzler, Chief Executive Officer of Barnwell, commented, “The loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to last year’s net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was largely due to a $1,678,000 decrease in land investment profits as there were no lot sales this quarter by the Kukio Resort land development partnerships whereas last year one lot was sold for $20,975,000. This also resulted in a corresponding decrease in equity in earnings from affiliates, which decreased $2,479,000 to a loss of $153,000. This was partially offset in the current quarter by a $460,000 income tax benefit due to the enactment of changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws in December 2017 and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $546,000 due to decreases in professional fees and compensation costs. Additionally, while oil prices increased 15% to $46.13 per barrel, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016, natural gas prices decreased 46% to $1.25 per one thousand cubic feet, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\n“Barnwell ended the quarter with $18,590,000 in working capital which includes $12,764,000 in cash and cash equivalents and an additional $5,157,000 in certificates of deposit. Our second quarter has begun with the successful sale of our Red Earth oil properties, concluded in February 2018, for $1,360,000. Barnwell will record a gain on this sale in our second quarter ending March 31, 2018.”\nThe information contained in this press release contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
