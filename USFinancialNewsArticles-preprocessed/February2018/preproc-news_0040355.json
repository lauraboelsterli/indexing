    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s elite Hawks police unit has arrested eight people so far in its investigations into high-level influence-peddling centering around the Indian-born Gupta family, wealthy friends of ousted president Jacob Zuma, a statement said.\nTwo other suspects were still at large in South Africa, it said, while another three - two of whom were described as “of Indian nativity” - were outside the country. Police were asking for assistance in executing the arrest warrants, it added.\nZuma and the three Gupta brothers have denied any wrongdoing.\nReporting by Ed Cropley; Editing by James Macharia\n ",
