    "text": "Feb 27 (Reuters) - EBay Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Giosis Pte Ltd's Japanese business, including the Qoo10 online shopping platform, to expand its presence in Asia's second-largest economy.\nGiosis, which already counts eBay as an investor, operates seven localized online marketplaces in five countries including Japan and Singapore.\nU.S.-based eBay said it would relinquish its stake in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses.\nDevin Wenig, eBay's chief executive officer, said in an interview with Reuters the company expects significant growth in Japan, already the world's third-largest e-commerce market.\n\"There is this perfect convergence of growing wealth and technology adoption,\" Wenig said. \"We think there's a lot of runway.\"\nThe deal will bring eBay's technology and its worldwide sellers to Qoo10s base of 2 million shoppers, mirroring its play book in South Korea nearly a decade ago, Wenig said.\n\"We're going to bring the world's inventory into Japan,\" he said.\nWenig declined to disclose the terms of the deal, valued at close to $700 million according to a Bloomberg report.\nEBay has modified its platforms, including its namesake shopping service, to include grouped listings and a simpler payment process to lure shoppers amid stiff competition from Amazon.com Inc.\nShares in eBay are up about 14 percent this year.
