    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 4:03 PM / a few seconds ago Exclusive: EU antitrust regulators to fine NYK, Wilhelmsen, other car shipping firms - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to fine Nippon Yusen KK (NYK) ( 9101.T ) and several other Japanese shippers as well as Norwegian Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics ASA (WWL) ( WWLO.OL ) in the coming weeks for rigging bids for shipping cars, according to people with knowledge of the matter. \nThe EU sanctions come after a near six year long investigation which started with dawn raids by the European Commission in September 2012 in coordination with Japanese and U.S. antitrust authorities. \nNorwegian shipping company Wilh. Wilhelmsen ASA ( WWI.OL ) confirmed at the time the raids at its 50 percent-owned Wallenius Wilhelmsen unit and EUKOR, in which it has a 40 percent stake. \nOther shippers involved in the case include K Line (Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd) ( 9107.T ) and Mitsui O.S.K Lines ( 9104.T ), the people said, adding that the companies admitted wrongdoing in exchange for a 10 percent cut in their fines.
