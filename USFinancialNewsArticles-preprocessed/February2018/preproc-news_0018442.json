(NasdaqGS:LCUT) (“Lifetime”), a leading global provider of branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home, today announced that Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) and Glass Lewis, two leading independent proxy voting advisory firms, have recommended that Lifetime stockholders vote FOR the issuance of the shares of Lifetime common stock contemplated in connection with the consummation of Lifetime’s previously announced acquisition of Filament Brands (“Filament”). The proposed share issuance will be voted upon at Lifetime’s Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) scheduled to be held at Lifetime’s office at 1000 Stewart Avenue, Garden City, New York 11530, on February 28, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).\nIn ISS’ February 7, 2018 report where it concluded that Lifetime stockholders should vote FOR the contemplated share issuance, ISS concluded that “support for the transaction is warranted, due to the sound strategic rationale, potential synergies, and expected strong earnings per share accretion.”\nLike ISS, Glass Lewis, in reaching its conclusions in its February 8, 2018 report where it concluded that Lifetime stockholders should vote FOR the contemplated share issuance, noted the financial and strategic rationale for the transaction.\nCommenting on the ISS and Glass Lewis reports and the favorable recommendations, Jeffrey Siegel, Lifetime’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said “We are very pleased that ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended that our stockholders vote FOR the share issuance contemplated by our acquisition of Filament. We are also pleased that in making the recommendations, ISS and Glass Lewis recognized the transaction’s sound strategic and financial basis. By acquiring Filament, we believe we are creating a stronger company with increased scale, new sales opportunities and a world-class leadership team. We continue to make progress towards completing the transaction in the first half of 2018 and look forward to delivering the value that we believe is inherent in this transaction to all of our stockholders, customers and employees. We strongly urge all our stockholders to follow the recommendations of ISS and Glass Lewis and vote TODAY FOR the share issuance contemplated by our acquisition of Filament.”\nLifetime reminds stockholders that their vote is important regardless of how many Lifetime common shares they own.
