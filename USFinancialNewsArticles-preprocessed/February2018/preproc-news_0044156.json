    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CLR) (the Company) today announced fourth quarter and full-year 2017 operating and financial results. Continental reported net income of $841.9 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Of total net income, $128.2 million was from operations and $713.7 million was from federal tax reform. The Company reported full-year net income of $789.4 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, with $75.7 million from operations and $713.7 million from federal tax reform.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120327/DA76602LOGO\nThe Company's net income includes certain items typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates, the result of which is referred to as \"adjusted net income.\" In fourth quarter 2017, these typically excluded items in aggregate represented $688.2 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, of Continental's reported net income. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $153.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. For full-year 2017, these typically excluded items in aggregate represented $598.6 million, or $1.60 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for full-year 2017 was $190.8 million, or $0.51 per diluted share.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fourth quarter 2017 was $731.1 million, and for full-year 2017 it was $2.1 billion. EBITDAX for fourth quarter 2017 was $837.9 million, contributing to full-year 2017 EBITDAX of $2.4 billion. Definitions and reconciliations of adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share and EBITDAX to the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures can be found in the supporting tables at the conclusion of this press release.\n\"Continental's fourth quarter performance was a fitting completion to a standout year,\" said Harold Hamm, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"As we made clear in our 2018 guidance announcement, we expect even stronger performance in 2018 with both significant production growth and robust free cash flow.\"\nFull-Year 2017 Production Increases 12% Over 2016\nFourth quarter 2017 net production totaled 26.4 million Boe, or 286,985 Boe per day, up 18% from third quarter 2017, with oil production up 20% to 168,066 barrels of oil (Bo) per day. Compared to fourth quarter 2016, Continental increased production 37%, with oil production up 44%.\nTotal net production for fourth quarter 2017 included 168,066 Bo per day (59% of production) and 713.5 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas per day (41% of production). Full-year 2017 production averaged 242,637 Boe per day.\nFirst quarter 2018 production is estimated to be between 285,000 and 290,000 Boe per day.\nThe following table provides the Company's average daily production by region for the periods presented.\n4Q\n3Q\n4Q\nFY\nFY\nBoe per day\n2017\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNorth Region:\nNorth Dakota Bakken\n158,640\n129,582\n96,035\n125,577\n109,686\nMontana Bakken\n6,958\n7,269\n8,489\n7,415\n9,514\nRed River Units\n9,497\n9,536\n10,140\n9,748\n10,745\nOther\n468\n449\n4,109\n434\n1,665\nSouth Region:\nSCOOP\n62,242\n57,283\n63,490\n60,693\n65,062\nSTACK\n47,914\n35,619\n24,426\n36,220\n16,983\nArkoma (1)\n11\n1,722\n1,929\n1,315\n1,915\nOther\n1,255\n1,328\n1,243\n1,235\n1,342\nTotal\n286,985\n242,788\n209,861\n242,637\n216,912\n(1) Producing properties comprising approximately 1,700 Boe per day of the Company's Arkoma production were sold in September 2017.\nBakken Continues to Deliver Record Results\nContinental's Bakken net production reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter averaging 165,598 Boe per day, up 58% over the fourth quarter 2016. The Company completed 97 gross (37 net) operated and non-operated Bakken wells with first production during fourth quarter 2017. Thirty-nine of the fourth quarter wells were operated by the Company with an average 24-hour IP of 2,180 Boe per day. The Company completed a total 350 gross (134 net) operated and non-operated Bakken wells with first production for full-year 2017. The Company plans to keep an average of six operated drilling rigs in the play during 2018.\nFive of the fourth quarter operated wells produced the highest 30-day rates ever recorded from the Company's operated Bakken wells, averaging 2,230 Boe per day. This included the Monroe 6-2H that produced at an average 30-day rate of 2,869 Boe, which was the best 30-day rate ever achieved by the Company from a Bakken well. All of the wells were completed using the Company's optimized completion designs with various combinations of larger proppant loads, tighter stage spacing and diverter technology, along with accelerated flow backs and high-capacity lift.\nFrom late 2016 through fourth quarter 2017, the Company has brought on 134 optimized Bakken wells in Dunn, McKenzie, Mountrail and Williams counties. Average production per well is slightly outperforming the Company's updated 1,100 MBoe Bakken type curve announced in August 2017. The type curve delivers a 125% rate of return at $60 per barrel WTI (WTI) and $3.00 per Mcf Henry Hub (HH). This more than doubles the rate of return expected from the Company's previous type curve.\n\"Continental's returns from the Bakken compete head to head with the best oil plays in the U.S. today, driven by our optimized completions, lower production expense and the $4.50 per Bo improvement in oil differentials since 2015,\" said Jack Stark, President. \"On top of that, Bakken production is 80% crude oil.\"\nThe Company exited 2017 with a drilled-well inventory of 165 gross operated wells in the Bakken, including 52 gross operated wells with stimulation complete or in progress, but which did not have first sales in 2017.\nSTACK: Density Tests Defining Unit Development\nContinental's STACK net production averaged 47,914 Boe per day in fourth quarter 2017, a 96% increase over fourth quarter 2016. A total of 63 gross (23 net) operated and non-operated STACK wells with first production were completed during the quarter, and 158 gross (52 net) operated and non-operated wells were completed with first production for the full year. The Company plans to keep an average of eight operated drilling rigs in the play during 2018, with four to six targeting the Woodford and Meramec formations as part of the joint development agreement with SK E&S.\nThe Company is introducing its preliminary economic model for unit development in the STACK Meramec over-pressured oil window. The unit economic model is based on the results of six full-unit density tests the Company has completed with three-to-five wells per zone. Initial results indicate that four wells per zone on average will deliver the maximum PV-10 from a single Meramec reservoir in a unit. The Company's unit economic model includes a total of eight wells with four wells in two Meramec reservoirs given the Company expects to target two Meramec reservoirs on average underlying its acreage in the over-pressured oil window. Combined these eight wells are projected to recover an estimated 9.6 million Boe (MMBoe) and deliver a PV-10 of approximately $87 million with a rate of return of 96%, assuming a completed well cost of $9.5 million for a 9,800-foot lateral well at $60 WTI and $3 HH. In addition, up to four more wells can be expected to be completed in the underlying Woodford formation.\nThe unit economic model includes results from the Verona and Gillilan density tests that were completed during the fourth quarter. These two units adjoin each other and were strategically selected to compare eight and 10 well density development. The Verona unit included four wells in the Upper and four wells in the Lower Meramec. The eight wells had a combined unit 24-hour IP of 18,205 Boe per day, averaging 2,281 Boe per day per well, and 68% of the production was crude oil. Results for the Verona were in-line with Company expectations. The Gillilan unit included five wells in the Upper and five wells in the Lower Meramec. The 10 wells had a combined unit 24-hour IP of 11,024 Boe per day, averaging 1,102 Boe per day per well, and 64% of the production was crude oil. Early performance from the Gillilan wells indicates the unit was over-drilled with ten wells and further supports the Company's eight-well model.\nDuring the fourth quarter the Company also completed its first density test in the STACK Meramec over-pressured condensate window. The Angus Trust density test involved only half of the unit with three wells drilled in the Upper Meramec and three wells drilled in the Lower Meramec. This is the tightest well spacing Continental has tested to date, which is the equivalent of six wells per zone or 12 wells in the unit. The half-unit 24-hour IP for the Angus Trust test was 15,955 Boe per day and 39% of the production was crude oil. Average IP per well was 2,659 Boe per day. Early performance indicates the maximum PV-10 from a unit can be achieved with fewer than 12 Meramec wells per unit in the over-pressured condensate window. To further evaluate the proper well density, the Company has begun drilling a second density test at the Simba unit located one mile west of the Angus Trust unit. The Simba will be a six-well, full-unit test with three wells in Upper and three wells in the Lower Meramec.\nSCOOP\nIn fourth quarter 2017, SCOOP net production averaged 62,242 Boe per day (23% oil), or 22% of the Company's total production in fourth quarter. A total of 12 gross (1 net) operated and non-operated SCOOP wells were completed with first production during the quarter, and 71 gross (16 net) operated and non-operated wells were completed with first production for the full year. In 2018, the Company plans to average seven operated rigs in the play.\nSCOOP Springer: Beginning Full-Field Development; Type Curve EUR Uplifted 28% for Unit Well\nContinental has concluded its initial Springer density testing program and is beginning full-field development with five rigs dedicated to the Springer in 2018. The Company has completed three density pilots that tested four, five and six well configurations in the Springer reservoir. Results indicate that on average, four wells should deliver the maximum PV-10 from the Springer reservoir on a unit basis. A Springer unit well is projected to recover 1,200 MBoe at a completed well cost of $9.5 million for a 7,500-foot lateral. This is a 28% uplift in EUR from the Company's legacy 940 MBoe type curve for a 4,500-foot standalone well. The Company's unit economic model projects that a four-well Springer unit will produce a combined 4.8 MMBoe over the life of the wells and generate a PV-10 of approximately $68 million and a rate of return of 175% assuming $60 WTI and $3 HH. This adds approximately $44 million to the PV-10 of a Springer unit compared to a standalone well at $60 WTI and $3 HH.\n\"Longer laterals and optimized completions in the Springer have doubled our type curve rate of return with $4.0 million incremental first-year gross cash flow per well,\" said Gary Gould, SVP of Production and Resource Development. \"Approximately 20% of Continental's operated drilling and completion capital budget will be focused on the Springer oil play in 2018.\"\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company completed its third density pilot with the completion of the six-well Celesta density unit. The six wells flowed at a combined peak 24-hour rate of 6,014 Boe (81% oil). The five new wells produced at an average 24-hour peak production rate of 939 Boe per day. The average lateral length was 9,400 feet for the six wells. Early performance of the Celesta unit wells indicates the maximum PV-10 from a unit can be achieved with fewer than six wells and supports the Company's four-well economic model for a Springer unit.\n\"We are eager to begin development of this prolific oil reservoir,\" said Mr. Stark. \"Timing is right to take advantage of improved crude prices and our optimized completion technology.\"\nSCOOP Woodford Oil Type Curve Increased Again\nThe Company announced it has increased the EUR for two-mile lateral wells drilled in the SCOOP Woodford oil window by approximately 13% to 1,520 MBoe per well, with 60% of production being crude oil. The increase in EUR was based on the results of 32 optimized completions conducted over the past several years in the SCOOP Woodford oil window and assumes an average 9,800-foot lateral well. At a targeted completed well cost of $12.7 million per well, this yields a 55% rate of return at $60 WTI and $3.00 HH.\nThe Company recently completed the Pyle 1-36-25XH in the SCOOP Woodford oil window. The Pyle flowed at a 24-hour IP of 1,812 Boe with 81% of the production being crude oil from a 9,800-foot lateral.\n2017 Proved Reserves: Standardized Measure and PV-10 (non-GAAP) Up 90% and 78%, respectively, over Year-End 2016\nThe Company announced proved reserves of 1.33 billion Boe at December 31, 2017, a 4% increase compared with year-end 2016 proved reserves. The 2017 average SEC oil price was $51.34 per barrel, and the 2017 average SEC natural gas price was $2.98 per MMBtu.\nAt December 31, 2017, Continental had a Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows of $10.47 billion. Continental's 2017 proved reserves had a PV-10 of $11.83 billion, up 78% year-over-year. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial metric, because it does not include the effects of discounted income taxes on future net revenues of approximately $1.36 billion. Continental and others in the crude oil and natural gas industry use PV-10 to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves without regard to specific income tax characteristics.\nYear-end 2017 proved reserves were 48% crude oil, 89% operated by the Company, and approximately 45% were classified as proved developed producing (PDP).\nThe Bakken accounted for 635.5 MMBoe, or 48% of Continental's year-end 2017 proved reserves. The SCOOP Woodford and SCOOP Springer plays accounted for 491.8 MMBoe, or 37% of Continental's year-end 2017 proved reserves. The STACK accounted for 167.4 MMBoe, or 13% of Continental's year-end 2017 proved reserves.\nThe Company had a total of 1,783 gross (976 net) proved undeveloped (PUD) locations at year-end 2017, with the Bakken accounting for 1,252 gross (656 net) PUD locations. SCOOP accounted for an additional 336 gross (230 net) PUD locations, while STACK accounted for 195 gross (90 net) PUD locations at year-end 2017.\nFinancial Update: 4Q 2017 Annualized Net-Debt-to-EBITDAX Ratio below 1.9x\n\"We were very pleased to finish 2017 in line or better than our guidance,\" said John Hart, Chief Financial Officer. \"Fourth quarter 2017 was excellent from an operations standpoint. Production expense per Boe was down 17% from third quarter 2017, and all other cash operating costs were within budget. This speaks directly to the performance of our operating teams and the premier quality of our assets.\n\"By year end, long-term debt was $6.35 billion, and our fourth quarter annualized net-debt-to-EBITDAX ratio was 1.88x. We fully expect this to continue to trend down through 2018 as we pay down debt with excess cash flow, sell non-core assets, grow production and reap the benefit of higher commodity prices.\"\nNet debt and EBITDAX are non-GAAP measures. Definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure are provided subsequently under the header \" .\"\nIn fourth quarter 2017, Continental's average realized sales price excluding the effects of derivative positions was $51.16 per barrel of oil and $3.30 per Mcf of gas, or $38.27 per Boe. Based on realizations without the effect of derivatives, the Company's fourth quarter 2017 oil differential was $4.23 per barrel below the NYMEX daily average for the period. The realized wellhead natural gas price for the quarter was on average $0.37 per Mcf above the average NYMEX Henry Hub benchmark price.\nThe corporate oil differential has improved by $2.86 per Bo from first quarter 2017, and the corporate gas differential has improved by $0.66 per Mcf. These trends reflect improved takeaway capacity in both the Bakken and Oklahoma as well as improving natural gas liquids pricing. The Company is expecting crude oil differentials to continue to improve in 2018 due to a recent renegotiation of an existing transportation contract at more favorable rates and terms, which should impact the Company's cash flow growth considerably.\nProduction expense per Boe was $3.17 for fourth quarter 2017, down a remarkable 17% compared with $3.82 per Boe for third quarter 2017. This improvement was primarily driven by reduced water handling and disposal costs from increased recycling activities in Oklahoma, reduced workover activity and the increase in production quarter over quarter. Other select operating costs and expenses for fourth quarter 2017 included production taxes of 7.3% of oil and natural gas sales; DD&A of $17.93 per Boe; and total G&A of $2.30 per Boe.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Continental's balance sheet included $43.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $188 million of borrowings against the Company's revolving credit facility. At year-end 2017 Continental's long-term debt was $6.35 billion, down $261 million from September 30, 2017. As of January 31, 2018 Continental's long-term debt was down another $95 million to $6.26 billion.\nContinental's 2018 guidance remains as announced on February 15, 2018 and can be found at the conclusion of this press release.\nThe following table provides the Company's production results, average sales prices, per-unit operating costs, results of operations and certain non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented. Average sales prices exclude any effect of derivative transactions. Per-unit expenses have been calculated using sales volumes.\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAverage daily production:\nCrude oil (Bbl per day)\n168,066\n116,486\n138,455\n128,005\nNatural gas (Mcf per day)\n713,518\n560,251\n625,093\n533,442\nCrude oil equivalents (Boe per day)\n286,985\n209,861\n242,637\n216,912\nAverage sales prices, excluding effect from derivatives:\nCrude oil ($/Bbl)\n$51.16\n$42.23\n$45.70\n$35.51\nNatural gas ($/Mcf)\n$3.30\n$2.70\n$2.93\n$1.87\nCrude oil equivalents ($/Boe)\n$38.27\n$30.64\n$33.65\n$25.55\nProduction expenses ($/Boe)\n$3.17\n$3.60\n$3.66\n$3.65\nProduction taxes (% of oil and gas revenues)\n7.3%\n6.4%\n7.0%\n7.0%\nDD&A ($/Boe)\n$17.93\n$20.11\n$18.89\n$21.54\nTotal general and administrative expenses ($/Boe) (1)\n$2.30\n$2.93\n$2.16\n$2.14\nNet income (loss) (in thousands) (2)\n$841,914\n$27,670\n$789,447\n($399,679)\nDiluted net income (loss) per share (2)\n$2.25\n$0.07\n$2.11\n($1.08)\nAdjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) (in thousands) (3)\n$153,660\n($27,416)\n$190,803\n($326,648)\nAdjusted diluted net income (loss) per share (non-GAAP) (3)\n$0.41\n($0.07)\n$0.51\n($0.88)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$731,125\n$262,031\n$2,079,106\n$1,125,919\nEBITDAX (non-GAAP) (in thousands) (3)\n$837,887\n$652,382\n$2,363,617\n$1,881,889\n(1) Total general and administrative expense is comprised of cash general and administrative expense and non-cash equity compensation expense.

Non-cash equity compensation expense per Boe was $0.50, $0.72, $0.52, and $0.61 for 4Q 2017, 4Q 2016, FY 2017 and FY 2016, respectively.\n(2) In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which among other things reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company remeasured its deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced tax rate, which resulted in a one-time increase in net income of approximately $713.7 million ($1.91 per diluted share) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(3) Adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted net income (loss) per share, and EBITDAX represent non-GAAP financial measures.

PV-10 generally differs from Standardized Measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. At December 31, 2017, the Company's PV-10 totaled approximately $11.83 billion. The Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows was approximately $10.47 billion at December 31, 2017, representing a $1.36 billion difference from PV-10 due to the effect of deducting estimated future income taxes in arriving at the Standardized Measure. The Company believes the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific income tax characteristics of such entities and is a useful measure of evaluating the relative monetary significance of crude oil and natural gas properties. Investors may utilize PV-10 as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of the Company's proved reserves to other companies. PV-10 should not be considered as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, the Standardized Measure as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of the Company's crude oil and natural gas properties.\nNet debt\nNet debt is a non-GAAP measure. We define net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents as determined under U.S. GAAP. Management uses net debt to determine the Company's outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. We believe this metric is useful to analysts and investors in determining the Company's leverage position since the Company has the ability to, and may decide to, use a portion of its cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt. At December 31, 2017, the Company's net debt amounted to $6.31 billion, representing total debt of $6.35 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $0.04 billion.\nEBITDAX\nWe use a variety of financial and operational measures to assess our performance. Among these measures is EBITDAX. We define EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, property impairments, exploration expenses, non-cash gains and losses resulting from the requirements of accounting for derivatives, non-cash equity compensation expense, and losses on extinguishment of debt. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or operating cash flows as determined by U.S. GAAP.\nManagement believes EBITDAX is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Further, we believe EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our ability to meet future debt service requirements, if any. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) and operating cash flows in arriving at EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired.\nEBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or operating cash flows as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an indicator of a company's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. Our computations of EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to EBITDAX for the periods presented.\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\nIn thousands\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n$\n841,914\n$\n27,670\n$\n789,447\n$\n(399,679)\nInterest expense\n75,823\n75,613\n294,495\n320,562\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n(608,317)\n26,478\n(633,380)\n(232,775)\nDepreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion\n476,732\n388,321\n1,674,901\n1,708,744\nProperty impairments\n27,552\n34,564\n237,370\n237,292\nExploration expenses\n2,802\n8,246\n12,393\n16,972\nImpact from derivative instruments:\nTotal (gain) loss on derivatives, net\n(8,417)\n45,331\n(90,432)\n67,099\nTotal cash received on derivatives, net\n15,867\n6,281\n32,401\n89,522\nNon-cash (gain) loss on derivatives, net\n7,450\n51,612\n(58,031)\n156,621\nNon-cash equity compensation\n13,377\n13,823\n45,868\n48,097\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n554\n26,055\n554\n26,055\nEBITDAX (non-GAAP)\n$\n837,887\n$\n652,382\n$\n2,363,617\n$\n1,881,889\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDAX for the periods presented.\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\nIn thousands\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n731,125\n$\n262,031\n$\n2,079,106\n$\n1,125,919\nCurrent income tax benefit\n(7,781)\n(22,941)\n(7,781)\n(22,939)\nInterest expense\n75,823\n75,613\n294,495\n320,562\nExploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs\n2,783\n3,613\n12,217\n12,106\nLitigation settlement\n(59,600)\n-\n(59,600)\n-\nGain on sale of assets, net\n54,420\n201,315\n55,124\n304,489\nTax deficiency from stock-based compensation\n-\n(368)\n-\n(9,828)\nOther, net\n723\n(1,613)\n(8,529)\n(10,636)\nChanges in assets and liabilities\n40,394\n134,732\n(1,415)\n162,216\nEBITDAX (non-GAAP)\n$\n837,887\n$\n652,382\n$\n2,363,617\n$\n1,881,889\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share\nOur presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the effect of certain items are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under U.S. GAAP without regard to non-cash gains and losses on derivative instruments, property impairments, losses on certain litigation settlements, gains and losses on asset sales, losses on extinguishment of debt and the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation. Management believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and investors for analysis of our operating results. In addition, management believes these measures are used by analysts and others in valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas industry to allow for analysis without regard to an entity's specific derivative portfolio, impairment methodologies, and property dispositions. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables reconcile earnings and diluted earnings per share as determined under U.S. GAAP to adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.\nThree months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nIn thousands, except per share data\n$\nDiluted EPS\n$\nDiluted EPS\nNet income (GAAP)\n$841,914\n$ 2.25\n$ 27,670\n$ 0.07\nAdjustments:\nNon-cash loss on derivatives\n7,450\n51,612\nProperty impairments\n27,552\n34,564\nLitigation settlement\n59,600\n-\nGain on sale of assets\n(54,420)\n(201,315)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n554\n26,055\nTotal tax effect of adjustments (1)\n(15,335)\n33,998\nTax benefit from US tax reform legislation\n(713,655)\n-\nTotal adjustments, net of tax\n(688,254)\n(1.84)\n(55,086)\n(0.14)\nAdjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP)\n$153,660\n$ 0.41\n$ (27,416)\n$ (0.07)\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n373,764\n370,539\nAdjusted diluted net income (loss) per share (non-GAAP)\n$ 0.41\n$ (0.07)\nYear ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nIn thousands, except per share data\n$\nDiluted EPS\n$\nDiluted EPS\nNet income (loss) (GAAP)\n$789,447\n$ 2.11\n$(399,679)\n$ (1.08)\nAdjustments:\nNon-cash (gain) loss on derivatives\n(58,031)\n156,621\nProperty impairments\n237,370\n237,292\nLitigation settlement\n59,600\n-\nGain on sale of assets\n(55,124)\n(304,489)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n554\n26,055\nTotal tax effect of adjustments (1)\n(69,358)\n(42,448)\nTax benefit from US tax reform legislation\n(713,655)\n-\nTotal adjustments, net of tax\n(598,644)\n(1.60)\n73,031\n0.20\nAdjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP)\n$190,803\n$ 0.51\n$(326,648)\n$ (0.88)\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n373,768\n370,380\nAdjusted diluted net income (loss) per share (non-GAAP)\n$ 0.51\n$ (0.88)\n(1) Computed by applying a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 38% in effect for 2017 and 2016 to the pre-tax amount of adjustments associated with our operations in the United States other than the tax benefit adjustment related to US tax reform legislation.\nCash general and administrative expenses per Boe\nOur presentation of cash general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses per Boe is a non-GAAP measure. We define cash G&A per Boe as total G&A determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP less non-cash equity compensation expenses, expressed on a per-Boe basis. We report and provide guidance on cash G&A per Boe because we believe this measure is commonly used by management, analysts and investors as an indicator of cost management and operating efficiency on a comparable basis from period to period. In addition, management believes cash G&A per Boe is used by analysts and others in valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas industry to allow for analysis of G&A spend without regard to stock-based compensation programs which can vary substantially from company to company. Cash G&A per Boe should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, total G&A per Boe as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFree cash flow\nOur presentation of free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operations before changes in working capital items less capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and divestitures. Free cash flow is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash flows as determined by U.S. GAAP. Management believes that these measures are useful to management and investors as a measure of a company's ability to internally fund its capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. These measures eliminate the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be indicative of the Company's performance from period to period. From time to time the Company provides forward-looking free cash flow estimates; however, the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure because management cannot reliably quantify certain of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measure. The reconciling items in future periods could be significant.\nContinental Resources, Inc.\n2018 Guidance\nAs of February 21, 2018\n2018\nFull-year average production\n285,000 to 300,000 Boe per day\nExit-rate average production\n305,000 to 315,000 Boe per day\nCapital expenditures (non-acquisition)\n$2.3 billion\nOperating Expenses:\nProduction expense per Boe\n$3.00 to $3.50\nProduction tax (% of oil & gas revenue)\n7.6% to 8.0%\nCash G&A expense per Boe (1)\n$1.25 to $1.75\nNon-cash equity compensation per Boe\n$0.45 to $0.55\nDD&A per Boe\n$17.00 to $19.00\nAverage Price Differentials:\nNYMEX WTI crude oil (per barrel of oil)\n($3.50) to ($4.50)\nHenry Hub natural gas (per Mcf)\n$0.00 to +$0.50\n(1) Cash G&A is a non-GAAP measure and excludes the range of values shown for non-cash equity compensation per Boe in the item appearing immediately below. Guidance for total G&A (cash and non-cash) is an expected range of $1.70 to $2.30 per Boe.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/continental-resources-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300602293.html\nSOURCE Continental Resources",
