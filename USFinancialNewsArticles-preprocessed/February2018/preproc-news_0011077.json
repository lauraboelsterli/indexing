The index was trading at its lowest level since September. \n* The TSX posted no new 52-week highs and 27 new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 4 new 52-week highs and 93 new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Canopy Growth Co, which rose 6.8 percent, while the largest decliner was Prometic Lfe Scn, down 5.9 percent. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, up 7.3 percent to $9.12; Aphria Inc , up 5.0 percent to $14.58 and Canopy Growth Co , up 6.8 percent to $25.75. \n* Among industrial stocks, Bombardier Inc slipped 1.7 percent to C$3.23. \n* In the financial sector, Toronto Dominion Bank lost 1.3 percent to C$72.97, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce gave back 1.4 percent to C$117.58.
