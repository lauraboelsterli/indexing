    "text": "SAN DIEGO & SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Shareholder rights law firm Robbins Arroyo LLP announces that purchasers of Quantum Corporation (NYSE: QTM) have filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between May 10, 2016 and February 7, 2018. Quantum provides scale-out storage, archive, and data protection solutions for small businesses and multi-national enterprises in the Americas, Europe, and the Asia Pacific.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog:\nwww.robbinsarroyo.com/quantum-corporation\nQuantum Accused of Improperly Recognizing Revenue\nAccording to the complaint, Quantum repeatedly reported positive financial results in its public filings, noting that the company was \"focused on building on our momentum to drive continued growth, profitability and cash flow.\" Quantum continued to deliver purported solid financial results until August 9, 2017, when the company reported results that fell short of expectations. Nonetheless, Quantum assured investors that it would take aggressive action to improve cost structure and generate consistent growth and profitability. According to the complaint, however, the company's financial problems were much more widespread than Quantum had led investors to believe. On February 8, 2018, Quantum announced that it was postponing the release of its fiscal third quarter 2018 results and its earnings conference call, confessing that the company had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its accounting practices and internal controls related to revenue recognition for transactions beginning April 1, 2016. On this news, Quantum's stock fell nearly 30% to close at $3.90 per share on February 8, 2018.\nQuantum Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
