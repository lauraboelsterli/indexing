    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 7:22 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago Figure skating: Uno 'relaxed' at being in Hanyu's shadow Elaine Lies 3 Min Read \nGANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Far from resenting the overwhelming fame of Olympic figure skating champion Yuzuru Hanyu, Japan’s Shoma Uno finds it relaxing to be attending his first Winter Games in his compatriot’s shadow. \nKnown as a phenomenal jumper who in 2016 became the first to successfully land a quadruple flip in competition, the 20-year-old Uno is hot on the heels of Hanyu in an increasing number of podium finishes and took silver at last year’s Grand Prix Final. \nCompared to Hanyu, who is followed around the world by passionate fans who scream “Yuzu” and toss dozens of stuffed animals onto the ice after his performances, Uno’s share of fan adulation is distinctly lower. \nBut Uno, known to some as “Pocket Rocket” for his diminutive stature and jumping ability, does not mind at all. \n“It allows me to really relax,” he told reporters with a grin after a practice session at the coastal city of Gangneung’s rink on Wednesday. \n“Because I‘m in his shadow, I‘m not under nearly as much pressure. But I hope to become the kind of skater who can stand up under just as much (as he does).” \nSkating to the “Winter” section of Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons”, Uno landed several clean jumps but broke off practice several times to consult with his coach, although he said this did not signal any problems.
