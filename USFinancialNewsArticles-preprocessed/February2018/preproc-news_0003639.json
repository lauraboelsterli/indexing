    "text": "ORADELL, N.J., Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bob Corley, Chairman of the Board of Directors, today announced that the Trustees of Christian Brothers (NJ) Institute have appointed Brian Mahoney Ed.D. as the 4th President of Bergen Catholic High School . Dr. Mahoney's leadership appointment commences July 1, 2018.\nDr. Mahoney will succeed Brother Brian M. Walsh C.F.C., who leaves Bergen Catholic in July to assume the role of Co-Director of the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers Ofﬁce of Education Services in New Rochelle, N.Y., focusing on Catholic identity in the 21st century for Edmund Rice Christian Brother schools in North America.\nDr. Mahoney holds a Bachelor of Arts in History from Siena College and earned a Master's Degree and Doctorate in Educational Leadership and Administration from Fordham University. He has been in education for over 20 years, most recently as Head of School at EF Academy, Thornwood, N.Y., which he has led since 2011. EF Academy is a boarding and day school community with a current enrollment of approximately 780 students from 40 countries. During Dr. Mahoney's tenure, enrollment grew over 200%, the school was successfully relocated to a 100-acre campus, several buildings were renovated, and a new 56,000 square foot multi-use building was constructed. He has also served as a trustee, and most recently president of the Mahopac N.Y. Central School District Board of Education.\nHe was selected after a national search led by Wickenden Associates, Princeton, New Jersey, a global leader amongst Head of School Search Firms. The Search Committee was led by Brian McAuliffe, BC '70; its 10-member committee included prominent alumni, board members, and members of the administration and faculty.\nIn announcing Dr. Mahoney's appointment, Chairman Corley noted challenges the Board of Directors faced , \"Dr. Mahoney will be the first laymen to lead Bergen Catholic High School, succeeding 12 Edmund Rice Christian Brothers, who founded and led Bergen Catholic to prominence since opening in 1955. We are confident that Dr. Mahoney, with his knowledge and practice of our Catholic Faith and his educational leadership skills, will continue to foster the Catholic identity and the Essential Elements of an Edmund Rice Christian Brother Education and build on Bergen Catholic's history of excellence.\"\nCommenting on Dr. Mahoney's appointment, and offering the perspective of an Edmund Rice Christian Brother, is sitting President of Bergen Catholic , Brother Brian M. Walsh, C.F.C., \"Since 2000, when the Essential Elements of an Edmund Rice Christian Brother Education were first written, by an assembly of over 100 Brothers and Lay Faculty from over 20 schools, the Catholic character and Christian Brother ethos have increased as the number of Christian Brothers on the staffs has decreased. From my many interactions with Dr. Mahoney I know that that will continue here at Bergen Catholic.\"\nJim Wickenden, Founder of Search Firm Wickenden Associates, and consulting leader of Bergen Catholic 's Presidential Search, noted the very high quality of candidates that applied for the Bergen position. \" Bergen Catholic 's reputation extends well beyond the N.Y. Metropolitan area. Amongst the many Catholic School searches we have led, the quality of candidates applying here was as strong or stronger than any we have been involved with.\"\nIn preparing and executing the Search, Mr. McAuliffe noted ''the committee was well aware that the competitive environment for Catholic high schools has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. We positioned the search to identify candidates who understood the competitive nature of the educational environment, the competitive strengths that Catholic Schools can offer, and successful experience competing. We felt Dr. Mahoney excelled in each of these criteria.\"\nDr. Mahoney, 43, is married to Amy Sutton Mahoney. Amy is a graduate of the Academy of the Holy Angels '94, Demarest, New Jersey and Siena College. Amy is currently an English teacher at Mahopac High School The Mahoney's have three children; two boys and a girl. Brendan 12, Patrick 10, and Cameron 6.\nBergen Catholic is a private, four-year, college-preparatory high school for young men located at 1040 Oradell Avenue in Oradell, New Jersey, a small suburban community approximately 10 miles from New York City. It is founded and staffed by the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The school is currently celebrating its 63rd year of operation. Its student body numbers approximately 750 young men from over 130 towns in the surrounding area.
