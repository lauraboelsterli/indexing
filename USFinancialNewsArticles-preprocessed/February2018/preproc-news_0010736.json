    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fusion (NASDAQ:FSNN), a leading provider of cloud services, announced today the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 12,937,500 shares of its common stock, including 1,687,500 shares for which the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, at a price to the public of $3.20 per share for gross proceeds of $41,400,000. The net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before estimated expenses of the offering payable by Fusion, were $38,709,000.\nPursuant to Fusion’s Agreement and Plan of Merger with Birch Communications Holdings, Inc., as amended, the shares sold in the offering will not be counted as issued and outstanding for purposes of calculating the number of shares of Fusion common stock to be issued as consideration to the Birch shareholders in connection with the closing of the merger. As a result, on a post-closing basis, the dilutive effect of this offering will be shared pro rata by current Fusion and Birch shareholders with current Fusion shareholders bearing approximately 25% of the dilution and current Birch shareholders bearing approximately 75% of the dilution from the offering.\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC acted as the sole book-running manager and B. Riley FBR, Inc. acted as a co-manager for the offering.\nThe offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222127) that was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 17, 2018. A final prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus relating to the offering were filed on February 1, 2018 and may be obtained by visiting the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by contacting Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, 222 South Ninth Street, Suite 350, Minneapolis, MN 55402, by telephone at 612-334-6300 or by email at prospectus@chlm.com ; or B.
