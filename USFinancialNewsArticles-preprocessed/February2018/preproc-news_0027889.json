    "text": "DUBLIN, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Macola Software announced today that CRN ® , a brand of The Channel Company , has named Lisa Wise, director of alliances and channel development, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nAs Macola’s top channel executive, Wise leads the channel team in the development of the Macola partner program strategy, including the recruitment and enablement of new channel partners. Under Wise’s direction, Macola launched its Unity 2.0 Partner Program in 2017, adding new features and benefits to its leading solution provider partner program, which equips partners with the tools they need to drive net new sales for Macola 10 – the company’s flagship ERP product. By working alongside Macola’s Managing Director, Alison Forsythe, Wise was able to help Macola continuously meet partner needs by strategically enhancing a program that incorporated all the necessary facets of training consultants – including mentoring, shadowing and hands-on training. Her commitment to the success of Macola’s channel program and participating partners is proven by the company’s continued channel momentum, which includes increasing its partner base by 20 percent in 2017.\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, executive chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\n“It’s an honor to be named to CRN’s prestigious list of Channel Chiefs for the second year in a row, and I am proud to represent Macola alongside the other notable honorees,” said Wise. “At Macola, our mission is first and foremost to provide the best service, support and technology to our incredible partners so they can offer that same world-class service to their own customers. Being recognized for that mission by a company like CRN is just an added bonus, and I look forward to continuing Macola’s channel momentum in the year ahead.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nFollow The Channel Company: Twitter , LinkedIn and Facebook\nTweet This:\n@TheChannelCo names @MacolaSoftware's Lisa Wise to @CRN 2018 Channel Chiefs list #CRNChannelChiefs www.crn.com/channelchiefs\nAbout Macola Software\nMacola Software, an ECi Software Solutions company, is a provider of business solutions for small to medium-sized manufacturing and distribution companies.\nMacola empowers today’s modern enterprises to plan, manage, analyze and control their businesses by providing innovative software applications, industry-experienced solutions consultants, best-of-breed technology plug-ins and outstanding client support.
