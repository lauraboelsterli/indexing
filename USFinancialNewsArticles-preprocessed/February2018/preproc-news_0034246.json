(“Solar”), a company in Singapore, to assist Solar to recover a large shipment of tin from sunken ships that are believed to be in the waters between Indonesia, Malaysia, and South China Sea.

The initial recovery project is expected to take approximately three weeks at sea.\nMr. Tidwell is planning to leave for Singapore in the next couple of weeks to get things underway.\nWatch Mr. Tidwell go down 17,500 feet with National Geographic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G--aX0IuLpA\nNo assurances can be given that the sunken ship will be found and, if found, will have the amount of recoverable tin and other cargo that the parties to the contract are seeking.\nInnocap, Inc.’s Salvage Projects: http:// info@innocap-inc.com /\nCertain information in this press release contains statements that are forward-looking in nature and involve certain significant risks and uncertainties.
