    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 9:12 PM / Updated an hour ago Leicester reject Manchester City bid for Mahrez - report Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Manchester City failed in an audacious transfer deadline day move for Leicester City midfielder Riyadh Mahrez, British media reported on Wednesday. \nThe Leicester Mercury newspaper said the Foxes had turned down City’s final bid of 65 million pounds plus an unnamed player for Mahrez, a deal that would have broken the Manchester club’s transfer record. \nThe paper said the bid was below Leicester’s valuation of the 26-year-old Algerian who reportedly put in a transfer request this week. He missed training on Tuesday and was not included in Leicester’s squad for Wednesday’s Premier League game at Everton. \nIt was the second disappointment for Mahrez on transfer deadline day. In August he was widely reported to be at an airport ready to fly to Europe if any clubs came in for him. Reporting by Neil Robinson, editing by Ed Osmond",
