    "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (NYSE: SKT) today reported financial and operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided initial earnings guidance for 2018.\nFinancial Results and Key Highlights\nFor the Fourth Quarter\nNet income available to common shareholders increased 32% to $0.33 per share, or $31.2 million, compared to $0.25 per share, or $23.8 million, for the prior year period Funds from operations (\"FFO\") available to common shareholders increased 11% to $0.68 per share, or $67.5 million, compared to $0.61 per share, or $60.9 million, for the prior year period Adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") available to common shareholders, which excludes certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance, increased 8% to $0.66 per share, or $65.6 million, for the 2017 period compared to $0.61 per share, or $60.9 million, for the 2016 period.\nFor the Year\nRaised regular quarterly common share cash dividend in April by 5.4% on an annualized basis to $1.37 per share, marking the 24th consecutive year of increased dividends Results for the 2017 period include a $35.6 million charge, or $0.36 per share, related to the redemption of certain senior notes due 2020, a $9.0 million charge, or $0.09 per share, related to the impairment of certain non-core assets, and a gain on the sale of a non-core outlet center of $6.9 million, or $0.07 per share. Results for the 2016 period include gains on the sale of an outlet center and the acquisition of interests in previously held joint ventures totaling $101.8 million, or $1.01 per share. Including the effect of these items, net income attributable to common shareholders was $66.8 million, or $0.71 per share, compared to $191.8 million, or $2.01 per share for the prior year period. FFO available to common shareholders, which also includes the charges related to the redemption of certain senior notes due 2020 discussed above, was $211.2 million, or $2.12 per share, compared to $236.9 million, or $2.36 per share, for the prior year period AFFO available to common shareholders was $245.3 million, or $2.46 per share, for the 2017 period and $238.4 million, or $2.37 per share, for the 2016 period\nFFO and AFFO are widely accepted supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies. Complete reconciliations containing adjustments from GAAP net income to FFO and AFFO are included in this release. Net income, FFO and AFFO per share are on a diluted basis.\n\"During 2017, our portfolio net operating income increased by 6.8%, on top of a 2016 increase of 8.4%. Our consolidated portfolio was 97.3% occupied at December 31, 2017, marking our 37 th consecutive year-end with occupancy of 95% or greater, or every year since we started the business in 1981. We opened one new outlet center during 2017 and completed a major expansion of an existing successful center. Both of these projects opened 93% leased,\" commented Steven B. Tanger, Chief Executive Officer.\n\"Outlets remain an important and profitable channel of distribution for retailers and manufacturers, as evidenced by this high level of occupancy. With a tenant occupancy cost ratio of 10.0% for 2017, Tanger continues to have the lowest cost of occupancy among all public mall REITs and many of the Company's tenants report that outlet stores remain one of their most profitable and important retail distribution channels. Given the outlet channel's appeal with the tenant community and the flexibility afforded by the strength of our balance sheet, we believe Tanger is well-positioned to weather headwinds in the retail environment and emerge stronger as the retail cycle improves,\" he added.\nRe-merchandising Activity\nTanger completed the planned major re-merchandising of 5 outlet centers during 2017. Enhancing the tenant mix has historically increased shopper traffic, driven demand from additional tenants, increased rent spreads on future renewals and increased overall outlet center productivity over time. Although these sought-after tenants typically require a lower relative cost of occupancy, re-merchandising with the high-volume brands that resonate with the consumer has been a successful long-term strategy for Tanger for more than 37 years.\nOperating Metrics\nBlended average rental rates increased 12.1% on 343 leases totaling approximately 1,508,000 square feet renewed or released throughout the consolidated portfolio during the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017, excluding 9 leases totaling 165,000 square feet in the centers with major re-merchandising projects during 2017 These new stores required the consolidation of 25 storefronts with an average size of 6,600 square feet to create 9 new storefronts with an average size of 18,400 square feet Including these 9 leases, blended average rental rates increased 8.8% on 352 leases totaling approximately 1,673,000 square feet renewed or released throughout the consolidated portfolio during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 Consolidated portfolio occupancy rate was 97.3% on December 31, 2017, compared to 96.9% on September 30, 2017 and 97.7% on December 31, 2016 Average tenant sales productivity for the consolidated portfolio was $380 per square foot for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 Same center tenant sales performance for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately 1% for the overall portfolio compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 Same center tenant sales performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 for the overall portfolio was stable compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 Tanger renewed approximately 84% of the consolidated portfolio space scheduled to expire during 2017, compared to a 2016 renewal rate of 85%\nLease renewals that commenced during 2017 totaled 1.3 million square feet and generated an increase in average rents of 8.7%. In order to maintain occupancy and preserve upside potential, the Company strategically executed 50 renewals with a term of one year or less (which represent approximately 15% of renewed space). Excluding these 50 renewals and the 9 re-merchandising leases, average rents increased 13.2% for renewals and 16.0% on a blended basis.\nAs of January 31, 2018, Tanger had lease renewals executed or in process for 58% of the space in the consolidated portfolio scheduled to expire during 2018, up from 46% of the space scheduled to expire during 2017 that was executed or in process as of January 31, 2017. Blended rental rates for consolidated portfolio leases renewed and re-tenanted through January 31, 2018 that will commence in 2018 increased 4.4%. Excluding 41 renewals with a term of one year or less, which represent approximately 20% of renewed space, average rents increased 9.9% on a blended basis.\nTanger recaptured approximately 201,000 square feet within its consolidated portfolio during 2017, including 35,000 square feet during the fourth quarter, related to bankruptcies and brand-wide restructurings by retailers. The Company recaptured approximately 105,000 square feet during 2016, including 45,000 square feet during the fourth quarter, and 157,000 square feet during 2015, none of which was during the fourth quarter.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, two new Tanger Outlet Centers were included in the consolidated portfolio sales metric for the first time. Average tenant sales for the portfolio reflects the dilution of these newly stabilized centers, as the productivity of new centers typically does not initially exceed the average productivity for the remaining portfolio, which is comprised largely of more mature assets. Average tenant sales productivity includes stabilized outlet centers and is based on all reporting retailers leasing stores less than 20,000 square feet in size, which have occupied such stores for a minimum of twelve months.\nSame Center and Portfolio NOI\nPortfolio net operating income (\"Portfolio NOI\") for the consolidated portfolio increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter and increased 6.8% on a year-to-date basis Same center net operating income (\"Same Center NOI\") increased for the 14 th consecutive year Excluding the centers with major re-merchandising projects during 2017, Same Center NOI for the consolidated portfolio increased 0.6% during the fourth quarter and increased 1.4% on a year-to-date basis Including these centers, Same Center NOI for the consolidated portfolio decreased 0.4% during the fourth quarter and increased 0.5% on a year-to-date basis For the consolidated portfolio, lease termination fees, which are excluded from Same Center NOI and Portfolio NOI, totaled $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively and totaled $3.6 million for both respective year-to-date periods. In addition, Tanger's share of lease termination fees in its unconsolidated joint ventures, which is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, totaled $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively and totaled $0.9 million and $1.7 million for the respective year-to-date periods.\nSame Center NOI and Portfolio NOI are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures of our operating performance. Complete definitions of Same Center NOI and Portfolio NOI and a reconciliation to the nearest comparable GAAP measure are included in this release.\n2017 Investment Activities\nCompleted two construction projects: Lancaster, Pennsylvania (123,000 square foot expansion) and Fort Worth, Texas (352,000 square foot new outlet center). Combined, these wholly-owned projects represent a 3.2% expansion of the Company's overall footprint at the beginning of the year and a total investment of approximately $138.8 million with an expected weighted average stabilized yield of approximately 9.2%. Increased Tanger's legal ownership interest in the Foxwoods (Mashantucket, Connecticut) center to 100%. Previously, the Company had two-thirds legal ownership interest, but a 100% economic interest in the consolidated joint venture as a result of its preferred equity interest and the capital and distribution provisions in the joint venture agreement. Sold a 22-year-old non-core outlet center in Westbrook, Connecticut\nTanger does not plan to deliver a new outlet center during 2018. However, pre-development and pre-leasing efforts are ongoing for projects in the Company's shadow pipeline of development opportunities. Tanger's long-standing disciplined development approach remains a core business tenet. The Company's underwriting practice requires achievement of a minimum pre-leasing threshold and receipt of all non-appealable permits prior to acquisition of land or commencement of construction.\nPeriod-End Balance Sheet Summary\nRepurchased a total of 1.9 million common shares during the year at a weighted average price of $25.80 per share for total consideration of $49.3 million, leaving $75.7 million remaining under Tanger's $125.0 million share repurchase authorization, which is valid through May 2019. No shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter. Completed a public offering of $300 million of 3.875% unsecured senior notes due July 2027 and used the net proceeds and unsecured lines of credit borrowings to redeem $300 million of outstanding 6.125% unsecured senior notes due June 2020 Entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in December 2017 to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on notional amounts aggregating $150.0 million. These interest rate swap agreements fix the base LIBOR rate, effective August 2018 through January 2021, at an average of 2.20%. Unencumbered the outlet center in Foxwoods (Mashantucket), CT by repaying the $70.3 million mortgage loan with borrowings under the unsecured lines of credit Total enterprise value was $4.4 billion and debt-to-enterprise value ratio was 40% Total outstanding floating rate debt was $268 million, representing 15% of total debt outstanding, or about 6% of total enterprise value Unused capacity was $306 million under the Company's $520 million unsecured lines of credit Weighted average interest rate was 3.33% Weighted average term to maturity of outstanding debt, including extension options, was approximately 6.3 years Approximately 94% of the Company's consolidated square footage was unencumbered by mortgages Interest coverage ratio was 4.46 times for 2017, compared to 4.40 times for 2016\nSubsequent Event\nOn January 9, 2018, Tanger closed on amendments to the unsecured lines of credit, which increased the borrowing capacity from $520.0 million to $600.0 million and extended the maturity date from October 2019 to October 2021, with a one-year extension option. The interest rate spread over LIBOR was also reduced to 0.875% from 0.900%.\nEarnings Guidance for 2018\nBased on the Company's internal budgeting process and the Company's view on current market conditions, management currently believes its net income and FFO for 2018 will be as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018:\nLow Range\nHigh Range\nEstimated diluted net income per share\n$1.02\n$1.08\nNoncontrolling interest, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets\nincluding noncontrolling interest share and our share of unconsolidated\njoint ventures\n1.41\n1.41\nEstimated diluted FFO per share\n$2.43\n$2.49\nTanger's estimates reflect the following key assumptions:\nPortfolio NOI growth for the consolidated portfolio between 0.5% and 1.5%, reflecting the full year impact of the new Fort Worth, Texas center and the Lancaster, Pennsylvania expansion Same Center NOI guidance for the consolidated portfolio between (1.0)% and 0.0%, reflecting the following: Lower average occupancy related to the elevated level of store closings in 2017 resulting from bankruptcy filings and brand-wide restructurings by retailers, as well as an assumption of additional store closings in 2018 at approximately half the level of the 2017 stores recaptured Negative impact of short-term lease renewals and lease modifications commencing in 2018 and 2017, which the Company strategically executed to preserve upside potential and maintain high occupancy Projected full year lease termination fees (which are not included in Same Center NOI) of approximately $1.0 million for the consolidated portfolio Tenant sales remain stable Average general and administrative expense of between $11.1 million and $11.5 million per quarter Interest expense for the year for the consolidated portfolio of $64.0 million to $66.0 million, and our share of interest expense in the unconsolidated portfolio of $6.0 million to $7.0 million 2018 weighted average diluted common shares of approximately 93.1 million for earnings per share and 98.1 million for FFO per share Combined recurring capital expenditures and second-generation tenant allowances of approximately $34 million Does not include the impact of any additional financing activity, the sale of any outparcels, properties or joint venture interests, or the acquisition of any properties or joint venture partner interests\nFourth Quarter Conference Call\nTanger to discuss its fourth quarter results for analysts, investors and other interested parties on Wednesday, February 14, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

We determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"), of which we are a member. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) before extraordinary items and gains (losses) on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate of consolidated real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including depreciation and amortization, and impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures.\nFFO is intended to exclude historical cost depreciation of real estate as required by GAAP which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.\nWe present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance. In addition, a portion of cash bonus compensation to certain members of management is based on our FFO or Adjusted Funds From Operations (\"AFFO\"), which is described in the section below. We believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate our performance and that of our management. In addition, FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is also widely used by us and others in our industry to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates. NAREIT has encouraged its member companies to report their FFO as a supplemental, industry-wide standard measure of REIT operating performance.\nFFO has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nFFO does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; FFO does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and FFO does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; FFO, which includes discontinued operations, may not be indicative of our ongoing operations; and Other companies in our industry may calculate FFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, FFO should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or our dividend paying capacity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using FFO only as a supplemental measure.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations\nWe present AFFO as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define AFFO as FFO further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. These further adjustments are itemized in the table below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating AFFO you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of AFFO should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nWe present AFFO because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we believe it is useful for investors to have enhanced transparency into how we evaluate management's performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies. We use AFFO when certain material, unplanned transactions occur as a factor in evaluating management's performance and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and may use AFFO when determining incentive compensation.\nAFFO has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:\nAFFO does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; AFFO does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and AFFO does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; AFFO does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and Other companies in our industry may calculate AFFO differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, AFFO should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using AFFO only as a supplemental measure.\nPortfolio Net Operating Income and Same Center Net Operating Income\nWe present portfolio net operating income (\"Portfolio NOI\") and same center net operating income (\"Same Center NOI\") as supplemental measures of our operating performance. Portfolio NOI represents our property level net operating income which is defined as total operating revenues less property operating expenses and excludes termination fees and non-cash adjustments including straight-line rent, net above and below market rent amortization and gains or losses on the sale of outparcels recognized during the periods presented. We define Same Center NOI as Portfolio NOI for the properties that were operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods and which were not acquired or subject to a material expansion or non-recurring event, such as a natural disaster, during the comparable reporting periods.\nWe believe Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI are non-GAAP metrics used by industry analysts, investors and management to measure the operating performance of our properties because they provide performance measures directly related to the revenues and expenses involved in owning and operating real estate assets and provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income, FFO or AFFO. Because Same Center NOI excludes properties developed, redeveloped, acquired and sold; as well as non-cash adjustments, gains or losses on the sale of outparcels and termination rents; it highlights operating trends such as occupancy levels, rental rates and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI, and accordingly, our Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nPortfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of our financial performance since they do not reflect the entire operations of our portfolio, nor do they reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, other non-property income and losses, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, or trends in development and construction activities which are significant economic costs and activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Because of these limitations, Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Portfolio NOI and Same Center NOI only as supplemental measures.\nTANGER FACTORY OUTLET CENTERS, INC.
