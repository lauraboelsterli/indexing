    "text": "(Reuters) - Australian pallets and container company Brambles Ltd ( BXB.AX ) reported a three-fold jump in half-year net profit on Monday as it recognised a one-time benefit from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States.\nBrambles reported an attributable profit of $447.2 million for the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with $146.2 million a year earlier, beating estimates of $323.8 million, according to an average of two analysts.\nThe company said profit was helped by the absence of impairments incurred in the previous year and recognition of the one-time benefit of $130.1 million from the U.S. tax reform.\nUnderlying profit for the first-half, however, rose only 1 percent on a constant currency basis to $493.7 million, impacted by previously flagged factors such as loss of large Australian reusable plastic containers contract and investments related to the Hoover Freguson joint venture.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of A$0.145 per share, the same as last year and said sales revenue for the first half rose 5 percent on a constant currency basis to $2.75 billion.\nUnder pressure from stiff competition in the Unite States, and hurt by the shutdown of Australiaâ€™s car manufacturing sector, the company maintained its full-year revenue growth to be in mid-single digits and expects underlying profit growth slightly higher than the revenue growth.\nReporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Adrian Croft and Sandra Maler\n ",
