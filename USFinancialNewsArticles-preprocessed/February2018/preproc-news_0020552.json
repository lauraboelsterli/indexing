The buildings feature variable height facades, attractive landscaping, office entries with excellent aesthetic appeal, and state-of-the-art specifications.

The Park is a high-quality asset in a strategic location occupied by a diverse and credit-worthy tenant base,” stated Scott Sealy, Jr., Chief Investment Officer. “This property blends perfectly with our established and growing portfolio.”\nThe Park’s best-in-class location in the Northwest Houston submarket offers tenants frontage on the Sam Houston Toll Road and direct access to the greater Houston Metroplex through SH-249, U.S. 290, I-45 and I-10.
