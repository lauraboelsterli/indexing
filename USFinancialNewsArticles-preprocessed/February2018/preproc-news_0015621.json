    "text": "JERUSALEM--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TEVA) today reported results for the year and the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFY 2017\nQ4 2017\nRevenues $22.4 billion $5.5 billion Cash flow from operations $3.5 billion $1.2 billion GAAP earnings (loss) per share ($16.26) ($11.41) Non-GAAP EPS $4.01 $0.93 2018 Business outlook:\nRevenues are expected to be $18.3 - 18.8 billion Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.25-2.50\nKåre Schultz, Teva’s President and CEO, said, “2017 was a challenging year for Teva. Starting 2018 we are focused on meeting our financial obligations and ensuring a much more solid and sustainable business model going forward. We are making strong progress on the restructuring plan, and I am optimistic about the progress made and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our targets in the coming year.\nTeva remains a recognized world-class leader in global healthcare, delivering unique value through accessible treatments and innovative medicines. By improving our financial profile through stabilization of our operating profit and cash flow, we will be better positioned to continue serving patients worldwide.”\nGoodwill Impairment In 2017, we noted significant adverse challenges in the U.S. generics market and the economic environment. These challenges included: (i) additional pricing pressure in the U.S. generics market as a result of customer consolidation into larger buying groups capable of extracting greater price reductions; (ii) pricing challenges due to government regulation; (iii) accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of off-patent medicines, resulting in increased competition for these products; (iv) delays in new launches of certain of our generic products; (v) originator strategies to maintain market share, reducing the value of newly launched complex or novel generics (vi) changes to traditional distribution model, and (vii) the recently-enacted U.S. tax reform legislation is expected to limit our ability to achieve targeted tax efficiencies compared to prior estimates. Consequently, we recorded goodwill impairments of $17.1 billion, mainly with respect to our U.S. generics reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we noted further deterioration in the U.S. generics market and economic environment, further limitations on our ability to influence generic medicines pricing in the long term and a decrease in value from future launches. These developments included: (i) additional pricing pressure in the U.S. generics market as a result of customer consolidation into larger buying groups capable of extracting greater price reductions; (ii) pricing challenges due to government regulation; (iii) accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of off-patent medicines, resulting in increased competition for these products; (iv) originator strategies to maintain market share, reducing the value of newly launched complex or novel generics; (v) changes to traditional distribution model; and (vi) the recently-enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, which is expected to limit our ability to achieve targeted tax efficiencies compared to prior estimates.\nConsequently, we recorded goodwill impairments totaling $17.1 billion in 2017, mainly with respect to our U.S. generics reporting unit.\n2017 Annual Results\nRevenues in 2017 were $22.4 billion, an increase of 2%, or 6% in local currency terms, compared to 2016, primarily due to: (i) an increase in our generic medicines segment from the inclusion of Actavis Generics revenues for the full year of 2017 as compared to five month in 2016, partially offset by the adverse market dynamics in the United States; (ii) the acquisition of Anda in the fourth quarter of 2016; and (iii) a decrease in revenues of our specialty medicines segment due to generic competition to certain key products.\nExchange rate differences, including the impact of Venezuela, between 2017 and 2016 negatively impacted our revenues by $914 million, our GAAP operating income by $290 million and our non-GAAP operating income by $335 million. Adjustments to the exchange rates used for the Venezuelan bolivar and the November 30, 2017 deconsolidation of our subsidiaries in Venezuela resulted in a decrease of $1,062 million in revenues, a decrease of $249 million in GAAP operating income and a decrease of $323 million in non-GAAP operating income, compared to results in 2016. In light of the political and economic conditions in Venezuela, we excluded changes in revenues and operating profit in Venezuela from any discussion of local currency results.\nGAAP gross profit was $10.8 billion in 2017, down 9% compared to 2016. GAAP gross profit margin for the year was 48.4%, compared to 54.1% in 2016. Non-GAAP gross profit was $12.2 billion in 2017, down 9% compared to 2016. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 54.7% in 2017, compared to 61.3% in 2016. The decrease in GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects lower profitability of our generic medicines segment, higher amortization of purchased intangible assets, lower profitability of our specialty medicines segment and the inclusion of Anda, and lower profitability of our other activities, partially offset by lower inventory step-up expenses, inventory related expenses in connection with the devaluation in Venezuela and lower costs related to regulatory actions taken in certain facilities. The decrease in non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects lower profitability of our generic medicines segment, lower profitability of our specialty medicines segment due to loss of exclusivity of key products, the inclusion of Anda as well as lower profitability of our other activities.\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses in 2017 were $1.8 billion, a decrease of 12.5% compared to 2016. R&D expenses excluding equity compensation expenses and purchase of in-process R&D in 2017 were $1.6 billion, or 7.1% of revenues, compared to $1.7 billion, or 7.6%, in 2016. R&D expenses related to our generic medicines segment were $702 million, compared to $659 million in 2016. R&D expenses related to our specialty medicines segment were $884 million, compared to $998 million in 2016.\nSelling and Marketing (S&M) expenses in 2017 were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 5.3% compared to 2016. S&M expenses excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets and equity compensation expenses were $3.4 billion, or 15.2% of revenues, in 2017, compared to $3.7 billion, or 17.0% of revenues, in 2016. S&M expenses related to our generic medicines segment were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to $1.7 billion in 2016. S&M expenses related to our specialty medicines segment were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 13% compared to $1.9 billion in 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) expenses in 2017 were $1.3 billion, an increase of $45 million compared to 2016. G&A expenses excluding equity compensation expenses and other expenses were $1.2 billion in 2017, or 5.5% of revenues, compared to $1.2 billion and 5.4% in 2016.\nOperating loss was $17.5 billion in 2017, compared to operating income of $2.2 billion in 2016. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.1 billion, down 11% compared to $6.8 billion in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP operating income, which excludes amortization and certain other items, and excluding depreciation expenses) for 2017 was $6.7 billion, down 9% compared to 2016.\nIn 2017, financial expenses were $895 million, compared to $1.3 billion in 2016. Non-GAAP financial expenses were $908 million in 2017, compared to $442 million in 2016.\nGAAP income tax expenses in 2017 were $1.9 billion or 11% on a pre-tax loss of $18 billion. In 2016, the provision for income taxes was $521 million or 63% on pre-tax income of $824 million. The provision for non-GAAP income taxes for 2017 amounted to $788 million on pre-tax non-GAAP income of $5.2 billion, for an annual tax rate of 15.3%. The provision for non-GAAP income taxes in 2016 was $1.1 billion on pre-tax non-GAAP income of $6.4 billion, for an annual tax rate of 17.4%.\nGAAP net loss attributable to Teva and GAAP diluted loss per share were $16.3 billion and $16.26, respectively, in 2017, compared to net income attributable to Teva of $329 million and a gain per share of $0.07 in 2016. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for calculating diluted EPS and non-GAAP diluted EPS were $4.3 billion and $4.01, respectively in 2017, compared to $5.2 billion and $5.14 in 2016.\nNon-GAAP information : Net non-GAAP adjustments in 2017 were $20.6 billion. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the year were adjusted to exclude the following items:\nan impairment of goodwill of $17.1 billion, mainly related to our U.S. generics reporting unit; impairment of long-lived assets of $3.8 billion, mainly related to revaluation of generic products acquired from Actavis Generics, discontinued Actavis Generics products and Rimsa products, product and marketing rights related to our business venture in Japan and an impairment of property, plant and equipment of $544 million amortization of purchased intangible assets totaling $1.4 billion, of which $1.2 billion is included in cost of goods sold and the remaining $209 million in selling and marketing expenses; restructuring expenses of $535 million; charge due to deconsolidation of our subsidiaries in Venezuela of $396 million; legal settlements and loss contingencies of $500 million ; contingent consideration of $154 million; equity compensation of $129 million; acquisition and integration expenses of $105 million; other R&D expenses of $221 million; inventory step-up of $67 million; costs related to regulatory actions taken in certain facilities of $47 million; financial income of $13 million; other non-GAAP items of $160 million; gain on sale of business of $1.1 billion; minority interest adjustment of negative $270 million; and tax effect and other income tax items of $2.7 billion (includes $1.0 billion U.S Tax Cuts and Job Act effect)\nWe believe that excluding such items facilitates investors' understanding of Teva’s business. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of our U.S. GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP figures.\nIn light of conditions in Venezuela, we concluded that as of November 30, 2017, we do not meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Venezuela and that we no longer have significant influence over such subsidiaries. Therefore, effective November 30, 2017, we deconsolidated the investment in our subsidiaries in Venezuela, recording deconsolidation charges of $396 million.\nCash flow from operations generated during 2017 was $3.5 billion, down 33% compared to $5.2 billion in 2016. Free cash flow, excluding net capital expenditures, was $2.7 billion compared to $4.4 billion in 2016, a decrease of 38%. The decrease was mainly due to business performance as well as higher payments for legal settlements.\nTotal balance sheet assets were $70.6 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to $86.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 and $93.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease from September 30, 2017 was mainly due to impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.\nCash and investments at December 31, 2017 decreased to $1.1 billion, compared to $0.9 billion at September 30, 2017 and to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our debt was $32.5 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion compared to $34.7 billion as of September 30, 2017, and a decrease of $3.3 billion compared to $35.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to $4.4 billion of net debt repayments on our various term loans, our revolving credit facility and other short term loans, partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations of $1.1 billion. The portion of total debt classified as short-term as of December 31, 2017 was 11%.\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $17.4 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $30.3 billion at September 30, 2017 and to $35.0 billion at December 31, 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.5 billion, down 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the decrease in revenues of our specialty medicines segment due to generic competition for our key products and the challenging market dynamics in the U.S. generics market. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, revenues decreased 12%.\nExchange rate differences including the impact of Venezuela between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 reduced revenues by $274 million, GAAP operating income by $118 million and non-GAAP operating income by $181 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company announced that it would not be paying annual bonuses for 2017 due to the financial results of the company being significantly below the company’s original annual operating plan for the year. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reversed amounts accrued for such bonuses during the first three quarters of 2017 and made no further accrual for such bonuses.\nGAAP gross profit was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, down 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP gross profit margin was 46.6% in the quarter, compared to 52.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP gross profit was $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, down 26% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 52.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 59.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $360 million, down 47% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 mainly due to portfolio optimization ,various efficiency measures as well as the reversal of the annual bonus accrual. R&D expenses excluding equity compensation expenses and purchase of in-process R&D in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $310 million or 5.7% of quarterly revenues, compared to $514 million or 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

S&M expenses related to our generic medicines segment were $382 million, a decrease of 30% compared to $549 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly due to lower expenses in Venezuela following exchange rate adjustments as well as certain other efficiency measures. S&M expenses related to our specialty medicines segment were $372 million, a decrease of 26% compared to $506 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was mainly due to cost reduction and efficiency measures in our commercial operations, aligning with the life cycle of our product portfolio.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $492 million, compared to $360 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

European revenues of $1.1 billion, flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, or a decrease of 8% in local currency terms, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly due to the exclusion of revenues of Actavis U.K., which was divested in January 2017. ROW revenues of $864 million, a decrease of 31%, or an increase of 2% in local currency terms, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

The decrease in specialty medicines revenues compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to lower sales of our CNS products and the November 2017 divestiture of certain women health products in the United States. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we also benefited from a payment of $150 million, which we received in connection with our agreement to sell our royalties and other rights in Ninlaro ® (ixazomib) to a subsidiary of Takeda.\nU.S. specialty medicines revenues were $1.2 billion, down 32% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, according to December 2017 IQVIA (formerly IMS Health) data, our U.S. market share for the COPAXONE products in terms of new and total prescriptions were 27.8% and 25.7%, respectively.

These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial expenses, non-GAAP income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS are presented in order to facilitates investors' understanding of our business. We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how we utilize the non-GAAP measures: our management and board of directors use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational performance, to compare against work plans and budgets, and ultimately to evaluate the performance of management; our annual budgets are prepared on a non-GAAP basis; and senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using these non-GAAP measures. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP figures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are not providing forward looking guidance for GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management’s current beliefs and expectations and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from that expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
