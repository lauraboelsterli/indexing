    "text": "VANCOUVER, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (NYSE & TSX: RBA, the \"Company\" or \"Ritchie Bros.\") reports results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n(All figures are presented in U.S. dollars)\nFourth quarter highlights\nThe Company generated $178.8 million of revenues, an increase of 22% compared to the same quarter last year. Net income attributable to stockholders was $36.8 million compared to $27.9 million for the same quarter in 2016. Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to stockholders was $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2017, which included a $10.1 million favorable impact of the recent U.S. tax reform and $3.1 million of acquisition-related costs. This compares to diluted EPS attributable to stockholders of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted adjusted EPS attributable to stockholders 1 (non-GAAP measure), which excludes the $10.1 million impact of the U.S. tax reform and certain acquisition-related costs, decreased 13% to $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Other key fourth quarter highlights included:\nConsolidated Revenue Rate 2 was 13.81% compared to 14.11% in the fourth quarter of 2016 Auctions and Marketplaces (\"A&M\") segment revenues increased 20%; segment Revenue Rate 2 decreased 49 basis points (\"bps\") to 12.64% from 13.13% in the fourth quarter of 2016 Revenue from other services of $15.1 million; an increase of 48% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 Gross Transaction Value (\"GTV\") 2 of $1.3 billion, a 24% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016\nFull year highlights\nFull year results were influenced by broad-based effects of unprecedented demand for infrastructure projects, high equipment utilization rates, and an overall equipment shortage principally in the United States and Canada, resulting in lower than expected full year GTV and revenue performance. On May 31, 2017, the Company acquired IronPlanet (the \"Acquisition\") for $776.5 million and undertook the complex integration work, which resulted in some temporary sales productivity decline.\nThe Company generated $610.5 million of revenues in 2017, an increase of 8% compared to $566.4 million in 2016, and $75.0 million of net income attributable to stockholders. Diluted EPS attributable to stockholders was $0.69, which included $38.3 million of acquisition-related costs and $38.3 million of interest expense. This compares to diluted EPS attributable to stockholders of $0.85 in 2016. Diluted adjusted EPS attributable to stockholders (non-GAAP measure) decreased 30% to $0.81 in 2017 from $1.15 in 2016. Other key 2017 highlights included:\nConsolidated Revenue Rate of 13.66% compared to 13.07% in 2016 A&M segment revenues increased 6%; segment Revenue Rate increased 36 basis points to 12.63% from 12.27% in 2016 Revenues from other services of $46.2 million; an increase of 34% compared to 2016 Cash provided by operating activities of $146.3 million Declared quarterly dividends aggregating to $0.68 per common share in 2017 GTV of $4.5 billion, a 3% increase compared to 2016\n1\nDiluted adjusted EPS attributable to stockholders is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that comparing diluted adjusted EPS attributable to stockholders for different financial periods provides useful information about the growth or decline of our diluted EPS attributable to stockholders for the relevant financial period, and eliminates the financial impact of adjusting items we do not consider to be part of our normal operating results. Diluted adjusted EPS attributable to stockholders is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to stockholders (non-GAAP measure) (described in footnote 4), net of the effect of dilutive securities, by the weighted average number of dilutive shares outstanding. Diluted adjusted EPS attributable to stockholders is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our consolidated financial statements under \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below.\n2\nGross Transaction Value (\"GTV\") represents the total proceeds from all items sold at the Company's auctions and online marketplaces. It is not a measure of financial performance, liquidity, or revenue, and is not presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Auctions and Marketplaces segment Revenue Rate is calculated as segment revenues divided by GTV. Consolidated Revenue Rate is calculated as total, consolidated revenues divided by GTV.\n\"In the fourth quarter, despite a continuation of supply constraints, we delivered GTV and revenue growth both on a reported and combined-company basis as our integration efforts started taking hold, the salesforce stabilized and our go to market execution improved\", said Ravi Saligram, Chief Executive Officer of Ritchie Bros.\nMr. Saligram continued, \"2017 as a whole was a historic year for Ritchie Bros. as we reshaped our future through the transformational acquisition of IronPlanet, a pivotal step in our evolution to become a truly diversified asset management and disposition company. Our full year financial results are a reflection of the unprecedented shortage of equipment supply, softness in Alberta's oil patch, and uncertainty caused by a significant delay in regulatory approvals that led to some salesforce turnover. However, we made meaningful progress on several fronts including solid revenue rate expansion over prior year, strong operating free cash flow, and excellent growth in EMEA, RBFS and Mascus. We are pleased to have completed our 2017 integration milestones and are on track to achieve our stated synergy targets.\nLooking ahead, we are very excited about the future of Ritchie Bros. and our results in our record-breaking auction last week in Orlando are testimony to the power of the combined company's capabilities. We are encouraged by the results in the fourth quarter and our progress to-date in 2018 but remain balanced as we navigate continued tight supply in 2018.\"\nFinancial Overview\n(Unaudited)\n(in U.S. $ millions, except EPS)\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\nBetter/(Worse)\nBetter/(Worse)\n2017\n2016\n2017 over\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017 over\n2016\nRevenues\n$\n178.8\n$\n146.8\n22%\n$\n610.5\n$\n566.4\n$\n8%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n93.0\n$\n74.1\n(25%)\n$\n323.3\n$\n283.5\n$\n(14%)\nAcquisition-related costs\n$\n3.1\n$\n4.6\n33%\n$\n38.3\n$\n11.8\n$\n(224%)\nImpairment loss\n$\n-\n$\n-\n-\n$\n8.9\n$\n28.2\n$\n68%\nOperating income\n$\n40.0\n$\n40.6\n(1%)\n$\n107.5\n$\n135.7\n$\n(21%)\nAdjusted operating income (non-GAAP)\nmeasure) 3\n$\n42.2\n$\n40.6\n4%\n$\n133.8\n$\n164.0\n$\n(18%)\nOperating income margin\n22.4%\n27.7%\n-530 bps\n17.6%\n24.0%\n-640 bps\nAdjusted operating income margin\n(non-GAAP measure) 4\n23.6%\n27.7%\n-410 bps\n21.9%\n28.9%\n-700 bps\nNet income attributable to\nstockholders\n$\n36.8\n$\n27.9\n32%\n$\n75.0\n$\n91.8\n$\n(18%)\nAdjusted net income attributable to\nstockholders (non-GAAP measure) 5\n$\n28.3\n$\n32.9\n(14%)\n$\n87.7\n$\n123.3\n$\n(29%)\nDiluted EPS attributable to\nstockholders\n$\n0.34\n$\n0.26\n31%\n$\n0.69\n$\n0.85\n$\n(19%)\nDiluted adjusted EPS attributable to\nstockholders (non-GAAP measure)\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.30\n(13%)\n$\n0.81\n$\n1.15\n$\n(30%)\nGTV\n$\n1,294.9\n$\n1,040.4\n24%\n$\n4,468.0\n$\n4,334.8\n$\n3%\nA&M segment:\nRevenues\n163.7\n136.6\n20%\n564.3\n531.8\n6%\nRevenue Rate\n12.64%\n13.13%\n-49 bps\n12.63%\n12.27%\n36 bps\nAdjusted (non-GAAP) figures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 in the table above have not adjusted for the impact of $1.4 million and $21.3 million of pre-tax acquisition-related costs, respectively. Segmented information, which includes segment revenues and profits, can be found in the tables on page 11 of this News Release.\n3\nAdjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure. The Company uses income statement and balance sheet performance scorecards to align the Company's operations with its strategic priorities. The Company concentrates on a limited number of metrics to ensure focus and to facilitate quarterly performance discussions. The income statement scorecard includes the performance metric, adjusted operating income. The Company believes that comparing adjusted operating income for different financial periods provides useful information about the growth or decline of operating income for the relevant financial period. The Company calculates adjusted operating income by eliminating from operating income the pre-tax effects of significant non-recurring items that the Company does not consider to be part of its normal operating results, such as acquisition-related costs, management reorganization costs, severance, retention, gains/losses on sale of certain property, plant and equipment, impairment losses, and certain other items, which the Company refers to as 'adjusting items'. Adjusted operating income is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Company's consolidated financial statements under \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below.\n4\nThe Company's income statement scorecard includes the performance metric, adjusted operating income margin, which is a non-GAAP measure. The Company believes that comparing adjusted operating income margin for different financial periods provides useful information about the growth or decline of its operating income for the relevant financial period. The Company calculates adjusted operating income margin by dividing adjusted operating income (non-GAAP measure) by revenues. Adjusted operating income margin is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Company's consolidated financial statements under \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below.\n5\nAdjusted net income attributable to stockholders is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that comparing adjusted net income attributable to stockholders for different financial periods provides useful information about the growth or decline of the Company's net income attributable to stockholders for the relevant financial period, and eliminates the financial impact of adjusting items the Company does not consider to be part of its normal operating results. Adjusted net income attributable to stockholders represents net income attributable to stockholders excluding the effects of adjusting items and is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the Company's consolidated financial statements under \"Non-GAAP Measures\" below.\nResults of operations – fourth quarter and full year update\nGTV increased 24% to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher online marketplace GTV is primarily driven by the Acquisition. The increase was partially offset by global equipment shortages particularly in the United States, some lower sales productivity as the Company progresses through the integration of its sales teams post-acquisition, and weaknesses in the Canadian oil patches. For the full year, GTV increased 3% to $4.5 billion compared to $4.3 billion in 2016.\nRevenues increased 22% to $178.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $146.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to the Acquisition, revenue growth in Europe and strong Mascus performance, partially offset by lapping large Canadian inventory dispersals, which favorably impacted the fourth quarter of 2016. Consolidated Revenue Rate declined 30 bps to 13.81% versus the same period last year. This rate decline was the result of the performance of the Company's underwritten business, and lapping the inventory dispersals in the fourth quarter. For the full year, revenues increased $44.1 million, or 8%, driven principally by the Acquisition and growth of value-added services.\nCosts of services increased $8.8 million to $25.0 million compared to $16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to costs associated with the Company's inspection and appraisal activities, which increased as a result of the Acquisition. Cost of services for 2017 was $79.0 million, which represents a $13.0 million increase from $66.1 million in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased $18.8 million, or 25%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to the Acquisition, including increased headcount, travel costs, and search engine fees associated with the online marketplace channel, as well as merit increases and higher bank fees attributable to the new credit facility. For the full year, SG&A expenses of $323.3 million increased $39.7 million, or 14%, compared to 2016.\nAcquisition-related costs consist of operating expenses directly incurred as part of a business combination, due diligence, and integration planning – including those related to the Acquisition – and continuing employment costs that are recognized separately from the Company's business combinations. Fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 post acquisition-related costs were $3.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of costs associated with the Acquisition. Fiscal 2017 acquisition-related costs were $38.3 million compared to $11.8 million in 2016.\nOperating income modestly declined to $40.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $40.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was primarily due to higher SG&A expenses, costs of services, and depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by the increase in revenues. For the full year, operating income decreased $28.3 million, or 21%, to $107.5 million compared to $135.7 million in 2016.\nNet income attributable to stockholders increased $8.9 million, or 32%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This improvement is primarily due to the favorable impact from the US tax reform partially offset by the increases in interest expense due to the increased indebtedness to fund the Acquisition. In 2017, net income attributable to stockholders decreased $16.8 million to $75.0 million from $91.8 million in 2016.\nPrimarily for the same reasons noted above, diluted EPS attributable to stockholders was $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to diluted EPS attributable to stockholders of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2017, diluted EPS attributable to stockholders decreased 19% to $0.69 from $0.85 in 2016.\nResults by segment\nA&M segment\nRevenue . Segment revenue increased 20% to $163.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $136.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to the Acquisition and revenue growth in Europe, partially offset by the performance of the Company's underwritten business, including the significant inventory dispersals in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment Revenue Rate declined 49 basis points to 12.64% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 13.13% in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the same reasons as noted above. In 2017, segment revenue increased 6% to $564.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $531.8 million in 2016. Segment Revenue Rate increased 36 basis points to 12.63% in 2017.\nSG&A expenses . Segment SG&A expenses increased $17.8 million to $89.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily for the same reasons noted above in the consolidated SG&A expense commentary. On an annual basis, segment SG&A expenses increased $36.6 million to $308.9 million in 2017 compared to 2016.\nOther services\nRevenue from other services grew $4.9 million, or 48% in the fourth quarter of 2017, versus the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to growth of our ancillary services, as well as increases in revenue from Mascus and RBFS. For the full year, revenue from other services grew $11.7 million, or 33.7% in 2017, versus 2016.\nRBFS operating segment. RBFS segment revenues were $4.6 million, a 19% increase for the fourth quarter in 2017 compared to the $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Funded volume, which represents the amount of lending brokered by RBFS, increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $90.5 million. RBFS segment profit increased 13% to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, RBFS segment revenues were $16.1 million, a 26% increase in 2017 compared to the $12.8 million in 2016. Funded volume increased 17% from $261.4 million in 2016 to $306.4 million in 2017. RBFS segment operating profit increased 28% over the same comparative period to $8.2 million from $6.4 million.\nDividend Information\nQuarterly dividend\nThe Company declared on January 26, 2018, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per common share payable on March 9, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2018.\nQ4 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nRitchie Bros. is hosting a conference call to discuss its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, at 8:00 am Pacific time / 11:00 am Eastern time / 4:00 pm GMT on February 27, 2018.
