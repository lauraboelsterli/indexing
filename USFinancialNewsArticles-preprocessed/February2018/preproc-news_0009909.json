    "text": "FOURTH QUARTER 2017 NET LOSS OF $2.1 MILLION OR $0.38 PER SHARE\nEXCLUDING THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF TAX REFORM 1 , NET INCOME OF $1.0 MILLION OR $0.19 PER SHARE\nFULL-YEAR 2017 NET INCOME OF $1.1 MILLION OR $.20 PER SHARE\nEXCLUDING THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF TAX REFORM 1 , NET INCOME OF $4.2 MILLION OR $0.77 PER SHARE\nOVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Blue Valley Ban Corp. (OTCQX: BVBC) (the “Company”) today reported consolidated earnings (loss) for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended December 31, 2017 of $(2,063,000) and $1,099,000 respectively, compared to $134,000 and $1,566,000 respectively for the comparable periods ended December 31, 2016. Earnings (loss) per common share for the quarter and year-to-date periods ending December 31, 2017 were $(0.38) and $0.20, respectively, compared to net earnings per share of $0.02 and $0.29, respectively, for the prior year quarter and year-to-date periods ending December 31, 2016.\nThe loss for the quarter of $2,063,000, or $0.38 per share, included an estimated one-time, non-cash charge of $3,070,000, or $0.57 per share, recorded in the Provision For Income Taxes line, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) 1 . This charge is a result of the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets (DTA) arising from a lower U.S. Corporate tax rate. Excluding the impact of the Tax Reform, net income for the fourth quarter 2017 of $1,007,000 increased $873,000 or 651% from the prior year period and full-year 2017 net income of $4,169,000 increased $2,603,000 or 166% from the prior year period. Numerous key aspects of the operating results and financial condition for the Company reflected positive trends and results as of and during the period ended December 31, 2017.\nRobert D. Regnier, Chairman and CEO of Blue Valley Ban Corp., commented, “While our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of a significant non-cash charge due to tax reform, the core operations of the Company generated improved profits over the prior year period. Loan growth, combined with a stable net interest margin resulted in a significant increase in our net interest income. The credit quality of our loan portfolio, validated by recent internal and external assessments, enabled the Company to record a negative provision for loan losses during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we reduced the balance of foreclosed assets by $1.5 million during the quarter. Foreclosed assets have been reduced by over 61% during 2017 and the remaining balance of $2.3 million is less than 0.33% of total assets at December 31, 2017. The improvement in asset quality during 2017 has resulted in a decrease in ongoing related expenses and improved earnings.”\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $674,000, while the Company’s non-interest income declined by $1,438,000, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to $953,000 of realized gains on available-for-sale securities which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 and did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s non-interest expense declined by $810,000, compared to the prior year period.\nThe Company recorded a $400,000 negative provision for loans losses during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a $950,000 provision during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Management evaluates credit risk on an ongoing basis to determine an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses (ALLL). Net recoveries to the ALLL as well as the Company’s persistently low ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans, net of the impact of loan growth during the period, were key factors for the determination of the level for the ALLL for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The negative provision reduced the Company’s ALLL to $5,535,000 and the Company’s ratio of ALLL to total loans to 1.03% as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s ratio of total reserves to non-accrual loans was approximately 470.18% as of December 31, 2017, which exceeds the most recent Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) peer group ratio of 462.00%. The Company’s ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.22% as of December 31, 2017, which was below the most recent UBPR peer group of 0.80%.\nAbout Blue Valley Ban Corp.\nBlue Valley Ban Corp. is a bank holding company that, through its subsidiaries, provides banking services to closely-held businesses, their owners, professionals and individuals in Johnson County, Kansas.\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The fourth quarter of 2017 and full-year 2017 results reflects the estimated impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform, which resulted in a $3.1 million decrease in net income. Net income and earnings per share excluding the impact of Tax Reform are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180205006031/en/\nBlue Valley Ban Corp.\nMark A.
