    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vaxart, Inc. today commented on the Company’s proposed merger with Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVIR). The following is a statement from Wouter Latour, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vaxart, who will lead the combined company following completion of the transaction:\nWe are thrilled with the prospects of combining forces with Aviragen. In addition to continuing to develop our influenza oral tablet vaccine and norovirus vaccine, the transaction will allow us to access Aviragen’s antiviral assets. Specifically, Vaxart is fully committed to Aviragen’s BTA074 Phase 2 program for the treatment of condyloma caused by HPV.\nWe are confident that Vaxart’s drug development capabilities will be an asset to Aviragen’s BTA074 Phase 2 program. Further, the clinical proof of efficacy of our oral tablet vaccine will provide the company with a significantly de-risked platform for all of our programs.\nWe encourage Aviragen stockholders to vote FOR the proposed merger. Vaxart’s Board of Directors and management team looks forward to completing the transaction expeditiously and intends to work diligently so that stockholders of both Aviragen and Vaxart can realize the significant benefits of the merger.\nAbout Vaxart\nVaxart is a clinical-stage company developing a range of oral recombinant vaccines based on its proprietary delivery platform. Vaxart vaccines are administered using convenient room temperature-stable tablets that can be stored and shipped without refrigeration and eliminate risk of needle-stick injury. Its development programs are oral tablet vaccines designed to protect against norovirus, seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as a therapeutic vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), Vaxart’s first immuno-oncology indication.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release are forward looking statements. The words “anticipates,” “may,” “can,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “intends,” “likely,” “will,” “should,” “to be,” and any similar expressions or other words of similar meaning are intended to identify those assertions as forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation: the risk that the conditions to the closing of the merger are not satisfied, the failure to timely or at all obtain stockholder approval for the merger; uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the merger and the ability of each of Aviragen and Vaxart to consummate the merger; risks related to Aviragen’s ability to correctly estimate its operating expenses and its expenses associated with the merger; risks related to the market price of Aviragen’s common stock relative to the exchange ratio; the ability of Aviragen or Vaxart to protect their respective intellectual property rights; competitive responses to the merger; unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the merger; and potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the merger. The vaccine candidates that Vaxart develops may not progress through clinical development or receive required regulatory approvals within expected timelines or at all. In addition, future clinical trials may not confirm any safety, potency or other product characteristics described or assumed in this press release and such vaccine candidates may not successfully commercialized.
