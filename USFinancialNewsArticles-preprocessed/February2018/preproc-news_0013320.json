    "text": "BOISE, Idaho, Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:MU) announced today that the company has appointed David Zinsner as senior vice president and chief financial officer, effective Feb. 19, 2018. Zinsner succeeds Ernie Maddock, who is retiring from Micron but will remain with the company as an adviser through early June to ensure a smooth transition. Zinsner will report directly to Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO.\n“On behalf of the company, I want to thank Ernie for his significant contributions to Micron,” Mehrotra said. “He has helped position the company for continued strong growth, and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\n“I am fortunate to have been a part of Micron’s progress over the last few years,” Maddock said. “My focus now is on supporting Dave and Sanjay during the transition period to ensure a seamless and effective handoff.”\nZinsner joins Micron with over 20 years of financial and operations experience in the semiconductor and technology industry. He most recently served as president and chief operating officer at Affirmed Networks. Prior to that, Zinsner was senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer for eight years at Analog Devices, and before that, he was senior vice president and chief financial officer for four years at Intersil Corp.\n“Dave brings a great combination of financial expertise and executive experience to Micron and has a strong track record of achieving outstanding results,” Mehrotra said. “We look forward to his leadership in driving our financial strategy and delivering significant value to our shareholders.”\n“I am very excited to be joining Micron at a time when the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of growing demand for memory and storage solutions across a wide range of industries,” Zinsner said. “I look forward to working with the Micron team to capitalize on those trends and to take the company to the next level.”\nZinsner holds a master’s degree in business administration, finance and accounting from Vanderbilt University and a bachelor’s degree in industrial management from Carnegie Mellon University.\nIn a separate press release, Micron today updated its financial outlook for its fiscal second quarter of 2018: investors.micron.com .\nAdditional information on David Zinsner is available at http://www.micron.com/media .\nAbout Micron\nWe are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions.
