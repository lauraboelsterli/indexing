    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Third Seven Capital Advisors (\"TSCA\"), a privately held, national investment advisory firm, has strengthened its leadership team with the appointment of Amit Dogra as President, effective today. Based in New York and reporting to TSCA CEO Richard Hillson, Dogra will play a principal role in expanding the Firm's Advisor community and driving revenue growth.\nAmit Dogra joins TSCA from HighTower Advisors where he was Managing Director, Head of Advisor Growth, Relationship Management and Practice Management. He brings 20 years of financial services experience working with thousands of advisors on how to grow their businesses organically, through acquisition, or via succession planning.\n\"We are proud to welcome Amit to TSCA,\" said CEO Richard Hillson. \"The Firm has reached a pivotal point in its development. He has an outstanding track record of helping investment advisors grow.\"\nDogra, 43, believes that the early adopter movement among national RIA aggregators, consolidators, and platform providers space is gone. \"Advisory businesses launching today are looking at ways to differentiate themselves,\" he said. \"As I considered various career opportunities it became clear TSCA is already transforming a highly commoditized financial advisory industry. We focus on the elements that attracted us to this dynamic industry in the first place: the excitement of direct investing and developing personal relationships that create lasting value for clients and advisors alike.\"\nTSCA has set ambitious goals for 2018. The National RIA business is looking to attract $1 billion of assets under management by working with advisors who want to join as employees or independent business owners, as well as those considering succession planning.\n\"While the year is just getting started,\" Hillson added, \"we already have commitments for almost $300 million of AUM to transition in the first quarter. We are thrilled with our early success and know with Amit joining us, it will only accelerate the achievement of our goals.\"\nAbout Third Seven Capital Advisors\nThird Seven Capital Advisors is a privately held, national investment advisory firm, built with a client first culture. We are conflict free, independent, and focused on providing all the wealth management services advisors and clients need. But that's not what makes us different.\nWe believe in putting \"the investments\" back in investing We believe human interaction is the best way to invest and achieve your life and wealth management goals We believe in value creation for clients and advisors\nWhat makes us different is what makes us better.\nVisit our website for more information: www.tscapadvisors.com\nAlso visit Third Seven Capital Advisors on social media:\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/11207225/\nTwitter: @TSCAPADVISORS\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tscapadvisors/\nCONTACT:\nMatthew Fotheringham\nThird Seven Capital Advisors\n212.393.4690\nfotheringham@tscapadvisors.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-seven-capital-advisors-appoints-amit-dogra-president-300591641.html\nSOURCE Third Seven Capital Advisors",
