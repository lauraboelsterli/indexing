    "text": "DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AERI), an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today announced the appointment of John LaRocca as General Counsel, reporting to Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Aerie’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. LaRocca will oversee all legal matters for the Company. He was previously Executive Vice President and General Counsel at Eagle Pharmaceuticals.\n“We are delighted to have John LaRocca on our executive team. I am confident that John’s strong legal and compliance background will serve our Company very well as we prepare for our commercial launch of Rhopressa® in the second quarter of 2018 and continue to advance our pipeline and international reach,” said Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Aerie.\nMr. LaRocca added, “I believe Aerie is uniquely positioned as it continues to grow into a major ophthalmic pharmaceutical company. The Company is at a very exciting stage in its life cycle, and I look forward to contributing to the Company’s future success.”\nIn connection with his acceptance of the position as General Counsel of the Company, Mr. LaRocca will receive awards totaling 70,000 stock options and 18,000 shares of restricted stock. The stock options will vest over 4 years, with 25% vesting on the first anniversary of the hire date and the remainder vesting ratably on each of the subsequent 36 monthly anniversaries of the hire date; the restricted stock will vest over a period of 4 years in four equal annual installments on each anniversary of the hire date. This award was made outside of Aerie’s stockholder-approved equity incentive plan and was approved by the Company’s independent directors as an inducement material to Mr. LaRocca entering into employment with the Company in reliance on NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4), which requires this public announcement.\nAbout Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAerie is an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Aerie's first product, Rhopressa ® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2017. A link to the full product label is available on the Aerie website at http://investors.aeriepharma.com . Aerie’s second product candidate, Roclatan TM (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005%, which is a fixed dose combination of Rhopressa ® and widely prescribed PGA latanoprost, achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in two Phase 3 registration trials, named Mercury 1 and Mercury 2, and also achieved successful 12-month safety and efficacy results in Mercury 1. The Roclatan TM NDA submission is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2018. Aerie is also focused on global expansion and the development of additional product candidates and technologies in ophthalmology.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
