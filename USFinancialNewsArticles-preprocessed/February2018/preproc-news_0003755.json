The Kansas City, Missouri-based firm opened its first UK office in Birmingham, England, last year.\nCrouch is based in Birmingham as the new lead of a growing team of engineers responsible for the engineering and design of future networks for Network Owners and developers. He joined Burns & McDonnell in January, having previously been Head of Engineering at Sterling Power Group.\nCrouch comes to Burns & McDonnell with nearly 10 years of experience in the electricity industry in the UK. He has worked on a range of electrical infrastructure design-build projects throughout the UK, and has significant experience in developing solutions for power network projects.\nThis follows the news that Burns & McDonnell has achieved accreditation to the three standards covered within its Integrated Management System in less than six months: ISO9001, ISO14001 and OSHAS18001.
