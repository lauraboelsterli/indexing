    "text": "MUNICH, Feb 21 (Reuters) - German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media said on Wednesday it had hired Max Conze, the former head of British home appliances maker Dyson, as the successor to departing CEO Thomas Ebeling.\nProSieben made the announcement the day before it publishes the last annual results of Ebelingâ€™s nine-year term - an era in which its shares rose by 3,000 percent only to falter last year as it was forced to cut its advertising revenue forecasts.
