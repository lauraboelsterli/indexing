    "text": "Merger successfully completed in 2017 and integration proceeding ahead of expectations Strong investment performance across all time periods, with 76%, 66% and 79% of assets under management (“AUM”) outperforming benchmarks on a 1, 3 and 5 year basis, respectively, as at 31 December 2017 AUM increased to US$370.8 billion, up 3% from 30 September 2017 and up 16% from 31 December 2016 on a pro forma basis Total revenue increased 10% quarter over quarter driven by performance fees and higher average AUM GAAP operating margin of 33.2% and adjusted operating margin of 43.6% in fourth quarter 2017\nLONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Janus Henderson Group plc (NYSE:JHG, ASX:JHG, “JHG” or “the Group”) published its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results for the period ended 31 December 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 net income attributable to JHG of US$471.7 million compared to net income attributable to JHG of US$99.5 million in the third quarter 2017 (fourth quarter 2016: US$37.8 million). Fourth quarter 2017 net income attributable to JHG included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of US$340.7 million related to new US tax legislation. Net income attributable to JHG on an adjusted basis, adjusted for the one-time non-cash tax benefit and acquisition and transaction related costs, of US$147.9 million increased 30% compared with US$114.2 million in the third quarter 2017 (fourth quarter 2016 pro forma: US$95.1 million).\nFourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share of US$2.32 compared to US$0.49 diluted earnings per share in the third quarter 2017 (fourth quarter 2016: US$0.33). Fourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share included US$1.67 per diluted share related to the new US tax legislation. Diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis of US$0.73 increased 30% compared to US$0.56 in the third quarter 2017 (fourth quarter 2016 pro forma: US$0.46).\nDick Weil and Andrew Formica, co-Chief Executive Officers of Janus Henderson Group plc, stated:\n“2017 was a landmark year for Janus Henderson Group. As we look back on accomplishments, we are extremely proud of what the firm delivered for clients and shareholders and immensely grateful for the tireless contributions of our employees, who have made the creation of our new firm possible.\n“Investment performance is strong, which is a testament to the quality of our investment teams and an endorsement of our commitment to active management. Despite outflows in 2017, we continue to see strong levels of engagement and support from our clients globally and remain encouraged by developing relationships. In 2017, we delivered substantial growth in profitability, top-line results and cash flow generation, and we are pleased that we are on track to deliver cost savings greater than originally promised.\n“As we look ahead to 2018, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the momentum we are seeing in many areas of our business. Certainly, there is still work to be done; however, we remain committed to providing superior client, shareholder and employee experiences and are excited about the future for Janus Henderson\".\nThe Group presents its financial results in US Dollars (“US$” or “USD”) and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP” or “GAAP”) which includes the results of Janus Capital Group from the Merger closing date. However, in the opinion of Management, the profitability of the Group and its ongoing operations is best evaluated using additional non-GAAP financial measures on a pro forma adjusted basis.

JHG management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from revenues in the computation of net revenue reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties that perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the Group’s managed AUM. 2 Adjustments primarily represent deal and integration costs in relation to the Merger, including severance costs, legal costs, consulting fees and write down of legacy IT systems. JHG management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 3 Investment management contracts have been identified as a separately identifiable intangible asset arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses. Such contracts are recognised at the net present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the contracts at the date of acquisition. For segregated mandate contracts, the intangible asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contracts. JHG management believes these non-cash and acquisition-related costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 4 Adjustments primarily represent fair value movements on options issued to Dai-ichi, deferred consideration costs associated with acquisitions prior to the Merger and increased debt expense as a consequence of the fair value uplift on the debt due to acquisition accounting. JHG Management believes these costs do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 5 Adjustments primarily relate to the gain recognised on disposal of the alternative UK small cap team (‘Volantis team’) on 1 April 2017 and adjustments related to deferred consideration costs for prior acquisitions. JHG management believes these gains do not represent the ongoing operations of the Group. 6 The tax impact of adjustments are calculated based on the US or foreign statutory tax rate as they relate to each adjustment; certain adjustments are either not taxable or not tax deductible. In addition, fourth quarter 2017 includes the impact of US tax legislation passed in December 2017.
