Commissions and Fees (C&F) for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.05 billion, an increase of 8% as compared to C&F of $1.9 billion for the same period in the prior year.\nTotal Revenues were $8.2 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 4% (4% constant currency increase; 5% organic increase) as compared to $7.9 billion for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted Revenues, which included $58 million of revenue not recognized due to purchase accounting rules for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016 increased 3% (4% constant currency increase; 4% organic increase). C&F for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 were $8.1 billion, an increase of 4% as compared to C&F of $7.8 billion for the same period in the prior year.\nThe U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was negative 221%, which included a one-time tax benefit of $204 million related to U.S. Tax Reform; and the adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share was 21%.\nIn connection with our analysis of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, we have recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $204 million in the fourth quarter. Approximately $208 million of this net benefit is due to the reduction in the federal tax rate and re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities primarily relating to the merger-related acquisition intangibles.\nThe U.S. GAAP tax rate for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 was negative 21%; and the adjusted tax rate for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share was 22%.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson was $245 million, as compared to a net income of $142 million for the same period in the prior-year. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson was $568 million, as compared to a net income of $420 million for the same period in the prior-year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, diluted earnings per share were $1.84, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.21. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 include pre-tax $92 million of transaction and integration expenses and $47 million of restructuring costs.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, diluted earnings per share were $4.18, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.51. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson and diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 include pre-tax $269 million of transaction and integration expenses and $132 million of restructuring costs.\nThe Company repurchased approximately $70 million of Willis Towers Watson stock during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, the Company repurchased approximately $710 million of Willis Towers Watson stock, including the cancellation of shares related to the settlement of shareholder appraisal litigation.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net income was $253 million, as compared to net income of $148 million for the same period in the prior-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $484 million, or 23.3% of Total Revenues, an increase from Adjusted EBITDA of $419 million, or 21.7% of Total Revenues in the prior-year. This represents an increase of 160 basis points in Adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior-year fourth quarter.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $592 million, as compared to net income of $438 million for the same period in the prior-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.90 billion, or 23.2% of Total Revenues, an increase from Adjusted EBITDA of $1.77 billion, or 22.3% of Adjusted Revenues in the prior-year. This represents an increase of 90 basis points in Adjusted EBITDA margin over the prior-year.\n“We just celebrated the second anniversary of Willis Towers Watson, and I couldn’t be more pleased to see the evolution of our Company in two short years.” said John Haley, Willis Towers Watson’s chief executive officer. “The foundation we built in 2016 led to strong execution as exhibited in the 2017 financial results. I’d like to thank our colleagues for their continued focus on integration, while maintaining a high level of client commitment and service. This effort was never more evident than seeing how our colleagues responded to our clients as recent catastrophes unfolded around the world. I’d also like to thank our clients for their enthusiastic support as we charted new waters with our integrated talent and risk offerings. I look forward to seeing the continued evolution during 2018 and beyond.”\nFourth Quarter Company Highlights\nSegment Highlights\nBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. Specific segment detail will focus on C&F on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted.\nHuman Capital & Benefits\nFor the quarter, the Human Capital & Benefits (“HCB”) segment had C&F of $758 million, an increase of 5% (2% constant currency increase; 4% organic increase) from $723 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. Retirement’s C&F growth was led by Great Britain resulting from increased work related to pension legislation. North America C&F grew due to an increase in demand for consulting and administration projects, despite a lower demand for Bulk Lump Sum project work. Health and Benefits (“H&B”) C&F decreased as a result of the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business and timing issues in Western Europe. North America H&B C&F grew due to increased consulting and product demand and Great Britain C&F grew due to global benefits solutions implementations. Talent and Rewards C&F increased as a result of survey work in Western Europe, Great Britain and International with a slight offset in North America due to a decreased demand for advisory services. C&F in the Technology and Administration Solutions business continued to experience strong growth in all regions as a result of new administration clients and project activity. The HCB segment had total revenues of $772 million compared to $731 million for the prior-year fourth quarter, which included interest and other income; and an operating margin of 22% for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016.\nCorporate Risk & Broking\nFor the quarter, the Corporate Risk & Broking (“CRB”) segment had C&F of $770 million, an increase of 10% (7% constant currency increase; 7% organic increase) from $698 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. All regions experienced C&F growth within CRB. International C&F was led by strong revenue growth in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, and energy-related business in CEEMEA. Western Europe C&F growth was led by Iberia, France and Italy driven by performance in large accounts and continued momentum in the Affinity business. North America had solid C&F growth as a result of new business and strong retention and forensic accounting claim work related to increased natural disasters. Great Britain C&F grew slightly as growth in the Energy and Natural Resources business was offset by the timing of a large client renewal and pressure on the retail business. The CRB segment had total revenues of $777 million compared to $706 million for the prior-year fourth quarter, which included interest and other income; and an operating margin of 28% compared to 29% for the prior-year fourth quarter.\nInvestment, Risk & Reinsurance\nFor the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance (“IRR”) segment had C&F of $300 million, an increase of 5% (2% constant currency increase; 4% organic increase) from $285 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. Wholesale led the growth for the segment due to increased demand in the Marine business and favorable timing. Insurance Consulting and Technology had strong C&F growth due to Technology sales, and Max Matthiessen C&F grew as a result of increased assets under management and performance fees. Investment C&F declined, but total revenues increased due to increased income from performance fees. Reinsurance C&F declined slightly, due to a reduction in Specialty work and softness in North America, but total revenues increased due to higher investment income in the U.S. Portfolio Underwriting Services. C&F declined due to the divestment in the U.S. Programs business. The IRR segment had total revenues of $305 million compared to $289 million for the prior-year fourth quarter, which included interest and other income; and an operating margin of 2% compared to 8% for the prior-year fourth quarter.\nBenefits Delivery & Administration (formerly Exchange Solutions)\nFor the quarter, the Benefits Delivery & Administration (“BDA”) segment had C&F of $193 million, an increase of 11% (11% constant currency increase; 11% organic increase) from $174 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. Individual Marketplace C&F increased by 11%, and the rest of the segment grew by 10%, led by Group Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing. Growth in the Individual and Group Marketplaces resulted from the additional 2017 enrollments, and Benefit Outsourcing’s growth was a result of new client wins and special projects. The BDA segment had total revenues of $193 million, compared to $175 million for the prior-year fourth quarter; and an operating margin of 22%, compared to 11% for the prior-year fourth quarter.\nReconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Income from Operations before Income Taxes and Interest in Earnings of Associates\nThe Company recorded expenses that are excluded from our segment operating income. The following table reconciles the exclusions.\n(In millions of U.S. dollars) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Segment Operating Income $ 435 $ 410 $ 1,786 $ 1,693 Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue — — — (58 ) Amortization (140 ) (148 ) (581 ) (591 ) Restructuring costs (47 ) (78 ) (132 ) (193 ) Transaction and integration expenses (92 ) (60 ) (269 ) (177 ) Provision for Stanford and other significant litigation (11 ) — (11 ) (50 ) Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses (36 ) — (36 ) — Unallocated, net (i) 1 (36 ) (19 ) (73 ) Income from operations 110 88 738 551 Interest expense 49 46 188 184 Other (income)/expense, net (18 ) 1 61 27 Income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates $ 79 $ 41 $ 489 $ 340 (i) Includes certain costs, primarily related to corporate functions which are not directly related to the segments, and certain differences between budgeted expenses determined at the beginning of the year and actual expenses that we report for U.S. GAAP purposes.\nOutlook for 2018\nFor 2018, the Company expects constant currency revenue growth of around 3%, and 4% on an organic basis; and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share in the range of $9.88 to $10.12.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a live webcast and conference call to discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017.

Learn more at willistowerswatson.com .\nSelect Questions and Answers\nQ1: U.S. T ax Reform is effective in 2018, why was there an impact on the fourth quarter of 2017?\nU.S. Tax Reform was generally effective for January 1 st , 2018. There were several provisions which impacted the Company in 2017; such as the Accumulated Earnings Tax (AETT) and full expensing of depreciation, which were effective on the date of enactment which was December 22, 2017. In addition, the Company re-measured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted corporate tax rate of 21%.\nQ2: Tax guidance for 2018 indicates a tax rate of approximately 24%. Will you be able to get this tax rate to be more in line with the U.S. corporate rate of 21%?\nWe continue to strive to align our tax rate with the U.S. Corporate income adjusted tax rate of 21%. However, we continue to review all of the implications of U.S. Tax Reform as we receive more clarity from published Treasury guidance over the next few months.\nQ3: Why was an expense related to Pension adjusted from earnings?\nIn 2017, the amount of UK plan transfer payments exceeded the plan’s service and interest cost, which triggered settlement accounting. Settlement accounting requires immediate recognition of a portion of the obligations associated with the plan transfers. For 2017, this resulted in a non-cash charge of $36 million.\nSettlement charges often result due to factors difficult to predict. In this instance, the Pension Freedom Act and the very low interest rates in the U.K. created a situation where the plan transfer payments were more significant than planned. While this could recur again, it is not something we consider as part of our continuing operations and therefore have adjusted.\nQ4: What was the primary driver of the operating income reduction for the IRR segment in the fourth quarter from 8% in 2016 to 2% in 2017?\nOperating margin for IRR included a large investment for new technology and analytics. Also, the segment margins are on reported results and a higher pound, which has a negative impact on margins as the impact on expenses is greater than revenue. We transact some of the GB work revenues in U.S. dollars, but all expenses are paid in GB pounds.\nQ5: Given the renewals that transpired in the fourth quarter, what is your view of the pricing environment?\nFirst, our role as trusted advisers for our clients is to help them manage risk and costs, so we try to manage prices down. However, ultimately, the carriers set the prices.\nIn primary lines, we saw a range of pricing, but think pricing was neutral to our revenues on the whole. In the reinsurance market, we saw property casualty rates in the range of flat to 7.5% increases. However, for the global portfolio of reinsurance products, pricing swings were up and down based on products and geography. Overall, we were neutral to perhaps a bit positive on pricing for fourth quarter reinsurance with most lines and geographies ceasing the rate decreases we have seen for the last 4 to 5 years.\nHowever, we wouldn’t suggest a hard market for either the primary or reinsurance markets, but it seems to be more positive than last year.\nQ6: What was the impact of foreign currency movement for the fourth quarter and full year?\nRevenues included $54 million of positive currency movement in the fourth quarter and $27 million of negative currency movement for the full year. The impact of currency fluctuations, net of hedging on adjusted earnings per share was positive $0.04 in the fourth quarter and negative $0.12 for the full year.\nQ7: The dollar has had a big move, so how should we be thinking about the benefit of that for 2018?\nThe US dollar has weakened here in January 2018. If the dollar doesn’t move going forward, foreign exchange could help us in 2018. If the dollar moves directionally against our top three currencies that we have, the pound, euro, Canadian dollar, a 5% change would have a positive impact of approximately $5 million, net of tax, on operating earnings or $0.04 AEPS on operating earnings.\nQ8: What is included in the provision for significant litigation that was adjusted from earnings?\nThis specific matter was related to litigation with the City of Houston for pension actuarial work performed for a pension fund for certain municipal employees. Willis Towers Watson no longer performs actuarial work for states or municipalities or for pension funds for state or municipal employees, having exited this business more than a decade ago.\nWillis Towers Watson Non-GAAP Measures\nIn order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning, we present the following non-GAAP measures: (1) Adjusted Revenues, (2) Constant Currency Change, (3) Organic Change, (4) Adjusted Operating Income, (5) Adjusted EBITDA, (6) Adjusted Net Income, (7) Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, (8) Adjusted Income Before Taxes, (9) Adjusted Income Taxes/Rate and (10) Free Cash Flow. The Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results.\nWithin these measures, we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include the following:\nRestructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or one-time Merger-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when these programs will have concluded. Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses - Adjustment to remove significant pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses to better present how the Company is performing. Fair value adjustment to deferred revenue – Adjustment in 2016 to normalize for the deferred revenue written down as part of the purchase accounting for the Merger. Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gain or loss resulting from disposed operations. Provision for Stanford and other significant litigation - The 2016 provision for the Stanford litigation matter, which we consider to be a non-ordinary course litigation matter. We will also include other litigation matters which we believe have a significant effect on our operating results. Venezuelan currency devaluation - Foreign exchange losses incurred as a consequence of the Venezuelan government’s enforced changes to exchange rate mechanisms. Tax effects of internal reorganizations - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of internal reorganizations of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries. Tax effect of U.S. Tax Reform - Relates to the (1) U.S. income tax adjustment of deferred taxes upon the change in the federal corporate tax rate, (2) impact of the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits, and (3) the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with the U.S. tax on certain foreign earnings offset with a write-off of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable under U.S. Tax Reform. Deferred tax valuation allowance - Adjustment to remove the effects of a release of the valuation allowance against certain U.S. deferred tax assets.\nWillis Towers Watson evaluates revenue on an as reported, adjusted, constant currency and organic basis. We believe disclosing adjusted, constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how Willis Towers Watson evaluates its performance internally.\nWillis Towers Watson considers Adjusted Revenues, Constant Currency Change, Organic Change, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Income before taxes, Adjusted Income Taxes/Rate and Free Cash Flow to be important financial measures, which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating and liquidity results against our competitors. These non-GAAP measures are important in illustrating what Willis Towers Watson’s comparable operating and liquidity results would have been had Willis Towers Watson not incurred transaction-related and non-recurring items. Willis Towers Watson’s non-GAAP measures and their accompanying definitions are presented as follows:\nAdjusted Revenues – presents relevant period-over-period comparisons of revenues by excluding the impact of purchase accounting rules and is defined as: Total Revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue.\nConstant Currency Change – represents the year over year change in revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenues, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenues, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.\nOrganic Change – excludes both the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above, as well as the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not incurred these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these translation-related items can vary from period to period.\nAdjusted Operating Income – Income from Operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA – Net Income adjusted for provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.\nAdjusted Net Income – Net Income Attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue, gain/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments and the tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share – Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average shares of common stock, diluted.\nAdjusted Income Before Taxes – Income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment of deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.\nAdjusted Income Taxes/Rate – Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, significant litigation settlements, significant pension settlement and curtailment activity, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain/loss on disposal of operations, tax effects of internal reorganizations and U.S. Tax Reform, and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the Adjusted Income Tax Rate which is calculated by dividing Adjusted Income Before Taxes by Adjusted Income Taxes.\nFree Cash Flow – Cash Flows from Operating Activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use. Free Cash Flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our consolidated financial statements.\nReconciliations of these measures are included in the accompanying tables with the following exception.\nThe Company does not reconcile its forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures (including the information under “Outlook for 2018” above), due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information, such as foreign currency impacts necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is available to the Company without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures.\nWillis Towers Watson Forward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
