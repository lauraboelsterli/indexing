    "text": "Philadelphia, PA, Laborocity, the fastest growing on-demand hiring platform in the United States today announced it is merging with Boston-based GladlyDo and expanding to Boston and New York City. The company is disrupting an age-old staffing model by allowing businesses to fill its labor gaps online with pre-screened and qualified workers instantly.\n“Combining forces with the GladlyDo team has put us in a position to really accelerate our growth into new cities.“– Joe Barba, Founder of Laborocity.\nLaborocity, formerly LaborOnDemand, has been providing on-demand labor services to construction, restoration, demolition, offices, and event staffing businesses in Philadelphia since 2014. In late 2016, Barba met Woody Klemmer, CEO of a Boston-based competitor, GladlyDo, and after a few initial meetings the synergies were evident. In early 2017, LaborOnDemand and GladlyDo agreed to merge and formed Laborocity.\n“We both were looking at the ‘staffing’ industry the way I imagine Uber looked at the taxi industry – age-old business model that is ripe for disruption.”– Woody Klemmer, Laborocity Co-Founder.\nPosting, searching, screening, hiring, and retaining employees is one of the greatest challenges businesses face as they grow. Low unemployment is only making this more difficult. Laborocity solves this problem using a proprietary recruiting, screening, and intelligent matching algorithm that instantly provides businesses with highly qualified workers , or “Doers”, on-demand.\nSince launching the new brand in May 2017, Laborocity has seen 1400% revenue growth and quadrupled its full-time employees. The construction market in particular is ripe for Laborocity as the supply for workers continues to tighten in a low-unemployment economy. Meanwhile, demand continues to rise due to the real estate and construction boom the country is currently experiencing. In fact, according to an October 2017 Costar Report, there are over 381,000 open construction jobs in the U.S. This trend will likely continue given the new tax-cuts , stricter immigration laws , and a potential trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that could provide a massive tailwind to the industry.\nLaborocity allows businesses to hire qualified workers on-demand at the push of a button. “Doers” are taken through a thorough vetting process that includes an interview and background check and they come fully insured. Less than 5% of applicants make it on to the platform...“Our secret sauce is really our ability to hire well. The Doers are our product, our service, and our brand, so we pride ourselves on providing only the best of the best” says Lynn Bruder, CEO of Laborocity. Laborocity currently offers services in the general labor, event staffing, office work, and consulting space.\nLaborocity saves businesses time, energy, and money and provides them a superior solution to what is currently available in the market. You can hire Doers instantly by visiting Laborocity.com\nAbout Laborocity:\nLaborocity , formerly LaborOnDemand and GladlyDo, is a leading on-demand hiring platform reinventing the way companies hire quality workers. Laborocity was built to help reduce the headache and costs associated with hiring quality workers, or “Doers”, in Philadelphia, Boston, and New York areas. Laborocity solves businesses’ immediate hiring needs around the clock with just a few clicks. Clients can access Laborocity’s on-demand service anytime from anywhere, allowing businesses and ‘Doers’ to connect and get hired in real-time.\nAttachments:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/78cc4923-899e-47d1-9d33-ee2658b78c31\nJennifer Sherlock Laborocity 2679695791 jsherlock@jennacommunications.com\nSource: Laborocity",
