    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 9 (Reuters) - China plans to launch its long-awaited crude oil futures contract on March 26, two sources familiar with the situation said on Friday, a move that will potentially shake up pricing of the world’s largest commodity market.\nThe sources declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.\nThe country’s securities regulator, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which is part of ShFE and will operate the contract, declined to comment.
