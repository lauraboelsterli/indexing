    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Xerox Corporation (\"Xerox\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: XRX). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 9980.\nThe investigation concerns whether Xerox and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n[Click here to join a class action]\nOn February 13, 2018, media outlets reported that Xerox's third-largest shareholder, Darwin Deason, had filed a lawsuit in New York state court, seeking to enjoin Xerox from completing a merger with Fujifilm Holding Corporation (\"Fujifilm\"). Deason's lawsuit alleges fraud, claiming that Xerox concealed from its investors the fact that the deal with Fujifilm includes a \"crown jewel lock-up right that allows Fuji to control Xerox's intellectual property and manufacturing rights in the $36 billion Asia-Pacific market in the event Xerox were to sell to another suitor.\"\nOn this news, Xerox's share price fell $0.78, or 2.6%, to close at $29.17 on February 13, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com .\nCONTACT:\nRobert S.
