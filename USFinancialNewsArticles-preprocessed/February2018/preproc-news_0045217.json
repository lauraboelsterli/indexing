    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CVR Partners, LP (NYSE: UAN), a manufacturer of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution fertilizer products, today announced a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $27.4 million, or 24 cents per common unit, on net sales of $78.2 million, compared to a net loss of $14.5 million, or 13 cents per common unit, on net sales of $84.9 million for the fourth quarter a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $18.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor full year 2017, CVR Partners had a net loss of $72.8 million, or 64 cents per common unit, on net sales of $330.8 million, compared to a net loss of $26.9 million, or 26 cents per common unit, on net sales of $356.3 million for full year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2017 was $65.8 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $92.7 million for the previous year.\nCVR Partners' results include the results of the East Dubuque fertilizer facility beginning April 1, 2016.\n\"We were pleased with the overall operating performance of our Coffeyville plant during the 2017 fourth quarter,\" said Mark Pytosh, chief executive officer. \"The fall ammonia application was much stronger in the 2017 fourth quarter than the previous year, leading to lower customer product inventories compared to last year.\n\"So far in 2018, we have seen lower nitrogen product imports, steady customer demand and increasing prices for nitrogen,\" Pytosh said. \"For the spring, most industry participants are expecting approximately 90 million corn acres to be planted.\"\nConsolidated Operations\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $132 per ton and $264 per ton, respectively. Consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $147 per ton and $352 per ton, respectively, for the same period in 2016.\nCVR Partners' fertilizer facilities produced a combined 199,500 tons of ammonia during the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 64,100 net tons were available for sale while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 306,100 tons of UAN. In the 2016 fourth quarter, the fertilizer facilities produced 207,600 tons of ammonia, of which 62,600 net tons were available for sale while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 330,700 tons of UAN.\nDistributions\nCVR Partners will not pay a cash distribution for the 2017 fourth quarter. CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices received for its finished products, maintenance capital expenditures, and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nCVR Partners previously announced that it will host its 2017 fourth quarter Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, Feb. 22, at 11 a.m. Eastern.
