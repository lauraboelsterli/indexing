    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average fell on Friday on weakness in most sectors, with banking stocks down on worries that domestic bond yields would be kept low after the central bank conducted a special bond purchase operation to curb rising yields.\nKyocera Corp tumbled 6.6 percent and was the biggest negative contributor to the Nikkei after it cut its annual net profit outlook.\nThe Nikkei dropped 0.9 percent to 23,274.53. For the week, it dropped 1.5 percent.\nThe broader Topix shed 0.3 percent to 1,864.20, with 26 of its 33 sectors falling.\nThe Bank of Japan on Friday conducted a special bond purchase operation to stem the rise in Japanese bond yields, offering to buy an unlimited amount of JGBs with more than five to ten years left to maturity.\nBank shares, which rose the previous day after some banks posted upbeat earnings results, lost ground. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed 1.4 percent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group fell 1.2 percent and Mizuho Financial Group declined 1.1 percent.\nBucking the weakness, Kobe Steel jumped 5.8 percent after it reinstated its annual profit forecast.
