    "text": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - Demand for global air freight, measured in freight tonne kilometres, rose 9 percent in 2017, recording the strongest performance since the rebound after the financial crisis in 2010, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday.\nAvailable capacity rose 3 percent and load factors rose by 2.5 percentage points to 45 percent.\nIn December global air freight demand rose 5.7 percent and available capacity grew 3.3 percent.\nIATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac said the outlook for air fright in 2018 is optimistic, with buoyant consumer confidence and growing strength in international e-commerce, but the overall pace of growth was expected to slow to a “healthy” 4.5 percent.
