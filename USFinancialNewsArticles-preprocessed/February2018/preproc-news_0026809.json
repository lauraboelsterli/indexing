    "text": "BANGKOK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Thai commercial banks’ loans may increase 6-8 percent this year after rising 4.4 percent in 2017, reflecting the improving economy, a senior central bank official said on Monday.\nNon-performing loans (NPLs) likely peaked in the final quarter of last year and might fall slightly in 2018, Daranee Saeju, a senior director of the Bank of Thailand’s financial institutions strategy department, told reporters.\nBanks’ NPLs rose to 2.91 percent of loans at the end of last year, totalling 429 billion baht ($13.57 billion), compared with 2.83 percent at end-2016, the BOT said.\nThe central bank has forecast economic growth of 3.9 percent for both this year and in 2017. A BOT official recently said growth in 2017 might be 4 percent, when the state planning agency announces official GDP data on Feb. 19.\nSoutheast Asia’s second-largest economy grew 3.2 percent last year, less than regional peers.\n($1 = 31.6200 baht)\nReporting by Kitiphong Thaichareon; Writing by Orathai Sriring; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
