    "text": "(Reuters) - Aero parts maker United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) is exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners, Chief Executive Greg Hayes said at the Barclays investor conference in Miami on Wednesday.\nHayes said a decision on whether UTC, which makes Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air conditioners, would be a more “valuable property together” or “better off in three separate businesses” by the end of 2018.\n“The real question is do you get a significant multiple expansion by having separate companies versus the conglomerate or the four businesses of UTC? Tough, tough questions. I would tell you that we’re looking at all of those possibilities,” Hayes said.\nThe CEO’s comment comes nearly a month after he indicated that a review was possible only after the closure of its acquisition of avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ) by the third quarter of 2018.\nHayes said on Wednesday if the company were to split, its aerospace business would have about $45 billion to $50 billion in sales, Otis elevators unit about $12 billion to $13 billion, and the climate-control business about $17 billion to $18 billion.\n“That’s the question for the board. That’s the question we continue to study,” he said.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
