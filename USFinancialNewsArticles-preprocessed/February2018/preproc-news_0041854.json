    "text": "HOUSTON, Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE:EEP) (EEP or the Partnership) today reported fourth quarter 2017 financial results and provided a quarterly business update.\nFOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS\nFourth quarter loss of $6 million and full year net income of $245 million; Fourth quarter and full year cash provided by operating activities of $112 million and $500 million, respectively\nFourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $430 million and $1,667 million; Fourth quarter and full year distributable cash flow (DCF) of $211 million and $784 million, respectively\nAdvanced Line 3 Replacement Project with construction underway in Canada; Minnesota regulatory process reaffirmed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), permit decisions expected in the second quarter of 2018\nAnnounced quarterly distribution of $0.35 per unit, or $1.40 on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017\nPRESIDENT'S COMMENT\n\"2017 was an important transitional year for EEP,\" commented Mark Maki, President of the Partnership. \"EEP is now well positioned with one of the lowest business risk profiles in the sector. Following the restructuring announced earlier in 2017, our stable financial results have reflected this enhanced value proposition and we have finished the year in-line with our guidance expectations. We now look forward to 2018 to continue to provide investors with reliable financial results and stable distributions from one of North America's most strategically positioned liquids pipeline infrastructure assets.\"\nFINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY\nEEP reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods in 2016, as summarized in the table below:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n(unaudited; in millions, except per unit amounts)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) (1)\n$\n(6)\n$\n81\n$\n245\n$\n(162)\nNet income (loss) per unit (basic and diluted)\n$\n(0.05)\n$\n0.08\n$\n0.50\n$\n(1.08)\nOperating Cash Flow\n$\n112\n$\n455\n$\n500\n$\n1,416\nAdjusted EBITDA (2)\n$\n430\n$\n469\n$\n1,667\n$\n1,881\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n211\n$\n221\n$\n784\n$\n943\nCoverage Ratio (as declared)\n1.30\n0.83\n1.22\n0.90\nAdjusted net income (1)\n$\n122\n$\n104\n$\n365\n$\n442\nAdjusted net income per unit (basic and diluted)\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.80\n$\n0.62\n(1) Net income and adjusted net income attributable to general and limited partner ownership interests in Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.\n(2) Includes noncontrolling interests\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $87 million over the same period from the prior year primarily driven by a non-recurring earnings charge of $168 million related to the termination of interest rate swaps due to updated funding plan assumptions.\nNet income for the full year increased by $407 million over the prior year primarily due to the absence of an asset impairment loss of $490 million, net of noncontrolling interest, related to the Sandpiper project in 2016. Results also include losses from the Midcoast assets which were sold to an affiliate of Enbridge Inc. in the second quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, eliminate the effect of: (a) non-cash, mark-to-market net gains and losses; and (b) other adjustments, including the derivative settlement noted above. Refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliations Appendices below for additional details.\nFourth quarter and full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA were down $39 million and $214 million respectively. The biggest driver of the period over period variances was the sale of the Midcoast assets in the second quarter of 2017.\nFourth quarter and full year 2017 operating cash flow decreased $343 million and $916 million, respectively, primarily due to the termination of interest rate swaps described above and from the absence of operating cash flows from the Midcoast assets. Full year 2017 cash flows also decreased period over period due to the termination of a receivables arrangement with a subsidiary of the general partner as part of the EEP restructuring in the second quarter of 2017 which affected the timing of the collection of receivables.\nDCF for the fourth quarter was $211 million, a decrease of $10 million over the comparable prior period in 2016. Full year 2017 DCF was $784 million compared to $943 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year change in DCF was largely driven by a $214 million reduction in Adjusted EBITDA as discussed in the Segment Results below, as well as a higher allowance for equity used during construction in 2017 related to ongoing construction for the Line 3 Replacement Program, offset by lower maintenance capital in 2017 and a reduction in noncontrolling interests as a result of EEP acquiring an additional 15% interest in Eastern Access.\nPROJECT EXECUTION\nThe U.S. Line 3 Replacement Program, along with the Canadian Program, will support the safety and operational reliability of the mainline system, enhance system flexibility, and allow EEP to optimize throughput on the mainline.\nFollowing the receipt of all required regulatory permitting for the Line 3 Replacement in Canada, construction began in August 2017 on certain Canadian segments of the pipeline and construction will continue through the winter. Regulatory permitting is also in place in North Dakota as well as in Wisconsin where construction is substantially complete.\nIn Minnesota, the MPUC is expected to vote on the Certificate of Need and Route Permit at the end of the second quarter of 2018. In parallel with this process, additional clarification and analysis will be provided to support the adequacy of the Final Environmental Impact Statement, as requested by the MPUC in December. Management continues to anticipate an in-service date for the project in the second half of 2019.\nU.S. TAX REFORM\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States implemented U.S. Tax Reform. The \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA) was signed into law and became enacted for tax purposes. Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxation years beginning after December 31, 2017. The most significant change included in the TCJA was a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nThis tax rate change is expected to cause Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. to reduce the income tax allowance component of the tolls in its FERC regulated cost-of-service based Facility Surcharge Mechanism (FSM) projects. Impacts of tax reform will be realized in the first quarter of 2018 and will be reflected in Lakehead's FSM toll filing for rates effective April 1, 2018. The total annual impact to EEP is expected to be roughly $55 million per year, net of noncontrolling interests.\nAs a result of the U.S. Tax Reform, EEP is adjusting its 2018 DCF guidance range to $720 million - $770 million from $775 million - $825 million and total distribution coverage in 2018 to approximately 1.15x from approximately 1.2x. Target consolidated Debt to EBITDA guidance remains unchanged.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nFor purposes of evaluating performance of the Partnership, we make adjustments for unusual, non-recurring or non-operating factors to our reported earnings, segment EBITDA, and cash flow provided by operating activities, as it allows Management and our investors to more accurately compare the Partnership's performance across periods and the factors being adjusted for are not indicative of the underlying performance and cash flows of the business. Schedules reconciling adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA by segment, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common share and distributable cash flow to their closest GAAP equivalent are available at www.enbridgepartners.com and as an Appendix to this news release.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n(unaudited; in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nLakehead\n$\n351\n$\n379\n$\n1,388\n$\n1,470\nMid-Continent\n18\n22\n59\n93\nBakken Assets\n59\n32\n227\n(599)\nTotal Liquids EBITDA\n$\n428\n$\n433\n$\n1,674\n$\n964\nOther\n(3)\n(1)\n(7)\n(9)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(6)\n$\n81\n$\n245\n$\n(162)\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n(unaudited; in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nLakehead\n$\n360\n$\n374\n$\n1,415\n$\n1,466\nMid-Continent\n17\n23\n60\n94\nBakken Assets\n56\n37\n177\n171\nTotal Liquids Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n433\n$\n434\n$\n1,652\n$\n1,731\nOther (1)\n(3)\n35\n15\n150\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n430\n$\n469\n$\n1,667\n$\n1,881\n(1) Includes the adjusted results of our disposed Natural Gas segment for the comparative periods.\nLiquids\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total Liquids segment remained essentially unchanged at $433 million over the comparable period in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased on the Lakehead System, for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017, as a result of a lower Lakehead System Local Toll and higher operating costs which will be partially recoverable in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA decreased from the Mid-Continent System as a result of the sale of Ozark Pipeline on March 1, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA from the Bakken assets increased as a result of the Bakken Pipeline System, which was placed into service in June 2017, and continued steady results from the legacy pipeline system.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\nLiquids Systems Volumes\n(thousand barrels per day)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nLakehead System:\nUnited States\n2,085\n2,001\n2,027\n1,968\nCanada\n639\n623\n646\n606\nTotal Lakehead System delivery volumes\n2,724\n2,624\n2,673\n2,574\nMid-Continent System delivery volumes\n—\n153\n24\n188\nBakken Assets:\nNorth Dakota System to Clearbrook\n216\n213\n214\n216\nBakken System to Cromer (1)\n108\n123\n115\n136\nTotal Bakken Assets delivery volumes\n324\n336\n329\n352\nTotal Liquids segment delivery volumes\n3,048\n3,113\n3,026\n3,114\n(1) Lower spot volumes on the Bakken Pipeline a component of the Bakken assets that delivers volumes into Cromer, Manitoba.\nOther\nOther primarily reflects the results of the Midcoast gas gathering and processing assets.

Any statements regarding sponsor expectations or intentions are based on information communicated to the Partnership by Enbridge Inc., but there can be no assurance that these expectations or intentions will not change in the future.\nExcept to the extent required by law, we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any , events or otherwise. Reference should also be made to the Partnership's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including its most recently filed 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 15, 2018 and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K for additional factors that may affect results. These filings are available to the public over the Internet at the SEC's website ( www.sec.gov ) and at the Partnership's website.\nAbout Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.\nEnbridge Energy Partners, L.P. owns and operates a diversified portfolio of crude oil transportation systems in the United States. Its principal crude oil system is the largest pipeline transporter of growing oil production from western Canada and the North Dakota Bakken formation.

Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. is traded under the symbol EEP; information about the company is available on its website at www.enbridgepartners.com .\nAbout Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C.\nEnbridge Energy Management, L.L.C. manages the business and affairs of the Partnership, and its sole asset is an approximate 19.9 percent limited partner interest in the Partnership. Enbridge Energy Company, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Enbridge Inc. of Calgary, Alberta, Canada (NYSE: ENB) (TSX: ENB) is the General Partner of the Partnership and holds an approximate 35 percent interest in the Partnership. Enbridge Management is the delegate of the General Partner of the Partnership.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS APPENDICES\nReconciliations of forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges with estimating some of the items, particularly with estimating non-cash unrealized derivative fair value losses and gains, which are subject to market variability and therefore a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\nAdjusted Net Income and Segment Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted net income for the Partnership and adjusted EBITDA for the principal business segment are provided to illustrate trends in income excluding non-cash unrealized derivative fair value losses and gains and other items that Management believes are not indicative of the Partnership's core operating results. The derivative non-cash losses and gains result from marking to market certain financial derivatives used by the Partnership for hedging purposes that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance as prescribed under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Non-GAAP measures no longer include make-up rights and option premium amortization adjustments. These changes were made on a prospective basis beginning with the second quarter of 2016 and are not material for historical periods presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nAdjusted EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is used as a supplemental financial measurement to manage the performance of the entity. Distributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measurement to assess liquidity and the ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and make cash distributions to unitholders. The following reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA and net cash provided by operating activities to distributable cash flow are provided because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures recognized under generally accepted accounting principles.\nAPPENDIX A\nNON-GAAP RECONCILATION EARNINGS TO DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n(unaudited; in millions, except per unit amounts)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to general and limited partner ownership interests in Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.\n$\n(6)\n$\n81\n$\n245\n$\n(162)\nNoncash derivative fair value (gains) losses:\n-Liquids\n4\n2\n3\n9\n-Natural Gas (included in Discontinued Operations)\n—\n19\n(12)\n85\n-Other\n(52)\n3\n(50)\n7\nAccretion of discount on Series 1 preferred units\n—\n1\n8\n5\nMake-up rights adjustment\n—\n—\n—\n1\nLine 2 hydrotest expenses, net of recoveries\n—\n(1)\n—\n(11)\nLine 6A and 6B incident expenses, net of recoveries\n—\n(8)\n—\n(2)\nOption premium amortization\n—\n—\n—\n1\nSandpiper Project wind down costs\n1\n2\n6\n5\nGain on sale of assets\n(4)\n—\n(40)\n1\nSeverance costs\n—\n5\n8\n6\nAsset impairment\n—\n—\n—\n497\nIntegration costs\n11\n—\n29\n—\nPre-issuance hedge termination\n168\n—\n168\n—\nAdjusted net income\n$\n122\n$\n104\n$\n365\n$\n442\nSeries 1 preferred unit distributions\n—\n23\n29\n90\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n106\n86\n345\n329\nDepreciation and amortization\n107\n111\n436\n427\nInterest expense, net\n103\n109\n407\n406\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(8)\n(6)\n(8)\n(1)\nInterest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization - discontinued operations\n—\n42\n93\n188\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n430\n$\n469\n$\n1,667\n$\n1,881\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(110)\n(122)\n(418)\n(467)\nInterest expense, net (1)(2)(3)\n(97)\n(109)\n(398)\n(413)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n8\n6\n8\n(1)\nDistributions in excess of equity earnings\n5\n—\n8\n6\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n(10)\n(20)\n(36)\n(55)\nAllowance for equity used during construction (4)\n(14)\n—\n(47)\n—\nOther\n(1)\n(3)\n—\n(8)\nDCF\n$\n211\n$\n221\n$\n784\n$\n943\n(1)\nExcludes unrealized mark-to-market net gains of $52 million and $50 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively.
