    "text": "TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO:6503) announced today its consolidated financial results for the first 9 months and third quarter, ended December 31, 2017, of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 (fiscal 2018).\n1. Consolidated First 9 Months Results (April 1, 2017 – December 31, 2017)\nNet sales: 3,115.0 billion yen (6% increase from the same period last year) Operating income: 232.4 billion yen (32% increase from the same period last year) Income before income taxes: 277.2 billion yen (41% increase from the same period last year) Net income attributable to Mitsubishi Electric Corp.: 193.1 billion yen (43% increase from the same period last year) In the first 9 months of fiscal 2018, from April through December 2017, the global economy saw a stable status in China, a buoyant expansion in the U.S. and gradual trends of recovery in Japan and Europe. In addition, the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar and the euro in and after May compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, but became stronger against the U.S. dollar after the latter half of November.\nUnder these circumstances, consolidated net sales for the first 9 months of fiscal 2018 increased by 6% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year to 3,115.0 billion yen due primarily to increased sales in the Energy and Electric Systems, Industrial Automation Systems, Electronic Devices and Home Appliances segments.\nConsolidated operating income increased by 32% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year to 232.4 billion yen, due to increased profits in the Energy and Electric Systems, Industrial Automation Systems, Information and Communication Systems and Electronic Devices segments.\nIncome before income taxes increased by 41% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year to 277.2 billion yen, due primarily to an increased operating income, recording a gain from sales of investment securities in Renesas Electronics Corporation, and an improvement of exchange gains and losses.\nNet income attributable to Mitsubishi Electric Corporation increased by 43% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year to 193.1 billion yen.\n2. Consolidated Third-quarter Results (October 1, 2017 – December 31, 2017)\nNet sales: 1,038.6 billion yen (7% increase from the same period last year) Operating income: 83.1 billion yen (54% increase from the same period last year) Income before income taxes: 91.9 billion yen (27% increase from the same period last year) Net income attributable to Mitsubishi Electric Corp.: 61.9 billion yen (32% increase from the same period last year) Consolidated net sales for this quarter, from October through December 2017, was 1,038.6 billion yen, a 7% increase from the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to increased sales in all segments.\nConsolidated operating income was 83.1 billion yen, an increase of 54% from the same period of the previous fiscal year, with increased profits in the Energy and Electric Systems, Industrial Automation Systems, Information and Communication Systems, Electronic Devices and Home appliances segments.\nIncome before income taxes increased by 27% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year to 91.9 billion yen due primarily to an increased operating income despite a decrease of gain on foreign exchange in the same period of the previous fiscal year.\nNet income attributable to Mitsubishi Electric Corporation increased by 32% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year to 61.9 billion yen.\nForecast for Fiscal 2018 (year ending March 31, 2018)\nAs a result of the weaker yen as well as the growth expected in the Industrial Automation Systems segment in which it sees an increase in demand for capital expenditures mainly in Asia, the company’s consolidated earnings forecast for fiscal 2018, ending March 31, 2018, has been revised from the announcement on October 31, 2017 as stated below.\nConsolidated Earnings Forecast for Fiscal 2018\nConsolidated Previous forecast\n(announced Oct. 31)\nCurrent forecast Net sales: 4,390.0 billion yen 4,420.0 billion yen (4% increase from fiscal 2017) Operating income: 315.0 billion yen 325.0 billion yen (20% increase from fiscal 2017) Income before income taxes: 350.0 billion yen 370.0 billion yen (25% increase from fiscal 2017) Net income attributable to Mitsubishi Electric Corp.:\n250.0 billion yen 265.0 billion yen (26% increase from fiscal 2017) The exchange rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 remains unchanged from the previous announcement at 105 yen to the U.S. dollar, while the exchange rate to the euro has been revised to 125 yen, five yen weaker than the previous rate. Note :\nThe results forecast above is based on assumptions deemed reasonable by the Company at the present time, and actual results may differ significantly from forecasts. Please refer to the cautionary statement at the end.\nAbout Mitsubishi Electric Corporation\nWith over 90 years of experience in providing reliable, high-quality products, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (TOKYO:6503) is a recognized world leader in the manufacture, marketing and sales of electrical and electronic equipment used in information processing and communications, space development and satellite communications, consumer electronics, industrial technology, energy, transportation and building equipment.
