(NYSE:AAT) (the “company”) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Results and Recent Developments\nNet income available to common stockholders of $7.1 million and $29.1 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, or $0.15 and $0.62 per diluted share, respectively Funds From Operations (\"FFO\") decreased 4% and increased 4% year-over-year to $0.46 and $1.92 per diluted share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Reaffirming 2018 FFO annual guidance range of $2.01 to $2.09 per diluted share Same-store cash NOI decreased 2.1% and 0.2% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Leased approximately 20,000 comparable office square feet at an average GAAP-basis and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 21% and 11%, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 Leased approximately 45,000 comparable retail square feet at an average GAAP-basis contractual rent and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 52% and 35%, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 Credit facility amended and restated to increase the revolving line of credit, extend maturity date and decrease credit spreads Term loan agreement amended to decrease credit spreads\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $7.1 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.9 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense at Lloyd District Portfolio and increase in general and administrative expenses during the period related to a one-time non-cash charge associated with the vesting modification of previously granted restricted stock awards. The vesting modification was approved by our compensation committee during to adjust vesting based on their analysis of our relative total shareholder return over a three year period instead of our prior performance metric of relative forward FFO multiple. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $29.1 million, or $0.62 per basic and diluted share compared to $32.6 million, or $0.72 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributed to the acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017 and an increase in general and administrative expenses, as previously noted.\nDuring , the company generated funds from operations (“FFO”) for common stockholders of $29.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $30.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in FFO from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense and general and administrative expenses during the period, as noted above. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated FFO for common stockholders of $123.2 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $116.8 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in FFO from the prior year was primarily due to additional operating income from Hassalo on Eighth due to an increase in the percentage leased, the acquisitions of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017 and Gateway Marketplace on July 6, 2017, offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses during the period, as noted above.\nFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.\nPortfolio Results\nThe portfolio leased status as of the end of the indicated quarter was as follows:\nDecember 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Total Portfolio Retail (1) 96.8 % 97.0 % 96.6 % Office 88.4 % 89.9 % 90.1 % Multifamily (2) 91.8 % 91.3 % 90.3 % Mixed-Use: Retail 96.9 % 93.7 % 98.7 % Hotel 92.5 % 92.7 % 89.8 % Same-Store Portfolio Retail (1) 97.1 % 97.2 % 96.9 % Office 88.4 % 89.9 % 90.1 % Multifamily (2)(3) 92.1 % 91.6 % 90.3 % Mixed-Use: Retail 96.9 % 93.7 % 98.7 % Hotel 92.5 % 92.7 % 89.8 % (1) Total retail leased percentage includes the retail components of Hassalo on Eighth.

On a same-store cash basis, retail NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased from the prior period due to higher annualized base rents at Carmel Mountain Plaza and Del Monte Center.

This increase was achieved notwithstanding the current repositioning of 21 off-line units at Loma Palisades, which was recently completed at the end of .\nOn a same-store GAAP basis, mixed-use NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the corresponding period in 2016. On a same-store cash basis mixed-use NOI decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the percentage leased at the retail portion of our mixed-use property. On a same-store GAAP and cash basis, mixed-use NOI decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in the percentage leased at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.\nCredit Facility and Term Loan Agreement\nOn January 9, 2018, our credit agreement was amended and restated to, among other things, (1) increase the revolving line of credit from $250 million to $350 million, (2) extend the maturity date of the restated $350 million revolving line of credit to January 9, 2022 (with two-, six-month extension options), (3) decrease the applicable leverage-based and ratings-based pricing spreads and (4) include an accordion feature to allow us to increase the revolving line of credit from its current $350 million to up to $700 million, subject to certain conditions.

FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nCash Net Operating Income\nThe company uses cash net operating income (\"NOI\") internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties. The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2) the cost of funds of the property owner, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nCash NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the company's cash NOI may not be comparable to the cash NOIs of other REITs.\nAbout American Assets Trust, Inc.\nAmerican Assets Trust, Inc.
