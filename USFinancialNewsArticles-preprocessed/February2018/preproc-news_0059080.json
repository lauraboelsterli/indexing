    "text": "NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PRA Group (Nasdaq:PRAA), a global leader in acquiring and collecting nonperforming loans, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. The company reported net income of $86.9 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $17.6 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share were $1.92 versus a loss of $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017 net income was $162.3 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, versus $85.1 million or $1.83 per diluted share in the prior year. Financial performance in the quarter was impacted by certain special items including a one-time, net after-tax benefit of $73.2 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, pre-tax expense of $1.7 million from the impairment of a legacy PRA Group Europe passive investment, and after-tax expense of $2.0 million related to redeemable noncontrolling interest in a Polish securitization fund.\n“PRA Group had a productive fourth quarter increasing cash collections 8%, investing significant capital with a record quarter in Americas Core, increasing estimated remaining collections (ERC) to $5.70 billion and increasing the number of net new full-time U.S. based collectors to over 2,725,” said Kevin Stevenson, president and chief executive officer. “In 2017, we raised capital to prepare for additional portfolio investment, invested record amounts in Americas Core and Americas Insolvency, announced the opening of two new call centers in the U.S., added over 1,100 net new full-time U.S. based collectors, and collected more cash than ever in Europe Core. I am extremely pleased by what we have accomplished this year.”\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nCash collections of $376.3 million, an increase of 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Americas Insolvency collections increased 12% versus the prior year quarter. Europe Core cash collections increased 10%. Americas Core cash collections increased 6% with U.S. call center cash collections increasing 16%. Investment in portfolios was $374.6 million, an increase of 87% versus the prior year quarter. Over 2,725 full-time U.S. based collectors, an increase of 70% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. ERC of $5.70 billion, an increase of 5% versus the third quarter of 2017.\nFull Year Highlights\nRaised capital in anticipation of increased investment opportunity in the U.S. Set a record level of total investment of $1.11 billion, excluding business acquisitions, as well as set records in both Americas Core and Americas Insolvency. Opened two new call centers in the U.S. to accommodate increased portfolio investment. Added over 1,100 net new full-time U.S. based collectors. Collected more cash than ever before in Europe Core. Made significant operational improvements in Europe. Cash collections of $1.51 billion, an increase of 1% versus 2016 driven largely by a 6% increase in U.S. call center cash collections. ERC increased $656 million, or 13%, from the end of 2016.\nCash Collections and Revenues\nThe following table presents cash collections by quarter and by source on an as reported and currency-adjusted basis:\nCash Collection Source 2017\n2016 ($ in thousands) Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Americas-Core $ 204,245 $ 212,756 $ 217,020 $ 226,906 $ 193,360 Americas-Insolvency 59,103 60,436 53,163 49,813 52,988 Europe-Core 107,124 102,681 99,121 98,081 97,429 Europe-Insolvency 5,794 5,961 5,371 5,030 4,974 Total Cash Collections $ 376,266 $ 381,834 $ 374,675 $ 379,830 $ 348,751 Cash Collection Source - Constant Currency Adjusted 2017 2016 ($ in thousands) Q4 Q4 Americas-Core $ 204,245 $ 193,867 Americas-Insolvency 59,103 53,170 Europe-Core 107,124 104,892 Europe-Insolvency 5,794 5,354 Total Cash Collections $ 376,266 $ 357,283 Cash collections in the quarter increased 8% versus the prior year quarter. U.S. call center cash collections increased 16% primarily from hiring additional collectors and portfolio acquisitions. Americas Insolvency cash collections increased 12% primarily as a result of increased portfolio purchases in 2017. This was partially offset by a decrease of 5% in U.S. legal cash collections. Full year cash collections increased 1% driven primarily by growth in U.S. call center cash collections. Net finance receivable revenue increased 50% versus the prior year quarter due to an outsized allowance charge in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, net finance receivable revenue was increased by significant portfolio investment and yield increases on certain pools. For the full year, net finance receivable revenue increased 5%. Fee income declined 71% primarily as a result of the sale of two fee-based subsidiaries earlier in the year. For the full year, fee income declined 68%.\nExpenses\nOperating expenses in the quarter increased from the previous year largely due to increases in compensation and employee services expense. This is due to the increase in the number of U.S. based collectors as the Company accommodates growth in supply of nonperforming loans domestically. This was partially offset by lower legal collection expenses due to fewer accounts qualifying for the legal collections channel and lower agency fees due to the sale of subsidiaries earlier in the year. For the full year, operating expenses decreased 2%. During the quarter, the Company recorded $5.3 million in pre-tax, noncash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs, a $0.4 million expense on interest rate swap agreements, and $1.0 million in amortization of intangible assets. The full year effective tax rate was negative due to a revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The revaluation resulted in a provisional decrease to net deferred tax liabilities. The net, after-tax impact related to the revaluation of the deferred tax liability was $73.2 million.\nPortfolio Acquisitions\nPRA Group invested $374.6 million in new finance receivables in the fourth quarter. The Company had in place forward flow commitments as of the end of 2017 for the purchase of nonperforming loans during 2018 with a maximum purchase price of $203.2 million.\nPortfolio Purchase Source 2017\n2016 ($ in thousands) Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Americas-Core $ 160,278 $ 115,572 $ 144,871 $ 115,166 $ 91,800 Americas-Insolvency 44,195 73,497 100,040 67,123 20,929 Europe-Core 152,417 14,695 42,876 39,505 80,129 Europe-Insolvency 17,698 7,146 7,860 6,020 6,943 Total Portfolio Purchasing $ 374,588 $ 210,910 $ 295,647 $ 227,814 $ 199,801 Conference Call Information\nPRA Group will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss results with institutional investors and stock analysts.
