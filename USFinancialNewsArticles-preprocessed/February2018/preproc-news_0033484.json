    "text": "NEW YORK, Notice is hereby given that Monteverde & Associates PC has filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for The District of Delaware, case no. 1:18-cv-00230, on behalf of shareholders of Kindred Healthcare, Inc., (\"Kindred\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: KND) who held Kindred securities and have been harmed by Kindred and its board of directors' (the \"Board\") for alleged violations of Sections 14(a), and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in connection with the merger of the Company to affiliates of each of TPG and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, and Humana Inc. (collectively, the \"The Consortium\").\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Kindred shareholders will receive $9.00 in cash for each share of common stock they own (the \"MergerConsideration\"). The complaint alleges that this offer is inadequate and that the Registration Statement in Form S-4 (the \"Proxy\") provides materially incomplete and misleading information about the Company's financials and the transaction, in violation of Sections 14(a), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Specifically, the Proxy contains materially incomplete and misleading information concerning: (i) the Company's financial projections; and (ii) the valuation analyses performed by the Company's financial advisors, Barclays Capital Inc. (\"Barclays\") and Guggenheim Securities, LLC (\"Guggenheim\" and together with Barclays, the \"Financial Advisors\"), in support of their fairness opinions.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today.
