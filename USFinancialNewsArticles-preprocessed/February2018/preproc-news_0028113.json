White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump’s view is that his chief of staff is “doing a great job and that he has full faith in him.” \n“I spoke to the president last night,” Conway said in an interview on CNN with Jake Tapper. “He said, ‘please tell Jake that I have full faith in chief of staff John Kelly and that I’m not actively searching for replacements.’ ” \nOn NBC, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said the president has “absolute confidence” in Kelly. Short also disputed reports that Kelly had told the president he was willing to resign over his handling of the allegations against Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who resigned last week after two reports of allegedly abusive behavior toward his ex-wives.",
