    "text": "MADISON, Wis., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Alliant Energy Corporation (NYSE: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for 2017 and 2016 as follows:\nGAAP EPS from\nNon-GAAP EPS\nContinuing Operat ions\nfrom Continuing Operations\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nUtilities and Corporate Services\n$1.82\n$1.75\n$1.80\n$1.75\nAmerican Transmission Company (ATC) Investment\n0.11\n0.10\n0.11\n0.10\nNon-utility and Parent\n0.06\n(0.20)\n0.02\n0.03\nAlliant Energy Consolidated\n$1.99\n$1.65\n$1.93\n$1.88\n\"We once again delivered solid financial and operational results in 2017. Our 2017 temperature normalized Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.99, 6% above calendar year 2016, and consistent with our long-term earnings growth goal,\" said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman and CEO. \"I am proud to report that over the last 5 years we have delivered a total shareholder return of 130%, exceeding the growth of both the S&P 500 and the EEI Utilities Index.\"\nUtilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy's Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $1.82 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2017, which was $0.07 per share higher than 2016. The primary drivers of higher EPS were higher margins resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company's (IPL's) interim retail electric base rate increase implemented in April 2017 and Wisconsin Power and Light's (WPL's) retail electric and gas base rate increases implemented in January 2017. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from rate base additions and updated WPL depreciation rates, higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortization at WPL, and impacts of milder temperatures on retail electric and gas sales in 2017.\nNon-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy's Non-utility and Parent operations generated $0.06 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2017, which was $0.26 per share higher than 2016. The primary drivers of higher EPS were asset valuation charges of $0.23 per share related to the Franklin County wind farm in 2016 and effects of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) in 2017.\nEarnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2017 excludes the write-down of regulatory assets due to the IPL retail electric rate review settlement and the effects of Tax Reform. Non-GAAP EPS for 2016 excludes asset valuation charges of $0.23 per share related to the Franklin County wind farm. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nTemperature impacts to Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations - The estimated impact of milder temperatures on retail electric and gas sales was a $0.06 per share loss in 2017. The temperature normalized Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 is $1.99. Temperature impacts did not affect Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2016.\nDetails regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between 2017 and 2016 for Alliant Energy are as follows:\n2017\n2016\nVariance\nUtilities and Corporate Services:\nHigher margins from IPL interim retail electric base rate increase\n$0.20\n$—\n$0.20\nHigher margins from WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases\n0.19\n—\n0.19\nHigher depreciation expense\n(0.13)\nHigher energy efficiency cost recovery amortization at WPL\n(0.04)\n0.03\n(0.07)\nEstimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales\n(0.06)\n—\n(0.06)\nEffects of Tax Reform\n0.04\n—\n0.04\nChanges in AFUDC (primarily Marshalltown Generating Station)\n(0.03)\nHigher WPL electric fuel-related costs, net of recoveries\n(0.01)\n0.02\n(0.03)\nHigher interest expense\n(0.03)\nNet write-down of regulatory assets due to IPL retail electric rate review settlement\n(0.02)\n—\n(0.02)\nEquity dilution\n(0.02)\n—\n(0.02)\nOther\n0.03\nTotal Utilities and Corporate Services\n$0.07\nATC Investment\n$0.01\nNon-utility and Parent:\nAsset valuation charges for Franklin County wind farm in 2016\n$—\n($0.23)\n$0.23\nEffects of Tax Reform\n0.04\n—\n0.04\nOther\n(0.01)\nTotal Non-utility and Parent\n$0.26\nHigher margins from IPL interim retail electric base rate increase - In April 2017, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers. The request was based on a 2016 historical Test Year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. An interim retail electric rate increase of $102 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective April 13, 2017. The IUB issued a written order in February 2018 approving a final rate increase of $130 million, on an annual basis.\nHigher margins from WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases - In December 2016, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing WPL to implement an increase in annual retail electric and gas rates of $9 million, each. The retail electric rate increase is comprised of a $60 million retail electric base rate increase and a $51 million monitored fuel-related cost decrease.\nEffects of Tax Reform - In December 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. The enactment of Tax Reform had a material impact on the 2017 financial statements since changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. The most significant provision of Tax Reform was the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in December 2017. The net impact of re-measuring deferred taxes associated with the non-utility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax carryforwards resulted in $0.08 of higher EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017. The net impacts of re-measuring deferred taxes associated with regulated utility operations were recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities and expect to be utilized to provide benefits to customers in the future.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nAlliant Energy consolidated EPS guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. We are updating the guidance for the reporting companies as follows:\nUtilities and Corporate Services\n$1.92 - $2.02\nATC Investment\n0.12 - 0.14\nNon-utility and Parent\n0.00 - 0.02\nAlliant Energy consolidated\n$2.04 - $2.18\n\"The 6% earnings growth between 2017 temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS and the midpoint of 2018 earnings guidance is consistent with our projected long-term annual earnings growth rate of 5 to 7% driven by investments in our utility business,\" said Kampling. \"The 2018 guidance is based upon approved retail electric base rates for both WPL and IPL, as well as WPL's approved retail gas base rates. Tax Reform is not forecasted to have a material impact on 2018 earnings.\"\nAssumptions for Alliant Energy's 2018 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:\nAbility of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return Stable economy and resulting implications on utility sales Normal temperatures in its utility service territories Continuing cost controls and operational efficiencies Execution of IPL's and WPL's capital expenditure and financing plans Regulatory treatment of Tax Reform benefits from utility operations Consolidated effective tax rate of 12%\nThe 2018 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, further impacts from anticipated changes to ATC LLC's authorized return on equity, future changes in laws or regulations, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call to review the 2017 results is scheduled for Friday, February 23rd at 9:00 a.m. central time.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as \"forecast,\" \"expect,\" \"guidance,\" or other words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe future financial performance or plans or strategies are forward-looking statements. Such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such statements. Actual results could be materially affected by the following factors, among others:\nIPL's and WPL's ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief to allow for, among other things, earning a return on rate base additions and the recovery of costs, including fuel costs, operating costs, transmission costs, environmental compliance and remediation costs, deferred expenditures, deferred tax assets, capital expenditures, and remaining costs related to electric generating units (EGUs) that may be permanently closed, earning their authorized rates of return, and the payments to their parent of expected levels of dividends; federal and state regulatory or governmental actions, including the impact of energy, tax, financial and health care legislation, and regulatory agency orders; ability to obtain regulatory approval for wind projects with acceptable conditions, to acquire sufficient transmission-ready wind sites, to complete construction within the cost caps set by regulators and to meet all requirements to qualify for the full level of production tax credits;

current or future litigation, regulatory investigations, proceedings or inquiries; reputational damage from negative publicity, protests, fines, penalties and other negative consequences resulting in regulatory and/or legal actions; the effect of accounting standards issued periodically by standard-setting bodies; the ability to successfully complete tax audits and changes in tax accounting methods with no material impact on earnings and cash flows; and factors listed in the \"2018 Earnings Guidance\" section of this press release.\nFor more information about potential factors that could affect Alliant Energy's business and financial results, refer to Alliant Energy's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including the section therein titled \"Risk Factors,\" and its other filings with the SEC.\nWithout limitation, the expectations with respect to 2018 earnings guidance in this press release are forward-looking statements and are based in part on certain assumptions made by Alliant Energy, some of which are referred to in the forward-looking statements. Alliant Energy cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward-looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to be correct. Any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy's ability to achieve the estimates or other targets included in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Alliant Energy undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy's financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 excluding the write-down of regulatory assets due to the IPL retail electric rate review settlement, and the effects of Tax Reform; and (2) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 excluding asset valuation charges related to the Franklin County wind farm. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy's management also uses income from continuing operations, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.\nIn addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL, excluding ATC Investment; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Investment; and Non-utility and Parent EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about Alliant Energy's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.\nThis press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that are reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2017 Form 10-K.\nThis press release also includes temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy's operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy's earnings growth rate.\nThe tax impact adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments that are excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations guidance, in the press release above.\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, all \"per share\" references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.\nALLIANT ENERGY CORPORATION\nFULL YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY (Unaudited)\nThe
