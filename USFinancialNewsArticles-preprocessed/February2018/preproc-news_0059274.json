Reed, New Media President and Chief Executive Officer. “This was a result of strong performance from our stable and growing revenue areas led by UpCurve, GateHouse Live, and circulation revenue. We are further encouraged by the start to the first quarter this year, and expect our organic same store revenue trend to continue to improve over our fourth quarter results.”\n“We have also been working to integrate the Morris Publishing Group acquisition, which contributed to a strong quarter for us. We are also excited about our current pipeline for deals, including the anticipated transactions we are announcing today in Eugene, Oregon and in Massachusetts. The Register-Guard, in Eugene, Oregon, is expected to be a great addition to our footprint in the west, with its long history of being the dominant source of news in the Willamette Valley and over 47,000 Sunday circulation. We are excited that the Baker family has trusted us as the next steward for this paper.”\n“Digital revenue saw a 28.6% increase in the quarter versus prior year, growing to $41.7 million, with UpCurve being the largest driver. UpCurve earned $20.8 million in revenue this quarter, up 31.7% to prior year, and had nearly 15,000 active SMB customers at the close of the year. UpCurve Cloud, our IT services business, continues to see strong growth with revenue increasing 64.2% from prior year. We now fulfill over 100,000 G-Suite and SugarCRM licenses for SMBs nationwide, which has been a great recurring revenue business with less than 10% annual churn. We are very excited about this fast growing area, as it is in high demand with SMBs today.”\n“GateHouse Live, our events division, delivered on its forecast to more than double its revenue in 2017 over the prior year, finishing with $15.7 million. We launched this business in 2015 and it has successfully grown to 235 events in 2017 across our communities. We now have several proven signature events that we have rolled out across our top markets and are investing in both creating new events and further expanding our current events into more markets. We expect continued strong growth from this business in 2018.”\n“Another segment of our business that we are highly focused on is our single largest revenue category, circulation. Importantly this quarter, circulation revenue saw a 90bps improvement over its third quarter trend and was down 0.6% on an organic same store basis to prior year. We are focused on maintaining this trend throughout 2018 as we expect this category to grow to over $500 million in annual revenue for us and we believe its stability will help lead to overall improved organic same store revenue trends.”\n“With the strong close to 2017, we are optimistic in our ability to continue to deliver solid returns for shareholders in 2018. We believe with the continued growth of our new business initiatives and pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, we are well positioned to deliver returns for our shareholders. We are also pleased to announce that our board approved a dividend of $0.37 per share for the quarter, which adds to the total return for our shareholders and shows the confidence we have in our business as we head into 2018.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNew Media recorded total revenues of $394.4 million for the quarter, up 18.2% to the prior year, and down 5.6% on an organic same store basis. This was an improvement of 80bps from the third quarter organic same store trend. Traditional Print Advertising decreased 13.2% on an organic same store basis, an improvement of 80bps from the third quarter trend.

The results of several acquisitions (“tuck-in acquisitions”) were funded from the Company’s available cash and are not considered material. Organic same store revenues are same store revenues adjusted to remove non-material acquisitions and non-material divestitures, and to adjust for Commercial Print revenues that are now intercompany.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company strongly urges stockholders and other interested persons not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are not measures of under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP measures, as presented in this press release, may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit), interest/financing expense, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash impairments. The Company defines As Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA before transaction and project costs, merger and acquisition related costs, integration and reorganization costs, gain/loss on sale or disposal of assets, non-cash items such as non-cash compensation, and Adjusted EBITDA from non-wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as As Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, cash taxes, interest paid, and pension payments.\nManagement’s Use of Adjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow are not measures of under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to income from operations, net income (loss), cash flow from continuing operating activities or any other measure of performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. New Media’s management believes these non-GAAP measures, as defined above, are useful to investors for the following reasons:\nEvaluating performance and identifying trends in day-to-day performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on the Company’s day-to-day operations; and Providing assessments of controllable expenses that afford management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal .\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA, As Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow as measures of our deployed revenue generating assets between periods on a consistent basis. We believe As Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow measure our and help identify operational factors that management can impact in the short term, mainly our operating cost structure and expenses. We exclude mergers and acquisition, transaction, and project related costs such as diligence activities and new financing related costs because they represent costs unrelated to the day-to-day operating performance of the business that management can impact in the short term. We consider the loss on early extinguishment of debt to be financing related costs associated with interest expense or amortization of financing fees, which by definition are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Such charges are incidental to, but not reflective of our day-to-day operating performance of the business that management can impact in the short term.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain items in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our ability to deliver on our investment thesis and execute on our operational strategy, our ability to complete the anticipated acquisitions described in this press release and the anticipated timing of closing such acquisitions, the availability of future acquisitions and strategic opportunities, finding, pursuing and completing future acquisitions and strategic opportunities and the benefits associated with such opportunities, expected revenue trends, including expectations for revenue growth, our ability to pay and continue to grow our dividend and deliver shareholder returns, growing our digital business and revenues, growing our events business and revenues, growing our circulation revenues and the impact of such growth on organic same store revenue trends, and our ability to identify, implement, and realize expense savings.

These and other risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control.
