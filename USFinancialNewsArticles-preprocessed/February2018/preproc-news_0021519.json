    "text": "Quarterly Net Sales Exceed $1 Billion for the First Time, Up 14%\nGREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nScanSource, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCSC), a leading global provider of technology products and solutions, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nQuarter ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change (in millions, except per share data) Net sales $ 1,032.2 $ 904.8 14 % Operating income 22.3 23.3 (4 )% Non-GAAP operating income (1) 34.7 29.6 18 % GAAP net income 8.0 23.0 (65 )% Non-GAAP net income (1) 23.0 19.1 21 % GAAP diluted EPS $ 0.31 $ 0.91 (66 )% Non-GAAP diluted EPS (1) $ 0.90 $ 0.75 20 % (1) Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, change in fair value of contingent consideration, tax reform charges, acquisition costs and other non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to GAAP financial information is presented in the Supplementary Information (Unaudited) below. “Second quarter showed strong growth and improved profitability,” said Mike Baur, CEO, ScanSource, Inc. “Our quarterly sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time with organic sales growth of 10%. We are executing our strategic plan to deepen customer relationships and grow profitably.”\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, net sales increased 14% to $1.032 billion, driven by strength in the Worldwide Barcode, Networking and Security segment, including higher big deals in North America. Organic sales growth, which excludes the impact from foreign currency translation and a recent acquisition, was 10%. Operating income totaled $22.3 million, reflecting a decline of 4% from increased expense for the change in fair value of contingent consideration and higher intangible amortization. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18% to $34.7 million, driven by operating leverage from higher sales volumes and the addition of the POS Portal acquisition.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter totaled $8.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, and included current quarter tax reform charges of $6.7 million. Non-GAAP net income increased to $23.0 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, including a $0.07 per share benefit from U.S. tax reform lower rates.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act reduces the corporate federal tax rate on U.S. earnings from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and provides for a one-time charge for certain foreign earnings. Since ScanSource has a June 30th fiscal year-end, the lower tax rate is expected to result in a blended U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. As a result of the Tax Act and tax reform laws enacted in Belgium, ScanSource recognized a one-time tax charge of approximately $6.7 million in the December quarter from the estimated impact of the inclusion of foreign earnings and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding these tax charges, the effective tax rate for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2017 would have been 28% and 29.8%, respectively.\nForecast for Next Quarter\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, ScanSource expects net sales to range from $860 million to $920 million, diluted earnings per share to range from $0.44 to $0.50 per share, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to range from $0.67 to $0.73 per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition costs. This forecast assumes a 30% effective tax rate for the quarter.\nWebcast Details and CFO Commentary\nAt approximately 4:15 p.m. ET, a CFO commentary, as a supplement to our press release and conference call, will be available on ScanSource's website, www.scansource.com (Investor Relations section). ScanSource will present additional information about its financial results and outlook in a conference call today, February 6, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET. A webcast of the call will be available for all interested parties and can be assessed at www.scansource.com (Investor Relations section). The webcast will be available for replay for 60 days.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release, including the forecast of sales and earnings per share for next quarter, contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated or forecasted results, including, but not limited to, changes in interest and exchange rates and regulatory regimes impacting our international operations, the impact of tax reform laws, the failure of acquisitions to meet our expectations, the failure to manage and implement our organic growth strategy, credit risks involving our larger customers and vendors, termination of our relationship with key vendors or a significant modification of the terms under which we operate with a key vendor, the decline in demand for the products and services that we provide, reduced prices for the products and services that we provide due both to competitor and customer actions, and other factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017, filed Commission. Except as may be required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are summarized below. Non-GAAP financial measures are used to understand and evaluate performance, including comparisons from period to period. Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs and other non-GAAP adjustments.\nNet sales on a constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions: The Company discloses the percentage change in net sales excluding the translation impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates between reporting periods and excluding the net sales from acquisitions prior to the first full year from the acquisition date. This measure enhances the comparability between periods to help analyze underlying trends on an organic basis.\nNon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP pre-tax income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: To evaluate current period performance on a more consistent basis with prior periods, the Company discloses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP pre-tax income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP diluted \"EPS\"). These non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, change in the fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs and other non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS measures are useful in assessing and understanding the Company's operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods.\nReturn on invested capital (\"ROIC\"): Management uses ROIC as a performance measurement to assess efficiency in allocating capital under the Company's control to generate returns. Management believes this metric balances the Company's operating results with asset and liability management, is not impacted by capitalization decisions and correlates with shareholder value creation. In addition, it is easily computed, communicated and understood. ROIC also provides management a measure of the Company's profitability on a basis more comparable to historical or future periods.\nROIC assists management in comparing the Company's performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance. ROIC is calculated as adjusted EBITDA over invested capital. Adjusted earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") excludes the change in fair value of contingent consideration and acquisition costs, in addition to other non-GAAP adjustments. Invested capital is defined as average equity plus average daily funded interest-bearing debt for the period. Management believes the calculation of ROIC provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of the Company's performance during the year.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and the non-GAAP financial measures that the Company reports may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be considered in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial information to GAAP is set forth in the Supplementary Information (Unaudited) below.\nAbout ScanSource, Inc.\nScanSource, Inc.
