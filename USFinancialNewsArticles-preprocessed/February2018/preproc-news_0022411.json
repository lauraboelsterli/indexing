    "text": "  2:29 p.m. ET Share \nSalke Succeeds Roy Price, Who Left Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations Getty Images Jennifer Salke at the annual PaleyFest Los Angeles hosted by The Paley Center for Media \nBy Ben Fritz Joe Flint \nAmazon.com Inc. has tapped NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke as head of Amazon Studios, its movie and television unit, succeeding Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer. \nAt Amazon AMZN, -2.05% Ms. Salke, 53 years old, will oversee a deep-pocketed and ambitious online video service with an annual budget of more than $4.5 billion, according to people at the company. \nIts best known television series include “Transparent,” “The Tick” and “Bosch.” Its most successful films have been “The Big Sick” and Oscar winner “Manchester by the Sea.” However Amazon has struggled to find broadly popular hits like HBO’s TWX, -0.83% “Game of Thrones” and Netflix Inc.’s NFLX, -1.21% “Stranger Things.” \nAmong the challenges facing Ms. Salke will be improving relations with the creative community, some of whom criticized the way Amazon operated during Mr. Price’s seven-year tenure. Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama “Goliath” for Amazon told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is “in way over their heads.”",
