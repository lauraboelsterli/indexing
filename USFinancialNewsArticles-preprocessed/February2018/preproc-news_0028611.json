    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Celiac Disease Foundation, the nation’s leading disease advocacy organization for celiac disease, announces the appointment of a new member to its Board of Directors. Joining the Board of Directors is Courtney de Balmann for the 2018-2020 term.\n“Courtney’s passion, talent, and guidance will help further the mission of the Foundation in driving diagnosis, treatment, and a cure for this woefully underdiagnosed autoimmune disease,” stated James J. Watson, Chairman of the Board. “The Board looks forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in our quest for a cure.”\nCurrently an independent consultant, Courtney previously served as the Executive Director of the Lung Cancer Research Foundation in New York. She was also the Director of Development of the Psychiatry Department at UCSF and Vice President of the HHV-6 Foundation where she is now a Board member. Prior to running medical research foundations, Courtney worked in fixed income at Goldman Sachs and Drake Management. She received her undergraduate degree in Economics from Boston College and her MBA from the Wharton School of Business at The University of Pennsylvania. Courtney became passionate about finding a cure for celiac disease after a close family member was diagnosed.\n“We are honored to have Courtney accept a position on the Foundation’s Board of Directors,” stated Marilyn G. Geller, Chief Executive Officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation. “We are pleased to have her expertise and leadership as we serve our community nationally and worldwide in the fight to solve celiac disease.”\nTo view the biographies of the Celiac Disease Foundation Board of Directors, click here .\nAbout Celiac Disease Foundation\nThe Celiac Disease Foundation is the nation’s leading disease advocacy organization for celiac disease and non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity. We drive diagnosis, treatment, and a cure through research, education, and advocacy to improve the quality of life for all those affected. Through iCureCeliac®, our national registry dedicated to patient-centered research, we collaborate with researchers, clinicians, and industry to better understand, and ultimately cure, celiac disease.\nSince our founding in 1990, the Celiac Disease Foundation continues to champion many battles: federal recognition of celiac disease and labeling standards for gluten-free foods, improved diagnostic tools, widespread patient and provider education, access to mainstream gluten-free products, and the need for better treatments and a cure.\nTalia Machlouf\ntalia.machlouf@celiac.org\n818-716-1513, x110\nSource:Celiac Disease Foundation",
