Net revenues totaled $75.0 million, a year-over-year decrease of 25%, when compared to $99.9 million in 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA was ($13.6) million, compared to $2.4 million in 2016.\nIn October 2017, the Company completed a one-for-seven reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock. All share and per share amounts throughout this release, including the attached tables, have been adjusted to account for the impact of this reverse stock split.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below, under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Business and Product Release Highlights:\nAdded full reporting and management capabilities for Facebook In-Stream Video Ads, which allows advertisers to reach consumers with engaging video content. Debuted product group splitter for Google Shopping to save advertisers time and boost overall yields by automatically promoting profitable SKUs. Continued development of \"TruePath,\" an industry-first cross-channel, impression-level attribution solution designed to help marketers understand the true customer journey from start to finish. Launched support for Amazon Advertising, which provides our advertisers with a major new channel to reach in-market audiences at scale. Launched support for Search Ads on Pinterest, which gives our advertisers access to new customers early in their buying cycle. Launched impression-share optimization, which ensures Brand advertisers maintain and expand their exposure on key search queries.\nFinancial Outlook:\nMarin is providing guidance for its first quarter of 2018 as follows:\nForward-Looking Guidance\nIn millions, except per share data\nRange of Estimate\nFrom\nTo\nThree Months Ending March 31, 2018\nRevenues, net\n$\n14.3\n$\n14.8\nNon-GAAP loss from operations\n$\n(7.5)\n$\n(7.0)\nNon-GAAP loss per share\n$\n(1.36)\n$\n(1.28)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding\n5.7\nNon-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP net loss per share excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of internally developed software and intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, non-cash expenses related to debt agreements, non-recurring costs associated with restructurings, and capitalization of internally developed software.\nAdditionally, the Company does not reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP net loss per share, due to variability between revenues and non-cash items such as stock-based compensation. The GAAP measures, loss from operations and net loss per share, include stock-based compensation expense, which is affected by hiring and retention needs, as well as the future price of Marin's stock. As a result, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be made without unreasonable effort.\nQuarterly Results Conference Call\nMarin Software will host a conference call today at 2:00 PM Pacific Time (5:00 PM Eastern Time) to review the Company's financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, and its outlook for the future.

For more information about Marin Software, please visit: http://www.marinsoftware.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nMarin uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release. Marin uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its ongoing operational performance. Marin believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Non-GAAP financial measures that Marin uses may differ from measures that other companies may use.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP expenses, measures and net loss per share. Marin defines non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of internally developed software and intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, non-cash expenses related to debt agreements, non-recurring costs associated with restructurings and capitalization of internally developed software. Non-GAAP net loss per share is calculated as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted average shares outstanding.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Marin defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, the amortization of internally developed software and intangible assets, the capitalization of internally developed software, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, interest expense, net, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and the non-recurring costs associated with restructurings. These amounts are often excluded by other companies to help investors understand the operational performance of their business. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measurement of its operating performance because it assists in comparing the operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non-cash and non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the operations that Marin believes, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements including, among other things, statements regarding Marin's business, expectations about our ability to return to growth, impact of investments in product and technology on future operating results, progress on product development efforts, product capabilities and future financial results, including its outlook for the first quarter of 2018.
