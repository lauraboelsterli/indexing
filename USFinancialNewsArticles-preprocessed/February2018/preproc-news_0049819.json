    "text": "Oceanside, CA, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lincoln Military Housing (LMH) today announced that Jil Dorflinger has joined the company as Regional Vice President of the Southwest Marines Region. In her role, Mrs. Dorflinger will oversee 10,000 homes serving Marine Families at several installations, including; MCB Camp Pendleton, MCAGCC Twentynine Palms, MCRD, MWTC Bridgeport/Coleville, MCAS Yuma and Kansas City. She will be responsible for the daily operations and oversight of a team of dedicated team members in their daily quest to deliver exemplary service to over 30,000 residents who have chosen to live with Lincoln.\nJill Dorflinger\nLike many of Lincoln’s team members, Mrs. Dorflinger’s property management career began at the same time that her new husband was beginning his career as a US Marine. She went on to spend the next 20 years working, and excelling, in virtually every position in property management for a large Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Prior to joining Lincoln, she ran their $1.3 billion dollar conventional apartment portfolio with over 4,400 homes across Colorado and Southern California.\n“Our residents, our team members and our partners will all benefit from Jill’s commitment to customer service and her strong knowledge of the industry. We are fortunate to have her join the Lincoln Military Housing leadership, who, alongside an outstanding team, work each day to support the greater mission by taking care of our military families,” said Philip Rizzo, Vice President of Operations at Lincoln Military Housing .\nAbout Lincoln Military Housing\nLincoln Military Housing (LMH) was formed in 2001 through a Department of Defense (DOD) contract with parent company Lincoln Property Company. The goal has always been to increase the quality of military housing for our nation's servicemen and women. Since its inception more than a decade ago, Lincoln Military Housing now provides more than 36,000 family homes for military members across the US. Lincoln is much more than a property management company. LMH acts as a support system for military families and offers community-building activities and 24-hour maintenance assistance programs, free, to all of their residents. Services are available for members of all branches of service -- Marine Corps, Army, Navy, Air Force, United States Coast Guard, and National Guard.
