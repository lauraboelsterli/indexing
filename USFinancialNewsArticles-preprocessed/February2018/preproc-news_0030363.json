    "text": "February 13, 2018 / 2:32 PM / in 2 minutes Danish Queen's husband moved from hospital to spend \"final time\" at castle -Royal House Reuters Staff 1 Min Read COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark’s Prince Henrik, the husband of Queen Margrethe, has been transferred from a Copenhagen hospital to Fredensborg Castle north of the city, where he wants to spend “his final time”, the Royal House said in a statement on Tuesday. His condition remained serious, the statement said. The 83-year-old French-born prince was diagnosed with a benign tumor two weeks ago. He had been hospitalized following an illness that began during a private trip to Egypt. His oldest son, Crown Prince Frederik, a member of the International Olympic Committee, returned home from the Winter Olympics in South Korea last week to be with Prince Henrik after his condition “seriously worsened”.
