We focus on helping brands optimize the relationships they have with their customers using the best tools available, from analytics to testing to voice of customer.\" Hall agrees. \"A true optimization program does not actually test everything; it optimizes everything using strategic prioritization to decide when to test, when to fix, and when to dig a little deeper and get more data.\"\nKelly Wortham, Director of Optimization\nKelly has been a well-known presence in the digital analytics and optimization industry since 2007.
