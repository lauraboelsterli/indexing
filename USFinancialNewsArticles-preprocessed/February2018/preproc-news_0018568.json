    "text": "BETHLEHEM, Pa., OraSure Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:OSUR), a leader in point-of-care diagnostic tests and specimen collection devices, today announced its consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nConsolidated net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $52.0 million, a 47% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Consolidated net product revenues were $50.2 million, representing a 75% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $167.1 million, a 30% increase from the comparable period of 2016. Consolidated net product revenues were $162.0 million, representing a 51% improvement from 2016. Net molecular collection systems revenues were $29.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, which represents a 248% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Net molecular collection systems revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $75.1 million, a 133% increase from 2016.\nInternational sales of the Company’s OraQuick® HIV products of $3.6 million increased 171% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. International OraQuick® HIV sales for year ended December 31, 2017 were $11.3 million, a 115% increase over 2016. The increase in international HIV sales for both periods was primarily the result of higher sales of the Company’s HIV self-test.\nInternational sales of the Company’s OraQuick® HCV product of $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 61% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the non-renewal of a foreign government supply contract in support of a countrywide HCV eradication program. International OraQuick® HCV sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $17.0 million, a 156% increase over the full year of 2016.\nConsolidated net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.3 million, or $0.12 per share on a fully diluted basis, which compares to consolidated net income of $7.2 million, or $0.13 per share on a fully diluted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $30.9 million, or $0.51 per share on a fully-diluted basis, which compares to consolidated net income of $19.7 million, or $0.35 per share, for the comparable period of 2016.\nCash and investments totaled $176.6 million and working capital amounted to $189.7 million at December 31, 2017.\n“Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results were outstanding,” said Douglas A. Michels, President and CEO of OraSure Technologies. “We reported record revenues and profitability for the year as a result of the exceptional performance of our molecular business and strong growth in our international HIV and HCV businesses. Our Company is in great shape financially and we are starting 2018 in a very solid position with significant momentum in our molecular and infectious disease businesses.”\nFinancial Results\nConsolidated net product revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 75% over the comparable period of 2016, primarily as a result of higher sales of the Company’s molecular collections products and higher international sales of the OraQuick® HIV self-test, partially offset by lower international sales of the OraQuick® HCV test. Fourth quarter 2017 sales of the OraQuick® HIV self-test included $589,000 of support payments under the Company’s charitable support agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (“Gates Foundation”).\nConsolidated net product revenues for the full year of 2017 increased 51% over 2016. This increase was primarily the result of higher sales of the Company’s molecular collections and OraQuick® HCV products and higher international sales of the OraQuick® HIV self-test, partially offset by lower domestic sales of the Company’s professional OraQuick® HIV product and lower cryosurgical product sales. Full-year 2017 sales of the OraQuick® HIV self-test included $1.0 million of support payments under the Gates Foundation agreement.\nConsolidated other revenues for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively. This compares to consolidated other revenues for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016 of $6.9 million and $21.3 million, respectively. Other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $1.3 million of Ebola and Zika-related funding received from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (“BARDA”) and $470,000 in cost reimbursement under the Company’s charitable support agreement with the Gates Foundation. Other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 included $747,000 of BARDA funding and $6.1 million of exclusivity revenues recognized under the Company’s HCV co-promotion agreement with AbbVie, which terminated on December 31, 2016. Other revenues for the full-year 2017 included $4.4 million of BARDA funding and $689,000 of cost reimbursement under the Gates Foundation agreement. Other revenues in 2016 included $2.3 million of BARDA funding and $18.9 million of AbbVie exclusivity revenues.\nConsolidated gross margin was 55% and 59% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Consolidated gross margin for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 was 67% and 69%, respectively. Gross margin for the current quarter and the full year of 2017 decreased primarily due to the absence of AbbVie exclusivity revenues during these periods, an increase in lower margin product sales, and higher scrap and spoilage costs.\nConsolidated operating expenses increased to $18.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $16.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was largely due to higher research and development expenses resulting from increased lab supplies and staffing costs and from the inclusion in the fourth quarter of 2016 of a payment to settle a claim against one of the Company’s raw material suppliers, which reduced research and development expenses by $1.4 million. A similar payment was not received in the fourth quarter of 2017. The current quarter increase was partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expense associated with lower legal fees and a decrease in costs caused by the absence of a corporate restructuring which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher consulting costs and a cost write-off in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the non-renewal of a foreign government supply contract in support of a country-wide HCV eradication program.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated operating expenses were $58.7 million, a $9.0 million decrease from the $67.8 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $12.5 million gain on a litigation settlement reported earlier this year, the absence of costs associated with the AbbVie HCV co-promotion agreement, and lower legal fees, partially offset by higher staffing costs and increased research and development expenses due to the supplier claim settlement and higher supply costs.\nOperating income rose 44% to $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $40.2 million, a 99% increase over 2016.\nIncome tax expense was $3.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a $31,000 income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, income tax expense was $10.1 million, a $9.5 million increase from the $603,000 reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. Full-year 2017 income tax expense included the additional taxes due as a result of the $12.5 million litigation settlement gain. The increases in income tax expense in both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were also a result of the higher pre-tax income generated by the Company’s Canadian subsidiary during both periods.\nThe Company’s cash and investment balance totaled $176.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $120.9 million at December 31, 2016. Working capital was $189.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $139.1 million at December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated $28.2 million in cash from operations.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Outlook\nIn January 2018, the Company announced the appointment of Dr. Stephen Tang as the Company’s new President and CEO, effective April 1, 2018. Dr. Tang will replace Douglas A. Michels, the Company’s current President and CEO, who will be retiring on March 31, 2018. The Company has also recently announced that Ronald H. Spair, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, will be retiring on or before June 30, 2018.\nCharges associated with these transitions are expected to total $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2018. These charges primarily reflect non-cash charges associated with modifications to existing stock grants held by the retiring executives and expenses associated with the onboarding of the Company’s new President and CEO.\nThe Company expects consolidated net revenues to range from $40.0 million to $41.0 million and is projecting a consolidated net loss of approximately $0.06 per share for the first quarter of 2018. The projected net loss includes the transition costs noted above.\nFinancial Data\nUnaudited Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Results of Operations Net revenues $ 52,028 $ 35,499 $ 167,064 $ 128,198 Cost of products sold 23,503 11,545 68,108 40,171 Gross profit 28,525 23,954 98,956 88,027 Operating expenses: Research and development 3,829 1,207 13,365 9,754 Sales and marketing 6,991 7,121 28,532 29,652 General and administrative 7,544 8,553 29,321 28,356 Gain on litigation settlement - - (12,500 ) - Total operating expenses 18,364 16,881 58,718 67,762 Operating income 10,161 7,073 40,238 20,265 Other income 118 92 794 58 Income before income taxes 10,279 7,165 41,032 20,323 Income tax expense (benefit) 2,963 (31 ) 10,084 603 Net income $ 7,316 $ 7,196 $ 30,948 $ 19,720 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.12 $ 0.13 $ 0.52 $ 0.35 Diluted $ 0.12 $ 0.13 $ 0.51 $ 0.35 Weighted average shares: Basic 60,652 55,811 59,050 55,615 Diluted 62,371 57,232 61,024 56,513 Summary of Net Revenues by Market and Product (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Dollars Percentage of\nTotal Net\nRevenues Market 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 Infectious disease testing $ 14,129 $ 13,679 3 % 27 % 39 % Risk assessment testing 3,141 3,322 (5 ) 6 9 Cryosurgical systems 3,163 3,071 3 6 9 Molecular collection systems 29,784 8,565 248 58 24 Net product revenues 50,217 28,637 75 97 81 Other 1,811 6,862 (74 ) 3 19 Net revenues $ 52,028 $ 35,499 47 % 100 % 100 %\nYear Ended December 31,\nDollars Percentage of\nTotal Net\nRevenues\nMarket 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 Infectious disease testing $ 61,951 $ 48,408 28 % 37 % 38 % Risk assessment testing 12,659 13,068 (3 ) 8 10 Cryosurgical systems 12,279 13,234 (7 ) 7 10 Molecular collection systems 75,099 32,214 133 45 25 Net product revenues 161,988 106,924 51 97 83 Other 5,076 21,274 (76 ) 3 17 Net revenues $ 167,064 $ 128,198 30 % 100 % 100 %\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, HIV Revenues 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 %\nChange Domestic $ 4,614 $ 5,054 (9 ) % $ 17,015 $ 21,499 (21 ) % International 3,563 1,314 171 11,301 5,248 115 Domestic OTC 1,880 1,747 8 6,832 6,320 8 Net product revenues $ 10,057 $ 8,115 24 % $ 35,148 $ 33,067 6 %\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear End\nDecember 31, HCV Revenues 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 %\nChange Domestic $ 2,468 $ 2,218 11 % $ 8,448 $ 7,436 14 % International 1,144 2,908 (61 ) 16,961 6,630 156 Net product revenues 3,612 5,126 (30 ) 25,409 14,066 81 Amortization of exclusivity payments - 6,114 (100 ) - 18,951 (100 ) Net HCV-related revenues $ 3,612 $ 11,240 (68 ) % $ 25,409 $ 33,017 (23 ) %\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Cryosurgical Systems Revenues 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Domestic professional $ 1,032 $ 1,389 (26 ) % $ 5,400 $ 5,545 (3 ) % International professional 245 165 48 797 771 3 Domestic OTC 273 288 (5 ) 1,230 1,350 (9 ) International OTC 1,613 1,229 31 4,852 5,568 (13 ) Net product revenues $ 3,163 $ 3,071 3 % $ 12,279 $ 13,234 (7 ) %\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Molecular Collection Systems Reve nues 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 %\nChange Commercial Genomics $ 26,978 $ 5,760 368 % $ 61,594 $ 20,767 197 % Academic Genomics 1,701 2,411 (29 ) 10,017 10,312 (3 ) Microbiome 1,105 394 180 3,488 1,135 207 Net product revenues $ 29,784 $ 8,565 248 % $ 75,099 $ 32,214 133 %\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 72,869 $ 109,790 Short-term investments 83,028 11,160 Accounts receivable, net 42,521 19,827 Inventories 19,343 11,799 Other current assets 4,144 3,865 Property and equipment, net 21,372 20,033 Intangible assets, net 8,223 10,337 Goodwill 20,083 18,793 Long-term investments 20,690 - Other non-current assets 3,928 2,331 Total assets $ 296,201 $ 207,935 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Accounts payable $ 10,228 $ 4,633 Deferred revenue 1,314 1,388 Other current liabilities 20,695 11,314 Other non-current liabilities 3,932 2,304 Deferred income taxes 1,951 2,446 Stockholders’ equity 258,081 185,850 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 296,201 $ 207,935\nYear Ended December 31, Additional Financial Data (Unaudited) 2017 2016 Capital expenditures $ 4,337 $ 4,353 Depreciation and amortization $ 6,402 $ 5,640 Stock-based compensation $ 6,973 $ 6,063 Cash provided by operating activities $ 28,156 $ 24,598\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast for analysts and investors to discuss the Company’s 2017 fourth quarter and full-year financial results, certain business developments and financial guidance for the first quarter of 2018, beginning today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time).
