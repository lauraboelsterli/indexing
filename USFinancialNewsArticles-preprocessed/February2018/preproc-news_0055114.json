    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Speculators’ net short dollar bets shrank slightly to a seven-week low, in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.\nThe value of the net short dollar positions, derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars, was $8.17 billion, in the week to Feb. 20.\nThat compares with a net short position of $8.19 billion the previous week.\nTo be short a currency means traders believe it will fall in value.\nSpeculators’ net short position on bitcoin Cboe futures fell to 1,608 contracts, down from a net short position of 1,875 contracts in the prior week, the data showed.
