    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.48 billion, compared to revenues of $2.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, and net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $113.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $88.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.56 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"Quanta ended the year strong, with record annual revenues, backlog and adjusted diluted earnings per share. More importantly, we expect our momentum to carry into 2018 and provide us with another opportunity to achieve record revenues, backlog and adjusted diluted earnings per share,\" said Duke Austin, president and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. \"We remain focused on our strategic objectives and believe we will grow while also improving margins. Quanta continues to differentiate itself in the marketplace through safe execution and by providing unique construction-led infrastructure solutions. With our leadership position, customer relationships and strong balance sheet, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers in a complex, ever-changing infrastructure market.\"\nCertain items impacted the fourth quarter of 2017 and were reflected as adjustments in Quanta's adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation. Favorably impacting the fourth quarter of 2017 was an estimated net tax benefit of $70.1 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) on December 22, 2017. The estimated net benefit of $70.1 million is based on Quanta's provisional analysis of the Tax Act and included $85.3 million of tax benefits associated with the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by an estimated $15.2 million transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Other one-time tax benefits of $18.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, favorably impacted the fourth quarter of 2017 and primarily related to entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts. In addition to the favorable tax impacts, the fourth quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $58.1 million ($36.6 million net of tax), or $0.23 per diluted share, which were primarily associated with two reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division.\nRECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nSecured Two Large Diameter Mainline Pipeline Projects - In February 2018, Quanta announced that it executed contracts for two large diameter mainline pipeline projects in the Appalachian region of the United States with estimated aggregate revenue in excess of $550 million. One project was reflected in backlog as of December 31, 2017, and the other project will be reflected in backlog as of March 31, 2018. Subject to the customers obtaining regulatory approvals, both projects are expected to begin construction in the first half of 2018, and completion is expected by the end of 2018. Selected for Large Electric Transmission Project - In January 2018, Quanta signed a contract for a large electric transmission project in south Florida to provide comprehensive construction services. Quanta expects construction to begin during the first quarter of 2018, with completion expected in the second quarter of 2019. Acquired two businesses - In January 2018, Quanta acquired an electrical infrastructure services business specializing in substation construction and relay services and Northwest Lineman College (NLC), an industry-leading educational and training institution serving the electric power industry, both of which are located in the United States. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of $47.9 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and 379,817 shares of Quanta common stock, with a cash and stock earn out that could provide maximum additional consideration of $15.0 million if certain financial and operational objectives are achieved by NLC. The results of the acquired businesses will be reflected in Quanta's Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment beginning on the acquisition dates. Stock Repurchased - During the fourth quarter of 2017, Quanta repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock in the open market for $50.0 million.\nRESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nRevenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 were $9.47 billion, compared to revenues of $7.65 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, and net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $315.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, or $2.00 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $198.7 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $1.97 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nQuanta completed three acquisitions during 2017 and five acquisitions during 2016. Therefore, Quanta's results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 included the results of the acquired businesses from the acquisition dates and are compared to the historical results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. For further information on the items that impacted comparability in 2017 and 2016, see the footnotes to the Supplemental Segment Data table and the non-GAAP reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock below.\nOUTLOOK\nThe long-term outlook for Quanta's business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company's historical results, and may impact Quanta's future financial results. Therefore, Quanta's financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management's effort to properly align these uncertainties with the backlog that the company is executing on and the opportunities that are expected to materialize during 2018. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.\nPrior to the company's conference call, management will post a summary of 2018 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the \"Investors & Media\" section of Quanta's website at http://investors.quantaservices.com . Quanta expects 2018 revenues to range between $9.75 billion and $10.25 billion. Quanta expects diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the full-year 2018 to be $1.95 to $2.35 and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) for the full-year 2018 to be $2.40 to $2.80. As a result of the Tax Act, management now expects Quanta's estimated annual tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 29 percent. See the attached table for a reconciliation of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to estimated GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the full-year 2018.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe non-GAAP measures in this press release and on Quanta's website are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta's performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta's operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP. Reconciliations of other non-GAAP to GAAP measures not included in the tables attached to this press release can be found in the Investors & Media section of Quanta's website at http://investors.quantaservices.com .\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nQuanta Services has scheduled a conference call for 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on February 22, 2018, which will also be broadcast live over the Internet.

Included in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was a $5.7 million asset impairment charge primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations, which was completed in 2017.\n(b) Included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was a $1.9 million charge associated with a construction barge. Included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $2 million in severance and restructuring costs.\n(c) Included in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $58.1 million in asset impairment charges primarily associated with goodwill for two reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. Specifically, a reporting unit that provides material handling services experienced lower operating margins and is expected to continue to face a highly competitive environment in its select markets, and a reporting unit that provides marine and offshore services experienced prolonged periods of reduced revenues and operating margins and is expected to continue to experience lower levels of activity in the U.S Gulf of Mexico and other offshore markets. Also included in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were the favorable impact of a $5.2 million change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; and $1.5 million and $10.6 million of acquisition and integration costs. Also included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was a $4.2 million charge associated with certain litigation that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017 and a $2.4 million charitable contribution made in connection with the formation of a non-profit line school. Included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were a $2.3 million endowment contribution to establish a business relationship and a workforce development program with a university and $3.1 million of acquisition and integration costs.\nQuanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Segment Data\nFor the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(Unaudited)\nBacklog\nBacklog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Quanta's methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Quanta's backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that it expects to realize from future work under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. These estimates include revenues from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed and on which work has not yet begun, as well as revenues from change orders, renewal options, and funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent that they are reasonably expected to occur. For purposes of calculating backlog, Quanta includes 100% of estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities. The following table presents Quanta's total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in millions):\nBacklog as of\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n12 Month\nTotal\n12 Month\nTotal\n12 Month\nTotal\nElectric Power Infrastructure Services\n$\n4,032.4\n$\n7,359.2\n$\n3,907.2\n$\n6,641.4\n$\n3,369.3\n$\n6,657.5\nOil and Gas Infrastructure Services\n2,413.8\n3,818.5\n2,283.4\n3,904.9\n2,484.0\n3,092.3\nTotal\n$\n6,446.2\n$\n11,177.7\n$\n6,190.6\n$\n10,546.3\n$\n5,853.3\n$\n9,749.8\nQuanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Stock\nFor the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(In thousands, except per share information)\n(Unaudited)\nThe non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta's acquisition activity, which can cause these amounts to vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (iii) items related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts are not regularly occurring items; (iv) income tax contingency releases vary period to period depending on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods; (v) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta's ongoing acquisition activity; (vi) asset impairments vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (vii) changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities vary from period to period depending on financial performance of certain acquired businesses; and (viii) severance and restructuring costs are not regularly occurring items. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

The amount includes $85.3 million of tax benefits associated with the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by an estimated $15.2 million transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. While Quanta has substantially completed its provisional analysis of the effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such effects, the net one-time benefits related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of Quanta's calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that it has made, additional regulatory guidance, and actions and related accounting policy decisions it may take as a result of the Tax Act.\n(b) The amount for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflects the elimination of one-time tax benefits primarily related to entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts.\n(c) The amounts reflect the elimination of the tax benefits related to the release of tax contingencies upon expiration of certain tax statute of limitations periods.\n(d) The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the elimination of asset impairment charges primarily associated with goodwill for two reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services Division. Specifically, a reporting unit that provides material handling services experienced lower operating margins and is expected to continue to face a highly competitive environment in its select markets, and a reporting unit that provides marine and offshore services experienced prolonged periods of reduced revenues and operating margins and is expected to continue to experience lower levels of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other offshore markets. The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 reflect the elimination of impairment charges primarily related to the pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations, which was completed in 2017.\n(e) The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the elimination of changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.\n(f) The amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 reflects the elimination of severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former president and chief executive officer and severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations primarily within the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.\n(g) The income tax impact of adjustments that are subject to tax is determined using the incremental statutory tax rate of the jurisdictions to which each adjustment relates for the respective periods.\n(h) Both diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were impacted by attorneys' fees and related expenses of approximately $4.2 million ($2.7 million net of tax), or $0.02 per share, associated with certain litigation that was resolved in the first quarter of 2017; a $2.4 million ($1.7 million net of tax), or $0.01 per share, charitable contribution made in connection with the formation and funding of a non-profit line school; and a $1.9 million charge ($1.2 million net of tax), or $0.01 per share, associated with a construction barge in order to record the asset to its estimated fair market value. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, both diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock were impacted by $54.8 million ($33.4 million net of tax), or $0.21 per share, of losses related to a power plant construction project in Alaska.\nQuanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nEstimated Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Common Stock\nFor the Full-Year 2018\n(In thousands, except per share information)\n(Unaudited)\nThe non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance.
