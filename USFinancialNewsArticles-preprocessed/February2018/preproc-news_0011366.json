    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. stocks sold off sharply on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling back below 25,000, as a pullback from record highs deepened and investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation.\nSigns that inflation is firming have raised some traders’ expectations that the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates four times this year. Fed officials have indicated that three rate hikes are likely.\nThe S&P 500 was last down 2.61 percent, and at one point was off more than 8 percent from the record high set on Jan. 26. The Dow was briefly down more than 10 percent from its record that day, flirting with territory that some define as a correction, and was last down 3.58 percent. The Nasdaq was down 2.54 percent.\nCOMMENTS: LARRY MILSTEIN, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY TRADING, R.W. PRESSPRICH & CO., NEW YORK\n“We had a nice bounce from the lows there. It’s unsettled where we go from here at this point. Some technical levels were hit in the equity market where selling beget more selling. It was probably some ‘blackbox,’ algo selling in stocks and buying in bonds.\nDENNIS DICK, PROPRIETARY TRADER, BRIGHT TRADING LLC, LAS VEGAS\n“You’ve got to be prepared for all types of markets, and a lot of people who have been in this market for the past three or four years have never seen this before.”\n“People who have been buying the dip are now going to be selling the rip. The psychology of the market changed today. It’ll take a while to get that psychology back.”\nJEFFREY KLEINTOP, CHIEF GLOBAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHARLES SCHWAB & CO, BOSTON\n”I certainly don’t see anything fundamental. It wasn’t driven by any macro event, rather it appears to be computer driven trading that led to an order imbalance. These things can happen quickly and tend to be corrected quickly.\n“Last week we saw a broad pullback that was macro related. Instead of being tied to fears of economic weakness it was tied to too much growth and fears of inflation. Certainly fears that the Fed in the U.S. might get more aggressive in reigning in stimulus. But as long as growth remains intact, and we believe it will, stocks should rebound.”\nLOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING, CHICAGO “The velocity of the market selloff picked up. For the first couple of days of it there hadn’t been much of a reaction in the long-end of the treasuries. Usually during a selloff there will be some kind of reaction. The magnitude of the selloff versus how far it’s come really didn’t raise any alarm bells in the stocks until the velocity picked up this afternoon.\n”Partly, I think the argument could be made too that the heightened inflation expectations from the tax bill and from infrastructure output, and then you had that very misleading wage number the other day, all fed into inflation expectations and it wasn’t that the Fed was going to raise rates to much it was that they weren’t going to be quick enough.”\nMICHAEL O’ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, JONESTRADING, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT\n“People who were not active, who tend to be in index products were looking to take profits today. They don’t price until the end of the day. They probably put orders in to sell and book some profits.”\n“These orders have to be done by the end of the day. You want to make sure you get them done.”\nMARKETS: BONDS: The 2- US2YT=RR Treasury note yield eased to 2.0767 percent, while the 10-year US10YT=RR bond yield rose to 2.8850, the highest since January 2014, before falling back to 2.7657.\nFOREX: The dollar index .DXY was up 0.33 percent.\nVIX: The Cboe volatility index more than doubled to 35.73, its highest since August 2015 and was last up 14.84 at 32.15.\nAmericas Economics and Markets Desk; +1-646 223-6300\n ",
