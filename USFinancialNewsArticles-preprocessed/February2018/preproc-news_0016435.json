That's because the stock market as measured by the S&P 500 index has to fall more to trigger those halts. The first such circuit breaker kicks in when the S&P 500 falls at least 7%, what's called level 1. The S&P was down 1.8% in afternoon trading on Thursday. To put the day's move in a broader context, the point drop in the Dow (which is a basket of 30 large U.S. company stocks versus the 500 or so stocks in the S&P) was just 2.1%. The Dow fell 528 points on Thursday. For the stock market to halt on Thursday, to allow fearful investors a chance to cool off, the S&P would have to drop to around 2,494, according to this notice from Nasdaq that is updated daily. And that kind of halt would last for 15 minutes.",
