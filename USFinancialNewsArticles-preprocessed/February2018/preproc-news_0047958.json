    "text": "ROME, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Italy’s tax police raided Telecom Italia headquarters in Rome on Wednesday as part of an antitrust inquiry into the group’s fibre optic network investments in rural areas, a source close to the matter said.\nThe competition watchdog is looking into how the former phone monopoly set wholesale prices for operators using its broadband network as well as its use of confidential information on its competitors’ retail customers.\nTelecom Italia (TIM) declined to comment.\nSince 2015 TIM has been facing competition in rolling out a fast broadband network in Italy from Open Fiber, a company owned by state-controlled utility Enel and state-owned lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.
