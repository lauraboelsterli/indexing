    "text": "(Reuters) - Indian shares ended lower for a third straight session on Thursday, after the governmentâ€™s 2018/19 budget set a capital gains tax on long-term equity investments, although investors welcomed higher spending in key areas of the economy such as agriculture.\nThe Nifty ended 0.1 percent down to 11,016.90 in a volatile session where shares briefly plunged 1.35 percent and gained up to 0.81 percent.\nThe Sensex closed 0.16 percent lower at 35,906.66.\nReporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
