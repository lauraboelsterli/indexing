    "text": "(Reuters) - Data-sharing business Dropbox Inc on Friday filed for an initial public offering of up to $500 million with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe company said it plans to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \"DBX\". bit.ly/2omUnih\nDropbox, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, is facing heated competition from technology giants including Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google, Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ).\nDropbox reported 2017 revenue of $1.11 billion, compared with $844.8 million a year earlier. The company’s net loss narrowed to $111.7 million from $210.2 million.\nThe California-based digital storage firm with 11 million paid users across 180 countries said that about half of its 2017 revenue came from customers outside the United States.\nGoldman Sachs & Co LLC, J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank Securities are some of the leading underwriters for the IPO.\nThe amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filing is usually a placeholder.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
