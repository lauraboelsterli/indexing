    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- R1 RCM Inc . (NASDAQ:RCM), a leading provider of technology-enabled revenue cycle management (RCM) services to healthcare providers, today announced a definitive agreement to acquire Intermedix Corp (Intermedix), including its healthcare division comprised of its physician and EMS RCM, practice management and analytics businesses, in a transaction valued at approximately $460 million.\nIntermedix provides revenue cycle management, practice management and data analytics services to more than 15,000 individual healthcare providers across the nation. The combination of R1 and Intermedix is expected to enhance R1’s position as a leading technology-enabled revenue cycle service provider with great breadth and depth of integrated revenue cycle capabilities across settings of care.\nIn today’s dynamic environment, health systems and providers alike face daunting challenges in cost effectively managing their revenue cycle. Barriers such as disparate information systems, processes and organizational cultures coupled with a lack of insightful analytics for decision making make it difficult for financial leaders to stay ahead of the demands on them. Additionally, with the increase of patient payment responsibilities and consumer oriented expectations, these challenges require new thinking. The combination of R1 and Intermedix is expected to address these provider challenges today and well into the future.\n“We believe the next chapter in healthcare is one of revenue cycle transformation, where an enterprise-wide approach will simplify and contribute to the way patients interact with the revenue cycle,” said Joseph Flanagan, president and CEO of R1. “By integrating the Intermedix assets into our technology-enabled services, we believe our health system and physician practice partners will more easily connect revenue cycle operations across all points of care, improving the patient and physician experience while improving revenues and reducing costs.”\n“We have become a leading revenue cycle, practice optimization and data analytics partner for physicians and EMS providers across the country,” said Joel Portice, CEO of Intermedix. “We see joining R1 as a natural evolution for us and expect that our client partners would gain a deeper breadth of services that will better connect them to the hospitals and health systems with which they work, making the revenue cycle easier to navigate for everyone from patients to providers and staff.”\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The Intermedix emergency preparedness division is not a part of the transaction and will become an independent company, backed by Thomas H. Lee Partners, once the transaction closes.\nAdvisors\nBofA Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal advisor to R1. Evercore acted as financial advisor and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP acted as legal advisor to Intermedix.\nConference Call\nR1’s management team will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Intermedix acquisition and business outlook. To participate, please dial 866-393-4306 (734-385-2616 outside the U.S. and Canada) using conference code number 7567439. A slide presentation to accompany the conference call, as well as a live webcast and replay of the call will be available at the Investor Relations section of the Company’s web site at ir.r1rcm.com .\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release includes information that may constitute “forward-looking statements,” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
