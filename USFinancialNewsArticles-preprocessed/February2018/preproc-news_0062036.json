(OTC PINK: TETAA) announced fourth quarter 2017 earnings which included the accretive impact of the February 28, 2017 acquisition of the assets of Keeley Asset Management Corp. (“KAMCO”).\nRevenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $8.1 million compared with $3.4 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Current quarter net income and fully diluted earnings per share were $1.1 million and $0.83, respectively, compared to $0.6 million and $0.53 for the same period a year ago. The quarterly results include recurring non-cash charges related to intangible asset and debt discount amortization. In addition, the company recognized two non-recurring, non-cash charges totaling $267,000. The first such expense of $65,000 was attributable to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. The second expense was a $202,000 impairment charge related to an annual assessment of the value of the company’s intangible assets. Excluding these non-cash items, cash earnings per share were $1.36. On October 17, 2017, Teton redeemed 15,000 shares ($1.5 million) of Series A Preferred stock which was issued in connection with the financing of the KAMCO acquisition.\nThe December 31, 2017 assets under management of $3.4 billion represented an increase of $2.0 billion, or 146% from December 31, 2016. Average AUM was $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $3.5 billion for the third quarter 2017 and $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull-year revenues were $30.0 million versus $13.4 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016. Full-year net income and fully diluted earnings per share were $4.9 million and $3.76, respectively, compared to $2.6 million and $2.39 for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the items described above, cash earnings per share were $5.01. These full-year results represent ten months of contribution from the KAMCO operations. The Company’s 2017 effective tax rate was 40.5%. As a result of the Tax Act, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be substantially lower going forward.\nFurther information regarding the KAMCO acquisition can be located on our website at www.tetonadv.com .\nOn February 23, 2018 Teton’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock payable on March 27, 2018 to Class A and Class B shareholders of record on March 13, 2018. Teton Advisors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share on its Series A Preferred Stock payable on March 27, 2018 to its Series A Preferred shareholders of record on February 23, 2018.\nTable I TETON ADVISORS, INC.
