    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Endologix, Inc. (Nasdaq:ELGX), a developer and marketer of innovative treatments for aortic disorders, announced today that John McDermott is stepping down as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. To facilitate a smooth transition, Mr. McDermott has committed to remaining in his current role until a successor is found.\nDaniel T. Lemaitre, Chairman of the Board of Endologix, said, “On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire Endologix team, I would like to thank John for his remarkable passion and dedication to our Company. His leadership has been critical in positioning Endologix as an innovative market leader and in bringing novel solutions to doctors and patients across the globe. We appreciate John’s continued involvement and support of the Company, and we wish him well in his future endeavors.”\nJohn McDermott, Chief Executive Officer of Endologix, said, “Despite the business challenges over the past couple of years, I am confident that Endologix has a bright future. Our vision is clear, the value proposition is compelling, and our pipeline of new products positions us for significant long-term growth. I remain deeply committed to our employees, physicians, and patients and will do whatever I can to support an effective leadership transition.”\nAbout Endologix\nEndologix, Inc. develops and manufactures minimally invasive treatments for aortic disorders. The Company's focus is endovascular stent grafts for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body, resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once AAA develops, it continues to enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture. The overall patient mortality rate for ruptured AAA is approximately 80%, making it a leading cause of death in the U.S. For more information, visit www.endologix.com .\nCautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nExcept for historical information contained herein, this press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private 1995.
