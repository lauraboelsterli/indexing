Ultracapacitor revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $20.8 million, compared with $27.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. High-voltage revenue was $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $8.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 24.0% compared with 20.6% in the third quarter of 2017, driven by increased high-voltage sales, which generally have higher gross margins than the corporate average, and lower losses related to inventory write downs and provisions for product warranties. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 25.6% compared with 22.5% in the third quarter of 2017 and excludes acquisition related intangibles amortization and inventory step-up expense as well as stock-based compensation expense.\nOperating Expense, Interest Expense, Net Loss & Adjusted EBITDA\nOperating expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.3 million, compared with $20.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter, the Company incurred restructuring charges associated with the early execution of an organizational optimization following the Nesscap acquisition and costs related to certain legal matters, including an amended agreement with Viex Capital Advisors, LLC, a settlement with the SEC and previously capitalized fees associated with an investment agreement with SDIC that did not close. Additionally, expense was lower in the fourth quarter due to a continued focus on operational efficiencies and discipline, a benefit from the aforementioned restructuring and higher than expected vacation usage during the year-end holiday shutdown. Non-GAAP operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.8 million compared with $12.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related expenses, a small amount of restructuring charges and other non-recurring legal costs. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.0 million compared to $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2017, including the convertible note coupon interest and non-cash interest for amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts. The increase was due to a full quarter of accrued interest in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.6 million compared to $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, which excludes the non-cash interest mentioned above. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.8 million, or $(0.24) per share, compared with a net loss of $13.9 million, or $(0.37) per share, for the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.3 million compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(1.8) million, compared with $(2.1) million for the third quarter of 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.5 million, compared with $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were primarily related to investments in the Korea manufacturing facility, the Switzerland manufacturing facility and equipment upgrades and research and development activities.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Outlook\nTotal revenue is expected to be in the range of $31 million to $33 million. Gross margin is expected to be 25.4%, plus or minus 150 basis points. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 26.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points. GAAP operating expense is expected to be in the range of $14.9 million to $15.3 million. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be in the range of $12.6 million to $13.0 million.\nThe Company has reconciled expected GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share at the midpoint of guidance. However, the Company is not able to estimate additional potentially excluded and reconciling amounts due to the substantial uncertainties involved. The effect of these excluded items may be significant. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP first quarter outlook is as follows (in millions, except for percentages and per share data):\nProjected at\nMidpoint of Guidance\nProjected at\nMidpoint of Guidance\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2018\nGross Margin Reconciliation:\nTotal Operating Expenses Reconciliation:\nGAAP gross margin\n25.4\n%\nGAAP total operating expenses\n$\n15.1\nStock-based compensation expense\n0.8\n%\nStock-based compensation expense\n(2.0)\nAcquisition related expense (1)\n0.3\n%\nAcquisition related expense (1)\n(0.2)\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n26.5\n%\nSEC and FCPA legal costs\n(0.1)\nNon-GAAP total operating expenses\n$\n12.8\nNet Loss Reconciliation:\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(7.7)\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.2\nGAAP net loss\n$\n(7.7)\nNon-cash interest expense\n0.5\nNon-cash interest expense\n0.5\nAcquisition related expense (1)\n0.3\nInterest, taxes, depreciation, amortization\n3.0\nSEC and FCPA legal costs\n0.1\nEBITDA\n(4.2)\nNon-GAAP net loss\n$\n(4.6)\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.2\nSEC and FCPA legal costs\n0.1\nNet Loss per Share Reconciliation:\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(1.9)\nGAAP net loss per diluted share\n$\n(0.20)\nExpenses excluded from GAAP\n0.08\nNon-GAAP net loss per diluted share\n$\n(0.12)\n(1)\nAcquisition related expense is partially recorded in operating expenses and partially recorded in cost of revenue.\nWebcast Information\nAs previously announced, Maxwell management will host a live webcast at approximately 5:00 p.m. EST / 2:00 p.m. PST today to discuss these results.

Information presented in this press release and in the attached financial tables includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, within the meaning of Item 10 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance or cash flows that (a) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, which are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows; or (b) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, which are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nThe Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release, in its earnings conference call and in its on-going evaluation of the business: (a) non-GAAP gross profit; (b) non-GAAP operating expense; (c) non-GAAP income (loss) from operations; (d) EBITDA; (e) adjusted EBITDA; (f) non-GAAP net income (loss); (g) non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share and (h) non-GAAP gross margin.\nThe definitions of non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release are presented below:\nNon-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, accelerated depreciation and acquisition related expense. Non-GAAP operating expense excludes the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, impairment of assets, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs, release of tax liability and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs. Non-GAAP loss from operations excludes the effect of accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, impairment of assets, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs, release of tax liability and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange loss, other income, stock-based compensation, restructuring and related costs, impairment of assets, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs, release of tax liability, gain on sale of product line and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share exclude the effect of accelerated depreciation, stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense, tax impact of potential cash repatriation, restructuring and related costs, impairment of assets, strategic equity transaction costs, acquisition related expense, shareholder advisement and settlement costs, release of tax liability, gain on sale of product line and SEC and FCPA legal and settlement costs.\nThe Company believes that these measures provide useful information to its management, board of directors and investors about its operating activities and business trends related to its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company's management and board of directors use these non-GAAP financial measures in developing operating budgets and in reviewing the Company's results of operations, as non-cash items, non-recurring items and items unrelated to ongoing operating results have limited impact on current and future operating decisions. Additionally, the Company believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with its past reports of financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures are intended to supplement GAAP financial information, and may be computed differently from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. However, investors should be aware that non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release exclude the following non-cash items, non-recurring items or items unrelated to its ongoing operating results, as applicable:\nStock-based compensation expense consisting of non-cash charges for stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase plan awards and bonuses and director's fees expected to be settled with the Company's fully vested common stock.
