    "text": "BALTIMORE, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Algeco Scotsman Global S.à r.l. (“A/S Global” and, together with its subsidiaries, “Algeco Scotsman”), today announced that two of its subsidiaries, Algeco Scotsman Global Finance plc and Algeco Scotsman Global Finance 2 plc, have closed their previously announced notes offerings.\nAlgeco Scotsman Global Finance plc issued the following tranches of senior secured notes due 2023 (the “Senior Secured Notes”):\n€600,000,000 6 1 / 2 % Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes;\n$520,000,000 8% Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes; and\n€150,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes.\nAlgeco Scotsman Global Finance 2 plc issued $305,000,000 10% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Senior Notes” and, together with the Senior Secured Notes, the “Notes”).\nAdditionally, Algeco Scotsman has obtained three-year cross currency swaps for the dollar-denominated Notes into euro, which will swap into euro the coupon and principal amount of 100% of the Senior Notes and $230 million of the dollar-denominated 8 1 / 2 % Senior Secured Notes and the coupon of $290 million of dollar-denominated 8 1 / 2 % Senior Secured Notes. Giving effect to the swaps, the weighted average interest rates for the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes are respectively 6.98% and 7.74% per annum.\nThe Notes offering formed part of a comprehensive refinancing of Algeco Scotsman’s capital structure, which closed simultaneously. The refinancing additionally included the issuance of a privately-placed preferred stock facility for net proceeds of €327 million and a new $400 million syndicated senior secured asset-based credit facility. The proceeds were used to redeem the Algeco Group’s existing Senior Secured Notes due 2018 and existing Senior Unsecured Notes due 2019, to refinance the existing asset-based credit facility and to pay for certain costs, fees and expenses.\nThe Notes were offered in a private placement transaction to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nAbout Algeco Scotsman\nAlgeco Scotsman is the leading global business services provider focused on modular space, secure portable storage solutions, and remote workforce accommodation management.
