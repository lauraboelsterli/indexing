    "text": "Published: Feb 13, 2018 4:40 p.m. ET Share \nABLV Bank receives rare sanction Getty Images The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned a major Latvian bank. \nBy Ian Talley \nWASHINGTON — The Treasury Department plans to sever ties between one the Baltic’s largest banks and U.S. markets, charging the bank with laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds, including for companies connected to North Korea’s banned ballistic missile program, the Trump administration said on Tuesday. \nThe rarely used action, part of a broader pressure campaign against North Korea and Russia, is one of Treasury’s most powerful tools. The sanction makes Latvian-based ABLV Bank, which is headquartered in Riga but has an office in Luxembourg, a pariah to other financial institutions and cuts access to the dollar and funding flows from the world’s most important market. \nBecause it can be a death blow to banks, Washington has only used the sanction a handful of times in the last decade. ABLV said in a statement that FinCen’s allegations were unfounded and the bank added it “shall make every care to rebut this outrageous defamatory information.” \nSigal Mandkelker, Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the bank handled transactions for corrupt politicians and funneled billions of dollars in public corruption and other illegal proceeds through shell-company accounts. The institution acted as a financial bridge between customers primarily in the former Soviet satellite nations and Western banks, allowing clients to tap global accounts, Treasury said.",
