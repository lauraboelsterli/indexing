    "text": "Paul George scored 33 points as the short-handed Oklahoma City Thunder routed the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 110-92 Sunday at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\nGeorge helped the Thunder win without point guard Russell Westbrook (sprained left ankle) and forward Carmelo Anthony (sprained right ankle), who missed each missed a second consecutive game. George shot 10 of 24 as Oklahoma City won for the 10th time in 15 games by leading over the final 42:05.\nWhile posting his 10th game with at least 30 points, George also contributed eight assists and three steals.\nAlex Abrines added 16 points as he and George combined to shoot 9 of 17 from 3-point range.\nThe Thunder tied a team record by hitting 16 3-pointers. They made 43.2 percent (16 of 37) from behind the arc.\nRaymond Felton started for Westbrook and contributed 14 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Jerami Grant also finished with 14, while Patrick Patterson started for Anthony and chipped in 14.\nMarc Gasol led the Grizzlies with 18 points, but it was not enough as Memphis dropped its sixth straight. JayMychal Green added 14 points and 12 rebounds while Tyreke Evans finished with 12 points after sitting out the previous five games due to a possible trade.\nAfter starting the game by missing four of their first five shots, the Thunder shot 56.5 percent and made 7 of 8 3-pointers to grab a 35-18 lead after the first quarter. George scored 16 points in the quarter, and the Thunder finished the period with a 22-6 run in the last six-plus minutes.\nOklahoma City set a team record by hitting 12 3-pointers in the first half. Abrines hit the record-setting trey with 76 seconds left in the half, and the Thunder carried a 74-54 lead into halftime.\nGeorge’s 3-pointer hiked the lead to 82-54 shortly after the break, but the Grizzlies were within 92-77 when Ben McLemore knocked down a 3-pointer with 2:38 left in the third quarter.\nOklahoma City took a 95-80 lead into the fourth and expanded it to 107-80 on a basket by Steven Adams with 6:56 left while Memphis missed 10 straight shots following McLemore’s 3-pointer.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
