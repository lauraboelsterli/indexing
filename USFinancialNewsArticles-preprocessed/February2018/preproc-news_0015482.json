    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 12:27 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Wall Street tumbles again as S&P, Dow confirm correction Lewis Krauskopf 2 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged anew on Thursday in another trading session with big swings, as equities remained in a tug-of-war with bond yields, volatility remained high, and investors failed to see a bottom of the market ahead. \nThe benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow industrials confirmed they were in correction territory, both falling more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 record highs. The S&P 500 slumped 3.8 percent on Thursday, while the Dow dropped 4.2 percent as losses accelerated late in the trading day. \nThursday marked another day of sharp swings in recent sessions including the S&P 500’s biggest drop in more than six years that pulled equities away from record highs.
