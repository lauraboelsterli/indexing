    "text": "BOSTON (AP) â€” A longtime executive at Google and its parent company Alphabet is taking on a new role at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe university announced Monday that Eric Schmidt will become an innovation fellow starting in the spring.\nIt's a yearlong fellowship that will involve working with MIT scholars and advising the newly-launched MIT Intelligence Quest. The new research initiative is pursuing discoveries in both artificial and human intelligence.\nSchmidt was Google's CEO from 2001 to 2011, a time of rapid growth for the Mountain View, California-based technology company. He later became executive chairman for Google, and then, in 2015, its newly-formed parent company Alphabet.\nHe resigned as Alphabet's chairman last month but remains a board member and technical adviser to the company.",
