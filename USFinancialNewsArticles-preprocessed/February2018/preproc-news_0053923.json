    "text": " 25 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Murray at the double as Brighton crush Swansea Reuters Staff 3 Min Read BRIGHTON AND HOVE ALBION 4 SWANSEA CITY 1 Feb 24 (Reuters) - Glenn Murray’s double helped Brighton and Hove Albion to a crucial 4-1 victory over fellow Premier League relegation battlers Swansea City on the south coast on Saturday. Swansea had claimed 11 points from their last five league games to escape the bottom three but they slid back below the trap door after being swept aside by a slick Brighton side. Murray converted an 18th-minute penalty after being fouled by Mike van der Hoorn and took his league tally to 10 for the season after the break, slotting in Jose Izquierdo’s cut-back. Anthony Knockaert, who had a goal ruled out for offside, made it 3-0 when he raced on to a through ball by Pascal Gross. Lewis Dunk’s own goal, his fourth of the season, offered Swansea some late hope but Dutchman Juergen Locadia’s goal on his Premier League debut completed the rout. Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion vs Swansea City - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton, Britain - February 24, 2018 Brighton's Anthony Knockaert scores their third goal REUTERS/Hannah McKay Swansea could have few complaints although things could have been different had Martin Olsson not missed an open goal just before the break after Jordan Ayew’s effort hit the post. Victory moved Brighton four points above Swansea who are third from bottom with 10 games to play, although the congested nature of the bottom half of the table means the battle for survival will have many more twists and turns. Slideshow (6 Images) “It was important we got the three points and moved up the table a little bit,” Murray said. “It’s still in the balance and we can’t take our foot off the pedal. But to move out of the mire is nice.” Swansea manager Carlos Carvalhal, whose appointment has transformed the Welsh club’s season, said individual mistakes had cost his side dearly and forced him to gamble. “The story is we tried to turn it around by putting more players into attack in the second half because we were losing and we wanted to win three points,” he said. ”We reacted well to their first goal. We took a player from midfield and put them up front, we knew that was a big risk. “We’d either win or the opponent would score. We took those risks very early. That’s football, it was a high risk bet.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Rex Gowar and Toby Davis",
