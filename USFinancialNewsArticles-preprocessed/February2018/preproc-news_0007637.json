    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 9:31 AM / in 8 minutes UPDATE 2-Dutch say cut of up to 2 bcm possible at Groningen gas field Reuters Staff \n* Dutch gas regulator: cut Groningen production to 12 bcm \n* Groningen production at 60 percent lower than 2014 peak \n* Operator Gasunie: cuts only if production can fluctuate \n* Minister: close Loppersum site in Groningen field (Adds quotes, details) \nBy Bart H. Meijer \nTHE HAGUE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Netherlands said on Thursday it would be possible to cut production at the Groningen gas field by up to 2 billion cubic meters this year, depending on temperatures, after the regulator urged a much larger reduction to limit the risk of earthquakes. \nThe government has already lowered output from Groningen several times in recent years as decades of extraction have led to dozens of earthquakes each year, damaging thousands of homes and buildings. \nThe government is under increasing pressure to find a way to ensure energy needs are met while guaranteeing safety. \nGas sector regulator SodM recommended production in Groningen be limited to 12 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, from the current cap of 21.6 bcm, in order to reduce the risk of further large earthquakes. \nIt said production should be cut even further in the future, with a “total shutdown” possible if necessary, after the northern Dutch region was hit by a 3.4 magnitude quake, the largest in years, in January. \nMeanwhile, gas transport company Gasunie said on Thursday that demand could be met with a cap of 19.5-21 bcm in the current gas year through October 2018 - but only under a production system that allows temperature to fluctuate along with temperatures. \nEconomic affairs minister Eric Wiebes appeared to lean towards maintaining energy needs in his initial response to the agencies on Thursday. \nHe ordered the immediate halt of production at the Loppersum site in the Groningen gas field and pleaded for producer NAM and transporter Gasunie to take all possible measures to reduce production using existing possibilities - resulting in a trim of between 0.5 bcm and 2 bcm, depending on temperatures. \n“SAFE SIDE” \nGas company NAM, the joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil that runs the Groningen field, last month proposed halting production at six points in the Groningen gas field and lowering production overall, without setting any concrete target. \nOnce the largest supplier of European Union gas, output at Groningen has already been trimmed by 60 percent from a peak of 54 bcm in 2013. \nThe regulator’s recommendation will not end earthquakes, but should reduce risks for people living in the region significantly, SodM inspector-general Theodor Kockelkoren said. \n“We are erring on the safe side as the uncertainty is large. It’s impossible to exactly predict the magnitude of earthquakes at different levels of production”, Kockelkoren said. “It is now up to the minister to make a very difficult decision.” \nSodM recommended immediately cutting production entirely at five points in the Groningen field: Ten Post, Overschild, De Paauwen, ‘T Zand and Leermens. \nProduction at the Bierum cluster should be kept as stable as possible, with fluctuations limited to around 20 percent, the regulator said. \nThe Gasunie recommendation would allow production to be as low as 14 bcm in relatively warm years - but it would risk forcing a major increase in cold years to as high as 27 bcm. Production is currently kept as stable as possible in order to lessen the risk of major earthquakes. \nWiebes is expected to have a full overview of ways to reduce production, including by lowering consumer and industrial demand, by the end of March. The government will issue a new decision on production for the year through October 2019 by June. \nWiebes last month promised to cut production in Groningen by “as much as reasonably possible”. \nDutch gas prices were little changed after the announcement. Earlier this week, analysts said production of around 18 bcm/year would guarantee supplies. \n“I felt anything below 19bcm as a current cap would be bullish. Price movement as yet has not been much,” said Oliver Sanderson, Thomson Reuters gas analyst. “I think this is because the market is waiting for confirmation”. \nHe said he thought NAM would not accept the 12 bcm cap until several years in the future and would make a shorter term counterproposal.
