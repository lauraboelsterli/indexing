(NYSE: VTR) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017:\nIncome from continuing operations per diluted common share for the full year 2017 grew 13 percent to $1.80 compared to the same period in 2016. For the fourth quarter 2017, income from continuing operations per diluted common share was $0.50. Normalized Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted common share for the full year 2017 grew one percent to $4.16 compared to the same period in 2016. For the fourth quarter 2017, normalized FFO per diluted common share was $1.03. Reported FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT FFO”), for the full year 2017 grew two percent to $4.22 compared to the same period in 2016. For the fourth quarter 2017, NAREIT FFO per diluted common share was $1.13. The Company recognized $717 million, or $2.00 per share, in gains on real estate disposals in 2017, which are included in net income but excluded from income from continuing operations, normalized FFO and NAREIT FFO.\nThe Ventas Advantage: Foundation for Lasting Excellence\n“2017 was another excellent year for Ventas, as we generated record cash flow from operations and delivered normalized FFO per share and same-store property cash NOI growth at the high end of our expectations,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “To further enhance our diverse portfolio, we made nearly $2 billion in value-creating investments, including significant expansion of our exciting university-based life science business, profitably disposed of almost $1 billion in assets and completed innovative deals with our leading operating partners.\n“The Ventas Advantage has proven resilient through cycles for two decades. This success is founded on solid strategic vision, superior foresight and innovation, intelligent and timely capital allocation decisions, rigorous execution and a cohesive, expert team. As we enter 2018 - our Company’s 20 th anniversary year - we are confident that we will continue our long track record of superior consistent performance as the industry leader.”\n2017 Performance\nFor the full year 2017, the Company’s normalized FFO per diluted common share year-over-year growth of one percent to $4.16 was principally due to accretive investments and improved property performance, partially offset by the impact of dispositions and loan repayments, higher rates on refinanced debt and lower profits and fees from beneficial transactions. For the full year 2017, the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities grew five percent to $1.44 billion compared to the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, the Company’s same-store total portfolio (1,037 assets) cash net operating income (“NOI”) grew 2.5 percent compared to the same period in 2016, at the high end of previously disclosed guidance of 2 to 2.5 percent. For the fourth quarter 2017, the Company’s same-store total portfolio (1,068 assets) cash NOI grew 2 percent compared to the same period in 2016. Same-store cash NOI growth for the total portfolio and by segment for the full year and fourth quarter 2017 follows:\n2017 Same-Store Cash NOI Full Year 2017 Q4 2017 Reported Growth 10/27/17 Guidance Reported Growth Triple-Net 3.7% 3% ─ 3.5% 4.2% SHOP 1.3% 0.5% ─ 1.5% (0.1%) Office 2.0% 1.5% ─ 2% 1.5% Total Company 2.5% 2% ─ 2.5% 2.0%\n2017 and Recent Highlights\n2017 New Investments: Ventas closed on $1.8 billion of investments and new development and redevelopment project commitments, including: University-Based Life Science Growth: The Company made acquisitions or development commitments approaching $400 million with new and existing relationships to further scale its institutional university-based life science business affiliated with leading research universities and companies: New relationships included the Company’s acquisitions of high-quality life science and research properties affiliated with AA-rated Brown University (“Brown”) and AA-rated Virginia Commonwealth University. Ventas also grew with existing partners, including follow-on development projects with Brown and Washington University in St. Louis. Ventas has grown its overall life science footprint by 37 percent since its initial life science acquisition in September 2016. High-Quality Growth with Leading Seniors Housing Partners: Ventas acquired nearly $400 million in high-quality seniors housing communities principally located in coastal markets and also committed to over $275 million of attractive development and redevelopment projects, primarily with leading senior care providers Atria Senior Living (“Atria”) and Sunrise Senior Living. These development projects are all part of joint ventures with institutional capital partners. Scaling of Leading Health System Platform: Ventas invested in the growth of leading healthcare provider Ardent Health Services (“Ardent”) by funding Ardent’s acquisition of LHP Hospital Group through a $700 million term loan. Pro forma for the pending acquisition of East Texas Medical Center by Ardent and the University of Texas System, Ardent will be an over $4 billion in annual revenue private, for-profit provider operating 31 hospitals in 7 states with average market shares of nearly 40 percent and with valuable not-for-profit and academic medical center relationships. Profitable Capital Recycling: Ventas sold properties and received final repayments on loans receivable in 2017 for proceeds of over $900 million, with gains exceeding $700 million. The majority of proceeds consisted of the Company’s completed sales of its 36 skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) operated by Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) (“Kindred”) for proceeds of $700 million, representing a seven percent yield on cash rent and an eight percent GAAP yield. Ventas’s percentage of aggregate NOI received from SNFs is now only one percent. Focused Partnerships with Leading Platforms: Ventas’s operators and assets continue to be highly valued and sought after, as experienced investors made meaningful investments in its platforms. Ventas’s support positioned its operators for continued success and value creation, including: recapitalization of Atria in its growth-focused capital raise with Fremont Realty Group; establishment of a new strategic seniors housing relationship in Eclipse Senior Living, a newly-formed operator founded by a team of experienced senior living executives led by industry veteran Kai Hsiao; and support of Kindred’s pending acquisition by TPG, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Humana (NYSE: HUM), which will create a separate, operationally focused and financially strong company that will operate Ventas’s long-term acute care and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Outstanding Financial Strength and Liquidity : The Company’s liquidity and financial flexibility remain strong, including: Net debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA of 5.7x at year-end 2017; Total indebtedness to gross asset value of 38 percent at year-end 2017; Exceptional fixed charge coverage of 4.6x at year-end 2017; Dividends for 2017 totaled $3.115 per share, representing a five percent year-over-year increase; and Excellent liquidity currently with over $2.7 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities and approximately $100 million of cash on hand. Leadership in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters: Ventas accelerated its commitment to ESG matters and was recognized repeatedly for its results and leadership, including: First time inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability™ North America Index, ranking in the top quartile of real estate companies in North America across a broad spectrum of ESG metrics; Recognition as NAREIT’s 2017 Health Care “Leader in the Light,” and first place ranking among the three listed healthcare real estate company participants in the 2017 GRESB real estate ESG assessment; and Being named a “Winning Company” in the 2020 Women on Boards Gender Diversity Index, which showcases Fortune 1000 Companies with 20 percent or greater women serving on their boards of directors. The Ventas Board of Directors is currently 30 percent female. Company and Leadership Recognition Ventas was named one of Fortune’s “2018 World’s Most Admired Companies” in January 2018, the only healthcare REIT on this year’s list, recognizing the Company’s industry leadership, exemplary stewardship and world-class team. Ventas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Cafaro was again recognized as a top global CEO and a leader in the real estate and healthcare industries, including being named by: Forbes as one of the “World's 100 Most Powerful Women” for the second year; The Harvard Business Review as one of “The Best-Performing CEOs in the World” for the fourth consecutive year; and Modern Healthcare as one of the “100 Most Influential People in Healthcare.” In the Harvard Business Review’s ranking of “The Best-Performing CEOs,” Ventas’s financial performance ranked in the top four percent of all companies measured, listed at number 32 of almost 900 firms - highlighting the superior and consistent performance of Ventas over an 18-year period.\nFirst Quarter Dividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter 2018 of $0.79 per share, representing a two percent year-over-year increase. The dividend is payable in cash on April 12, 2018 to stockholders of record on April 2, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\n“Our 2018 forecast reflects our expectation that our high-quality diverse portfolio will continue to grow same-store cash NOI. It incorporates continued strategic actions to create shareholder value over the short and long-term, including $1.5 billion in asset dispositions, inclusive of a potential joint venture on an existing portfolio of senior housing assets and proceeds from the repayment of nearly $850 million of highly profitable loan investments. These disposition proceeds are expected to be redeployed into the repayment of debt, resulting in further improvement of our balance sheet, and investments in future growth in our attractive university-based life science business,” said Cafaro. “While these actions affect 2018 normalized FFO, we are confident they position us to seize opportunities and maintain our leading market position.”\nVentas expects 2018 income from continuing operations per share, NAREIT FFO per share, normalized FFO per share and same-store cash NOI growth to range as follows:\nFull Year 2018 Range Per Diluted Common Share Low High Income from Cont. Ops $1.34 ─ $1.40 NAREIT FFO $3.80 ─ $3.89 Normalized FFO $3.95 ─ $4.05 Full Year 2018 Projected Same- Store Cash NOI Growth Current Guidance Low High Triple-Net 3% ─ 4% SHOP (4%) ─ (1%) Office 1.75% ─ 2.75% Total Company 0.5% ─ 2%\nSubstantially all of the expected normalized FFO change in 2018 compared to 2017 results from: (a) no material unannounced acquisitions included in 2018 guidance; (b) the impact of 2017 and 2018 disposition activity including i) the carryover impact of nearly $1 billion of late 2017 dispositions - principally comprised of $700 million in SNF dispositions at an eight percent GAAP yield - and related debt reduction and ii) $1.5 billion of additional capital recycling in 2018 at a GAAP rate of over eight percent, including joint ventures, loan repayments and other asset dispositions, the proceeds of which will be used principally to retire debt; and (c) proactive balance sheet management, including the expectation that the Company will refinance approximately $1 billion of debt during the year with longer-duration fixed rate debt, and increased interest expense from LIBOR increases. Debt retirement in 2018 is expected to further improve the Company’s net debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA ratio to approximately 5.5x by year-end 2018.\nThe Company’s guidance does include the funding of $425 million in future growth through high-quality development and redevelopment projects, mostly in Ventas’s attractive university-based life science and medical office businesses.\nVentas expects continued positive same-store cash NOI growth in 2018 for the Company’s total property portfolio. Total portfolio same-store cash NOI is expected to grow 0.5 to 2 percent, with strong Office and Triple-Net portfolio growth being largely offset by seniors housing operating portfolio (“SHOP”) performance. SHOP same-store cash NOI is expected to be lower in 2018 due to the cumulative impact of new seniors housing supply in certain markets and the full year occupancy impact of a severe flu season. Same-store NOI growth in 2018 as measured on a GAAP basis is expected at the guidance midpoint to be 100 basis points lower than same-store cash NOI growth for the total Company property portfolio, with the most pronounced differential in the Office segment.\nNo equity issuance is included in guidance. The 2018 outlook assumes approximately 360 million weighted average fully-diluted shares. A reconciliation of the Company’s guidance to the Company’s projected GAAP measures is included in this press release.\nThe Company’s guidance is based on a number of other assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Conference Call\nVentas will hold a conference call to discuss this earnings release today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

annual per share amounts due to material changes in the Company’s weighted average diluted share count, if any.\nHistorical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. In particular, the Company believes that normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of FFO and normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.\nThe Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property, including gains or losses on re-measurement of equity method investments, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company defines normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles, transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to acquisition lawsuits; (b) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan and derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration, severance-related costs and charitable donations made to the Ventas Charitable Foundation; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) expenses related to the re-audit and re-review in 2014 of the Company’s historical financial statements and related matters; and (h) net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters. Normalized FAD represents normalized FFO excluding non-cash components, which include straight-line rental adjustments, and deducting capital expenditures, including certain tenant allowances and leasing commissions. FAD represents normalized FAD after subtracting merger-related expenses, deal costs and re-audit costs and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities.\nFFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD should not be considered as alternatives to net income or income from continuing operations (both determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that income from continuing operations is the most comparable GAAP measure because it provides insight into the Company’s continuing operations. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income and income from continuing operations as presented elsewhere herein.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION EPS, FFO and FAD Guidance Attributable to Common Stockholders 1,2\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Tentative / Preliminary and Subject to Change FY2018 - Guidance FY2018 - Per Share Low High Low High Income from Continuing Operations $484 $505 $1.34 $1.40 Gain on Real Estate Dispositions 280 310 0.78 0.86 Other Adjustments 3 (4 ) (6 ) (0.01 ) (0.02 ) Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders $760 $809 $2.11 $2.25 Depreciation and Amortization Adjustments 887 900 2.46 2.50 Gain on Real Estate Dispositions (280 ) (310 ) (0.78 ) (0.86 ) Other Adjustments 3 — — — — FFO (NAREIT) Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,367 $1,399 $3.80 $3.89 Merger-Related Expenses, Deal Costs and Re-Audit Costs 13 8 0.04 0.02 (Gain) Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net 45 63 0.12 0.18 Other Adjustments 3 (3 ) (12 ) (0.01 ) (0.03 ) Normalized FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,422 $1,458 $3.95 $4.05 % Year-Over-Year Growth (5 )% (3 )% Non-Cash Items Included in Normalized FFO 19 17 Capital Expenditures (138 ) (148 ) Normalized FAD Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,303 $1,327 Merger-Related Expense, Deal Costs and Re-Audit Costs (13 ) (8 ) Other Adjustments 3 (4 ) (2 ) FAD Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,286 $1,317 Weighted Average Diluted Shares (in millions) 360 360 1\nThe Company’s guidance constitutes within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company.

The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and office building services costs. In the case of NOI, cash receipts may differ due to straight-line recognition of certain rental income and the application of other GAAP policies. The Company believes that income from continuing operations is the most comparable GAAP measure for both NOI and same-store cash NOI because it provides insight into the Company’s continuing operations. The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated, operational and reported under a consistent business model for the full period in both comparison periods, and excluding assets intended for disposition and for SHOP, those properties that transitioned operators after the start of the prior comparison period. To normalize for exchange rate movements, all same-store cash NOI measures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.\nTriple-Net Leased Properties Senior Living Operations Office Operations All Other Total For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Income from continuing operations $ 178,835 Adjustments: Interest and other income (5,180 ) Interest 111,951 Depreciation and amortization 232,650 General, administrative and professional fees 34,930 Gain on extinguishment of debt, net (102 ) Merger-related expenses and deal costs 1,632 Other 3,986 Loss from unconsolidated entities 4,355 Income tax benefit (46,680 ) Reported Segment NOI $ 206,301 $ 143,332 $ 134,014 $ 32,730 516,377 Adjustments: Normalizing adjustment for technology costs — 310 — — 310 NOI not included in same-store (28,931 ) (3,444 ) (8,116 ) — (40,491 ) Straight-lining of rental income (608 ) — (5,142 ) — (5,750 ) Non-cash rental income (3,007 ) — (351 ) — (3,358 ) Non-segment NOI — — — (32,730 ) (32,730 ) (32,546 ) (3,134 ) (13,609 ) (32,730 ) (82,019 ) Same-Store cash NOI (Constant Currency) $ 173,755 $ 140,198 $ 120,405 $ — $ 434,358 Percentage increase 4.2 % (0.1 )% 1.5 % 2.0 % For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Income from continuing operations $ 142,575 Adjustments: Interest and other income (84 ) Interest 107,739 Depreciation and amortization 232,189 General, administrative and professional fees 31,488 Gain on extinguishment of debt, net (386 ) Merger-related expenses and deal costs (438 ) Other 1,087 Income from unconsolidated entities (2,207 ) Income tax benefit (2,836 ) Reported Segment NOI $ 212,049 $ 146,616\n$ 130,120 $ 20,342 509,127 Adjustments: NOI not included in same-store (39,013 ) (7,099 ) (6,547 ) — (52,659\n) Straight-lining of rental income (1,774 ) — (4,828 ) — (6,602 ) Non-cash rental income (4,782 ) — (131 ) — (4,913 ) Non-segment NOI — — — (20,342\n)\n(20,342 ) NOI impact from change in FX 330 854 — — 1,184 (45,239 ) (6,245 ) (11,506 ) (20,342 ) (83,332 ) Same-Store cash NOI (Constant Currency) $ 166,810 $ 140,371 $ 118,614 $ — $\n425,795\nTriple-Net Leased Properties Senior Living Operations Office Operations All Other Total For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Income from continuing operations $ 643,949 Adjustments: Interest and other income (6,034 ) Interest 448,196 Depreciation and amortization 887,948 General, administrative and professional fees 135,490 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 754 Merger-related expenses and deal costs 10,535 Other 20,052 Loss from unconsolidated entities 561 Income tax benefit (59,799 ) Reported Segment NOI $ 844,711 $ 593,167 $ 524,566 $ 119,208 2,081,652 Adjustments: Normalizing adjustment for technology costs — 3,375 — — 3,375 NOI not included in same-store (142,448 ) (32,574 ) (125,974 ) — (300,996 ) Straight-lining of rental income (3,612 ) — (19,521 ) — (23,133 ) Non-cash rental income (16,758 ) — (942 ) — (17,700 ) Non-segment NOI — — — (119,208 ) (119,208 ) (162,818 ) (29,199 ) (146,437 ) (119,208 ) (457,662 ) Same-Store cash NOI (Constant Currency) $ 681,893 $ 563,968 $ 378,129 $ — $ 1,623,990 Percentage increase 3.7 % 1.3 % 2.0 % 2.5 % For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Income from continuing operations $ 554,209 Adjustments: Interest and other income (876 ) Interest 419,740 Depreciation and amortization 898,924 General, administrative and professional fees 126,875 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 2,779 Merger-related expenses and deal costs 24,635 Other 9,988 Income from unconsolidated entities (4,358 ) Income tax benefit (31,343 ) Reported Segment NOI $ 850,755 $ 604,328 $ 444,276 $ 101,214 2,000,573 Adjustments: Modification fee 2,720 — — — 2,720 NOI not included in same-store (158,884 ) (49,128 ) (63,015 ) — (271,027 ) Straight-lining of rental income (15,411 ) — (12,577 ) — (27,988 ) Non-cash rental income (20,288 ) — 1,905 — (18,383 ) Non-segment NOI — — — (101,214 ) (101,214 ) NOI impact from change in FX (1,037 ) 1,293 — — 256 (192,900 ) (47,835 ) (73,687 ) (101,214 ) (415,636 ) Same-Store cash NOI (Constant Currency) $ 657,855 $ 556,493 $ 370,589 $ — $ 1,584,937\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION NOI and Same-Store Cash NOI by Segment Guidance 1,2\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) FY2018 -
