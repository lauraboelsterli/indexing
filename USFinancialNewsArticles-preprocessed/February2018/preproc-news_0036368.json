Dr. Breidbart is an accomplished managed care executive with over 20 years of experience driving quality improvement and establishing quality-based payment models.

Prior to Solera Health, Dr. Breidbart served as Chief Clinical Officer at Emblem Health, and as Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield’s (BCBS) Chief Medical Officer. At the former, he was responsible for all clinical program strategies and quality-based payment models. At BCBS, Dr. Breidbart significantly reduced the out-of-network spend by spearheading an advanced patient notification process and instituting a post-discharge program.\nDr. Breidbart has dedicated much of his career to improving the health care of New Yorkers. “Affinity Health Plan has earned a reputation for providing New Yorkers with high quality, cost-effective care for over 30 years,” said Dr. Breidbart. “I am thrilled to work alongside the rest of the team to further improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of health care for our members.”\nDr. Breidbart brings to his role at Affinity a decade of clinical experience as a pediatric endocrinologist at New York Medical College in Valhalla, NY. He earned his medical degree from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, his master’s degree in business administration from Pace University and his undergraduate degree from Yale University. Dr. Breidbart completed his residency in Pediatrics at Babies Hospital at Columbia Presbyterian (now Children’s Hospital of New York) and Westchester Medical Center.\nAbout Affinity Health Plan\nFounded in 1986, Affinity is an independent, not-for-profit organization driven by the mission to help its members, their families and their communities lead healthier lives.
