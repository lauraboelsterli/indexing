    "text": "Company Nearly Doubles Revenues One Year since Acquisition\nPALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HGGC, a leading middle-market private equity firm, today announced the completion of two acquisitions by Davies Group Ltd, a tech-enabled operations management, consulting and digital solutions provider. The acquisitions of Total Loss Settlement Services Limited (TLSS) and Randall & Quilter’s Insurance Services and Captive Management operations mark the fifth and sixth strategic add-ons to the Davies Group platform since HGGC acquired the business a year ago.\nTLSS is a United Kingdom-based specialist motor claims desk engineering and total loss solutions provider. The company will form part of Davies Motor within the group’s claims solutions business, adding scale and capabilities that allow the company to deliver additional value and efficiency for insurance clients. The carve-out of the Insurance Services and Captive Management operations from Randall & Quilter extends Davies’ international presence and expands the company’s offering in its Insurance Services division.\nPrevious acquisitions completed under HGGC’s ownership include Service Tick, Ambant, CMSL, and Cynergie. Through these acquisitions, as well as double-digit organic growth, Davies Group has nearly doubled revenues in the last 12 months and expanded its business to provide more tech-enabled services to organizations in additional highly regulated markets, including insurance, financial services, utilities, and communications, as well as to regulatory bodies.\n“We knew that Davies was a great platform for growth when we acquired it,” said John Block, Principal at HGGC. “After a year of solid focus, Davies has grown into a more capable international business process outsourcer with scale and operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Bermuda and North America.”\nWith its scope of services across three distinct business lines: Claims Solutions, Insurance Services, and Customer Solutions, Davies provides a greater number of organizations with deeper and more comprehensive business insights.\n“Davies’ expanded offering of resources and service capabilities allows the company to deliver end to end solutions, making them a more valuable business partner for their diverse customer base,” said Rich Lawson, CEO and Co-Founder at HGGC. “Dan Saulter and his team have done a great job of integrating these acquisitions without any interruption in providing world-class service to customers.”\n“HGGC is a fantastic partner for Davies,” said Dan Saulter, Group CEO at Davies. “The team’s can-do attitude, support and insights have helped us grow and outperform in the past year. We have not only driven organic and M&A growth, but we have continued our digital transformation, commercializing our use of drones, video, and robotics; and the successful launch of our ‘Disruptive thinking’ innovation lab, placing the power of new ideas in the hands of our people.”\nAbout Davies Group\nDavies Group is a multi-award winning operations management, consulting and digital solutions provider to organisations in highly regulated markets, including insurance, financial services, utilities, communications and to regulatory bodies.
