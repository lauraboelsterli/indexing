    "text": "28 Mins Ago | 01:18 \nYour next home could be built by robots. Designed by Construction Robotics, this robot mason is named SAM 100, short for \"Semi-Automated Mason.\" According to Construction Robotics, the bot can place between 300 and 400 bricks an hour, compared to a human which can only lay around 60 to 75 bricks an hour. \nLast year, the construction industry began going through a boom , however the industry is facing a severe labor shortage. As skilled laborers are aging out of the workforce, the gap is expected to widen. Robot workers like SAM 100 could help alleviate some of that strain.",
