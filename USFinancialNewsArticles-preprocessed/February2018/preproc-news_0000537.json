    "text": "JOHNS CREEK, Ga., Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Saia, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA), a leading transportation provider offering multi-regional less-than-truckload (LTL), non-asset truckload, expedited and logistics services, today reported fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results.\nFourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share of $1.82 compares to $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, our diluted earnings per share were $3.49 versus $1.87 in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a reduction in deferred income tax liability that was required as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this reduction, diluted earnings per share were $0.53 for the fourth quarter and $2.19 per share for 2017. 1\nHighlights from our fourth quarter and full year operating results were as follows:\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016 Results\nRevenues were $353 million, a 17.7% increase Operating income was $22.9 million, a 33.2% increase Operating ratio improved by 80 basis points to 93.5 LTL shipments per workday increased 8.7% LTL tonnage per workday increased 8.3% LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 8.7%\n2017 Results Compared to 2016 Results\nRecord revenues of $1.4 billion compares to $1.2 billion Operating income was $94.7 million, a 19.7% increase Operating ratio of 93.1 compares to 93.5 LTL shipments per workday increased 5.6% LTL tonnage per workday increased 5.2% LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 8.0%\n“Fourth quarter results reflect not only significant growth from our expansion into new markets this past year, but are also indicative of continuing strong freight activity and disciplined pricing. The two terminals we opened in the fourth quarter bring the 2017 total openings in new markets to six or approximately 4% terminal growth,” said Saia President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick O’Dell. “Customers have been very responsive to our offering of an expanded service area and freight in and out of new markets in the Northeast in December accounted for 6.8% of daily LTL revenue,” O’Dell continued.\n“Our revenue run rate in the Northeast has exceeded our expectations. We believe both existing and new customers value our broader direct LTL shipping coverage and that this provides a potential future growth opportunity. We also believe customers value the 98% on-time service standard and .73% cargo claims ratio that we achieved in the fourth quarter. Our LTL yield increased by 8.7% in the quarter, marking our 30 th consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement,” stated O’Dell.\n“In 2018 we plan to open terminals in 4-6 new markets, as we continue to execute on our plan to provide 48-state coverage for our customers over the next few years,” concluded O’Dell.\nFinancial Position and Capital Expenditures\nTotal debt was $132.9 million at December 31, 2017 and inclusive of the cash on-hand, net debt to total capital was 18.0%. This compares to total debt of $73.8 million and net debt to total capital of 13.0% at December 31, 2016.\nNet capital expenditures in 2017 were $217.0 million including equipment acquired with capital leases. This compares to $152.4 million in net capital expenditures in 2016. In 2018, we anticipate net capital expenditures of approximately $265 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements reflect the present expectation of future events of our management as of the date of this news release and are subject to a number of important factors, risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. These factors, risks, uncertainties and assumptions include, but are not limited to, (1) general economic conditions including downturns in the business cycle; (2) effectiveness of Company-specific performance improvement initiatives, including management of the cost structure to match shifts in customer volume levels; (3) the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services; (4) failure to achieve acquisition synergies; (5) failure to operate and grow acquired businesses in a manner that supports the value allocated to these acquired businesses, including their goodwill; (6) economic declines in the geographic regions or industries in which our customers operate; (7) competitive initiatives and pricing pressures, including in connection with fuel surcharge; (8) loss of significant customers; (9) the Company’s need for capital and uncertainty of the credit markets; (10) the possibility of defaults under the Company’s debt agreements (including violation of financial covenants); (11) possible issuance of equity which would dilute stock ownership; (12) integration risks; (13) the effect of litigation including class action lawsuits; (14) cost and availability of qualified drivers, fuel, purchased transportation, real property, revenue equipment and other assets; (15) governmental regulations, including but not limited to Hours of Service, engine emissions, the Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) initiative, compliance with legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting, Homeland Security, environmental regulations and the Food and Drug Administration; (16) changes in interpretation of accounting principles; (17) dependence on key employees; (18) inclement weather; (19) labor relations, including the adverse impact should a portion of the Company’s workforce become unionized; (20) terrorism risks; (21) self-insurance claims and other expense volatility; (22) cost and availability of insurance coverage; (23) increased costs of healthcare and prescription drugs, including as a result of healthcare reform legislation; (24) social media risks; (25) cyber security risk; (26) failure to successfully execute the strategy to expand the Company’s service geography into the Northeastern United States; and (27) other financial, operational and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company’s SEC filings. In addition, information regarding the impact of the Tax Act is a preliminary estimate. This estimate is a forward-looking statement and is subject to change, possibly materially, as the Company completes its financial statements. Information regarding the impact of the Tax Act is based on the Company’s current calculations, as well as the Company’s current interpretations, assumptions and expectations relating to the Tax Act, which are subject to further guidance and change. As a result of these and other factors, no assurance can be given as to our future results and achievements. A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances and those future events or circumstances may not occur.\nFOOTNOTE\n1 Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure and Reconciliation:\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowers U.S. corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018, among other changes. The estimated impact of the Tax Act was a reduction of deferred income tax liability due to the effects of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates. Management believes that presenting the Company’s results excluding the Tax Act is meaningful as excluding this item increases the comparability of period-to-period results. Diluted earnings per common share excluding the impact of the Tax Act is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents the calculation of diluted earnings per common share, excluding the impact of the Tax Act:\nSaia, Inc. and Subsidiaries Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Reconciliation to GAAP For the Quarters and Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Unaudited) Fourth Quarter Years 2017 2016 2017 2016 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.82 $ 0.40 $ 3.49 $ 1.87 Less: Diluted earnings per share impact of Tax Act (1.29 ) - (1.30 ) - Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.53 $ 0.40 $ 2.19 $ 1.87 CONTACT: Saia, Inc.\nDoug Col\ndcol@saia.com\n678.542.3910\nSaia, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Amounts in thousands) (Unaudited) December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,720 $ 1,539 Accounts receivable, net 170,610 135,083 Prepaid expenses and other 28,251 29,857 Total current assets 203,581 166,479 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Cost 1,289,994 1,101,946 Less: accumulated depreciation 554,214 497,827 Net property and equipment 735,780 604,119 OTHER ASSETS 28,286 29,772 Total assets $ 967,647 $ 800,370 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable $ 57,717 $ 45,149 Wages and employees' benefits 39,748 31,700 Other current liabilities 55,657 51,333 Current portion of long-term debt 14,083 16,762 Total current liabilities 167,205 144,944 OTHER LIABILITIES: Long-term debt, less current portion 118,833 57,042 Deferred income taxes 59,423 80,199 Claims, insurance and other 39,639 35,107 Total other liabilities 217,895 172,348 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY: Common stock 26 25 Additional paid-in capital 246,454 237,846 Deferred compensation trust (3,486 ) (3,190 ) Retained earnings 339,553 248,397 Total stockholders' equity 582,547 483,078 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 967,647 $ 800,370\nSaia, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Operations For the Quarters and Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited) Fourth Quarter Years 2017 2016 2017 2016 OPERATING REVENUE $ 353,251 $ 300,223 $ 1,378,510 $ 1,218,481 OPERATING EXPENSES: Salaries, wages and employees' benefits 194,579 171,169 766,790 696,046 Purchased transportation 21,270 13,890 81,482 56,329 Fuel, operating expenses and supplies 71,329 57,953 268,090 230,364 Operating taxes and licenses 11,242 9,798 43,330 40,025 Claims and insurance 9,152 10,676 37,162 39,625 Depreciation and amortization 22,495 19,330 87,102 76,240 Loss (gain) from property disposals, net 286 220 (183 ) 716 Total operating expenses 330,353 283,036 1,283,773 1,139,345 OPERATING INCOME 22,898 17,187 94,737 79,136 NONOPERATING EXPENSES (INCOME): Interest expense 1,289 984 5,051 4,394 Other, net (149 ) (30 ) (92 ) (177 ) Nonoperating expenses, net 1,140 954 4,959 4,217 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 21,758 16,233 89,778 74,919 Income tax expense (benefit) (26,001 ) 5,885 (1,378 ) 26,895 NET INCOME $ 47,759 $ 10,348 $ 91,156 $ 48,024 Average common shares outstanding - basic 25,589 25,084 25,518 25,038 Average common shares outstanding - diluted 26,189 25,782 26,086 25,680 Basic earnings per share $ 1.87 $ 0.41 $ 3.57 $ 1.92 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.82 $ 0.40 $ 3.49 $ 1.87\nSaia, Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Amounts in thousands) (Unaudited) Years 2017 2016 OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net cash provided by operating activities (1) $ 157,846 $ 146,426 Net cash provided by operating activities 157,846 146,426 INVESTING ACTIVITIES: Acquisition of property and equipment (186,696 ) (119,365 ) Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment 5,172 1,682 Net cash used in investing activities (181,524 ) (117,683 ) FINANCING ACTIVITIES: Repayment of long-term debt (7,143 ) (7,143 ) Borrowing (repayment) of revolving credit agreement, net 43,000 (14,534 ) Proceeds from stock option exercises 4,480 3,173 Shares withheld for taxes (1) (1,250 ) (650 ) Other financing activity (12,228 ) (8,174 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 26,859 (27,328 ) NET INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 3,181 1,415 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, BEGINNING OF YEAR 1,539 124 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, END OF YEAR $ 4,720 $ 1,539 NON-CASH ITEMS: Equipment financed with capital leases $ 35,483 $ 34,683 (1) December 31, 2016 balances have been reclassified to conform with the 2017 adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .\nSaia, Inc. and Subsidiaries Financial Information For the Quarters Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Unaudited) Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter % Amount/Workday % 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Workdays 61 61 Operating ratio 93.5 % 94.3 % Tonnage (1) LTL 912 842 8.3 14.95 13.80 8.3 TL 192 172 11.5 3.15 2.83 11.5 Shipments (1) LTL 1,636 1,506 8.7 26.83 24.69 8.7 TL 27 24 11.6 0.44 0.40 11.6 Revenue/cwt.
