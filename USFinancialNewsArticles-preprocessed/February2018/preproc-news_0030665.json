    "text": "(Recasts, adds closure details, background)\nFeb 13 (Reuters) - New Zealandâ€™s CBL Corp Ltd said on Tuesday it will exit its capital-intensive French construction insurance business as it shifts focus to more profitable core businesses.\nThis will help it deliver ongoing value to shareholders as well as a higher return on equity, Auckland-based CBL said in a statement.\nThe insurance company said exit options include the sale of the insurance book, along with divestment of distribution and operational networks of certain associates, including European Insurance Services Ltd and Securities and Financial Solutions Europe SA (SFS).\nCBL did not mention any specific charges from the closure.\nIt bought a 71 percent stake in SFS and IMS Expert Europe SA for NZ$150 million ($109.08 million) in January last year.\nThe company will announce its full-year results on Feb. 27.
