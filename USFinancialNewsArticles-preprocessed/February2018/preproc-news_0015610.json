(NASDAQ:UBNT) (“Ubiquiti\" or the \"Company”) today announced results for the second fiscal quarter of 2018, ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Summary\nRevenues of $250.8 million, increasing 17.5% year-over-year GAAP net loss of $51.5 million and GAAP loss per share of $0.66 Net loss due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in a $110.7 million tax expense Non-GAAP net income of $59.6 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.76\nSecond Quarter Financial and Product Highlights\nRevenues increased 17.5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially , primarily driven by demand for our UniFi AC and airMAX AC product families. Enterprise Technology revenues increased 33.7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially , reflecting the continued adoption of our UniFi AC technology platform. Initiated a new stock repurchase program , authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of its common stock, as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed on February 8, 2018. Entered into a new credit facility , providing for a $500 million term loan and $400 million revolving credit facility, as disclosed in the Form 8-K filed on January 23, 2018. Cash of over $823 million , up over 34% year-over-year and over 30% sequentially. Announced UNMS (Ubiquiti Network Management System) , proprietary software providing for the centralized control of Ubiquiti devices across multiple sites worldwide.\nFinancial Highlights ($, in millions, except per share data)\nIncome statement highlights F2Q18 F1Q18 F2Q17 Revenues 250.8 245.9 213.5 Service Provider Technology 119.9 119.9 115.6 Enterprise Technology 131.0 126.0 98.0 Gross profit 96.9 111.7 95.1 Gross Profit (%) 38.6% 45.4% 44.6% Total Operating Expenses 30.8 24.6 25.3 Income from Operations 66.1 87.1 69.8 GAAP Net (Loss)/Income\n(51.5) 74.9 60.6 GAAP EPS (diluted) (0.66) 0.92 0.72 Non-GAAP Net Income 59.6 74.9 60.1 Non-GAAP EPS (diluted) 0.76 0.92 0.72 Gross Margins\nDuring this quarter, GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, representing 38.6% of revenues. Gross margin includes $18.6 million of charges primarily related to provisions for obsolete inventory, vendor deposits and loss on purchase commitments associated primarily with the Company’s FrontRow consumer-oriented product launched in August 2017. Due to the lower than expected sales performance of FrontRow during the December 2017 holiday season, the Company was forced to assess the economic recovery of inventory and other related commitments. Excluding this $18.6 million charge, gross profit would have been $115.5 million, or 46.1%, representing a sequential improvement over the previous quarter.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nCash. Total cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 were $823.8 million, compared with $604.2 million as of June 30, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents, less debt (net cash) of $356.1 million increased $22.2 million sequentially. The sequential increase in net cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by operating earnings partially offset by the repurchase of common stock.\nBorrowing Availability. The Company fortified its balance sheet by securing additional liquidity through its amended and restated credit agreement, as filed on Form 8-K on January 23, 2018. The amended and restated credit agreement provides credit facilities of $900 million, consisting of a $500 million term loan which was entirely drawn at closing and a $400 million revolving credit facility.\nTax Reform. In addition to the increased liquidity provided by its credit facilities, the Company will have additional flexibility to repatriate foreign earnings as a result of the most recent federal tax reform.\nDSOs. Second quarter fiscal 2018 days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (\"DSO\") were 58 days, compared with 48 days in the prior quarter, and 50 days in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. DSO's in the current period increased versus the prior quarter and prior year quarter primarily due to the timing of sales within the current quarter, which were more heavily weighted toward the back of the quarter.\nInventory. Inventory at the end of the quarter decreased $23.4 million to $98.9 million. This amount includes $2.8 million of the $18.6 million charge associated primarily with the Company’s FrontRow consumer-oriented product, as discussed above. Consequently, inventory weeks on hand decreased on a sequential basis to 9 weeks in the current quarter versus 13 weeks the prior quarter. The Company expects to hold 8 to 12 weeks of previously introduced product inventory in warehouses going forward, in addition to new product inventory and selected raw materials.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on recent business trends, Ubiquiti currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following forecast for the Company's third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018:\nRevenues of between $245 million and $260 million; and Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.92 - $0.99.\nThe Company is currently optimistic that it will achieve the lower-end of the revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings-per-share guidance previously provided for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.\nA material number of non-qualified stock options issued under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan will expire on April 8, 2018 and we expect these options to be exercised during the fiscal third or fourth quarter of 2018. The impact of any exercise of such non-qualified stock options upon our financial results is not included in the foregoing business outlook for the fiscal third and fourth quarters of 2018.\nConference Call Information\nUbiquiti Networks will host a Q&A-only call to discuss the Company’s financial results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.

The Company incurred a net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 causing inclusion of any potentially dilutive securities to have an anti-dilutive effect, resulting in the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and dilutive earnings per share being equivalent during the quarter.

Included in the Company’s second quarter transition tax calculation is an approximate $2.1 million benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the reduced domestic rate to 28% on the first quarter 2018 earnings which were previously provided for at the 35% rate. As the year to date provision reflects the impact of the reduced 28% rate for the six-month results, this $2.1 million benefit was not removed from the non-GAAP results for the six-month period ending December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company’s non-GAAP Tax Reform Transition Tax adjustment for the six months will differ from the three months period by the $2.1 million benefit made during the second quarter fiscal 2018 related to first quarter 2018 earnings.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial results prepared under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of net income and earnings per diluted share that are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses and gains such as stock-based compensation expense, the adoption of ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payments Accounting, the tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments, and Tax Reform Transition Tax.\nReconciliations of the adjustments to GAAP results for the periods presented are provided above. In addition, an explanation of the ways in which management uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its business, the substance behind management's decision to use this non-GAAP financial information, material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial information, the manner in which management compensates for those limitations, and the substantive reasons management believes that this non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to investors is included under \"About our Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjustments\" above.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges which are excluded from these non-GAAP measures. For example, share-based compensation expense is impacted by the Company’s future price at which the Company’s stock will trade in those future periods. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. Certain exclusions, such as share-based compensation expenses, are generally incurred each quarter, but the amounts have historically and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nWe believe that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share provides important supplemental information regarding non-cash expenses, significant items that we believe are important to understanding our financial, and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met specified targets and thresholds. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes that the exclusion of the items described below, for which the amounts or timing may vary significantly depending upon the Company's activities and other factors, facilitates comparability of the Company's operating performance from period to period. We have chosen to provide this information to investors so they can analyze our operating results in the same way that management does and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our Company.\nUse and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures used by Ubiquiti Networks\nWe compute non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by adjusting GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per diluted share to remove the impact of certain adjustments and the tax effect of those adjustments. Items excluded from net income are:\nStock-based compensation expense Adoption of ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, applying the principles of ASC 740 Tax Reform Transition Tax\nUsefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Information to Investors\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and may be materially different from other non-GAAP measures, including similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, net income or earnings per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP adjustments, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income” included in this press release.\nUbiquiti Networks, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017 June 30, 2017 (1) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 823,776 $ 604,198 Accounts receivable, net 159,153 140,561 Inventories 98,893 142,048 Vendor Deposits 54,523 54,082 Prepaid income taxes — 2,419 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 11,295 9,026 Total current assets\n1,147,640 952,334 Property and equipment, net 15,657 12,916 Long-term deferred tax assets 2,880 5,133 Other long-term assets 2,151 2,328 Total assets $ 1,168,328 $ 972,711 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 11,947 $ 49,008 Income taxes payable 12,588 1,707 Debt - short-term 14,743 14,743 Other current liabilities 65,600 33,030 Total current liabilities 104,878 98,488 Long-term taxes payable 130,308 28,023 Debt - long-term 452,950 241,821 Other long-term liabilities 4,162 2,615 Total liabilities 692,298 370,947 Stockholders’ equity: Common stock 78 80 Additional paid–in capital 771 525 Retained earnings 475,181 601,159 Total stockholders’ equity 476,030 601,764 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 1,168,328 $ 972,711 (1) Derived from audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017.\nUbiquiti Networks, Inc.\nRevenues by Product Type (In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Service Provider Technology $ 119,852 $ 115,580 Enterprise Technology 130,959 97,956 Total revenues $ 250,811 $ 213,536 Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.\nRevenues by Geographical Area\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 North America $ 94,957 $ 94,609 South America 20,746 19,285 Europe, the Middle East and Africa\n102,026 77,381 Asia Pacific 33,082 22,261 Total revenues $ 250,811 $ 213,536 Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.
