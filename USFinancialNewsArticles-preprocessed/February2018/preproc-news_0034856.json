    "text": "COPENHAGEN, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The Danish central bank has completed $3.7 billion worth of hedging of payments in connection to Denmarkâ€™s planned purchase of 27 new fighter aircrafts, it said on Thursday.\n* Danish lawmakers agreed last year to buy 27 F-35 Lightning fighter jets from U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp with expected delivery in the years 2021 to 2026.\n* As most costs are in dollars it was decided to hedge the expected payments in dollars so that the price in Danish crowns would be fixed.
