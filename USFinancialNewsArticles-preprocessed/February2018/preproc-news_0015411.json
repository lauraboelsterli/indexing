    "text": "(Adds Quote: s, details)\nHARARE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Zimbabwe is negotiating a $1.5 billion guarantee with Afreximbank to ensure foreign investors’ funds are protected, central bank Governor John Mangudya said on Wednesday.\nUnder new President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who rose to power following a defacto military coup that forced Robert Mugabe to resign in November, the government is trying to assure foreign investors that their money is safe in Zimbabwe.\nMangudya added that Zimbabwe, where Mnangagwa is trying to woo foreign investors, was also arranging a $400 million facility to ensure payments for critical imports and allow investors to repatriate funds.\n“Such guarantees and liquidity support are necessary to protect investors’ funds from country risk, and in doing so, enhancing investor confidence,” Mangudya said in a monetary policy speech.\nMangudya also announced a raft of measures that he said would help the economy, including increased financial support to small-scale gold miners and tobacco farmers. The two commodities generate the highest export earnings for the country.\nThe central bank governor also said the bank would work to reduce government’s borrowing from the bank. The government has overdraft of $1.2 billion instead of $800 million permissible under the law, Mangudya said. (Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by James Macharia)\n ",
