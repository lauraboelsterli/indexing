(NYSE: ARNC) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.\nThe Company recorded fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10% year over year, driven by higher volumes across all segments and higher aluminum prices. Fourth quarter 2017 organic revenue was up 6% year over year. For full year 2017, revenue was $13.0 billion, up 5% year over year, driven by higher volumes across all segments and higher aluminum prices, partially offset by the impact of the planned ramp-down of the Company’s Tennessee Packaging operations and unfavorable product pricing and mix. Full year 2017 organic revenue was up 5% year over year.\nNet loss attributable to Arconic in the fourth quarter was $727 million, or $1.51 per share. These results include $879 million in special items, principally due to impairments of goodwill in the forgings and extrusions business and assets in the Latin America extrusions business, the impact of U.S. tax reform, and reduction of liabilities for a contingent earn-out and a separation-related guarantee. For the full year 2017, the Company reported 2017 net loss attributable to Arconic of $74 million, or $0.28 per share.\nExcluding special items, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted income was $152 million, or $0.31 per share, driven by net cost savings and higher volumes, which were partially offset by unfavorable product pricing and mix. Excluding the impact of special items, full year 2017 adjusted income was $618 million, or $1.22 per share.\nFourth quarter 2017 Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $436 million, up 54% year over year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was $446 million, up 24% year over year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin excluding special items was 13.6%, up 150 basis points year over year, including a 190 basis point negative impact of higher aluminum prices, last-in-first-out (LIFO) and metal lag.\nFull year 2017 Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion, up 17% year over year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was $1.9 billion, up 9% year over year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin excluding special items was 14.3%, up 60 basis points year over year, including a 110 basis point year-over-year negative impact of higher aluminum prices, LIFO and metal lag.\nArconic continued its progress on cost reduction; in the fourth quarter, the Company delivered net cost savings of $68 million or 2.1% of revenue, and for the full year 2017, net cost savings of $232 million or 1.8% of revenue. Arconic delivered an improvement of $111 million year over year in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) excluding special items.\nArconic Chief Executive Officer Chip Blankenship said, “In 2017, Arconic made progress on growing revenue and profits and taking out cost. However, a significant opportunity for improvement remains. Our challenge is to reinforce strengths, close gaps and identify new opportunities. My goal is to ensure that all of our businesses execute consistently and deliver outstanding returns for our shareholders.”\nBlankenship continued, “Arconic has foundational strengths and incredible potential. I am convinced that if we stay focused on four priorities – customers, people, operational excellence and technology – we will deliver on Arconic’s potential.”\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, cash from operations was $612 million; cash used for financing activities totaled $45 million; and cash used for investing activities was $236 million. Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $376 million. In 2017, Arconic redeemed $1.25 billion of debt, ending the year with debt of $6.8 billion and cash on hand of $2.15 billion. Cash from operations in 2017 was $701 million. Free Cash Flow for the year was $105 million.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Segment Performance\nEngineered Products and Solutions (EP&S)\nEP&S reported revenue of $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% year over year, and Adjusted EBITDA of $296 million, up $31 million year over year. Increased aerospace volume in both engines and airframes coupled with strong net cost savings more than offset unfavorable price and mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, up 110 basis points year over year.\nContinuing Arconic’s efforts to lower its cost profile, EP&S consolidated its organizational structure, collapsing four business units into three and reducing layers. These changes are expected to save approximately $15 million in 2018 and create a streamlined organization to accelerate progress and deliver for customers and shareholders.\nGlobal Rolled Products (GRP)\nGRP reported revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 15% year over year. Organic revenue was up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA was $124 million, up $8 million year over year, driven by strong automotive volume and net cost savings, partially offset by reduced aerospace wide-body build rates, airframe destocking, pricing pressure in regional specialties, and the planned Tennessee Packaging ramp down. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.0%, down 80 basis points year over year, driven by a 160 basis point negative impact of higher aluminum prices.\nTransportation and Construction Solutions (TCS)\nTCS delivered revenue of $518 million, an increase of 14% year over year. Organic revenue was up 8%. Adjusted EBITDA was $84 million, up $9 million year over year, as higher volume and cost reductions more than offset headwinds, including unfavorable price and mix and higher aluminum prices. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.2%, down 20 basis points year over year, including a 170 basis point negative impact of higher aluminum prices.\nFull Year 2017 Segment Performance\nSegment performance in 2017 included the following:\nEP&S revenue of $5.9 billion, up 4% year over year, Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, up 2% year over year, and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.6%, down 30 basis points year over year GRP revenue of $5.0 billion, up 3% year over year, organic revenue up 5% year over year, Adjusted EBITDA of $599 million, up 4% year over year, and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.0%, up 10 basis points year over year, including a 140 basis point negative impact of higher aluminum prices TCS revenue of $2.0 billion, up 10% year over year, organic revenue up 7% year over year, Adjusted EBITDA of $321 million, up 10% year over year, and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2%, up 10 basis points year over year, including a 120 basis point negative impact of higher aluminum prices\nShare Repurchase Program and Early Debt Reduction\nTo further enhance the Company’s financial position and return capital to shareholders, Arconic’s Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million of its outstanding common stock and a $500 million early debt reduction. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time, in amounts, at prices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate. Repurchases will be subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time, and the share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or terminated at any time without prior notice. The Company currently has approximately 483 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nIn addition, Arconic intends to redeem in March 2018 all of its outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019 in accordance with the terms of the notes and the Indenture, dated as of September 30, 1993, between Arconic and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as trustee. As of February 5, 2018, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes is $500 million.\nStrategy and Portfolio Review\nChip Blankenship, who officially joined the Company on January 15, has initiated a review of Arconic’s strategy and portfolio. The Company expects to complete this review by the end of the year.\nGlobal Headquarters Relocation\nAs part of the Company’s continued drive to reduce corporate overhead, Arconic announced that it will relocate its global headquarters in 2018 out of New York City to a more cost-effective location. The Company expects to complete the move by the end of 2018.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance*\nArconic is providing the following 2018 guidance:\nFull Year 2018 Revenue $13.4-$13.7 billion Adjusted Earnings Per Share $1.45-$1.55 Free Cash Flow ~$500 million\n* Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of the forward-looking financial measures of adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from the non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.\nArconic will hold its quarterly conference call at 10:00 AM Eastern Time on February 5, 2018 to present quarterly and full year results. The meeting will be webcast via www.arconic.com . Call information and related details are available at www.arconic.com under “Investors;” presentation materials will be available at approximately 8:00 AM Eastern Time on February 5.\nAbout Arconic\nArconic (NYSE: ARNC) creates breakthrough products that shape industries.

Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and management’s rationale for the use of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the schedules to this release and on our website at www.arconic.com under the “Investors” section.\n1 Organic revenue is U.S. GAAP revenue adjusted for Tennessee Packaging (due to its planned phase-down), divestitures, and changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency exchange rates relative to prior year period.\n2 Arconic’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to sales minus the following items: cost of goods sold; selling, general administrative and other expenses; research and development expenses; and provision for depreciation and amortization. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nArconic and subsidiaries Statement of Consolidated Operations (unaudited) (in millions, except per-share and share amounts) Quarter ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 (1)\nSales $ 3,271 $ 3,236 $ 2,967 Cost of goods sold (exclusive of expenses below) 2,656 2,626 2,375 Selling, general administrative, and other expenses 151 155 269 Research and development expenses 28 25 39 Provision for depreciation and amortization 141 140 133 Impairment of goodwill 719 - - Restructuring and other charges 47 19 122 Operating (loss) income (471 ) 271 29 Interest expense 98 100 128 Other income, net (2) (114 ) (1 ) (54 ) (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes (455 ) 172 (45 ) Provision for income taxes 272 53 1,246 (Loss) income from continuing operations after income taxes (727 ) 119 (1,291 ) Income from discontinued operations after income taxes (1) - - 38 Net (loss) income (727 ) 119 (1,253 ) Less: Net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1) - - 5 NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO ARCONIC $ (727 ) $ 119 $ (1,258 ) (LOSS) EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO\nARCONIC COMMON SHAREHOLDERS:\nBasic (4)(5) : Continuing operations $ (1.51 ) $ 0.23 $ (2.98 ) Discontinued operations - - 0.07 Net (loss) income $ (1.51 ) $ 0.23 $ (2.91 ) Average number of shares (3)(5) 481,339,090 441,512,709 438,486,935 Diluted (4)(5) : Continuing operations $ (1.51 ) $ 0.22 $ (2.98 ) Discontinued operations - - 0.07 Net (loss) income $ (1.51 ) $ 0.22 $ (2.91 ) Average number of shares (3)(5) 481,339,090 462,055,864 438,486,935 (1)\nOn November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the results of operations of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as discontinued operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. (2)\nOther income, net for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 included an adjustment of $81 to the contingent earn-out liability related to the 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson (Firth Rixson earn-out) and an adjustment of $25 to a separation-related guarantee liability.

As a result, the basic and diluted average number of shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 includes the 39 million common shares. (4)\nIn order to calculate both basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share, preferred stock dividends of $18 and $17 for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, need to be subtracted from Net (loss) income attributable to Arconic.\n(5)\nIn the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the diluted average number of shares does not include any share equivalents (21 million and 18 million, respectively) related to outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI International Metals, Inc (“RTI”)) as their effect was anti-dilutive. In the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the difference between the respective diluted average number of shares and the respective basic average number of shares relates to share equivalents (20 million) on outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI).\nArconic and subsidiaries Statement of Consolidated Operations (unaudited) (in millions, except per-share and share amounts) Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (1)\nSales $ 12,960 $ 12,394 Cost of goods sold (exclusive of expenses below) 10,357 9,811 Selling, general administrative, and other expenses 731 942 Research and development expenses 111 132 Provision for depreciation and amortization 551 535 Impairment of goodwill 719 - Restructuring and other charges 165 155 Operating income 326 819 Interest expense (2) 496 499 Other income, net (3) (640 ) (94 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 470 414 Provision for income taxes 544 1,476 Loss from continuing operations after income taxes (74 ) (1,062 ) Income from discontinued operations after income taxes (1)\n- 184 Net loss (74 ) (878 ) Less: Net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (1)\n- 63 NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ARCONIC $ (74 ) $ (941 ) LOSS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ARCONIC COMMON SHAREHOLDERS: Basic (5) : Continuing operations $ (0.28 ) $ (2.58 ) Discontinued operations - 0.27 Net loss $ (0.28 ) $ (2.31 ) Average number of shares (4)(6) 450,875,943 438,275,079 Diluted (5) : Continuing operations $ (0.28 ) $ (2.58 ) Discontinued operations - 0.27 Net loss $ (0.28 ) $ (2.31 ) Average number of shares (4)(6) 450,875,943 438,275,079 Common stock outstanding at the end of the period (4) 481,416,537 438,519,780\n(1)\nOn November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders.

(2) Interest expense for year ended December 31, 2017 included $76 related to the early redemption of the Company’s outstanding 6.500% Senior Notes due 2018 and 6.750% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, the “2018 Senior Notes”) and a portion of the Company’s outstanding 5.720% Senior Notes due 2019.

Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. The Combined segment adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The difference between certain segment totals and consolidated amounts is Corporate. (1)\nOn November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. completed its separation into two standalone, publicly-traded companies. Arconic includes the former Alcoa Inc. segments: Engineered Products and Solutions, Transportation and Construction Solutions, and Global Rolled Products, except for the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which became part of Alcoa Corporation. The Global Rolled Products segment information has been updated to exclude the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia. (2)\nCombined segment adjusted EBITDA is the summation of the respective Adjusted EBITDA of Arconic’s three reportable segments. (3)\nOther income, net included: •\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an adjustment of $56 to the Firth Rixson earn-out; •\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a $351 gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock; •\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2017, a $167 gain on the exchange of Arconic’s remaining investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock for a portion of the Company’s outstanding 2018 Senior Notes; and •\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an adjustment of $81 to the Firth Rixson earn-out and an adjustment of $25 to a separation-related guarantee liability. (4)\nInterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 includes $76 related to the early redemption of the Company’s outstanding 2018 Senior Notes and a portion of the Company’s outstanding 5.720% Senior Notes due 2019.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Arconic excluding the impacts of restructuring and other charges, discrete tax items, and other special items (collectively, “special items”). There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Net (loss) income attributable to Arconic determined under GAAP as well as Net income attributable to Arconic – as adjusted. (1) On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the results of operations of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as discontinued operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. (2) Discrete tax items for each period included the following: •\nfor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, a charge resulting from the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 that principally relates to the revaluation of US deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21% ($272), charge for a reserve against a foreign attribute resulting from the Company’s Delaware reincorporation ($23), partially offset by a benefit for the reversal of state valuation allowances ($69) and a number of small items ($6); •\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2017, a number of small items; •\nfor the quarter ended December 31, 2016, a charge for valuation allowances related to the November 1, 2016 separation (see Note 1 above) ($1,267), a net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets due to tax rate and tax law changes ($51), a net benefit for valuation allowances not associated with the separation ($29), and a net benefit for a number of small items ($9); •\nfor the year ended December 31, 2017, a charge resulting from the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 that principally relates to the revaluation of US deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21% ($272), charge for a reserve against a foreign attribute resulting from the Company’s Delaware reincorporation ($23), partially offset by a benefit for the reversal of state valuation allowances ($69) and a number of small items ($3); and •\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016, a charge for valuation allowances related to the November 1, 2016 separation (see Note 1 above) ($1,267), a net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets due to tax rate and tax law changes ($51), a net benefit for valuation allowances not associated with the separation ($18), and a net benefit for a number of small items ($10). (3) Other special items included the following: •\nfor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an impairment of goodwill related to the forgings and extrusions business ($719), a favorable adjustment to the Firth Rixson earn-out ($81), a favorable adjustment to a separation-related guarantee liability ($25), legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower ($7), costs associated with the Company’s Delaware reincorporation ($3), a favorable tax impact resulting from the difference between Arconic’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate and the statutory rate applicable to special items ($6), a favorable tax impact related to the interim period treatment of operational income in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax expense was recognized ($5); •\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2017, legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower ($7) and a favorable tax impact resulting from the difference between Arconic’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate and the statutory rate applicable to special items ($7); •\nfor the quarter ended December 31, 2016, costs associated with the separation of Alcoa Inc. ($87), a favorable adjustment to the Firth Rixson earn-out ($56), a favorable tax benefit related to the currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income ($38), an unfavorable tax impact related to the interim period treatment of operational losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized ($37), and a favorable tax impact resulting from the difference between Arconic’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate and the statutory rates applicable to special items ($26); •\nfor the year ended December 31, 2017, an impairment of goodwill related to the forgings and extrusions business ($719), a gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock ($351), and a gain on the exchange of the remaining portion of Arconic’s investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock ($167), a favorable adjustment to the Firth Rixson earn-out ($81), costs associated with the Company’s early redemption of $1,250 of outstanding senior notes ($76), proxy, advisory, and governance-related costs ($58), a favorable adjustment to a separation-related guarantee liability ($25), costs associated with the separation of Alcoa Inc. ($18), legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower ($14), and costs associated with the Company’s Delaware reincorporation ($3); and •\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016, costs associated with the separation of Alcoa Inc. ($205), unfavorable tax costs associated with the redemption of company-owned life insurance policies ($100), a favorable adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment both of which related to the 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson ($76), a favorable tax benefit related to the currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income ($49), and unfavorable tax costs associated with the sale of a US subsidiary with book goodwill ($16). (4) The tax impact on special items is based on the applicable statutory rates whereby the difference between such rates and Arconic’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate is itself a special item (see Note 3 above). The average number of shares applicable to diluted EPS for Net income attributable to Arconic - as adjusted, includes certain share equivalents as their effect was dilutive. Specifically: •\nfor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI) were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 502,109,950; •\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2017, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI) were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 462,055,864; •\nfor the quarter ended December 31, 2016, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI) were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 443,779,820; •\nfor the year ended December 31, 2017, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI) were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 471,472,729; and •\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI) were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 453,118,372.

Pursuant to this agreement, this amount is not reported in Arconic’s shipments but has been included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA / Total shipments for historical comparative purposes.\nArconic and subsidiaries Calculation of Financial Measures (unaudited), continued (dollars in millions) Organic Revenue Quarter ended Quarter ended Year ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nArconic\nSales – Arconic $ 3,271 $ 2,967 $ 3,236 $ 3,138 $ 12,960 $ 12,394 Less: Sales – Tennessee packaging 40 37 45 176 190 552 Sales – Fusina rolling mill - 37 - 39 54 165 Sales – Remmele Medical - - - - - 23 Aluminum price impact 124 n/a 115 n/a 407 n/a Foreign currency impact 40 n/a 17 n/a 30 n/a Arconic Organic revenue $ 3,067 $ 2,893 $ 3,059 $ 2,923 $ 12,279 $ 11,654 Global Rolled Products Segment (GRP) (1)\nSales – GRP $ 1,241 $ 1,079 $ 1,234 $ 1,285 $ 4,992 $ 4,864 Less: Sales – Tennessee packaging 40 37 45 176 190 552 Sales – Fusina rolling mill - 37 - 39 54 165 Aluminum price impact 113 n/a 102 n/a 372 n/a Foreign currency impact 10 n/a 5 n/a 21 n/a GRP Organic revenue $ 1,078 $ 1,005 $ 1,082 $ 1,070 $ 4,355 $ 4,147 Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS)\nSales – TCS $ 518 $ 456 $ 517 $ 450 $ 1,985 $ 1,802 Less: Aluminum price impact 11 n/a 13 n/a 35 n/a Foreign currency impact 15 n/a 8 n/a 15 n/a TCS Organic revenue $ 492 $ 456 $ 496 $ 450 $ 1,935 $ 1,802 Organic revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors as it presents revenue on a comparable basis for all periods presented due to the impact of the ramp-down and Toll Processing and Services Agreement with Alcoa Corporation at the North America packaging business at its Tennessee operations, the sale of the Fusina, Italy rolling mill, the sale of the Remmele Medical business, and the impact of changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency fluctuations relative to the prior year periods.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand Arconic’s asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.\n(1) On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders.

RONA is calculated as adjusted net income divided by working capital and net PP&E. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as RONA helps management and investors determine the percentage of net income the company is generating from its assets. This ratio tells how effectively and efficiently the company is using its assets to generate earnings. (1) See Reconciliation of Adjusted Income for a description of special items. (2) The Deferred purchase program relates to an arrangement to sell certain customer receivables to several financial institutions on a recurring basis. Arconic is adding back the receivable for the purposes of the Working capital calculation.\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180205005470/en/\nArconic Inc.\nInvestor Contact\nPatricia Figueroa, 212-836-2758\nPatricia.Figueroa@arconic.com\nor\nMedia Contact\nChrista Zipf, 212-836-2605\nChrista.Zipf@arconic.com\nSource: Arconic Inc.",
