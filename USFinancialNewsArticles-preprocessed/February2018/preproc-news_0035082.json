In the 70 years of competition, no man has successfully defended the title, which will continue for another four years as Mayer, a surprise winner in Sochi four years ago, was way off the pace on Thursday. Mayer, the 11th racer to start, produced a ragged run to post one minute, 41.46 seconds, more than a second behind early leader Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who posted 1:40.25 as the seventh man out. The downhill took place in clear, sunny conditions having been postponed from Sunday due to high winds. Reporting by Mitch Phillips, Editing by Greg Stutchbury",
