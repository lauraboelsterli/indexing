    "text": "BELFAST (Reuters) - Britain believes there is still a chance for Northern Ireland’s main parties to reach an agreement on restoring their devolved government, the minister responsible for the province said on Wednesday after talks concluded without an agreement.\n“While substantive progress has been made, it appears this phase of talks has reached a conclusion. I would urge everyone to reflect on the circumstances that have led to this and their positions, both now and in the future,” Karen Bradley told reporters.\n“The position of the UK government remains the same: devolved government is in the best interests of everyone in Northern Ireland and is best for the union. I believe the basis for an accommodation (between the parties) still exists.”\nReporting by Amanda Ferguson, writing by Padraic Halpin\n ",
