Some Anbang-related stocks rose because the state takeover would rule out the possibility of a fire sale of assets, traders said.\n** At 04:01 GMT, the Shanghai Composite index was up 3.09 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,271.65. ** China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.05 percent, with its financial sector sub-index higher by 0.49 percent, the consumer staples sector down 0.51 percent, the real estate index up 1.49 percent and healthcare sub-index up 0.01 percent. ** Chinese H-shares listed in Hong Kong rose 1.35 percent at 12,697.78, while the Hang Seng Index was up 0.84 percent at 31,226.61. ** The smaller Shenzhen index was down 0.21 percent and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was weaker by 0.84 percent. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was firmer by 0.87 percent while Japan’s Nikkei index was up 0.52 percent. ** The yuan was Quote: d at 6.34 per U.S. dollar, 0.26 percent firmer than the previous close of 6.3565. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Shanghai Prosolar Resources Development Co Ltd up 10.11 percent, followed by Datang Telecom Technology Co Ltd gaining 10.01 percent and KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc up by 9.98 percent. ** The largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Henan Ancai Hi-tech Co Ltd down 4.38 percent, followed by Wuhan DDMC Culture Co Ltd losing 3.74 percent and Hna Innovation Co Ltd down by 3.57 percent. ** So far this year, the Shanghai stock index is down 1.17 percent, while China’s H-share index is up 7.0 percent.

The volume traded was 13.87 billion as of the last full trading day. ** As of 04:02 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 26.89 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 15.01 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 1.9 percent. ** So far this week, the market capitalisation of the Shanghai stock index has risen by 2.22 percent to 28.98 trillion yuan. ** In Hong Kong, the sub-index of the Hang Seng index tracking energy shares rose 1.2 percent while the IT sector rose 0.9 percent.
