    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Winmark Corporation (Nasdaq: WINA) announced today net income for the year ended December 30, 2017 of $24,565,100 or $5.66 per share diluted compared to net income of $22,217,600 or $5.13 per share diluted in 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 net income was $7,656,500 or $1.86 per share diluted, compared to net income of $6,166,200 or $1.41 per share diluted, for the same period last year. Revenues for the year ended December 30, 2017 were $69,745,900, up from $66,580,300 in 2016. As a result of the recently enacted Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the Company recognized a one-time, non-cash, tax benefit of approximately $1.5 million or $0.36 per share in the fourth quarter related to the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in U.S. federal corporate income tax rates.\n“Throughout the year, we experienced steady growth in royalties as our franchisees continued to perform well,” noted Brett D. Heffes, Chief Executive Officer. “We have continued to invest in Winmark Franchise Partners since its launch earlier last year, and I am excited by the long-term opportunities for this business.”\nWinmark Corporation creates, supports and finances business. At December 30, 2017, there were 1,211 franchises in operation under the brands Plato's Closet®, Once Upon A Child®, Play It Again Sports®, Style Encore® and Music Go Round®. An additional 62 retail franchises have been awarded but are not open. In addition, at December 30, 2017, the Company had a lease portfolio of $41.3 million.\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), relating to future events or the future financial performance of the Company.
