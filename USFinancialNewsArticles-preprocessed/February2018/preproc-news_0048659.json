    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Superior Energy Services, Inc. (the “Company”) today announced net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $21.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, on revenue of $497.0 million. This compares to a net loss from continuing operations of $57.2 million, or $0.37 per share for the third quarter of 2017, on revenue of $506.0 million and a net loss from continuing operations of $166.3 million, or $1.10 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, on revenue of $354.4 million.\nThe Company recorded a provisional income tax benefit of $76.5 million during the fourth quarter due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $4.2 million in reduction in value of assets. The resulting adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $51.2 million, or $0.33 per share. This compares to an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $50.5 million, or $0.33 per share for the third quarter of 2017, and an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $111.6 million, or $0.74 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s net loss from continuing operations was $187.0 million, or $1.22 per share, on revenue of $1,874.1 million as compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $833.3 million, or $5.50 per share, on revenue of $1,450.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n“The U.S. land market experienced dramatic expansion in 2017,” said David Dunlap, President and CEO. “This expansion caused us to absorb costs associated with activating idle equipment and hiring field personnel throughout the year. During the fourth quarter, these costs began to abate and our profitability improved. Industry inefficiencies related to transportation of proppant and reliability of supplies have also impacted profitability throughout the year. These types of inefficiencies were to be expected as activity growth increased sharply as measured by the U.S. land rig count expanding by almost 140% between June of 2016 and the end of 2017. As activity growth moderates, these inefficiencies will diminish and we believe that our profitability will continue to improve.\n“We remain confident that dedicating high quality hydraulic fracturing assets to operators with the most efficient completion operations is the best model for our hydraulic fracturing business. This business realized improvement in profitability throughout the year, which increased sharply in the fourth quarter. During the course of the fourth quarter, we also observed an increase in the percentage of our customers who are now sourcing their own proppant, continuing a broader industry trend. Historically, many of our customers have sourced their own proppant and proppant sales have generally been associated with low margins. As a result, we sold less proppant during the quarter, which impacted our revenue, but this change in behavior did not impact our profitability to the same degree.\n“The value of our diversified business model was also apparent as several other product lines across U.S. land markets, led by coiled tubing and pressure control, experienced higher levels of demand and pricing during the quarter.\n“Revenue was lower in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily due to lower completion services activity. A large sand control project peaked during the third quarter and was substantially less active in the fourth quarter. Also, a Gulf of Mexico subsea well intervention project was suspended after a subcontracted control system failed. An alternative control system is being prepared and we expect to resume commercial operations during the second half of 2018.\n“Internationally, there has been a gradual increase in spending and activity levels in certain land markets, primarily in Latin America. We remain cautious about signaling a widespread international recovery as a number of market areas have yet to show signs of increasing activity, but we do see signs that a gradual upward trend, supported by higher oil prices, may continue.\n“Looking back at 2017, it is amazing how fast our industry has returned to work. There are just as many challenges to manage during a recovery as there are in a downturn, but we have assembled an impressive workforce with the skills and experience to meet them. Looking ahead to 2018, I am confident that an improved oil price environment and economic outlook can lead to better than expected results and improving margins as our operating efficiency continues to improve.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Geographic Breakdown\nU.S. land revenue was $331.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, unchanged as compared with revenue of $331.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a 65% increase compared to revenue of $200.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gulf of Mexico revenue was $76.4 million, a sequential decrease of 17% from third quarter 2017 revenue of $91.7 million, and a 7% increase from revenue of $71.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. International revenue of $89.6 million increased 8% as compared with $82.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 and increased 9% as compared to revenue of $82.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDrilling Products and Services Segment\nThe Drilling Products and Services segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.2 million, a 3% increase from third quarter 2017 revenue of $77.2 million and a 14% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $69.3 million.\nU.S. land revenue increased 4% sequentially to $35.1 million, Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 3% sequentially to $22.5 million and international revenue increased 7% sequentially to $21.6 million.\nOnshore Completion and Workover Services Segment\nThe Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $232.7 million, a 6% decrease from third quarter 2017 revenue of $248.4 million, and a 55% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $150.6 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company’s pressure pumping business sold less proppant than in the third quarter resulting from a greater number of its customers sourcing their own proppant. This change in customer behavior resulted in sequential revenue being approximately $18.9 million lower.\nProduction Services Segment\nThe Production Services segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $118.2 million, a 21% increase from third quarter 2017 revenue of $97.3 million and a 46% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $81.0 million.\nU.S. land revenue increased 37% sequentially to $55.0 million due to higher demand for most service lines, particularly coiled tubing and pressure control. Gulf of Mexico revenue increased 21% sequentially to $19.9 million due primarily to increased coiled tubing activity. International revenue increased 6% sequentially to $43.3 million due to higher levels of well intervention work in Latin America.\nTechnical Solutions Segment\nThe Technical Solutions segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $66.9 million, a 19% decrease from third quarter 2017 revenue of $83.1 million and a 25% increase from fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $53.5 million.\nU.S. land revenue decreased 10% sequentially to $8.2 million. Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 35% sequentially to $34.0 million as completion tools activity was lower after a large scale project peaked in the third quarter. International revenue increased 12% to $24.7 million.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday, February 20, 2018.
