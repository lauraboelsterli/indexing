    "text": "ABUJA, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Kaduna oil refinery has temporarily shut down because of a lack of crude, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said on Thursday.\nThe state oil firm is now making arrangements to supply crude so production can resume, an NNPC spokesman told Reuters by phone, without giving further details.\nKaduna, with a capacity of 110,000 barrels per day, is one of Nigeria’s three main oil refineries. They are frequently beset with issues that mean they can either not operate at all or cannot work at full capacity. (Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n ",
