(NYSE American: CQP):\nSummary of Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results (in millions, except LNG data)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\nDecember 31, 2017\n2016\n2017\n2016 Revenues $ 1,518 $ 551 $ 4,304 $ 1,100 Net income (loss) $ 374 $ 86 $ 490 $ (171 ) Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 612 $ 202 $ 1,512 $ 365 LNG exported: Number of cargoes 70 23 205 56 Volumes (TBtu) 252 81 734 195 LNG volumes loaded (TBtu) 252 82 735 196 2018 Full Year Distribution Guidance\n2018 Distribution per Unit $2.00 - $2.20\nRecent Achievements\nOperational\nSubstantial completion of Train 4 of the SPL Project (defined below) was achieved in October 2017, more than five months ahead of the guaranteed completion date. Over 200 cargoes were produced, loaded, and exported from the SPL Project in 2017. To date, approximately 300 cumulative LNG cargoes have been exported from the SPL Project, with deliveries to 25 countries and regions worldwide. Over 1,100 TBtu of natural gas feedstock has been nominated to the SPL Project since startup, with 99.9% scheduling efficiency.\nFinancial\nWe declared and paid distributions of $1.79 per unit to common unitholders for full year 2017, within the guidance range for the period. The date of first commercial delivery (“DFCD”) was reached under the 20-year LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Korea Gas Corporation related to Train 3 of the SPL Project in June 2017, and under the respective 20-year SPAs with Gas Natural Fenosa LNG GOM, Limited and BG Gulf Coast LNG, LLC relating to Train 2 of the SPL Project in August 2017. DFCD under the 20-year SPA with GAIL (India) Limited related to Train 4 of the SPL Project is expected to be reached in March 2018.\nLiquefaction Project Update\nSPL Project Liquefaction Train Trains 1-3 Train 4 Train 5 Train 6 Project Status Operational Operational Under Construction Permitted Expected Substantial Completion Complete Complete 1H 2019 — Expected DFCD Window Start\nComplete 1H 2018 2H 2019 — Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”) (NYSE American: CQP) reported net income of $374 million and $490 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to net income of $86 million and net loss of $171 million for the comparable periods in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA 1 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $612 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, compared to $202 million and $365 million for the comparable 2016 periods.\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 70 and 205 LNG cargoes, respectively, were exported from the SPL Project, of which 2 and 14, respectively, were commissioning cargoes.\nTotal revenues increased $967 million and $3.2 billion during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total operating costs and expenses increased $626 million and $2.3 billion during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nVariances in results of operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, were primarily driven by increased income from operations, due primarily to the timing of completion of Trains and the length of each Train’s operations within the periods being compared, partially offset by increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.\nSPL Project Update\nThrough Cheniere Partners, we are developing up to six natural gas liquefaction Trains at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities (the “SPL Project”). Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place.\nDistributions to Unitholders\nWe paid a cash distribution per common and subordinated unit of $0.50 to unitholders of record as of February 2, 2018 and the related general partner distribution on February 14, 2018.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nCheniere Energy, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year on Wednesday, February 21, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern time / 9 a.m. Central time.

Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place.
