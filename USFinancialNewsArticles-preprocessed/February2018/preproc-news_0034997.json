    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd reported on Tuesday a 62 percent rise in third-quarter net profit as growing passenger numbers and higher cargo revenue offset a decline in ticket prices and rising fuel costs.\nThe carrier, a benchmark for Asiaâ€™s premium airlines, made S$286 million ($216.29 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, up from S$177 million a year before.\nThe airline, like Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, has been undertaking a transformation programme designed to cut costs and to boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers. ($1 = 1.3223 Singapore dollars) (Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Stephen Coates and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n ",
