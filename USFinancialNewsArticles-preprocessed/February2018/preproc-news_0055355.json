    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday said Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) needed to make “one or more huge acquisitions” to increase its earnings, but admitted that finding a deal at “a sensible purchase price” had become a challenge.\n“Prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high,” Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders. “The ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity.”\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
