    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOverview for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016:\nRevenue increased 7.3% to $1.1 billion Comparable restaurant sales increased 0.9% for the quarter Restaurant level operating margin was 14.9%, an increase from 13.5% Net income was $43.8 million, an increase from $16.0 million Diluted earnings per share was $1.55, including a benefit of $0.21 per share resulting from changes in U.S. tax law, compared to $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2016 Opened 38 new restaurants\nOverview for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year:\nRevenue increased 14.7% to $4.5 billion Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.4% Restaurant level operating margin was 16.9%, an increase from 12.8% Net income was $176.3 million, an increase from net income of $22.9 million Diluted earnings per share was $6.17, including a benefit of $0.21 per share resulting from changes in U.S. tax law, compared to $0.77 in 2016 Opened 183 new restaurants and closed or relocated 25, including 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen Restaurants\n“During 2017, we have made considerable changes around leadership, operations, and long-term planning and it is clear that, while there is still work to be done, we are starting to see some success,” said Steve Ells, founder, chairman and chief executive officer. “2018 marks the 25th anniversary of Chipotle, and I am encouraged by the dedication all of our guests and employees have to this brand. Our focus this year will be to continue perfecting the dining experience, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering, and reinvesting in our restaurants. We are making good progress on our search for a new CEO who can improve execution, drive sales and enable Chipotle to realize our enormous potential.”\nFourth quarter 2017 results\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of 7.3% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue was driven by new restaurant openings and to a lesser extent by a 0.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurants sales include a 0.6% reduction related to deferred revenue that was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to our Chiptopia Summer Rewards program. Comparable restaurant sales increased as a result of an increase in the average check, including a 2.4% impact from menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, partially offset by a decrease in transactions. We opened 38 new restaurants during the quarter, and relocated or closed four restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,408.\nFood costs were 34.2% of revenue, a decrease of 110 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was driven by the benefit of the menu price increases, cost savings initiatives related to paper and packaging products, and relief in avocado prices during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRestaurant level operating margin was 14.9% in the quarter, an improvement from 13.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by decreased promotional activity and lower food, beverage and packaging costs as a percent of revenue.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were 5.2% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 110 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2016. In dollar terms, general and administrative expenses decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to decreased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and lower legal costs.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $43.8 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to net income of $16.0 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $6.0 million benefit ($0.21 per diluted share) for changes in U.S. tax law.\nFull year 2017 results\nRevenue for the full year 2017 was $4.5 billion, up 14.7% from the prior year. The increase in revenue was driven by new restaurant openings and a 6.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales for the full year included a 1.2% benefit from menu price increases during the second and fourth quarters and a 0.3% benefit from the accounting for deferred revenue during 2016 and 2017 related to Chiptopia Summer Rewards. Comparable restaurant sales improved primarily as a result of an increase in average check during 2017 compared to 2016.\nWe opened 183 new restaurants during the year and closed or relocated 25 (including the closure of 15 ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants), bringing the total restaurant count to 2,408.\nFood costs were 34.3% of revenue, a decrease of 70 basis points as compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by the benefit of the menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, combined with bringing the preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants after using pre-cut produce during portions of 2016, and cost savings initiatives related to paper and packaging products. These decreases were partially offset by higher avocado prices.\nRestaurant level operating margin was 16.9% for the full year 2017, an improvement from 12.8% in the prior year. The improvement was driven by sales leverage, including the benefit of menu price increases, decreased marketing and promotional spend and labor efficiencies, partially offset by higher wages paid to crew and managers. Marketing and promotional expenses were 3.5% of revenue during 2017, compared to 5.1% of revenue during 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were 6.6% of revenue for the full year of 2017, a decrease of 50 basis points over the prior year, primarily as a result of sales leverage. In dollar terms, general and administrative costs increased compared to the prior year primarily due to recording a liability of $30.0 million, which represents an estimate of potential claims and assessments by payment card networks related to the data security incident that was announced in April 2017. Additionally, increased bonus costs and higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense contributed to the increase. The increase was partially offset by lower legal costs, as well as decreased meeting costs because of the biennial All Managers Conference held in September 2016.\nOur 2017 effective tax rate was 36.1%, a decrease of 4.7% from 2016, due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a lower state tax rate. This decrease was partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pre-tax operating income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018. As a result, we recognized a $6.0 million benefit related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax position at the lower rate.\nNet income for the full year 2017 was $176.3 million, or $6.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $22.9 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the prior year.\nWith regard to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We’re pleased that the lower income tax rate from the tax law change will result in savings of approximately $40 to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than one-third of these tax savings in our people, including by making all of our restaurant managers and crew eligible for a one-time cash bonus, awarding one-time stock bonuses to a broad group of staff employees, and enhancing a number of other benefits such as parental leave and short term disability, all to help position Chipotle as the employer of choice in the restaurant industry. We’re excited to share further details about these programs in the coming days.”\nOutlook\nFor 2018, management is expecting the following:\nComparable restaurant sales increases in the low single digits 130 - 150 new restaurant openings An estimated effective tax rate for the full year of between 30.0% and 31.0%, which includes an underlying effective tax rate of about 27% to 28%, plus the effect of prior year employee equity plans which may either expire without vesting (resulting in no tax deduction), or vest at lower realized values (resulting in a lower tax deduction). While we expect future underlying effective tax rates in the 27% to 28% range, these rates will be further impacted by volatility due to accounting for taxes associated with previous and future stock-based compensation awards as well as a deferred tax asset related to market-based performance stock awards which may not vest.\nDefinitions\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:\nComparable restaurant sales, or sales comps, represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months.\nRestaurant level operating margin represents total revenue less restaurant operating costs, expressed as a percent of total revenue.\nConference Call\nChipotle will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 at 4:30 PM Eastern time.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-877-451-6152 or for international callers by dialing 1-201-389-0879. The call will be webcast live from the company's website on the investor relations page at ir.chipotle.com . An archived webcast will be available approximately one hour after the end of the call.\nAbout Chipotle\nSteve Ells, our founder, Chairman and CEO, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get exactly what they want. Chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, the land, and the people who produce them. Chipotle prepares its food using real, wholesome ingredients and without the use of added colors, flavors or other additives typically found in fast food. Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in Denver in 1993 and as of December 31, 2017, operated 2,408 restaurants.
