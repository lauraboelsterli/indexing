    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 6:37 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago Toyota posts 54 percent jump in third-quarter profit, lifts full-year forecast Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday reported a 54 percent jump in operating profit for the third quarter, boosted by strong performance at home in Japan along with a weaker yen, and raised its forecast for full-year profit. \nJapan’s biggest-selling automaker posted 673.6 billion yen (£4.4 billion) operating profit for October-December, from 438.59 billion yen a year earlier. The result exceeded a mean estimate of 527.22 billion yen taken from 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nToyota raised its forecast for operating profit in the year through March to 2.2 trillion yen, a 10 percent rise from last year, based on an unchanged assumption of the yen averaging around 111 yen versus the U.S. dollar.
