    "text": "Adjusted EPS of $0.87\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MEDNAX, Inc. (NYSE:MD), the national health solutions partner specializing in neonatology, anesthesiology, radiology, maternal-fetal medicine, other pediatric services, and management services, today reported earnings of $1.46 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017. These results include $0.75 per share of income tax benefit related to impacts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes this benefit, MEDNAX reported Adjusted EPS of $0.87.\nFor the 2017 fourth quarter, MEDNAX reported the following results:\nNet revenue of $911 million; Net income of $136 million; and EBITDA of $155 million.\n“Our operating results for the fourth quarter exceeded the high end of our expectations and reflect improvements in same-unit revenue growth and payor mix trends,” said Roger J. Medel, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of MEDNAX. “During the quarter, we progressed further on the corporate initiatives we developed earlier in 2017, with the goals of supporting our practices through specific action plans, enhancing our cost and service excellence across our organization, and continuing our strategic growth, including our fourth radiology practice acquisition for the year. As we look forward in 2018, we believe our continued execution on these plans will position us well to achieve our goal of delivering a differentiated value proposition to our partners, while remaining committed to the quality patient care that is the hallmark of our organization.”\nOperating Results\nMEDNAX’s net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by 9.6 percent, to $910.8 million, from $830.8 million for the prior-year period. MEDNAX’s revenue growth attributable to recent acquisitions was 5.7 percent, while overall same-unit revenue increased by 3.9 percent when compared to the prior year period.\nSame-unit revenue attributable to patient volume increased by 2.4 percent for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Volumes increased across all of the Company’s service lines. For the 2017 fourth quarter, same-unit neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patient days increased by 2.6 percent compared to the prior-year period.\nSame-unit revenue from net reimbursement-related factors increased by 1.5 percent for the 2017 fourth quarter as compared to the prior-year period. The net increase in revenue was primarily due to modest improvements in managed care contracting and an increase in the administrative fees received from our hospital partners.\nThe percentage of services reimbursed under government programs was favorable by roughly 50 basis points for the fourth quarter compared with the prior-year period, reflecting a favorable comparison for neonatology and other pediatric services, partially offset by a slightly unfavorable comparison for anesthesiology services.\nFor the 2017 fourth quarter, practice salaries and benefits expense was $617.5 million, compared to $533.0 million for the prior-year period. Practice salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 67.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 64.2 percent for the prior-year period. This increase in expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to growth in clinician compensation expense at existing practices as well as to support acquisition-related growth. In addition, professional liability expense increased as compared to the prior-year period.\nFor the 2017 fourth quarter, general and administrative expenses were $108.9 million, as compared to $97.0 million for the prior-year period. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 12.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 11.7 percent for the prior-year period.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) for the 2017 fourth quarter was $154.6 million, compared to $169.6 million for the prior-year period, or a decline of 8.9 percent. EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue was 17.0 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 20.4 percent in the prior-year period, with this decline primarily reflecting higher operating expense growth as compared to revenue growth.\nThe Company had historically included investment and other income and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates as a component of the “interest expense, net” adjustment within EBITDA. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company has excluded these items such that the interest expense adjustment represents interest expense only and has conformed its previous EBITDA calculations with the current period presentation. Historical reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as well as the reconciliation of forward-looking EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are available on the Company’s website at www.mednax.com/investors .\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $26.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $25.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $1.1 million that primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets from recent acquisitions.\nInterest expense was $19.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $16.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to higher outstanding borrowings and a slightly higher effective interest rate on borrowings between the two periods.\nMEDNAX generated net income of $136.1 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, or $1.46 per diluted share based on a weighted average 93.2 million shares outstanding. This compares with net income of $78.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, for the 2016 fourth quarter, based on a weighted average 93.3 million shares outstanding. Net income for the 2017 fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $70.0 million, or $0.75 per share, related to a revaluation of our deferred tax liability resulting from the reduction in the corporate tax rate enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”).\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, MEDNAX reported Adjusted EPS of $0.87, compared to $1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted net income attributable to MEDNAX, Inc. per common and common equivalent share excluding non-cash amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Adjusted EPS also excludes $0.75 per share related to the impacts of the TCJA.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, MEDNAX generated revenue of $3.46 billion, up 8.6 percent from $3.18 billion for the prior year. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $587.9 million, compared to $666.5 million for the prior year. MEDNAX earned net income of $320.4 million, or $3.45 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, based on a weighted average 93.0 million shares outstanding, which compares to net income of $324.9 million, or $3.49 per share, based on a weighted average 93.1 million shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, included $70.0 million, or $0.75 per share, related to the impacts of the TCJA. For the year ended December 31, 2017, MEDNAX reported Adjusted EPS of $3.34, compared to $3.99 for the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EPS excludes $0.75 per share related to the impacts of the TCJA.\nMEDNAX had cash and cash equivalents of $60.2 million at December 31, 2017, and net accounts receivable were $504.0 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, MEDNAX generated cash flow from operations of $195.6 million, which compares to $130.9 million during the 2016 fourth quarter.\nMEDNAX used $178.4 million during the 2017 fourth quarter to fund acquisitions and to make contingent purchase price payments for previously completed acquisitions. During the quarter, the Company acquired Synergy Radiology Associates, PA, a private radiology physician group based in Houston, Texas. This marked the fourth radiology services practice acquisition in 2017 and the tenth physician group practice to become part of MEDNAX in 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, MEDNAX had total net debt outstanding of $1.9 billion, consisting primarily of its borrowings under its revolving credit facility and senior notes. At December 31, 2017, the amount of additional borrowing capacity available under the Company’s revolving credit facility was $890 million.\n2018 First Quarter Outlook\nFor the 2018 first quarter, MEDNAX expects earnings per share will be in a range of $0.63 to $0.68 per diluted share and Adjusted EPS will be in a range of $0.84 to $0.89. The Adjusted EPS range excludes $0.13 per diluted share of estimated amortization expense and $0.08 per diluted share of estimated stock-based compensation expense.\nAdditionally, for the 2018 first quarter, MEDNAX expects that EBITDA growth will be between negative four percent and positive one percent, compared to the prior-year period EBITDA of $133.0 million.\nThis outlook assumes that total same-unit revenue growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018 will be in a range of two to four percent, compared to the prior-year period.\nThis outlook also assumes an effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 of 27.5 percent.\nMEDNAX’s results from operations in the 2018 first quarter, when compared on a sequential basis to the 2017 fourth quarter, will be affected by annual seasonality. These factors include a significant increase in expenses associated with the Social Security payroll taxes that are higher at the beginning of every year, as compared to the fourth quarter of each year, as well as impacts on net revenue during the first quarter, on a sequential basis, because there are fewer calendar days than in the fourth quarter. These recurring items reduce MEDNAX’s net income, EBITDA and earnings per share for the first quarter of each year, relative to other quarters throughout the year.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nA reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the financial tables of this press release.
