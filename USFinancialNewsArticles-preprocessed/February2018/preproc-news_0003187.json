Words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions, or circumstances) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. For example, the information in this press release relating to the Company’s statement that ZEJULA achieved 60% market share among PARP inhibitors utilized in patients with ovarian cancer for the month of December is a forward-looking statement reflecting the current belief and best estimate of management made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This statement and other forward-looking statements contained herein involve substantial risks and uncertainties including, among others, risks and uncertainties associated with the completion of the integrated audit of the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our estimate of the ZEJULA market share should not be used to extrapolate or estimate potential revenues from sales of ZEJULA for any period, as the determination of such revenues is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and estimates which are unknown. Accordingly, any estimates of revenues for such periods would be highly speculative and unreliable. TESARO undertakes no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements. For a further description of the risks and uncertainties relating to the business of the Company in general, see TESARO’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nAbout TESARO\nTESARO is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company devoted to providing transformative therapies to people bravely facing cancer.
