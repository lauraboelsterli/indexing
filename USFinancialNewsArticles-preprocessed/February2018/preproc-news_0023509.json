    "text": "Published: Feb 12, 2018 8:41 a.m. ET Share \nWells Fargo fumbles its efforts to repay impacted customers Reuters A Wells Fargo branch in Evanston, Illinois \nBy Emily Glazer \nWells Fargo & Co. is having trouble doing right by the customers it has wronged. \nThe big bank acknowledged that it recently sent out 38,000 erroneous communications to customers that it forced to buy unneeded auto insurance. \nIn some cases, according to two people briefed on the matter, Wells Fargo WFC, +1.32% has also sent refunds to people who weren’t the bank’s customers; notified those who were harmed of incorrect amounts to be paid; and told people of coming refunds though they had never gotten the insurance. \nIn another matter, Wells Fargo has yet to begin a broad-based reach out related to refunds for as many as 110,000 customers who were charged improper fees to extend interest-rate commitments they received from Wells Fargo on their mortgages, people familiar with the matter said.",
