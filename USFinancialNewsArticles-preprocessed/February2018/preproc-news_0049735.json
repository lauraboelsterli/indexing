(the “Company” or “PogoTec”) , an innovator in wearable devices, today announced that its Regulation A+ Initial Public Offering of up to $32 million has been qualified by the SEC. The Company has filed a NASDAQ Capital Market application in anticipation of a possible public listing of the stock at the conclusion of the offering. The application is subject to approval by the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.\nEffective immediately, retail investors can purchase equity in PogoTec at $11 per share and participate in the company’s mission to transform the way consumers capture and share images and videos from their surroundings.\nWR Hambrecht + Co is acting as the sole and exclusive underwriter for PogoTec’s Regulation A+ Initial Public Offering. PogoTec will also be using Fundable.com to crowdsource the offering at www.fundable.com/pogotec .\nIn November 2017, the company began selling PogoCam, the world’s smallest and lightest attachable eyewear camera that unobtrusively attaches to virtually all eyewear, so users can capture and share the world from their point of view.

PogoTec has licensed PogoTrack to three global frame manufacturers, including ClearVision Optical, FGX International and Argus Vision.\n“WR Hambrecht + Co is delighted to support the PogoTec team in its mission to create a new and innovative platform for wearable technology,” said John Hullar, Managing Partner, WR Hambrecht + Co. “With its capable management team, its strong manufacturing and distribution partners, and a broad patent portfolio, we expect PogoTec to be a leader in wearable technology beginning with its first product, PogoCam, and continuing with other innovations in augmented reality and wireless power.”\nAdditional information on the filing can be found at:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649430/000121390018001981/f253g10218_pogotecinc.htm\nhttps://wrhambrecht.com/ipos/pogotec-regulation-a-ipo/\nAbout PogoTec\nPogoTec™, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Roanoke, Virginia.
