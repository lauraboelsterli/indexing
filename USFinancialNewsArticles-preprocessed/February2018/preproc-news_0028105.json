    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 6:50 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Rugby-England hold on for narrow win over Wales Martyn Herman 1 Min Read \nLONDON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Two first-half tries by winger Jonny May were enough for holders England to beat a gutsy Wales side 12-6 in an intense Six Nations match at Twickenham on Saturday. \nOn a freezing wet day in west London, May took advantage of two moments of magic to race over as England claimed a 15th successive home victory in the competition to keep them top of the standings. \nEngland led 12-3 at the interval and although Wales threw everything at them in the second half, Eddie Jones’s side produced a resolute rearguard action and clung on to take the points. \nGareth Anscombe’s late penalty gave Wales a glimpse of victory but England held out.
