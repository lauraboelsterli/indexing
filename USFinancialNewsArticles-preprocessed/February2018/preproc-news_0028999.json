    "text": "DENVER and EL SEGUNDO, Calif. and ST. PAUL, Minn. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Granicus, the largest provider of cloud-based software solutions to government, today announced that it will acquire Vision Technology Solutions LLC, the premiere provider of website solutions for government organizations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWith the acquisition of Vision, Granicus is accelerating its mission to power seamless digital citizen experiences by bringing the first end-to-end digital government platform to market.\nThe combination of Vision's website solutions with Granicus' cloud-based communication and legislative management solutions will enable governments to serve their citizens simply and effectively with a single integrated provider. The combined company aims to address the digital customer experience gap that exists between the private and public sector.\n\"Customers have come to expect a fast, seamless experience when interacting with businesses across private industry,\" said Granicus CEO Mark Hynes. \"Unfortunately, despite the best of intentions, most government agencies have been unable to keep up with rising citizen demands for access and transparency.\"\nIn fact, surveys indicate satisfaction with government services has fallen to an eight-year low. Most government organizations are critically aware of this rising dissatisfaction trend, with 73 percent of state and local government leaders indicating in a recent Deloitte survey that their digital capabilities were behind the private sector.\n\"Our government clients are feeling considerable pressure to embrace digital technologies to share information, bring citizens closer to the legislative process and transition traditional services online. These pressures are coming both from the communities they serve, as well as the desire to deliver more impactful services with constrained budgets,\" said Hynes. \"By combining Vision with Granicus we are one step closer to providing government organizations with a comprehensive platform that delivers on the promises of a digital future - satisfying the rising digital experience expectations of citizens, while providing those services more cost efficiently.\"\nVision's flagship product, visionLive™, is a subscription-based content management system (CMS) and service plan that equips organizations with the technology, support, training and insights to keep websites relevant and effective. Together, Granicus and Vision serve nearly 3,500 organizations in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.\n\"Millions of Americans interact with government agencies every day – whether they are looking to weigh in on legislation or virtually participate in local council meetings, they are most likely starting this interaction online,\" said Vision CEO David Nachman. \"By bringing Granicus and Vision together, we will help our clients better serve and engage today's mobile and connected citizens in ways that are more impactful and more easily delivered.\"\nAbout Granicus\nGranicus provides technology that empowers government organizations to create better lives for the people they serve.
