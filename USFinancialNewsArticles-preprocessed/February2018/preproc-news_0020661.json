    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cactus, Inc. (NYSE: WHD) (“Cactus”) announced today the pricing of its upsized initial public offering of 23,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock (“common stock”) at $19.00 per share. The shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “WHD” on February 8, 2018. In addition, Cactus has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,450,000 shares of common stock from Cactus at the initial public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is expected to close on February 12, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nCactus expects to receive approximately $405.8 million of net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses (or approximately $467.4 million if the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of common stock is exercised in full). Cactus intends to contribute the net proceeds of this offering to its operating company subsidiary, Cactus Wellhead, LLC (“Cactus LLC”), in exchange for common units representing limited liability company interests in Cactus LLC (“CW Units”). Cactus will cause Cactus LLC to use (i) approximately $251.0 million to repay the borrowings outstanding under its term loan facility and (ii) approximately $154.8 million to redeem CW Units from certain of the owners of Cactus LLC. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, Cactus intends to contribute the net proceeds from any such exercise to Cactus LLC in exchange for additional CW Units, and to cause Cactus LLC to use any such amounts to redeem additional CW Units from certain of the owners of Cactus LLC.\nCitigroup and Credit Suisse are acting as joint book-running managers. Simmons & Company International, Energy Specialists of Piper Jaffray; J.P. Morgan; and BofA Merrill Lynch are also acting as joint book-running managers. Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.; Barclays; RBC Capital Markets; Raymond James; and Scotia Howard Weil are acting as co-managers.\nThe offering of these securities will be made only by means of a prospectus that meets the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933. A copy of the prospectus may be obtained from:\nCitigroup c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions 1155 Long Island Avenue Edgewood, NY 11717 Tel: 800-831-9146 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Attention: Prospectus Department One Madison Avenue New York, New York 10010 Telephone: (800) 221-1037 newyork.prospectus@credit-suisse.com\nAbout Cactus, Inc.\nCactus, Inc. designs, manufactures, sells and rents a range of highly-engineered wellheads and pressure control equipment.
