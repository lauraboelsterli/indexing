    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Cyprus said on Thursday drilling by a consortium of Italy’s ENI and France’s Total had discovered an extensive strain of natural gas in an offshore area south-west of the island.\n“An extensive column of clean natural gas was discovered in the geographical formations,” Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis told journalists in Nicosia.\nHe said further analysis of data compiled from the “Calypso” well was required to give an assessment of quantities, but said it confirmed that the geology was similar to that of the mammoth Zohr field offshore Egypt.\nReporting By Michele Kambas\n ",
