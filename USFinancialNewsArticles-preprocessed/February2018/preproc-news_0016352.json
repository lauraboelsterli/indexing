    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cato Corporation (NYSE: CATO) today reported sales for the five weeks ended February 3, 2018 of $54.2 million, a 19% increase from sales of $45.5 million for the four week period ended January 28, 2017. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 contains 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 and January 2018 contains five weeks versus four weeks in January 2017. On a comparable five-week basis, total sales decreased 7% and same-store sales for the month decreased 6%.\nSales for fiscal fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018 were $211.1 million, a decrease of 3% over sales of $218.2 million for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2017. On a comparable 14-week basis, total sales for the quarter decreased 8% and comparable store sales decreased 8% from last year. For the year, the Company's sales decreased 11% to $842.1 million from 2017 sales of $947.4 million. On a comparable 53-week basis, total sales for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 decreased 12% and comparable store sales decreased 12% from last year.\n\"The January same store sales decline is consistent with our recent trend,\" stated John Cato, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \"Based on further clarification from the FASB regarding the required adjustments due to the implementation of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\", we have updated our guidance for 2017. We now expect the fourth quarter earnings to be a loss of between $.55 and $.65 versus a loss of $.48 last year. This includes our revised estimate of a one-time tax expense of between $.40 and $.50 as a result of the implementation of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\". This non cash expense is comprised of two items. The first is the deemed repatriation charge due to our foreign operations. The second is the recalculation of deferred tax assets, which was understated in the December sales release but is now updated due to further clarification. The Company's estimate for full year earnings per diluted share is in the range of $.30 to $.40 versus $1.72 last year.\"\nThe Company will release fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings on Thursday, March 22, 2018.\nDuring January, the Company closed four stores. During the fourth quarter, the Company closed nineteen stores. For the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, the Company opened six stores, relocated three stores and closed twenty six stores. As of February 3, 2018, the Company operated 1,351 stores in 33 states, compared to 1,371 stores in 33 states as of January 28, 2017.\nThe Cato Corporation is a leading specialty retailer of value-priced fashion apparel and accessories operating three concepts, \"Cato\", \"Versona\" and \"It's Fashion\".
