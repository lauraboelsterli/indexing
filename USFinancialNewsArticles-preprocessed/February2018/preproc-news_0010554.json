    "text": "(Reuters) - A winter storm will dump snow and freezing rain on the U.S. Midwest and the Northeast beginning on Tuesday after it caused several deaths as it snarled highways and spurred the cancellation of hundreds of flights at Chicago’s main airport.\nThe National Weather Service warned commuters in northern Texas, east through southern Illinois and Indiana, and New York and Massachusetts, to watch for icy road conditions, wind gusts and reduced visibility throughout the day and into Wednesday.\n“The ice and snow will result in difficult travel conditions,” the NWS said in an advisory. “Motorists are strongly urged to slow down and allow plenty of time to reach their destinations.”\nWinds of 40-miles an hour(65 kph) and as much as 4 inches (10 cm) of snow are expected across the affected regions, with parts of New York and Vermont getting as much as a foot of snow, the NWS said.\nThe storm was responsible for the death of six people on Monday in crashes throughout Iowa, the Des Moines Register reported.\nTwo people also died in southwest Missouri and more than 70 others were injured after icy roads caused a high number of crashes, the Springfield News-Leader reported.\nAt Chicago’s busy O‘Hare International Airport, the storm caused the cancellation of more than 460 flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.\nReporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ",
