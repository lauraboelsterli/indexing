    "text": "LEXINGTON, KY, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardiff Lexington Corporation , formerly Cardiff International (OTCQB: CDIF) (OTC: CDIX) , a holding company focused on acquiring profitable, middle-market companies to create value for business owners and investors, today announced that it has changed the name of the company and has launched its new website ( www.cardifflexington.com ). The Company also announced that effective February 7, 2018, Cardiff Lexington will be Quote: d on the OTC Markets under its new ticker “CDIX.”\nAlex Cunningham, CEO of Cardiff Lexington, commented, “We are excited to announce our name change as well as our new ticker and website, which we believe better reflect the progress we have made and the expanded mission of the Company - creating value in the middle-market for business owners and investors. The market for small and middle-market private companies is often inefficient due to lack of access to growth capital and reasonable debt financing options. With many baby-boomer small business owners nearing retirement, there are also few options for succession planning and retirement. At Cardiff Lexington, we provide business owners access to capital, diversification and a long-term exit strategy. At the same time, we are well positioned to deliver value for our investors by acquiring private companies with strong cash flow and solid balance sheets. Our holding company structure provides investors diversification and mitigates risk.”\nForward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act.
