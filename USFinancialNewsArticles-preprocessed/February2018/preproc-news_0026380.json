Mestrallet retires in May.\nAn Engie spokesman confirmed that the company’s board will meet on Tuesday, but declined all comment on Mestrallet’s succession.\nOfficials at Solvay could not be immediately reached for comment.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq and Benjamin Mallet in Paris and Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
