    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Noble Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: NBLX) (“Noble Midstream” or the “Partnership”) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial and operational results.\nThe Partnership’s results are consolidated to include the non-controlling interests in the Partnership’s development companies (“DevCos”) retained by Noble Energy, Inc. (“Noble Energy”); however, certain results are shown as “attributable to the Partnership,” which excludes the non-controlling interests in the DevCos retained by Noble Energy. Noble Midstream believes the results “attributable to the Partnership” provide the best representation of the ongoing operations from which the Partnership’s unitholders will benefit.\nFourth Quarter and Recent Highlights Include:\nNet Income of $46 million, or $43 million attributable to the Partnership Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $42 million Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $52 million, or $48 million attributable to the Partnership, an increase over the prior quarter of 4% and year over year of 76% attributable to the Partnership Distribution per unit of $0.4883, a 4.7% increase from the third quarter 2017 distribution and 30% above the minimum quarterly cash distribution; this represents a 24% year-over-year increase Distributable Cash Flow (DCF) 1 attributable to the Partnership of $43 million, resulting in distribution coverage 1 of 2.2x Oil and gas gathering volumes of 122 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d), a 28% increase over third quarter 2017 volumes and up nearly 100% year over year Produced water gathering volumes of 49 thousand barrels of water per day (MBw/d), an 81% increase over third quarter 2017 volumes and up over four times year over year Advantage Pipeline, LLC (Advantage Pipeline) volumes of 60 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBbl/d), 67% above third quarter 2017 volumes. January 2018 nominations grew to approximately 90 MBbl/d Successful startup of two major projects in the fourth quarter - the Jesse James central gathering facility (CGF), the Partnership’s second CGF in the Delaware Basin, and a fresh water system in the DJ Basin for Noble Energy, through Green River DevCo\n“Noble Midstream ended 2017 by delivering another outstanding quarter, with strong growth in our core gathering systems driving an increase in key financial metrics. I am proud of the operational and strategic milestones achieved during our first full year as a publicly traded partnership. We completed our inaugural drop-down, successfully executed our growth projects on time and on budget, and enhanced our third party business and downstream exposure through transformational business development activity. Noble Midstream is committed to maintaining our financial strength, which, combined with our deep backlog of strong return opportunities, differentially positions the company in 2018 and beyond,” stated Terry R. Gerhart, Chief Executive Officer of the general partner of Noble Midstream.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNoble Midstream’s fourth quarter results were in-line or better than guidance in all categories.\nFourth quarter volume growth in the Partnership’s gathering systems was driven by (1) a full quarter's contribution of the oil and produced water gathering system for the Partnership’s third-party customer in the DJ Basin through Laramie River DevCo, (2) a full quarter's impact of the Billy Miner I oil, gas and produced water gathering system in the Delaware Basin through Blanco River DevCo, (3) the December 2017 startup of the second CGF in the Delaware Basin through Blanco River DevCo, and (4) strong well performance offsetting a decline in quarterly well connects for our customers in the Delaware and DJ Basin (75 equivalent wells, normalized to 4,500 lateral feet).\nThe Billy Miner I CGF, Jesse James CGF and Plains All American, L.P.’s Wolfbone Ranch Station connections to Advantage Pipeline are in-service.\nAverage fresh water delivered in the fourth quarter was above midpoint of guidance at 135 MBw/d; this represented a 23% decrease from the prior quarter, resulting from the previously announced reduced completion activity from our customers in the DJ Basin. The Partnership delivered fresh water to 36 Noble Energy equivalent wells in the fourth quarter, including 12 equivalent wells in Wells Ranch and 24 equivalent wells on federal leases in the East Pony area.\nFourth quarter revenue was $68 million, with gathering revenue representing approximately 69%, freshwater delivery accounting for 29% and oil treating and other revenue comprising the remaining 2%. Operating income was $45 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% from the prior quarter. Fourth quarter investment income of $2 million is primarily comprised of approximately $900 thousand from the Partnership’s minority ownership in White Cliffs Pipeline LLC and $1.1 million from the Partnership’s 50% ownership in the Advantage joint venture.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $136 million, or $62 million attributable the Partnership, primarily due to the following items:\nLaramie River DevCo - Completion of the Partnership’s third-party oil and produced water gathering system in the DJ Basin. The Partnership connected 18 equivalent wells in the fourth quarter Blanco River DevCo - Completion of the second CGF, Jesse James, as well as backbone gathering infrastructure on the Southern portion of Noble Energy’s Delaware Basin acreage. Capital also reflects significant procurement for the three CGFs scheduled to be online by mid-year 2018 Trinity River DevCo - Completion of the Billy Miner I and Jesse James CGFs connection to the Advantage Pipeline Colorado River DevCo - Well connections in Noble Energy’s Wells Ranch (25 equivalent wells) and East Pony (19 equivalent wells) development areas Green River DevCo - Construction on fresh water delivery infrastructure expansion in Noble Energy’s Mustang area and procurement and construction on the oil, gas and produced water gathering systems. The freshwater expansion commenced operations in December and the gathering system is expected to be operational mid-year 2018\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had $283 million of liquidity with $18 million in cash on hand and $265 million undrawn under its $350 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year-end and in connection with the closing of the acquisition of Saddle Butte Rockies Midstream, LLC, the Partnership partially exercised the accordion feature under its existing revolving credit facility. This increased the commitment under the revolving credit facility to $530 million from $350 million. As of January 31, 2018, $410 million was outstanding under the Partnership’s revolving credit facility.\nQuarterly Distribution\nOn January 25, 2018, the Board of Directors of Noble Midstream’s general partner, Noble Midstream GP LLC, declared a fourth quarter cash distribution of $0.4883 per unit, a 4.7% increase from the third quarter 2017 and a 24% year-over-year increase.\nThe fourth quarter distribution was paid on February 12, 2018, to unitholders of record as of February 5, 2018.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the full year 2017, all segments were in-line or above guidance ranges. The Partnership reported significant growth in operating and financial metrics versus 2016 due to an increase in equivalent well connects, strong well performance and multiple new project startups in the DJ Basin and Delaware Basin. Net income for the full year was $164 million, up 92%. Net income attributable to the Partnership grew from $28 million in 2016 to $141 million, or $4.10 per limited partner unit in 2017. Growth attributable to the Partnership reflects Noble Midstream’s previously announced acquisition of an additional interest in Colorado River DevCo and Blanco River DevCo which closed on June 26, 2017.\nCapital expenditures in 2017, excluding acquisition capital, totaled $390 million, or $225 million attributable to the Partnership.\nConference Call\nNoble Midstream will host a webcast and conference call today at 1:00 p.m. Central Time to discuss fourth quarter and full 2017 financial and operational results as well as 2018 guidance. The live audio webcast and related presentation material is accessible on the ‘Investors’ page of the Partnership’s website at www.nblmidstream.com . Conference call numbers for participation are 877-883-0383, or 412-902-6506 for international calls. The passcode number is 0571805. A replay of the conference call will be available at the same web location following the event.\nAbout Noble Midstream Partners\nNoble Midstream is a growth-oriented Delaware master limited partnership formed by Noble Energy, to own, operate, develop and acquire domestic midstream infrastructure assets.

Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release, the financial tables and other supplemental information include Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow, and Distribution Coverage Ratio, which are all non-GAAP measures that may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial results with investors and analysts. The following presents a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its nearest comparable GAAP measure.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and unit-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe define Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less estimated maintenance capital expenditures and cash interest expense. Distributable Cash Flow is used by management to evaluate our overall performance. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash on a quarterly basis, and Distributable Cash Flow is one of the factors used by the board of directors of our general partner to help determine the amount of cash that is available to our unitholders for a given period. We define Distribution Coverage Ratio as distributable cash flow divided by total distributions declared. The Distribution Coverage Ratio is used by management to illustrate our ability to make our distributions each quarter.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow, and Distribution Coverage Ratio provide information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to net income, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities, or any other GAAP measure of financial performance.\nSchedule 4 (Continued)\nNoble Midstream Partners LP\nReconciliations of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Net Income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\nand Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Reconciliation from Net Income (GAAP) Net Income (GAAP) $ 46,253 $ 35,191 Add: Depreciation and Amortization 4,470 2,414 Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized 642 266 Income Tax Provision (13 ) — Unit-Based Compensation 209 42 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 51,561 37,913 Less: Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 3,438 10,501 Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) 48,123 27,412 Less: Cash Interest Paid 1,498 175 Maintenance Capital Expenditures 3,836\n1,892 Distributable Cash Flow of Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) $ 42,789 $ 25,345 Distributions (Declared) $ 19,851 $ 13,782 Distribution Coverage Ratio (Declared) 2.2x 1.8x Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) to\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) and Distributable Cash Flow (Non-GAAP)\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Reconciliation from Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (GAAP) $ 41,868 $ 37,878 Add: Interest Expense, Net of Amount Capitalized 642 266 Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities 8,202 (137 ) Change in Income Tax Payable (13 ) — Stock Based Compensation and Other 862 (94 ) Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 51,561 $ 37,913 Less: Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 3,438 10,501 Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) 48,123 27,412 Less: Cash Interest Paid 1,498 175 Maintenance Capital Expenditures 3,836 1,892 Distributable Cash Flow of Noble Midstream Partners LP (Non-GAAP) $ 42,789 $ 25,345 Distributions (Declared) $ 19,851 $ 13,782 Distribution Coverage Ratio (Declared) 2.2x 1.8x 1 Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are not Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measures.
