    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General Jeff Sessions pushed back against criticism from President Donald Trump on Wednesday over his decision to have the Justice Department inspector general - and not prosecutors - investigate alleged surveillance abuse.\n“We have initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary,” Sessions said in a statement. He said the department “will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.”\nReporting by Sarah N.
