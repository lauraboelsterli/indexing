    "text": "SANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ENEL CHILE S.A. (NYSE: ENIC) today announced the launch of the preemptive rights offering in connection with the capital increase approved by the company's shareholders on December 20, 2017, as part of a proposed corporate reorganization of Enel Chile (the \"Reorganization\"). The Reorganization includes (i) a tender offer by Enel Chile for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Enel Generación Chile S.A. (\"Enel Generación\"), including in the form of American Depositary Shares (\"ADSs\"), that are not owned by Enel Chile and its affiliates (the \"Tender Offer\"), (ii) a capital increase by Enel Chile in connection with the Tender Offer and (iii) a merger of Enel Green Power Latin América S.A. (\"EGPL\") with and into Enel Chile. Pursuant to the capital increase related to the Tender Offer, the company is authorized to issue 10,000,000,000 new shares, which are subject to the preemptive rights offering and are to be offered for cash at a price of Ch$82 per share.\nEach share of Enel Chile common stock held of record on February 9, 2018 will entitle its holder to receive one transferable right to subscribe for 0.20370 shares of common stock. Five rights are required to subscribe for one new share at a subscription price of Ch$82 per new share. Enel Chile will accept subscriptions for whole shares only and will not issue fractional shares or cash in lieu of fractional shares. The 30-day exercise period for the rights begins on February 15, 2018 and will end on March 16, 2018.\nHolders of Enel Chile ADSs will not be distributed rights to subscribe for new shares of common stock or new ADSs or have any right to instruct Citibank, N.A., as depositary, to subscribe on their behalf. The rights with respect to shares of Enel Chile common stock represented by ADSs will be issued to the depositary. Holders of ADSs who want to exercise or sell the rights corresponding to the shares of common stock underlying such ADSs, must surrender their ADSs to the depositary prior to 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on March 7, 2018 and instruct the depositary to deliver both the underlying shares of common stock and the rights to a securities brokerage account in Chile specified by the holder.\nThe rights offering will not be effective if any of the following events occur: (i) Enel Chile has not published a notice of the results of the Tender Offer on or before December 31, 2018 or (ii) Enel Chile has published a notice of the results of the Tender Offer indicating that the Tender Offer expired or was not successful.\nThe shares of Enel Chile common stock to be offered in the rights offering have been registered in Chile with the Financial Market Commission (formerly known as the Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros), or the CMF. A registration statement on Form F-3 relating to these securities offered in the United States in the rights offering and a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in such registration statement have been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\nNo Offer or Solicitations\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and does not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.\nNo offering of securities in the United States with respect to the Tender Offer shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nImportant Information For Investors and Security Holders\nThe Tender Offer described herein has not yet commenced.

The information contained in the preliminary prospectus is not complete and may be changed. Each of Enel Chile and Enel Generación may file with the SEC other documents in connection with the proposed Tender Offer.\nThis communication is not a substitute for the definitive prospectus that Enel Chile will file with the SEC, which will contain important information, including detailed risk factors. The definitive prospectus (when available) and related tender offer materials (when available) will be sent to shareholders and holders of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Enel Generación. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF ENEL GENERACIÓN ARE URGED TO READ THE DEFINITIVE PROSPECTUS AND OTHER TENDER OFFER MATERIALS THAT ARE FILED OR MAY BE FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE FULL DETAILS OF THE TENDER OFFER.\nInvestors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the tender offer materials and other documents filed with the SEC by Enel Chile and Enel Generación on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .
