    "text": "PRAGUE, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Czech-based lottery and gaming operator Sazka Group has issued 200 million euros worth of 5-year senior notes with a coupon of 4.00 percent, it said on Monday.\nThe notes, issued through its subsidiary Sazka Group Financing and coming due in December 2022, will be listed on the Bratislava Stock Exchange.\nThe group, owned by Czech investors Karel Komarek’s KKCG group and Jiri Smejc’s EMMA Capital, has become one of Europe’s biggest betting operators after acquisitions in recent years. Last month, it boosted its stake in Casinos Austria.\nSazka hired investment banks last November for a potential initial public offering in London to help fund its growth.\nReporting by Jason Hovet\n ",
