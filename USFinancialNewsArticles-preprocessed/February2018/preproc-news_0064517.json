    "text": "Published: Feb 26, 2018 8:32 a.m. ET Share \nInvesting giant sends weekend email asking for information by Sunday evening Bloomberg News Jenny Strasburg Miriam Gottfried \nInvesting giant Blackstone Group LP asked outside fund managers over the weekend to detail their ownership in companies that make or sell guns, requesting the information by Sunday night, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe request, with a roughly one-day turnaround, was emailed to managers at about a dozen hedge funds in which Blackstone BX, -0.37% has a stake, one of the people said. \nThe email asked for information about “any ownership or lending” of or to “gun manufacturers or gun sellers,” according to people familiar with the request. \nIn the message, Blackstone executives apologized for the weekend intrusion, saying that Blackstone’s senior management wanted to know the information as soon as possible. \nBlackstone has taken steps over the years to eliminate its exposure to guns across its various lines of business.
