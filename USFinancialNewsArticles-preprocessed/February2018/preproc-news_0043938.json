    "text": "RIGA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Latvia’s central bank chief, who was held in custody over the weekend on suspicion that he solicited a bribe, said on Tuesday he was the victim of a smear campaign.\n“I have not demanded or received any bribes,” Governor Ilmars Rimsevics said at a news conference.\n“I have become the target of some Latvian commercial banks to destroy Latvia’s reputation.”\nNeither the police nor the anti-corruption authority have given details of the alleged request by Rimsevics - an ECB rate-setter - for a bribe.\nReporting by Gederts Gelzis; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
