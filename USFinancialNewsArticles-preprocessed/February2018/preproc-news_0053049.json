    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Arup, the design and consulting firm for the built environment, announces that Sergei Terzaghi has been appointed the Americas Geotechnical Leader, working out of the firm's Los Angeles office. Sergei will also serve as a Principal for the office.\nAndy Howard, Chairman of the Americas Region, said, \"Sergei is one of the world's foremost geotechnical engineers. We are delighted to add his industry leading talent to our team.\"\n\"I'm honored to join the Arup team here on the West Coast,\" Sergei said. \"Geotechnical engineering is a vital and growing discipline – especially in this region – and I'm looking forward to bringing my passion and expertise in this field to the Americas region.\"\nSergei has over 30 years' of experience in the geotechnical field. His work encompasses the full breadth of geotechnical engineering including desktop studies, investigation, analysis, design and construction input for highways, tunnels, railways, pipelines (onshore and offshore), embankments, dams, marine / offshore projects and foundations and excavations for a vast range of structures including tanks through to large multi-story buildings.\nPrior to coming to Los Angeles, Sergei spent over eight years in Arup's Sydney office as a Senior Associate and then as a Principal. There, he worked on a wide range of projects throughout Australia and Asia, including the Thomson Eastern Rail Line in Singapore; the Northern Connector Freeway in Adelaide; multiple sections of the Pacific Highway Upgrade in New South Wales, Australia; and Pump Station 15 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Geotechnical engineering is a family affair for Sergei; his grandfather, Karl von Terzaghi, is known as \"The Father of Soil Mechanics.\"\nBefore his time at Arup, Sergei served as Senior Associate at Sinclair Knight Merz, a Senior Engineer at URS Grenier Woodward-Clyde and Senior Geotechnical Engineer at Murray North. Sergei received a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.\nAbout Arup\nArup provides planning, engineering, design, and consulting services for the most prominent projects and sites in the built environment.
