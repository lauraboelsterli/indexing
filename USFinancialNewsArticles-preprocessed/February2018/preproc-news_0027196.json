    "text": "DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PositiveID Corporation (“PositiveID” or “Company”) (OTC:PSID), a life sciences company focused on detection and diagnostics, announced today that its Thermomedics subsidiary has delivered its first 500 Bluetooth®-enabled Caregiver® thermometers to a large global healthcare customer. Caregiver with Bluetooth was launched in January 2018.\nThe new, advanced version of Caregiver is the first FDA cleared non-contact, infrared thermometer intended for professional use that utilizes Bluetooth technology to connect wirelessly to patient monitoring stations and electronic health records systems to transmit temperature readings automatically into a patient’s record to increase efficiency and accuracy.\nCaregiver delivers an oral-equivalent temperature in one to two seconds directly from the forehead, without contact, for adults, children, and infants. Since there is no skin contact and Caregiver does not require probe cover supplies, it reduces the risk of cross-contamination, which is an increasing concern, and saves healthcare facilities the cost of covers (as much as $0.10 per temperature), storage space, and waste disposal costs. It is estimated that Caregiver can offer savings of $250 or more per year per device in probe cover supplies alone.\n“The use of wireless technology in hospitals is becoming universal, and we believe our new version of Caregiver with Bluetooth can help automate electronic health records keeping for improved accuracy and efficiency,” stated Gary O’Hara, Chief Technology Officer of Thermomedics. “We are optimistic that as healthcare professionals experience the benefits of this new version of Caregiver, more customers will follow suit and we will see an increase in our market share.”\nPositiveID believes its next generation Bluetooth-enabled Caregiver thermometer holds the potential to boost adoption of the Caregiver line to take advantage of the growing use of infrared thermometry, which is the fastest growing segment of the $1 billion global temperature monitoring device market according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc.\nCaregiver is marketed by Thermomedics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PositiveID.\nAbout PositiveID Corporation\nPositiveID Corporation is a life sciences tools and diagnostics company with an extensive patent portfolio. PositiveID develops biological detection and diagnostics systems, specializing in the development of microfluidic systems for the automated preparation of and performance of biological assays.
