    "text": "BRANFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sachem Capital Corp. (NYSE American:SACH) announced today that on February 6, 2018 its board of directors authorized and declared a dividend of $0.105 per share to be paid to shareholders of record on February 16, 2018. The dividend will be payable on February 27, 2018.\nAbout Sachem Capital Corp.\nSachem Capital Corp. specializes in originating, underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of first mortgage loans. It offers short term secured, non­banking loans to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, development, rehabilitation or improvement of properties located primarily in Connecticut. The company does not lend to owner occupants. The company’s primary underwriting criteria is a conservative loan to value ratio. The properties securing the company’s loans are generally classified as residential or commercial real estate and, typically, are held for resale or investment. Each loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on real estate and may also be secured with additional real estate collateral. Each loan is also personally guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower. The company also makes opportunistic real estate purchases apart from its lending activities. SCC believes that it qualifies as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes and intends to make the election to be taxed as a REIT when it files its 2017 federal income tax return.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.
