    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE: RYAM) today announced that the Company plans to add two new independent directors to its Board of Directors at the upcoming 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to be held on May 21, 2018.\nJulie A. Dill will be one of the three Class I directors nominated by the Company for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting, and, if elected, will join the Board of Directors in May, at the same time as the anticipated retirement of another director, Ronald Townsend, who has served on the Board of Directors of the Company since 2014. Matthew P. Hepler will join the Board of Directors at the same time as a Class III director with a term expiring in 2020. As such, the Board of Directors will increase in size from nine to ten.\nMs. Dill and Mr. Hepler collectively bring significant experience to the Company’s Board of Directors in international business management (including Canada, where the Company has extensive operations), the chemical and energy industries, financial management and investor relations, as well as the perspective of a current investor in the Company. Biographical information on each of the new directors will be included with the Company’s 2018 proxy statement.\n“We are pleased to welcome Julie and Matt to our Board at this exciting time in our history, given our recent transformational Tembec acquisition,” said Paul Boynton, Chairman, President and CEO of Rayonier Advanced Materials. “With the depth of knowledge and experience of our current Board members and the addition of Julie and Matt, we feel confident in our strategic direction and our ability to drive the growth of long term, sustainable stockholder value.”\nIn connection with the appointment of Mr. Hepler, who is a Partner with Marcato Capital Management L.P. (“Marcato”), a significant stockholder of the Company, the Company has entered into an agreement with Marcato governing Mr. Hepler’s membership on the Board of Directors. The agreement, which provides for customary standstill, voting and other commitments, will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission together with a Report on Form 8-K.\nAbout Rayonier Advanced Materials\nRayonier Advanced Materials is a global leader of cellulose-based technologies, including high purity cellulose specialties, a natural polymer commonly found in cell phones, computer screens, filters and pharmaceuticals.
