In Nigeria, another big market for the bottler, inflation was expected to stay around the mid-teens, he said.\nStill, the company expects higher volumes across its business, with Russia and Nigeria returning to volume growth.\nThe company’s shares were up 3.8 percent at 0844 GMT.\nIn 2017, sales grew 4.9 percent to 6.5 billion euros.\nExcluding currency fluctuations, sales rose 5.9 percent, above the company’s mid-term target for growth of 4 to 5 percent. Volume rose 2.2 percent.\nComparable earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 20 percent to 621 million euros, with comparable earnings per share up about 27 percent to 1.23 euros, ahead of analyst forecasts.\nBogdanovic, who took over as chief executive in December following the death of CEO Dimitris Lois, said there was a strong pipeline of product innovation and commercial activity lined up for 2018.\nHe declined to comment when asked about Coca-Cola’s plan to sell its African bottling assets, a process that started last year.\nReporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Edmund Blair\n ",
