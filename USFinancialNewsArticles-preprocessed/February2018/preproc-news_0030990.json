The material terms of the Merger Agreement and the Merger were disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on November 7, 2017.\nThis communication shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nInformation set forth in this press release, including statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the Merger, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the rules, regulations and releases of the Commission. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the Merger, including future financial and operating results, and the combined company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact, including statements containing such words as “will,” “could,” “plans,” “intends,” “expect,” “believe,” “view,” “opportunity,” “allow,” “continues,” “reflects,” “typically,” “anticipate,” “estimated,” or similar expressions, should also be considered forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue influence on these forward-looking statements, which are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of the Company and NJCB. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements.\nAmong the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; (2) the risk that NJCB’s shareholders may not adopt the Merger Agreement; (3) the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals or waivers may not be obtained or may be obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (4) delays in closing the Merger or other risks that any of the closing conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (5) material adverse changes in the Company’s or NJCB’s operations or earnings; (6) potential litigation in connection with the Merger; and (7) an increase or decrease in the common stock price of the Company during the 10 day pricing period prior to the closing of the Merger, which could cause an adjustment to the exchange ratio or give NJCB the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. There are important, additional factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements, including the factors described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Commission on March 16, 2017. Although management has taken certain steps to mitigate any negative effect of the aforementioned items, significant unfavorable changes could severely impact the assumptions used and could have an adverse effect on profitability.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company has filed with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-4, which includes a preliminary prospectus of the Company and a preliminary proxy statement of NJCB (the “Proxy Statement-Prospectus”). The registration statement on Form S-4 has not yet become effective and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus included therein is in preliminary form. The Company may file other documents with the Commission regarding the Merger. The Proxy Statement-Prospectus, in definitive form, will be mailed to the shareholders of NJCB.
