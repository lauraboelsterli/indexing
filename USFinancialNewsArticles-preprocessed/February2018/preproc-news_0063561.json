On Tuesday, the contract fell 87 cents to close at $66.63.\nTraders said oil prices declined on concerns a slowdown in global economic growth after China reported on Wednesday that factory growth in February slowed to the lowest since July 2016.\nChina is the world's second-biggest economy and the biggest importer of oil. Crude oil demand is highly correlated to economic growth.\nWhile the week-long Lunar New Year holiday this month disrupted business activity, traders also pointed to tougher pollution rules that curtailed factory output.\nIn the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, rising crude stockpiles weighed on oil prices.\nData from   showed on Tuesday that crude inventories   Feb. 23, to 421.2 million.\nRefinery   day (bpd), API data showed, implying a drop in demand for feedstock crude. Gasoline stocks rose by 1.9 million barrels.\nOfficial data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due out later on Wednesday.\nSoaring U.S. production has pressured oil futures at a time when members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia have reduced output to support prices.\n\"Climbing U.S. production continues to weigh on the market as traders fear that the OPEC output cuts will be nullified by the rising U.S. output,\" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.\nU.S. crude oil production has risen by a fifth since mid-2016 to more than 10 million bpd <C-OUT-T-EIA>.\nOn Tuesday, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said the United States will likely overtake Russia as the world's biggest oil producer by 2019.\nIt already overtook Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter, late last year.\n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick in TOKYO and Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)",
