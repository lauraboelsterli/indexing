Qualcomm shares fell more than 1.5 percent.\nLendingClub’s shares fell more than 4 percent after the online lender posted a wider quarterly loss.\nBy 9:36 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.33 percent to trade at 25,046.48. McDonald’s rose 1.5 percent and was the biggest driver of the blue-chip index.\nThe Nasdaq Composite rose 0.56 percent to 7,274.62 and the S&P 500 was up 0.41 percent at 2,727.5.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.8 percent gain in consumer discretionary shares. Amazon was up 1.3 percent and Netflix 1.7 percent.\nThe S&P technology index rose 0.5 percent. The top gainers were Apple, Alphabet and Facebook .\nHowever, the energy index fell 0.4 percent as oil prices eased due to a rebound in dollar.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields are still near four-year highs at 2.8859.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, eased at 19.21, below Friday’s close of 19.46.\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he still thinks just two interest rate hikes this year is “likely appropriate,” but signaled he is open to more if needed.\nHarker said he expected the U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent this year before slowing to 2 percent growth next year and to below 2 percent in 2020.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,778 to 748. On the Nasdaq, 1,685 issues rose and 656 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D‘Silva)\n ",
