International revenue of $207.3 million, up 52.9% year over year.\nOperating Highlights\nGoDaddy's GoCentral is seeing continued strong adoption, increasing conversion from free to paid, and generating positive customer feedback and rising net promoter scores. GoDaddy continues to enhance GoCentral's features, recently launching Online Appointment scheduling, payments via Square, blogging capabilities, and integration with Google My Business, among many other features. GoCentral users can now book client appointments online 24x7, sync with the most popular calendars, get paid easily offline or online, and create powerful online identities via Google. GoDaddy continued its successful integration of HEG, including the recent launch of localized marketing efforts in multiple European markets. GoDaddy announced it will acquire Main Street Hub for approximately $125 million in cash plus up to $50 million in potential future earnouts. Main Street Hub provides small businesses with a complete \"do-it-for-me\" service for managing engagement on the most popular social networks. The transaction is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2018. GoDaddy appointed Mark Garrett to its board of directors. Mr. Garrett, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Adobe, brings deep financial technology leadership to the board. GoDaddy announced it will host an Investor Day on March 28, 2018 at its Global Technology Center in Tempe, Arizona. Given limited space, interested shareholders and analysts are encouraged to email investors@godaddy.com for an invitation. GoDaddy completed a secondary offering of 7.2 million shares of its Class A common stock sold by certain of its stockholders at $47.32 per share in December 2017, increasing the publicly available float.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $595.0 million, total debt was $2,482.3 million and net debt was $1,887.3 million.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the first quarter ending March 31, 2018, GoDaddy expects total revenue in the range of $620 million to $625 million. For the full year ending December 31, 2018, GoDaddy expects total revenue in the range of $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion, representing approximately 16% growth at the midpoint versus the $2.2 billion in revenue generated in 2017. The full year revenue outlook includes approximately $65 million to $70 million from HEG in Q1, and contribution of roughly $10 million per quarter in the back half of the year from our recently announced planned acquisition of Main Street Hub. The implementation of the new revenue recognition accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on revenue.\nFor the full year 2018, GoDaddy expects unlevered free cash flow in a range of $605 million to $625 million, representing approximately 24% growth at the midpoint versus the $495.5 million in unlevered free cash generated in 2017. GoDaddy expects full year cash interest payments of approximately $90 million to $95 million and cash tax-related payments of $25 million to $30 million.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). GoDaddy does not provide reconciliations from non-GAAP guidance to GAAP, because projections of changes in individual balance sheet amounts are not possible without unreasonable effort, and presentation of such reconciliations would imply an inappropriate degree of precision. Our reported results provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents.\nQuarterly Conference Call and Webcast\nGoDaddy will host a conference call and webcast to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on February 22, 2018. To hear the call, dial (866) 393-4306 in the United States or (734) 385-2616 from international locations, with passcode 7396408. A live webcast of the call, together with a slide presentation including supplemental financial information and reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent, will be available through the Company's Investor Relations website at https://investors.godaddy.net . Following the call, a recorded replay of the webcast will be available on the website.\nGoDaddy Inc. uses its Investor Relations website at https://investors.godaddy.net as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor the Company's Investor Relations website, in addition to following press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, public conference calls and webcasts.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on estimates and information available to us at the time of this press release and are not guarantees of future performance. Statements in this release involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, our results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed , including, but not limited to: launches of new or adoption and expansion of existing products or services, any projections of product or service availability, technology developments and innovation, customer growth, addressable market size, market acceptance of products or other future events; any statements about historical results that may suggest future trends for our business; any statements regarding our plans, strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, including international expansion plans; any statements regarding integration of recent or planned acquisitions, any statements regarding our future financial results; statements concerning the potential acquisition of Main Street Hub, including the time frame in which this will occur and the expected benefits to GoDaddy from completing the acquisition; statements concerning GoDaddy's ability to continue to integrate its acquisition of HEG, and the projected impact of the acquisition on GoDaddy's business and results of operations; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.\nActual results could differ materially from our current expectations as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to: the unpredictable nature of our rapidly evolving market; fluctuations in our financial and operating results; our rate of growth; interruptions or delays in our service or our web hosting; breaches of our security measures; the impact of any previous or future acquisitions; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, our existing and future products and services; our ability to manage our growth; our ability to hire, retain and motivate employees; our ability to integrate and execute on our plans for HEG; the effects of competition; technological, regulatory and legal developments; intellectual property litigation; and developments in the economy, financial markets and credit markets.\nAdditional that could affect GoDaddy's financial results are included in the other filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the risks described under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the risk factors described the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed May 3, 2017, which are available on the Company's website at https://investors.godaddy.net and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Additional information will also be set forth in other filings that the Company makes with the SEC from time to time. Risks related to HEG also include retention of customers and employees and GoDaddy's ability to integrate HEG into GoDaddy. All in this press release are based on information available to GoDaddy as of the date hereof. GoDaddy does not assume any obligation to update the provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes Total Bookings and ARPU, as operating metrics, and financial measures defined as \"non-GAAP financial measures\" by the SEC, including Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Net Debt. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies in our industry, as those other companies may calculate their non-GAAP financial measures differently, particularly related to adjustments for acquisition accounting.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful as a supplement in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between each non-GAAP financial measure and its nearest GAAP equivalent is included in this release following the financial statements. We use both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage our operations.\nTotal bookings. Total bookings represents cash receipts from the sale of products to customers in a given period adjusted for products where we recognize revenue on a net basis and without giving effect to certain adjustments, primarily net refunds granted in the period. Total bookings provides valuable insight into the sales of our products and the performance of our business since we typically collect payment at the time of sale and recognize revenue ratably over the term of our customer contracts. We report total bookings without giving effect to refunds granted in the period because refunds often occur in periods different from the period of sale for reasons unrelated to the marketing efforts leading to the initial sale. Accordingly, by excluding net refunds, we believe total bookings reflects the effectiveness of our sales efforts in a given period.\nARPU. We calculate ARPU as total revenue during the preceding 12 month period divided by the average of the number of total customers at the beginning and end of the period. ARPU provides insight into our ability to sell additional products to customers, though the impact to date has been muted due to our continued growth in total customers.\nUnlevered Free Cash Flow. Unlevered free cash flow is a measure of our liquidity used by management to evaluate our business prior to the impact of our capital structure and after tax distributions required by Desert Newco's LLC agreement and purchases of property and equipment, such as data center and infrastructure investments, that can be used by us for strategic opportunities and strengthening our balance sheet. However, given our debt obligations, unlevered free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses.\nNet Debt. We define net debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt consists of the current portion of long-term debt plus long-term debt, unamortized original issue discount and unamortized debt issuance costs. We believe the presentation of net debt provides useful information to investors because our management reviews net debt as part of its management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage. Furthermore, certain analysts and debt rating agencies monitor our net debt as part of their assessments of our business.\nAbout GoDaddy\nGoDaddy powers the world's largest cloud platform dedicated to small, independent ventures.
