The Company expects first quarter GAAP revenue to be in the range of $276 million to $277 million.

EBITDA is GAAP net income excluding provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, and other (expense) income, net, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is GAAP net income excluding provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, and other (expense) income, net, the impact of fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired GoTo’s deferred revenue, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related costs, gain on divestiture of non-core assets, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation related expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by non-GAAP revenue, or GAAP revenue if not different. Non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired GoTo’s deferred revenue, acquisition related costs and amortization, gain on divestiture of non-core assets, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation related expense and includes amortization expense for GoTo’s internally capitalized software development costs that were adjusted in acquisition accounting to fair value. Non-GAAP provision for income taxes excludes the tax impact of the fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired GoTo’s deferred revenue, acquisition related costs and amortization, gain on divestiture of non-core assets, stock-based compensation expense, litigation related expense, discrete integration-related tax impacts, and the tax impact related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (net tax benefit of $86 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017), and includes the tax impact of amortization expense for GoTo’s internally capitalized software development costs that were adjusted in acquisition accounting to fair value. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share reflects the adjustments noted in non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP provision for income taxes above. Adjusted cash flow from operations excludes acquisition and litigation related payments.\nThe exclusion of certain expenses in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual or infrequent. We anticipate excluding these expenses in the future presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods and uses these measures in financial reports prepared for management and the Company's board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other software-as-a-service companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant elements that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management of the Company presents its non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its GAAP results. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business. Reconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in this release.\nAbout LogMeIn, Inc.\nLogMeIn, Inc.
