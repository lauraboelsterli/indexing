    "text": "725 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump, leading an emotional discussion with families touched by school gun violence, signaled support for a plan to arm teachers and coaches and also tighten background checks and mental-health screening before gun purchases.\nInviting students and parents to offer solutions to school shootings, Mr. Trump spoke approvingly of letting trained school staff carry concealed weapons that could be used against the shooter with a view toward minimizing casualties.\nAn armed, properly trained school faculty member can end a mass shooting before the nearly 10 minutes it takes for police to show up, Mr. Trump said. \nThree Decades of School Shootings Related Florida, A Big Death-Penalty State, Weighs What to Do About School Shooting Trump Takes Step to Ban ‘Bump Stocks’ FBI Probes Tip-Line Operations After Missed Florida-Shooting Warning Gun Rights Expand Amid Shootings “If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, it could very well end the attack very quickly,” Mr. Trump said.\nMr. Trump, seated solemnly beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, said of the school violence, “We’ll solve it together.” \n“You’ve gone through extraordinary pain and we don’t want others to go through the pain you’ve gone through. It wouldn’t be right.”\nMr. Trump made clear his belief that “gun-free zones” make schools less safe, increasing the chances that gun massacres go unanswered.\n“A gun-free zone is, ‘Let’s go in and let’s attack, because bullets aren’t coming back at us,’ ” he said.\nMr. Trump spent more than an hour listening to anguished stories of children killed in school shootings and pleas to break the gridlock surrounding the gun debate. \nAmong his guests in the State Dining Room were students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were fatally shot last week by a 19-year-old former student using a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 , as well as parents of children killed at Columbine High School in 1999 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. \nNikolas Cruz later admitted to being the gunman in the Florida attack, according to a complaint affidavit released last week.\nIn an emotional meeting at the White House on Wednesday, students, parents, and administrators affected by school shootings offered pleas for change to President Trump. Photo: Getty The discussion also coincided with student protests demanding action by lawmakers, and an organized lobbying effort by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas attack in the Florida legislature.\n“I’m pissed,” said Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter, Meadow, was killed at Stoneman Douglas. “I’m not going to see my daughter again. She’s not here. She’s at North Lauderdale in King David Cemetery. That’s where I go to see my kid now.”\nMr. Pollack said school safety needed to be the first priority, and then gun laws could be debated later. “How many schools, how many children have to get shot?” he said.\nThe president signaled his support for that priority and reiterated his recent calls for tightening the background check system for gun purchases, saying they need to be “very strong.” \nMr. Trump said a more complicated solution may be needed to identify people who are mentally ill and ensure they don’t threaten others. \n“Today if you catch somebody they don’t know what to do with them,” he said. “He hasn’t committed the crime, but he may very well. And there’s no mental institution, there’s no place to bring them.”\nSince 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims. Mr. Trump said nothing about banning assault-style weapons, a proposal that some of the visitors endorsed. White House aides have said the president doesn’t support banning specific classes of weapons.\n“I don’t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war,” said Samuel Zeif, a Stoneman Douglas student who said his best friend was killed in the shooting. He was overcome with emotion as he pointed out he was sitting next to Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan in the shooting at Sandy Hook.\n“After Columbine, after Sandy Hook?” Mr. Zeif said, fighting back tears. “It’s still happening.”\nMr. Trump sought to be a soothing presence at the meeting, allowing everyone to speak in a respectful setting.\nThough the president and his guests searched for common ground, policy differences were evident.\nParkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky, who said she has spent the week attending funerals of the students shot at the school, urged the president to rid the country of assault rifles and to push for so-called “red flag laws,” which would make it easier to keep guns from people who show signs of violence.\n“We have to at some point be strong enough and care enough to come up with solutions,” she said.\nMark Barden, whose son was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, said he opposed more guns at school. He said that a murderer who planned to commit suicide after a school shooting wouldn’t be deterred by an armed teacher.\n“No one wants to see a shootout at a school,” he said.\nMs. Hockley urged the president to focus on protocols that would help teachers identify problems, instead of letting them carry guns.\n“Rather than arm with a firearm, I would rather arm them with the knowledge of how to prevent this in the first place,” Ms. Hockley said. “This is about prevention.”\nTeacher unions are speaking out against arming educators in schools. \nThe National Education Association, which has about 3 million members, said Wednesday that educators should not be armed school staff and need to be focused on teaching students.\n“We need solutions that will keep guns out of the hands of those who want to use them to massacre innocent children and educators. Arming teachers does nothing to prevent that,” NEA President Lily Eskelsen García said in a statement.\nAt a CNN town-hall event Wednesday in Sunrise, Fla., Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said he was opposed to the idea of arming school teachers.\nMr. Rubio spoke in response to a question from a teacher at Stoneman Douglas high school who objected to the notion of strapping a gun to her leg and donning a bullet-proof vest.\nMr. Rubio said the idea has “practical problems.” If a SWAT team entered the school, officers could mistake the armed teacher for the shooter, causing “an additional tragedy,” Mr. Rubio said.\n—Tawnell D.
