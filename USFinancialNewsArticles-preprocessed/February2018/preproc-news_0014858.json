    "text": "SHANGHAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong and China stocks opened sharply lower on Monday, as Asian markets stumbled after inflation fears rocked bond markets and knocked Wall Street off record highs amid mounting speculation that global central banks would aggressively tighten policy.\nHong Kongâ€™s benchmark Hang Seng Index opened 2.7 percent lower, while the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which tracks Chinese companies listed in the city, was down 3 percent at open.\nBoth indexes recovered some losses in early trade.\nChina stocks continued their slide after posting their biggest weekly loss in over a year.\nThe CSI300 index opened down 1.6 percent, and the Shanghai Composite Index both opened 1.6 percent lower.\nBoth gauges recouped some losses. At 1:51 GMT, CSI300 was down 0.7 percent at 4,241.33 points, with the Shanghai Composite Index 0.4 percent lower at 3,447.88 points.
