For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $174.6 million, or $1.93 per diluted common share, compared to $83.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP operating income 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $74.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared to non-GAAP operating income 1 of $56.0 million, or $0.63 per diluted common share, for fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-GAAP operating income 1 was $285.1 million, or $3.16 per diluted common share, compared to $122.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Non-GAAP operating 1 return on average equity excluding average AOCI 1 for the year was 14.0% based upon reported results and 12.9% excluding both the impact of assumption revisions and losses on extinguishment of debt.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") was enacted on December 22, 2017, reducing the statutory federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The impact of Tax Reform was a reduction of net income for the quarter of $35.9 million, or $0.40 per share, due to the rate change on net deferred tax assets at the time of enactment. The impact of Tax Reform has been excluded from non-GAAP operating income 1 .\nPOLICYHOLDER FUNDS UNDER MANAGEMENT UP 1.6% ON $1.0 BILLION OF SALES\nPolicyholder funds under management at December 31, 2017 were $48.4 billion, a $773 million or 1.6% increase from September 30, 2017. Fourth quarter sales were $1.0 billion before coinsurance ceded and $883 million after coinsurance ceded. Gross sales and net sales for the quarter were down 27.4% and 21.6%, respectively, from fourth quarter 2016 sales. However, on a sequential basis, gross and net sales increased 10.3% and 5.9%, respectively.\nTotal sales by independent agents for American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company increased 2.2% sequentially while total sales by broker-dealers and banks for Eagle Life Insurance Company rose by $77 million or 53.1% sequentially. Sales of fixed index annuities (FIAs) were up 8.4% sequentially to $945 million with the majority of the increase attributable to sales at Eagle Life.\nCommenting on sales, John Matovina, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: \"The sequential increase in FIA sales is only the second sequential increase we've had in the last eight quarters. Our sequential sales pattern has largely tracked the industry on a directional basis with industry sales facing headwinds from the DOL fiduciary rule, the strong equity market and low interest rates. In addition, we have dealt with increased competition including a focus by certain distributors on products featuring complex \"hybrid\" market indices. We have avoided these hybrid indices as we believe they lack the transparency that has been the hallmark of our safe money insurance products.\"\nCommenting on the market environment and the outlook for FIA sales, Matovina added: \"The market in each of our distribution channels remains competitive. The downward rate adjustments several competitors made in September and October have largely reversed, and we have seen additional increases in 2018. However, changes we made to our products in September and October, gave us sales momentum, and we continue to be in a strong competitive position for guaranteed income, caps and participation rates. In March, we plan to augment that position by introducing a new fixed index annuity product that focuses on guaranteed lifetime income. We will have a bonus and non-bonus version of the new product. Each version will have two fee based options for lifetime income, allowing the policyholder to decide, at time of purchase, whether to activate lifetime income after a shorter or longer deferral period, and a no fee option which will have lower lifetime income than the fee based options. This product incorporates significant input from our distribution partners, and we expect it to be well received in the market as income levels are anticipated to be competitive. We also intend to continue to emphasize our Choice and Select series of products for accumulation. Despite the current challenges facing the FIA market, we believe the long-term outlook for FIA sales remains favorable driven by well understood demographic factors, and we are well positioned to fully participate in that growth.\"\nINVESTMENT SPREAD WIDENS ON NON-TRENDABLE ITEMS\nAmerican Equity’s investment spread was 2.75% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2.70% for the third quarter of 2017 and 2.62% for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a sequential basis, the average yield on invested assets increased by four basis points while the cost of money fell by one basis point.\nAverage yield on invested assets rose to 4.47% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 4.43% for the third quarter of 2017 reflecting an increase in the benefit from fee income from bond transactions, prepayment income and other non-trendable investment income items to twelve basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 from five basis points in the third quarter of 2017. The average yield on fixed income securities purchased and commercial mortgage loans funded in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.27% compared to 4.39% in the third quarter of 2017, and 4.03% for the first six months of 2017.\nThe aggregate cost of money for annuity liabilities of 1.72% in the fourth quarter of 2017 was down one basis point from 1.73% in the third quarter of 2017. The benefit from over hedging the obligations for index linked interest was eight basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to six basis points in the third quarter of 2017.\nCommenting on investment spread, Matovina said: “Fourth quarter spread results were enhanced by non-trendable items totaling twenty basis points compared to eleven basis points in the third quarter of 2017. Our investment spread remains under pressure due to the investment of portfolio cash flows in instruments with yields below our portfolio rate. We should benefit from the recent uptick in benchmark 10-year Treasury rates, and we continue to seek opportunities to increase the yield on our investment portfolio while meeting our high credit quality parameters. Alternatively, we have flexibility to reduce our crediting rates and could decrease our cost of money by approximately 0.49% through further reductions in renewal rates to guaranteed minimums should acceptable investment yields not materialize.\"\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Non-GAAP operating income equals net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of items that fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a manner unrelated to core operations, and the Company believes measures excluding their impact are useful in analyzing operating trends. The most significant adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP operating income eliminate the impact of fair value accounting for the Company's fixed index annuity business and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"). The adjustment related to fair value accounting for the Company's fixed index annuity business is not economic in nature but rather impacts the timing of reported results. The Company believes the combined presentation and evaluation of non-GAAP operating income together with net income provides information that may enhance an investor’s understanding of its underlying results and profitability.\nReconciliation from Net Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income (b) $ 36,803 $ 120,796 $ 174,645 $ 83,243 Adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP operating income: (a) Net realized investment (gains) losses, including OTTI (676 ) 6,436 (5,093 ) 7,188 Change in fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives - fixed index annuities 5,463 (103,444 ) 121,846 56,634 Change in fair value of derivatives - debt (1,085 ) (3,748 ) (1,224 ) (1,265 ) Litigation reserve — — — (1,957 ) Income taxes (b) 34,003 35,927 (5,124 ) (21,499 ) Non-GAAP operating income $ 74,508 $ 55,967 $ 285,050 $ 122,344 Per common share - assuming dilution: Net income $ 0.41 $ 1.35 $ 1.93 $ 0.97 Adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP operating income: Net realized investment (gains) losses, including OTTI (0.01 ) 0.07 (0.05 ) 0.08 Change in fair value of derivatives and embedded derivatives - fixed index annuities 0.06 (1.16 ) 1.35 0.66 Change in fair value of derivatives - debt (0.01 ) (0.04 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Litigation reserve — — — (0.02 ) Income taxes 0.37 0.41 (0.06 ) (0.25 ) Non-GAAP operating income $ 0.82 $ 0.63 $ 3.16 $ 1.43 (a) Adjustments to net income to arrive at non-GAAP operating income are presented net of related adjustments to amortization of deferred sales inducements (DSI) and deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) where applicable.\n(b) Net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 includes income tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new enacted federal tax rate resulting from Tax Reform. The change in the federal income tax rate decreased net income and earnings per common share-assuming dilution by $35.9 million and $0.40 per share, respectively. The impact of Tax Reform has been excluded from non-GAAP operating income.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAverage Stockholders' Equity and Return on Average Equity (Unaudited)\nReturn on average equity measures how efficiently the Company generates profits from the resources provided by its net assets. Return on average equity is calculated by dividing net income and non-GAAP operating income for the trailing twelve months by average equity excluding average accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"). The Company excludes AOCI because AOCI fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to unrealized changes in the fair value of available for sale investments.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Average Stockholders' Equity Average equity including average AOCI 2,570,876 Average AOCI (532,283 ) Average equity excluding average AOCI $ 2,038,593 Net income $ 174,645 Non-GAAP operating income 285,050 Return on Average Equity Excluding Average AOCI Net income 8.57 % Non-GAAP operating income 13.98 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006181/en/\nAmerican Equity Investment Life Holding Company\nSteven D.
