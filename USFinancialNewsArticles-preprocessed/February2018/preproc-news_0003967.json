    "text": " 36 PM / in 32 minutes Cigna's corporate customer medical costs grew less than 3 percent Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nNEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Cigna Corp, which manages healthcare benefits for some of the largest U.S. corporations, said on Thursday that medical costs among its customers grew less than 3 percent in 2017, below its expectations. \nChief Executive Officer David Cordani, speaking with analysts after reporting fourth-quarter earnings, said even that growth rate was unsustainable. Medical costs typically rise faster than inflation, and most insurers typically report annual increases of 6 percent, plus or minus 100 basis points. \nCordani was responding to analyst questions about a new healthcare venture announced by JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon.com Inc Corp, saying they needed to address too-high healthcare costs that were hurting business.
