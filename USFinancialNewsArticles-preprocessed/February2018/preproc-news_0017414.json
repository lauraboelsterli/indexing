Excluding one-time items, Kellogg earned 96 cents per share, meeting analysts’ estimates. \nSales from Kellogg’s North America unit that comprises frozen foods, nutritious foods unit Kashi, and RXBAR, rose more than 9 percent to $412 million. \nSales at Kellogg’s U.S. morning foods and snacks businesses both declined. \nKellogg’s key cereals business has suffered for several years as people seek foods with lower sugar. \nFor 2018, Kellogg expects net sales to remain unchanged year-over-year. Adjusted earnings are forecast to increase 9 percent to 11 percent, with the recent U.S. tax reform contributing 5 to 6 percentage points of growth.
