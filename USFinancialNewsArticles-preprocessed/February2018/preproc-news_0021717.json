(NASDAQ: FEYE), the intelligence-led security company, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We achieved strong results across all key financial metrics in the fourth quarter and delivered against our year-long commitment of billings and revenue growth, non-GAAP operating profitability, and positive operating and free cash flow by the fourth quarter,” said Kevin Mandia, FireEye chief executive officer. “We delivered year-over-year and sequential growth in every major product group and geographic region, and we closed a record number of transactions greater than $1 million.\"\n“We are building FireEye for the long-term, and we begin 2018 with a solid foundation for future growth and increased profitability,\" added Mandia. “The combination of our expertise on the front lines, our threat intelligence, and our machine-generated cyber attack data gives us greater visibility into the threat environment than any other security company. I believe this is a sustainable competitive advantage for us. We leverage our unique insights in our continuous innovation cycle that allows us to rapidly adapt our solutions, deliver expertise on demand, and remain relevant for our customers as the threat landscape evolves.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue of $202.3 million, an increase of 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016, and above the guidance range of $190 million to $196 million.

Cash flow generated by operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was reduced by a payment of $12.5 million in net legal settlement costs.\n2017 Financial Results\nRevenue of $751.1 million, an increase of 5 percent from 2016, and above the guidance range of $739 million to $745 million. Billings of $768.3 million, a decrease of 6 percent from 2016, and above the guidance range of $736 million to $756 million. 1 GAAP gross margin of 64 percent, compared to 62 percent in 2016.

Cash flow generated by operations in 2017 was reduced by a payment of $12.5 million in net legal settlement costs.\n1 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFirst Quarter and 2018 Outlook\nFireEye provides guidance based on current market conditions and expectations. First quarter and full year 2018 guidance ranges reflect the adoption of ASC 606.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, FireEye currently expects\nTotal revenue in the range of $192 million to $197 million. Billings in the range of $165 million to $175 million. Non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 74 percent. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately negative 2 percent to negative 4 percent. Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.03 to $0.06. Cash flow generated by operations between zero dollars and negative $10 million.\nNon-GAAP net loss per share for the first quarter assumes cash interest expense of approximately $3 million associated with the company’s convertible senior notes, provision for income taxes of between $1.0 million and $1.5 million, and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 186 million.\nFor 2018, FireEye currently expects\nRevenue in the range of $815 million to $825 million. Billings in the range of $810 million to $830 million. Non-GAAP operating margin between 1 percent and 2 percent. Non-GAAP net income per share between $0.00 and $0.04. Positive cash flow generated by operations of $45 million to $55 million. Capital expenditures between $35 million and $40 million, including approximately $12 million in capital expenditures associated with the relocation of the company's headquarters to a new building in January 2018.\nNon-GAAP net income per share for 2018 assumes cash interest expense of approximately $12.1 million, paid semi-annually in June and December, associated with the company's convertible senior notes, provision for income taxes of between $5.0 million and $6.0 million, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 197 million.\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and non-cash interest expense related to the company’s convertible senior notes. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, the amounts of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and non-recurring expenses that may be incurred in the future. Stock-based compensation expense is impacted by the company’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the company’s common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and subject to constant change. The actual amount of stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 will have a significant impact on the company’s GAAP operating margin and net loss per share. Further, amortization of intangible assets, as well as other non-recurring expenses, if any, will also impact results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.\n2018 Analyst Day Scheduled for March 1st\nThe company has scheduled its 2018 Analyst Day for March 1, 2018, with management presentations beginning at 8:30 a.m. Pacific time.

The risks and uncertainties that could cause FireEye’s results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include customer demand and adoption of FireEye’s products and services; real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in FireEye's products or services; any delay in FireEye’s release of products or services; FireEye's ability to react to trends and challenges in its business and the markets in which it operates; FireEye's ability to anticipate market needs or develop new or enhanced products and services to meet those needs; FireEye’s ability to hire and retain critical executives and key employees; FireEye’s ability to attract new and retain existing customers and train its sales force; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns and length of FireEye’s sales cycle; risks associated with new offerings; sales and marketing execution risks; the failure to achieve expected synergies and efficiencies of operations between FireEye and its acquired companies; the ability of FireEye and its acquired companies to successfully integrate their respective market opportunities, technologies, products, personnel and operations; the ability of FireEye and its partners to execute their strategies, plans, objectives and expected investments with respect to FireEye’s partnerships; and general market, political, economic, and business conditions, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in FireEye’s Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 2, 2017, which should be read in conjunction with these financial results and is available on the Investor Relations section of FireEye’s website at investors.fireeye.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov .\nAll forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof, and FireEye does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as required by law. Any future product, service, feature, or related specification that may be referenced in this release is for informational purposes only and is not a commitment to deliver any offering, technology or enhancement. FireEye reserves the right to modify future product or service plans at any time.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this release FireEye has provided financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures used by other companies. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing the company's financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\nBillings. FireEye defines billings as revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period. FireEye excludes deferred revenue assumed in connection with acquisitions from the billings calculation. The company considers billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive deferred revenue balances, which are an important indicator of the company’s future revenues. Revenue recognized from deferred revenue represents a significant percentage of quarterly revenue. There are a number of limitations related to the use of billings versus revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Second, FireEye’s calculation of billings may be different from other companies in its industry, some of which may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. FireEye compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding GAAP revenue and evaluating billings together with revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income (loss), net income (loss) per share, and free cash flow. FireEye defines non-GAAP gross margin as total gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and, as applicable, other special or non-recurring items, divided by total revenue. FireEye defines non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related expenses, change in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, restructuring charges, and other special or non-recurring items. FireEye defines non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income divided by total revenue. FireEye defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related expenses, change in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, restructuring charges, other special or non-recurring items, non-cash interest expense related to the company’s convertible senior notes, and discrete tax benefits. FireEye defines non-GAAP net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share excludes shares issuable upon conversion of the company's senior convertible notes that are anti-dilutive. FireEye defines non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average shares outstanding, which excludes stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and shares issuable upon conversion of the company's senior convertible notes that are anti-dilutive. FireEye defines free cash flow as cash flow generated by operations less purchases of property and equipment.\nNon-GAAP net income and net income per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluded stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in June 2015, and legal settlement costs. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share excluded shares issuable upon conversion of convertible senior notes that are anti-dilutive.\nNon-GAAP net loss and net loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 excluded stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in June 2015, and discrete benefit from income taxes. Additionally, weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP loss per share excluded stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and shares issuable upon conversion of senior convertible notes that are anti-dilutive.\nNon-GAAP net loss and net loss per share for 2017 excluded stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, change in the fair value of contingent earn-out liability, non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in June 2015, and legal settlement costs. Weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP net loss per share excluded stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible senior notes that are anti-dilutive.\nNon-GAAP net loss and net loss per share for 2016 excluded stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses, change in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, restructuring costs, non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in June 2015, and discrete benefit from income taxes. Additionally, weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate non-GAAP loss per share excluded stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible senior notes that are anti-dilutive.\nFireEye considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related expenses, non-cash interest expense related to the company’s convertible senior notes, change in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, restructuring charges, and other non-recurring and discrete items so that management and investors can compare the company's core business operating results, over multiple periods.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their nearest GAAP equivalents. First, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the company's business. Stock-based compensation is an important part of FireEye employees' overall compensation. Second, the components of the costs that FireEye excludes in its calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures, including not only stock-based compensation, but also non-recurring or non-operating items such as acquisition related expenses, legal settlement costs, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense related to the company’s convertible senior notes, change in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, restructuring charges, and discrete tax benefits, may differ from the components excluded by peer companies when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. FireEye compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating non-GAAP financial measures together with their nearest GAAP equivalents.\nAbout FireEye, Inc.\nFireEye is the intelligence-led security company.
