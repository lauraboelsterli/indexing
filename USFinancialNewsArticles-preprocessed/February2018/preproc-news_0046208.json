    "text": "Revenues exceed consensus estimates\nSynergy opportunity of $75M in annual run rate spend now expected\nOTTAWA, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mitel® (Nasdaq:MITL) (TSX:MNW), a global leader in business communications, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“Our strong fourth quarter performance driven by ongoing customer adoption of Mitel cloud solutions combined with continued solid revenue from our on-site business enabled us to exceed consensus estimates with revenue of $356 million,” said Rich McBee, Mitel Chief Executive Officer. “In line with our move to the cloud strategy, we ended the year with an installed UCaaS subscriber base in excess of 1.1 million seats, and with UCaaS revenue up 158% from a year ago. MiCloud seats installed via service providers in Europe also crossed the 1 million seat mark, a positive market indicator that our move to the cloud strategy is now gaining traction and speed in Europe as cloud momentum builds globally.”\nCommenting on the integration of ShoreTel, Mr. McBee said, “In the first full quarter since completing the ShoreTel acquisition we moved quickly and efficiently to integrate the key value drivers for the deal including integration of the portfolios, sale and service teams, and R&D organizations and roadmaps. With the heavy lifting on integration well-advanced, we are now expecting a synergy opportunity of $75M in annual run rate spend to be achieved over two years. With this new synergy target we see opportunity to deliver additional shareholder value from the combination.”\nAs Reported Financial Highlights from Continuing Operations\nin millions\n(except per share data) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Historical\nCurrency\nConstant\nCurrency 1\nGAAP Revenues $ 355.9 $ 259.8 $ 271.3 Non-GAAP Revenues 2 $ 357.4 $ 259.8 $ 271.3 GAAP Net Income (Loss) $ (1.7 ) $ 13.9 $ 16.6 Non-GAAP Net Income 3 $ 33.1 $ 27.3 $ 30.0 GAAP EPS – basic $ (0.01 ) $ 0.11 $ 0.14 Non-GAAP EPS 4 $ 0.27 $ 0.22 $ 0.24 Adjusted EBITDA 5 $ 60.4 $ 42.7 $ 45.4 1 – Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts Q4-2016 results by using the same foreign currency exchange rates as in Q4-2017. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measurements” below.\n2 – Non-GAAP revenues is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effect of purchase price accounting adjustments. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP revenues to GAAP revenues, please refer to the segmented information in this release. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measurements” below.\n3 – Non-GAAP Net Income is a non-GAAP measure defined as Net Income (Loss), adjusted for items as noted in the table included in this press release under “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)”. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measurements” below.\n4 – Non-GAAP EPS (earnings per share), or Non-GAAP net income per common share, is a non-GAAP measure defined as Non-GAAP Net Income divided by weighted average number of common shares outstanding, fully diluted. See the table included in this press release under “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss).” See “Non-GAAP Financial Measurements” below.\n5 – Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as Net Income (Loss), adjusted for items as noted in the table included in this press release under “Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA”. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measurements” below.\n“In Q4, our first full quarter following the ShoreTel acquisition, we continued integration actions driving annualized synergies of $38 million to date. Cash generation was strong, enabling the company to end the year with $43 million in cash and pay down debt in the quarter. We expect cash generation to further improve as synergy actions taken during the fourth and first quarters begin taking effect,” said Steve Spooner, Mitel Chief Financial Officer.\nBusiness Highlights\nAs reported by Synergy Research, Mitel is now the #2 UCaaS market share leader globally based on total recurring seats installed. More than 100,000 recurring cloud seats were added during Q4-2017, bringing Mitel’s installed recurring seat count to 1,126,000. A large UK-based retailer and existing Mitel customer migrates to cloud using MiCloud Flex in a deal with a total contract value of $3.5 million. In January, one quarter after acquiring ShoreTel, Mitel outlined its integrated portfolio for North America offering including a suite of best-of-breed solutions designed to provide customers maximum investment protection, choice and flexibility while delivering the best path to the cloud. Frost and Sullivan recently recognized Mitel as the 2017 Growth Excellence Leader in the Unified Communications industry in North America. The evaluation places Mitel ahead of Cisco and Microsoft on the basis of customer impact and growth performance.\nBusiness Outlook\nMitel has set the following financial performance guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2018\nQ1-2018 Guidance Non-GAAP Revenues 1 $300 million to $320 million Non-GAAP Gross Margin % 1 55.2% to 57.2% Adjusted EBITDA 2 $28 million to $38 million Non-GAAP Net Income 2 $9 million to $16 million Diluted Share count 124,500,000 Non-GAAP EPS $0.07 to $0.13 1 – Non-GAAP Revenues and Non-GAAP Gross Margins exclude purchase accounting adjustments. Reconciliations between Non-GAAP Revenues and Non-GAAP Gross Margin % and the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP have not been provided because such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts. More specifically, purchase accounting adjustments are not available without unreasonable efforts due to their high variability, complexity and low visibility due to the recent nature of the ShoreTel acquisition. We expect the adjustments to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n2 – A reconciliation between the Business Outlook for Q1-2018 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the table entitled “Reconciliation of Guidance - Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Loss), before income taxes” located in the tables at the end of this release.\nConference Call Information\nMitel will host an investor conference call and live webcast on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET (5:30 a.m. PT) to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to assist management and investors in understanding our past financial performance and prospects for the future, including changes in our operating results, trends and marketplace performance. Non-GAAP measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. Investors are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please see the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure attached to this release.\nForward Looking Statements\nSome of the statements in this communication are (or forward-looking information) applicable U.S. and Canadian securities laws.

(2) Adjustments for foreign exchange, purchase accounting adjustments and debt retirement costs are not available without unreasonable efforts and are excluded from the reconciliation due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility. We expect the adjustments to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results. (3) The amount and timing of special charges and restructuring costs depend on several factors, including future revenue levels, opportunities for operating efficiencies, and the size and timing of acquisition activities. As a result, we expect the charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results. (4) The guidance reconciliations above reconcile to GAAP net income (loss), before income taxes, as opposed to GAAP net income (loss), because income tax expense (recovery) guidance is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility of the Company's quarterly income tax provision. We expect income tax expense (recovery) to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results. (5) Non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by the estimated diluted share count.\nSource:Mitel Networks",
