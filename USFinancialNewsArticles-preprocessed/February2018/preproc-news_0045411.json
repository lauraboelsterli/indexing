Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net WHAT \"CORRECTION\"? BIG TECH SETS NEW RECORDS (1450 GMT) It feels like only a few days since a sharp global sell-off wiped out a chunk of 2018's gains in global equities. But big tech has hardly blinked. While the S&P 500 is still more than 5 percent below the record it hit on Jan. 26, NYSE FANG futures - a benchmark for global tech giants provided by exchange operator ICE - are breaking new records. It seems Q4 results are helping to dispel any doubts over their ability to maintain paradigm-shifting rates of growth. NYSE FANG comprises Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, NVIDIA, Tesla and Twitter . (Danilo Masoni) EUROPEAN STOCKS SHRUG OFF ECB MINUTES (1303 GMT) The euro might have spiked briefly immediately after the release of the ECB minutes, but there was nothing as exciting among European stocks - the STOXX 600 remains where it was, down 0.6 percent. The minutes showed that ECB policymakers felt it was too early to change their communication stance to signal a normalisation of policy. Here's Capital Economics' takeaway from the minutes: \"The account of the ECBâ€™s January meeting suggests that the Bank will drop the easing bias from its policy statement as soon as the next meeting on 8th March, but gives few signals as to when asset purchases will end.\" Also of note in the minutes were comments around the euro's appreciation and the drivers behind that: \"Although the past appreciation of the euro had so far had no significant negative impact on euro area external demand, volatility in foreign exchange markets represented a further risk that needed monitoring.\" (Kit Rees) BEFORE ECB MINUTES, STOXX DRIFTS SLIGHTLY LOWER (1151) European shares are retreating slightly with the STOXX 600 down 0.7 percent at around lunchtime. Here's how the main regional indexes look just ahead of the release of the ECB minutes which are unlikely to grab the same interest of those the Fed released yesterday. (Danilo Masoni) LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF HOPE IN THE BANKING SECTOR (0923 GMT) Though the broader European banking index may be down around 0.7 percent, results from Barclays and Belgium-based KBC Groep are helping stem losses. It seems that investors have been looking for capital returns from the banks - HBSC's shares dropped after there was no mention of a share buyback earlier this week, whereas Lloyds gained yesterday after announcing a buyback of up to 1 billion pounds. And today analysts are pointing to Barclays promising to restore its full dividend. \"Full-year dividend back to 6.5p next year and talk of buybacks should have investors purring with delight even though a series of one-off charges meant Barclays slid to a loss in 2017,\" Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said in a note. Interestingly while analysts at Investec described Barclays' results as \"fairly awful\", they also think that the outlook has improved thanks to the aforementioned dividend payment intentions and a better-than-expected performance in Barclays' investment banking division. Moreover, higher interest rates in the U.S. should also benefit the sector more broadly. While Barclays' shares lost more than 9 percent last year, so far they have gained around 4.7 percent in 2018. (Kit Rees) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES PULL BACK (0820 GMT) Europe has opened, and fallen. There seem to be a number of drivers: yields on 10-year U.S. treasuries are fast approaching 3 percent (a level now crossed by the 30-year) after the Fed's latest policy minutes, which in turn is hitting the equity market. Not surprising then, that the biggest sectoral losers early on are the \"bond proxies\" - consumer staples and telecoms. Throw into the mix a number of not-so-well-received results from the likes of Moneysupermarket.com (-19 pct), Ingenico (-12 pct) and Playtech (-8 pct) as well as several FTSE big-hitters going ex-div and you can see why the mood is pretty downcast. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) EUROPEAN HEADLINES: MORNING ROUND-UP (0749 GMT) Earnings season is in full swing and the flurry of publications today is offering precious indications as to whether Q4 was indeed a strong vintage. Clues are expected on the health of sectors which have suffered recently, such as telecoms, utilities or consumer staples but also areas where optimism has risen yesterday, such as banks, thanks to Lloyds, and miners with Glencore.

Yesterday's PMIs showed that, while business growth remains robust, it has slipped slightly from January's peak. \"The data is in line with our expectations of European growth peaking in Q1, but the still-elevated survey levels continue to support our above-consensus 2018 growth forecast and our preference for European stocks on a three- to six-month horizon,\" analysts at Credit Suisse's Wealth Management division said in a note. From the chart below, you can see how the euro zone's Euro Stoxx Index has tracked a rise in PMI readings, suggesting that an economic expansion has been filtering through into optimism around the region's equities.
