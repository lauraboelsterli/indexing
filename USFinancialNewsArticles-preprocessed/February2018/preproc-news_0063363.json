MANAGEMENT REMARKS\n“We are very pleased with MITT’s performance during 2017, producing core earnings in-line with our regular common dividend and generating an economic return on equity for the year of 21%,” said Chief Executive Officer David Roberts. “During the fourth quarter, the team achieved strong financial results, focusing on book value protection and risk management, and we believe MITT is well positioned going forward to take advantage of a range of opportunities at favorable risk-adjusted returns.”\n“During the fourth quarter, spreads for most mortgage-backed credit sectors were modestly tighter and agency spreads remained stable despite nominal interest rates rising, resulting in an increase in MITT’s book value,” said Chief Investment Officer, TJ Durkin. “We saw opportunities to deploy capital into both Agency RMBS and Credit Investments during the quarter, and MITT continues to leverage the Angelo, Gordon platform to source residential assets. Additionally, we remain focused on growing Arc Home, our mortgage origination affiliate going forward.”\nINVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS\n$3.8 billion investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017 as compared to the $3.5 billion investment portfolio as of September 30, 2017 (2)(3) Net purchased $249.9 million of Agency and TBA securities, inclusive of unsettled trades, coupled with net purchases of $94.1 million of Credit Investments 2.38% Net Interest Margin (“NIM”) as of December 31, 2017 (7) Increase in cost of funds primarily due to an increase of 25 bps in the federal funds rate in December 4.4x “At Risk” Leverage as of December 31, 2017 (6) Increase in leverage primarily due to the addition of Agency RMBS 7.8% constant prepayment rate (“CPR”) on the Agency RMBS investment portfolio for the fourth quarter (5) Duration gap was approximately 1.15 years as of December 31, 2017 (15)\nFOURTH QUARTER ACTIVITY\n($ in millions) Description Net\nPurchased /\n(Sold/Payoff)\nNet Repo\n(Added) /\nRemoved*\nNet Equity\nInvested /\n(Returned)\n30-Year Fixed Rate $ 228.0 $ (169.7) $ 58.3 Inverse Interest Only 28.7 (13.8) 14.9 Interest Only and Excess MSRs 9.6 (7.8) 1.8 Total Agency RMBS 266.3 (191.3) 75.0 Prime 16.7 (8.7) 8.0 Alt-A 6.7 (5.2) 1.5 Subprime (29.5) 24.6 (4.9) Credit Risk Transfer 28.5 (22.5) 6.0 RPL/NPL 25.3 (22.6) 2.7 Residential Whole Loans 44.5 (31.3) 13.2 Total Residential Investments 92.2 (65.7) 26.5 CMBS 9.4 (2.7) 6.7 Freddie Mac K-Series CMBS 3.8 - 3.8 CMBS Interest Only 1.6 (0.3) 1.3 Total Commercial Investments 14.8 (3.0) 11.8 Total ABS (12.8) 5.8 (7.0) Total Q4 Activity Prior to TBA 360.5 (254.2) 106.3 Fixed Rate 30 Year TBA (18.7) N/A (0.6)** Total Q4 Activity including TBA $ 341.8 N/A $ 105.7 *Timing and size of repo added may differ from that of repo removed.

Premiums and discounts associated with purchases of the Company's securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the estimated life of such securities, using the effective yield method. The Company recorded a de minimus retrospective adjustment due to the change in projected cash flows on its Agency RMBS, excluding interest-only securities and TBAs. Since the cost basis of the Company's Agency RMBS securities, excluding interest-only securities and TBAs, exceeds the underlying principal balance by 3.9% as of December 31, 2017, slower actual and projected prepayments can have a meaningful positive impact, while faster actual or projected prepayments can have a meaningful negative impact on the Company's asset yields.\nFINANCING AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company, either directly or through its equity method investments in affiliates, had master repurchase agreements with 39 counterparties, under which it had debt outstanding with 27 counterparties as of December 31, 2017.

Our management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with our GAAP financials, provides supplemental information useful for investors in evaluating our results of operations. Our presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\nWe define Core Earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders excluding both unrealized and realized gains/(losses) on the sale or termination of securities and the related tax expense/benefit or disposition expense, if any, on such sale or termination including (i) investments held in affiliated entities and (ii) derivatives. As defined, Core Earnings include the net interest and other income earned on our investments on a yield adjusted basis, including credit derivatives, investments in debt and equity of affiliates, inverse Agency Interest-Only securities, interest rate derivatives, TBA drop income or any other investment activity that may earn or pay net interest or its economic equivalent. One of our objectives is to generate net income from net interest margin on the portfolio, and management uses Core Earnings to measure this objective. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when considered with our GAAP financials, provides supplemental information useful for investors in evaluating our results of operations. This metric, in conjunction with related GAAP measures, provides greater transparency into the information used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nA reconciliation of Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders to Core Earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017, the three months ended December 31, 2016, and the year ending December 31, 2017 is set forth below:\n($ in thousands) Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 Net Income/(loss) available to common stockholders $ 20,890 $ (4,449) $ 105,088 Add (Deduct): Net realized (gain)/loss 1,459 1,666 13,986 Drop income 473 52 3,099 Equity in (earnings)/loss from affiliates (2,921) (364) (12,621) Net interest income and expenses from equity method investments*\n2,236 1,738 8,695 Unrealized (gain)/loss on real estate securities and loans, net 7,661 30,588 (45,529) Unrealized (gain)/loss on derivative and other instruments, net (15,589) (13,405) (19,813) Core Earnings $ 14,209 $ 15,826 $ 52,905 Core Earnings, per Diluted Share $ 0.50 $ 0.57 $ 1.90 *For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $0.1 million or $0.00 per share of net income/(loss) attributed to our investment in AG Arc.

Book value uses stockholders’ equity less net proceeds of the Company’s 8.25% Series A and 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as the numerator.\n(2) The investment portfolio at period end is calculated by summing the fair market value of our Agency RMBS, any long positions in TBAs, Residential Investments, Commercial Investments, and ABS Investments, including securities and mortgage loans owned through investments in affiliates, exclusive of AG Arc LLC. Refer to footnote (3) for more information on the GAAP accounting for certain items included in our investment portfolio. See footnote (13) for further details on AG Arc LLC.\n(3) Generally, when we purchase a security and employ leverage, the security is included in our assets and the leverage is reflected in our liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as either “Repurchase agreements” or “Securitized debt, at fair value.” Throughout this press release where we disclose our investment portfolio and the related repurchase agreements that finance it, we have presented this information inclusive of (i) unconsolidated ownership interests in affiliates that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method and (ii) long positions in TBAs, which are accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. This press release excludes investments through AG Arc LLC unless otherwise noted. This presentation of our investment portfolio is consistent with how our management evaluates the business, and we believe this presentation, when considered with the GAAP presentation, provides supplemental information useful for investors in evaluating our investment portfolio and financial condition. See footnote (13) for further details on AG Arc LLC.\n(4) The economic return on equity for the quarter represents the change in book value per share from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017, plus the common dividends declared over that period, divided by book value per share as of September 30, 2017. The annualized economic return on equity is the quarterly return on equity multiplied by four. The economic return on equity for 2017 represents the change in net book value per share from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, plus the dividends declared over that period, divided by net book value per share as of December 31, 2016.\n(5) This represents the weighted average monthly CPRs published during the quarter for our in-place portfolio during the same period. Any net TBA position is excluded from the CPR calculation.\n(6) “At Risk” Leverage was calculated by dividing total financing including any net TBA position by our GAAP stockholders’ equity at quarter-end. Total financing at quarter-end includes repurchase agreements inclusive of repurchase agreements through affiliated entities, exclusive of any financing utilized through AG Arc LLC, plus the payable on all unsettled buys less the financing on all unsettled sells, securitized debt and any net TBA position (at cost). Total financing excludes any repurchase agreements and unsettled trades on U.S. Treasuries.\n(7) Net interest margin is calculated by subtracting the weighted average cost of funds from the weighted average yield for the Company’s investment portfolio, which excludes cash held by the Company. See footnotes (8) and (9) for further detail. Net interest margin also excludes any net TBA position.\n(8) The yield on our investment portfolio represents an effective interest rate, which utilizes all estimates of future cash flows and adjusts for actual prepayment and cash flow activity as of quarter-end. This calculation excludes cash held by the Company and excludes any net TBA position. The calculation of weighted average yield is weighted based on fair value.\n(9) The cost of funds at quarter-end was calculated as the sum of (i) the weighted average funding costs on total financing outstanding at quarter-end and (ii) the weighted average of the net pay rate on our interest rate swaps, the net receive rate on our Treasury long positions, the net pay rate on our Treasury short positions, and the net receivable rate on our IO index derivatives, if any. Both elements of the cost of funds at quarter-end were weighted by the outstanding repurchase agreements and securitized debt outstanding at quarter-end, excluding repurchase agreements associated with U.S. Treasury positions. The cost of funds excludes any net TBA position.\n(10) The management fee percentage at quarter-end was calculated by annualizing management fees recorded during the quarter and dividing by quarter-end stockholders’ equity.\n(11) The other operating expenses percentage at quarter-end was calculated by annualizing other operating expenses recorded during the quarter and dividing by quarter-end stockholders’ equity.\n(12) This estimate of undistributed taxable income per share represents the total estimated undistributed taxable income as of quarter-end. Undistributed taxable income is based on current estimates and projections. As a result, the actual amount is not finalized until we file our annual tax return, typically in September of the following year.\n(13) The Company invests in Arc Home LLC through AG Arc LLC, one of its indirect subsidiaries.\n(14) The Company allocates its equity by investment using the fair market value of its investment portfolio, less any associated leverage, inclusive of any long TBA position (at cost). The Company allocates all non-investment portfolio related items based on their respective characteristics in order to sum to the Company’s stockholders’ equity per the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s equity allocation method is a non-GAAP methodology and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures or concepts of other companies, who may use different calculations.\n(15) The Company estimates duration based on third-party models. Different models and methodologies can produce different effective duration estimates for the same securities.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006699/en/\nAG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc.\nKaren Werbel - Investor Relations\n212-692-2110\nir@agmit.com\nSource: AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc.",
