    "text": "* Credit Agricole says Q4 net income up 33 pct\n* CIB revenue resilient in a low volatility\n* CASA guides French retail reached its floor\n* BNP, SocGen also point at revenue stabilisation (Updates with CFO, CEO comments)\nBy Maya Nikolaeva and Matthieu Protard\nPARIS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Credit Agricole said its French retail bank unit had reached a turning point and that revenues should grow from the levels seen in the fourth quarter last year, as it reported higher overall profits.\nCredit Agricole reported on Thursday a 33 percent jump in quarterly profit as its investment banking unit held up well in a tough market environment, helping offset a one-time hit from tax-related items.\nEarlier this month, SocGen reported forecast-beating fourth quarter results although profits at BNP Paribas - France’s biggest listed bank - fell short of market forecasts.\nCredit Agricole’s outlook comes as other French banks, including BNP Paribas and SocGen have struggled from a weak performance in consumer banking, although all pointed towards a stabilisation of revenue this year.\nCredit Agricole’s retail unit LCL, which accounted for a fifth of the bank’s 2017 revenue, reported a 3.9 percent revenue fall, compared to declines of 0.4 percent at BNP Paribas and 1.0 percent at SocGen.\n“We have revenue volumes in the fourth quarter which, in our point of view, is the floor of what we are going to see over the coming quarters,” Jerome Grivet, Credit Agricole SA chief financial officer, told journalists.\nThe bank was also seeing a positive impact from loan growth on net interest income and continued growth in fee and commission income.\nSocGen also said it was seeing a slowdown in the erosion of revenues and BNP Paribas had also guided for 2018 revenue of zero to minus 0.8 percent.\nWhile they have cut staff and the number of branches, the banks have also rolled out vast investment plans to upgrade infrastructure and develop new digital products on the back of rising competition from purely online rivals, that has been putting pressure on margins.\n“The new entrants are solely digital and this is why they make you think that we are ‘traditional’. We are present physically and digitally...speed of our digital acceleration is very strong,” said Credit Agricole chief executive Philippe Brassac.\nBrassac added that there is no profitable online-only bank and that he did not believe in a purely digital business model.\n$1 = 0.8080 euros Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva and Matthieu Protard Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
