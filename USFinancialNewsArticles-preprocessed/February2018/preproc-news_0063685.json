    "text": "LAS VEGAS, NV, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- International Spirits and Beverage Group Inc., (a Nevada Corporation) (OTCPK:ISBG) is pleased to announce that it continues to strengthen the company’s balance sheet through amendments made to notes held by company debt holders.\n“I am overwhelmed by the actions taken by those who have supported the company,” said ISBG’s President and Chairman, Alonzo Pierce. “We are taking the necessary steps in securing a brighter future for this company and its shareholders. These actions will surely help pave the way for us to soar on the wings of our brands.”\nWhile many noteholders have agreed to extend their notes to 2019, there are others that have forgiven their notes completely. Letters declaring the various amendments to these notes were forwarded to the company hired to do the corporate valuation, one of the vital closing steps to completing the audit.\nAbout ISBG: ISBG is a Nevada-based alcoholic beverage company specializing in the development, marketing and global sales of innovative wine and spirits brands. The Company's expertise lies in the strategic development and aggressive early growth of its brands and establishing these brands as viable and profitable. ISBG intends to build its own brands while seeking out individual acquisition candidates to continue to develop its pipeline of new brands into the ISBG portfolio.
