This is in addition to his current title as President, which he's held since 2010.\nKerckhoff joined Plancorp as a financial planner in 1997, when the firm managed roughly $198 Million in assets. Since then, the firm has experienced significant growth with $4B in client assets across four office locations, including St. Louis, MO., Webster Groves, Mo., Sarasota, Fla. and, most recently , Nashville, Tenn.

Today, BrightPlan is the only human-robo hybrid solution of its kind certified by the Centre for Fiduciary Excellence (CEFEX).\nKerckhoff also helped oversee the establishment of Plancorp's Philanthropy Committee, as well as its Women's Initiative , which seeks to foster a collaborative environment among female advisors and clients, while providing financial literacy and support for women in the communities Plancorp serves.\nJeff Buckner , who founded Plancorp in 1983, remains the firm's chairman and Co-chief investment officer. He commented: \"Chris joined us as one of the first five Plancorp employees. From day one, he's demonstrated the kind of visionary thinking and leadership that reflects a genuine passion for his work. He has helped guide the firm through exciting changes, while ensuring that we maintain our unique, people-first culture â€“ and I'm delighted to announce that, as of today, he officially assumes the role of CEO.\"\n\"Over the last few years Plancorp has experienced significant growth, and developed a solid reputation for exemplary client service,\" added Kerckhoff . \"This serves as a testament to the dedication of the incredible team we have assembled over the last 20 years. We've had a profound impact on many families' lives, and I'm enthused to lead the company as we identify new ways to deliver outstanding value.\"\nFor more information about Plancorp, visit www.plancorp.com .\nAbout Plancorp:\nPlancorp LLC was founded in 1983 as a fee-only financial planning firm in St. Louis, MO.
