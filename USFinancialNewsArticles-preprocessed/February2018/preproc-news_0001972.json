(NYSE:BAX) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017, and provided its financial guidance for 2018.\n“Baxter’s solid performance in 2017 reflects the ongoing impact of strategic, disciplined execution,” said José (Joe) E. Almeida, chairman and chief executive officer. “We are combining an unwavering focus on operational excellence with an increased emphasis on innovation and portfolio expansion to deliver positive results for patients and investors. Looking ahead, our continued transformation will help support our aspiration of delivering industry-leading performance for our investors and other stakeholders in 2018 and beyond.”\nFourth-Quarter Financial Results\nIn the fourth quarter, worldwide sales totaled approximately $2.8 billion, an increase of 5 percent on a reported basis, 3 percent on a constant currency basis and 2 percent on an operational basis as compared to the prior-year period. Operational sales adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for U.S. cyclophosphamide, the Claris Injectables (Claris) acquisition and the previously communicated select strategic product exits the company is undertaking. In line with the financial outlook shared on October 25, 2017, fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million as a result of temporary manufacturing disruptions in Puerto Rico due to the impact of Hurricane Maria.\nSales in the U.S. were $1.1 billion, increasing 1 percent. International sales totaled more than $1.6 billion, representing an 8 percent increase on a reported basis and a 4 percent increase on a constant currency basis.\nGlobal sales for Hospital Products totaled $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, advancing 5 percent on a reported basis, 3 percent on a constant currency basis and 1 percent operationally as compared to the prior-year period. Performance in the quarter benefited from continued strength in our U.S. fluid systems business as well as favorable demand for injectable pharmaceuticals, which includes the contribution of approximately $30 million of sales from the acquisition of Claris. Sales in the quarter also benefited from increased demand for the company’s advanced surgery products as well as cytotoxic contract manufacturing services. Hospital Products fourth quarter sales were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million as a result of the Hurricane Maria related manufacturing disruptions.\nBaxter’s fourth quarter Renal sales were approximately $1.1 billion, representing an increase of 5 percent on a reported basis, 3 percent on a constant currency basis and 4 percent operationally. Sales growth in Renal was driven by solid performance globally across both chronic and acute renal therapies.\nBaxter reported a net loss from continuing operations of $61 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis for the fourth quarter. These results included special items totaling $137 million net ($415 million net after-tax, which includes a net tax charge of $322 million related to the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform). Other special charges in the quarter primarily included business optimization and intangible asset amortization.\nOn an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxter’s fourth quarter income from continuing operations totaled $354 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, exceeding the company’s previously issued guidance of $0.56 to $0.59 per diluted share.\nSummary of Full-Year 2017 Results\nBaxter’s worldwide sales totaled approximately $10.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 4 percent on both a reported and constant currency basis, and 5 percent on an operational basis as compared to the prior-year period. Sales within the United States totaled $4.5 billion, improving 6 percent on both a reported and operational basis over the prior year. International sales totaled approximately $6.1 billion, representing a 2 percent increase on a reported and constant currency basis and 4 percent operationally. Full-year sales for Hospital Products totaled $6.6 billion, reflecting growth of 5 percent on a reported, constant currency and operational basis. Baxter’s Renal sales totaled more than $3.9 billion, increasing 2 percent on both a reported and constant currency basis and 4 percent operationally.\nFor full-year 2017, Baxter reported income from continuing operations of $724 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, on a GAAP basis. These results include special items of $461 million net ($652 million net after-tax, including the estimated net impact of U.S. tax reform) primarily related to business optimization initiatives, intangible asset amortization, Claris integration expenses and deconsolidation of the company’s Venezuelan operations.\nOn an adjusted basis, excluding special items, Baxter’s full-year income from continuing operations totaled approximately $1.4 billion, or $2.48 per diluted share.\nIn 2017, Baxter generated $1.85 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of $229 million driven by improved operational performance and the continuing impact of programs focused on improving the company’s working capital. In addition, through disciplined management of expenditures, Baxter reduced capital spending by $85 million to $634 million. As a result, the company generated an increase of $314 million in free cash flow to $1.22 billion (operating cash flow less capital expenditures).\n“Over the last two years, Baxter has demonstrated significant progress in improving our cash generation. This improvement allows the company flexibility to reinvest in the business and return value to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases,” said Jay Saccaro, Baxter’s chief financial officer. “During the year, we increased the annual dividend rate by 23 percent as well as repurchased $564 million worth of shares, while also pursuing internal and external initiatives to augment future growth.”\n2017 Business Highlights\nBaxter advanced its mission to save and sustain lives through patient-focused and customer-inspired innovation while generating profitable growth. Among the year’s highlights, the company:\nCompleted its acquisition of Claris Injectables Limited , significantly broadening Baxter’s presence in the global generic injectable pharmaceuticals marketplace. Initiated high-potential research and development collaborations across a range of therapeutic opportunities with partners such as Mayo Clinic , Ramot at Tel Aviv University/Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and ScinoPharm . Received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance clarifying the regulatory pathway for a new home-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution generation system; and initiated U.S. clinical trials of HDx therapy enabled by THERANOVA , a Baxter technology currently available in other global markets that is designed to closely mimic the natural kidney through clearance of small to large middle molecules during dialysis. Introduced Baxter’s leading-edge PrisMAX acute care technology through a limited launch in select international markets; and also launched, in select markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa, a new indication for the oXIRIS set, the first 3-in-1 set for use in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols. Launched enhancements and upgrades for a range of Baxter products to promote safety and increase ease of use, including the AK 98 hemodialysis system , FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL [Fibrin Sealant] and the SIGMA SPECTRUM infusion system .\nAs 2018 begins, Baxter remains focused on accelerating growth and innovation through both business development and its internal R&D pipeline. Among developments since the start of the year, the company:\nAnnounced entry into an agreement to acquire two surgical hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc: RECOTHROM Thrombin topical (Recombinant), the first and only stand-alone recombinant thrombin, and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant, which is used in vascular reconstruction, subject to the satisfaction of standard closing conditions. Received U.S. FDA approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection using Baxter’s proprietary frozen GALAXY container technology, making it the first and only presentation of Bivalirudin available in a convenient frozen premixed solution.\nPuerto Rico Update\nAs noted in earlier press releases, regarding the impact of Hurricane Maria, Baxter experienced production disruptions at its three Puerto Rico facilities following challenges to the island’s power and infrastructure, which affected the manufacture of several products for the U.S. market. Baxter is committed to helping ensure patients have continued access to the products and therapies they need, and the company has been working diligently to restore its operations to full capacity following the storm.\nAll of Baxter’s Puerto Rico facilities are now back on the electrical grid and have been ramping up production to pre-hurricane levels. In addition, Baxter has been working closely with FDA, which granted regulatory discretion for temporary special importation of certain products from Baxter facilities in Ireland, Australia, Canada, Mexico, England, Italy and Brazil to help support product supply for the U.S. market. While the company expects to return to more normal supply levels for products manufactured in Puerto Rico over the coming weeks, sales in the first quarter will be negatively impacted by approximately $25 million.\n“I am incredibly proud of and grateful to our employees around the world, who are inspired by our mission to save and sustain lives and have contributed in remarkable ways to our recovery efforts in Puerto Rico,” said Almeida. “I also want to thank our customers for their extraordinary patience and support as we work together through these unprecedented supply challenges, and to acknowledge the FDA’s valued assistance and partnership, which has been vital to the island’s continued recovery.”\n2018 Financial Outlook\nBaxter is providing its outlook for the full-year and first quarter of 2018:\nFor full-year 2018, Baxter expects sales growth of 6 to 7 percent on a reported basis and approximately 4 percent on both a constant currency and operational basis. Operational sales adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, generic competition for cyclophosphamide and the benefit of the Claris acquisition. The company expects earnings from continuing operations, before special items, of $2.72 to $2.80 per diluted share. For the first quarter, the company expects sales growth of approximately 5 to 6 percent on a reported basis, or 1 to 2 percent on a constant currency basis. Operational sales are expected to be flat to up 1 percent as compared to the prior-year period. The company expects earnings from continuing operations, before special items, of $0.60 to $0.62 per diluted share.\nThe reconciliations between the projected 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share and projected GAAP diluted earnings per share follows:\n2018 Earnings per Share Guidance Q1 2018 FY 2018 Diluted Earnings per Share – Adjusted $0.60 - $0.62 $2.72 - $2.80 Estimated intangible asset amortization $0.06 $0.23 Estimated business optimization charges $0.07 - $0.09 $0.19 - $0.24 Diluted Earnings per Share – GAAP $0.45 - $0.49 $2.25 - $2.38 These estimates are based on information reasonably available at the time of this release, and future events or new information may result in different actual results.\nA webcast of Baxter's fourth quarter 2017 conference call for investors can be accessed live from a link on the company's website at www.baxter.com beginning at 7:30 a.m. CST on February 1, 2018.
