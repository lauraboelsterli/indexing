    "text": "MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich., Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: INFU) (\"InfuSystem\" or the \"Company\"), a leading national provider of infusion pumps and related services for the healthcare industry in the United States, announced today it has received notice that on January 29, 2018 the United States District Court for the Central District of California has issued an order dismissing, with prejudice, a putative class-action lawsuit against the Company.\nThe dismissal relates to an action brought on November 8, 2016 by a purported shareholder of the Company (Case No. 2:16-cv-08295-ODW) against the Company and two individual defendants: Eric Steen, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director; and Jonathan Foster, the Company's former Chief Financial Officer. The complaint asserted claims against all defendants under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and against Messrs. Steen and Foster as control persons.\nOn June 19, 2017, the Company and all defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint. On December 15, 2017, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's first amendment to the class action compliant (\"FAC\"), with leave to amend. On December 20, 2017, the parties stipulated, and the Court extended, the plaintiff's time to amend the FAC up to January 19, 2018. As of January 19, 2018, the plaintiff never filed an amended complaint and the Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice on January 29, 2018.\nAbout InfuSystem Holdings, Inc.\nInfuSystem Holdings, Inc. is a leading provider of infusion pumps and related services to hospitals, oncology practices and other alternate site healthcare providers. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, the Company delivers local, field-based customer support and also operates Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Texas, Georgia and Ontario, Canada. The Company's stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol INFU.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe financial results in this press release reflect preliminary results, which are not final until the Company's Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2017 is filed.
