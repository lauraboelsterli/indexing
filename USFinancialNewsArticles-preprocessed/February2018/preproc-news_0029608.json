This category honors some of the longest standing nonprofit supporters of the veterans' community who continuously show dedicated and committed efforts to bringing veteran and service members' interests to the forefront of the national dialogue.\nThe HillVets100 includes veterans from all eras, from the Vietnam War to the more recent Iraq and Afghanistan Wars. Selectees represent a broad spectrum of veterans from artists to elected officials to business executives, among others.\nBlake was recently named executive director of Paralyzed Veterans, after serving as its interim executive director since November 2017.
