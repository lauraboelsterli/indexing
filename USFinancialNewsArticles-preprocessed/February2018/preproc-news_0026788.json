LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE:BBW) today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.\nSharon Price John, Build-A-Bear Workshop President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During fiscal 2017, we advanced our strategy as additional groundwork was laid to further leverage the power of the Build-A-Bear brand while we simultaneously improved the profitability of our retail channel highlighted by expansion in retail gross margin, which contributed to pre-tax income that exceeded guidance. During the year, we made operational improvements enabling us to drive conversion and deliver our highest dollars-per-transaction in history, which partially offset the traditional mall traffic challenges. We also continued to evolve our real estate portfolio with more productive formats that have lower overall costs. In advance of the holiday season, we upgraded our e-commerce platform and relaunched our website, which contributed to growth of almost 12% from this channel for the quarter, and, when combined with our redeveloped store base, positions us to advance key omni-channel initiatives. Specifically, in the year ahead, we are planning to more fully participate in the changing patterns of shoppers and connect more closely with consumers through elevated social and digital marketing and a recently updated loyalty program. We remain focused on the continued execution of our strategy and ongoing effort to drive long-term profitable growth.”\nAdditional Fiscal Year 2017 Details (52 weeks ended December 30, 2017, compared to 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016):\nConsolidated net retail sales were $349.4 million compared to $357.6 million in fiscal 2016; Consolidated comparable sales decreased 6.5%, including a 6.5% decrease in both North America and Europe inclusive of a consolidated comparable e-commerce sales increase of 2.8%; SG&A decreased $4.5 million to $152.7 million, or 42.7% of total revenues from $157.2 million, or 43.2% of total revenues in fiscal 2016; Income tax expense was $5.9 million with an effective tax rate of 42.7%, compared to income tax expense of $3.9 million with an effective tax rate of 74.1% in fiscal 2016, with both years impacted by discrete tax items (see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results); Net income was $7.9 million compared to $1.4 million in fiscal 2016; and Adjusted net income was $8.4 million compared to adjusted net income of $6.6 million in fiscal 2016 (see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results).\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights (13 weeks ended December 30, 2017, compared to the 13 weeks ended December 31, 2016):\nTotal revenues were $107.6 million compared to $110.3 million in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter; Retail gross margin expanded 510 basis points to 51.1% compared to 46.0% in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter; Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $44.9 million, or 41.7% of total revenues, compared to $47.0 million, or 42.6% of total revenues, in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter; Net income was $5.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $0.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter; Adjusted net income was $6.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $5.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter (see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results); Consolidated net retail sales were $105.8 million compared to $107.7 million in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter; Consolidated comparable sales decreased 8.0%, including a 6.5% decrease in North America and a 13.1% decrease in Europe inclusive of a consolidated comparable e-commerce sales increase of 11.7%; Pre-tax income increased to $9.7 million, compared to $3.5 million in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter; Adjusted pre-tax income increased to $9.7 million, compared to $8.2 million in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter (see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results); and Income tax expense was $4.4 million with an effective tax rate of 45.8%, compared to $3.2 million with an effective tax rate of 90.9% in the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter with both periods impacted by discrete tax items (see reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results).\nStore Activity:\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company opened 41 locations, closed 26 locations and remodeled or reformatted 23 stores into a Discovery format, ending the year with 29% of its store base in an updated Discovery format. As of December 30, 2017, the Company operated 361 corporately-managed locations, including 301 in North America and 60 outside of North America. The Company’s international franchisees ended the year with 102 stores in 12 countries.\nBalance Sheet:\nAs of December 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $30.4 million. The Company ended fiscal 2017 with no borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Total inventory at year-end was $53.1 million compared to $51.9 million at 2016 year-end, an increase of 2.4%. In fiscal 2017, capital expenditures totaled $18.1 million and depreciation and amortization was $16.2 million.\nShare Repurchase:\nThe Company repurchased 401,400 shares of its common stock for $3.7 million in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter bringing total shares repurchased to 513,725 for the fiscal year. At year-end, the Company had $15.3 million remaining on the share repurchase authorization that was adopted in August 2017. Since the end of its 2017 fiscal year, the Company purchased an additional 616,141 shares of common stock for $5.3 million.\nFiscal Year Change:\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year-end, which previously ended on the Saturday closest to December 31, to the Saturday closest to January 31. This change was effective immediately following the end of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year. A one fiscal month transition period, December 31, 2017 through February 3, 2018, will be reported on the Company’s Form 10-Q along with results for the quarter ending May 5, 2018. The first 12-month fiscal year under the new calendar will encompass February 4, 2018 through February 2, 2019. Select recast unaudited historical financial information for the four quarterly periods of fiscal 2016 (which, based on the new fiscal year, would have ended on April 30, 2016; July 30, 2016; October 29, 2016; and January 28, 2017) and the first three quarterly periods of fiscal 2017 (which, based on the new fiscal year, would have ended on April 29, 2017; July 29, 2017; and October 28, 2017) is included in this press release as well as posted on the Company’s website under the Investor Relations link.\nAccounting Changes Impacting Revenue Recognition:\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” a replacement of Revenue Recognition Topic 605. The Company adopted Topic 606 on December 31, 2017. While the majority of the Company’s revenues are not impacted by Topic 606, the timing of the recognition of breakage revenue for certain gift cards changes. Previously, the Company recognized gift card breakage after 60 months for certain gift cards, while the new standard requires that gift card breakage be recognized based on actual redemption experience. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a pre-tax cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $12.3 million representing gift card breakage revenue not previously recognized that was accelerated due to Topic 606. The change will negatively impact the Company’s fiscal 2018 total revenue and pre-tax income by $3.9 million with the remaining balance of the cumulative effect adjustment predominantly impacting fiscal years 2019 and 2020.\nTax Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA):\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which, among other items, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Due to the Company’s net deferred tax asset position at the end of fiscal year 2017, the Company recorded a provisional one-time, non-cash tax expense of $1.4 million increasing its tax rate by 15 percentage points and 10.5 percentage points for the fourth quarter 2017 and fiscal year 2017, respectively. Following this adjustment, the Company expects to have an ongoing benefit of a reduction in its federal tax rates.\n2018 Preliminary Expectations:\nThe Company is providing guidance for its preliminary GAAP expectations for fiscal year 2018, (52 weeks ending February 2, 2019). On a GAAP basis, the Company currently expects:\nTotal revenue growth to be slightly positive, including the aforementioned $3.9 million negative impact due to accounting changes in Revenue Recognition; Pre-tax income to grow in the range of 10 to 15%, after adjusting 2017 GAAP pre-tax income for $3.9 million related to accounting changes in Revenue Recognition; Diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.53 to $0.57, using an effective tax rate range of 25% to 27%, assuming no discrete items; and Capital expenditures to be in the range of $15 to $18 million with depreciation and amortization in the range of $16 to $17 million.\nToday’s Conference Call Webcast:\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop will host a live internet webcast of its quarterly investor conference call at 9 a.m. ET today.
