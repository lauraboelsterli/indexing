Net sales slipped 11.5 percent to 39 billion rupees.\n“The quarterly performance was muted on the back of business mix as well as forex losses,” said Nilesh Gupta, managing director.\nProfit fell 65 percent to 2.22 billion rupees for the quarter ended Dec. 31, well below an average analysts' estimate of 4.21 billion rupees, Thomson Reuters data showed. ( bit.ly/2E47T4m )\nLupin said its profit was hit by a foreign exchange loss of 821 million rupees compared to a gain of 276 mllion rupees a year earlier.\nThe company also incurred a charge of 361 million rupees as a result of recalculating deferred tax assets related to its United States operations due to the introduction of a new tax regime.
