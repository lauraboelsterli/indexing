    "text": "Advisory Board to Provide Strategic Technological and Business Insight for ICO and Beyond\nMENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mavatar today announces four new members have joined its ICO Advisory Board. They include Emmanuel Abiodun, Architect (VP) Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service; Sara Azadi, EVP, Managing Director at Edelman; Claudio Ludovisi, former Vice President, Head of Strategy & Business Planning, ABC Entertainment; and Dr. Sachio Semmoto, Chairman and CEO of eAccess and eMobile.\nThe Advisory Board will provide supplementary insight for Mavatar. Mr. Abiodun, for instance, who was a co-founder of PeerNova, has been immersed in Blockchain since its early days .\n“We’re seeing an accelerated effort to implement this disruptive technology in all major industry sectors,” says Abidun. “Smart contracts and blockchain instill trust whilst also offering flexibility. I see a place where smart contacts govern a lot of future agreements in the ad space without intermediaries, and mCart is a perfect example of this.”\nAzadi, who has over a decade of experience in brand consultancy, thinks should cryptocurrency-powered mCarts become an industry standard, shoppable content will replace push model advertising by allowing marketers to track influence down to actual sales dollars.\n“Advertising alone won’t move consumers to buy and we know consumers want to buy from someone they trust,” explains Azadi. “For influencer marketing to be effective, we need a system that accurately attributes who moved a consumer to purchase. This would allow retailers to move away from the default marketing methodologies of last click attribution.”\nClaudio Ludovisi, who previously served as VP, Head of Strategy and Business Planning at ABC Entertainment and SVP, Operational Strategy, Marketing and Digital at NBC Entertainment, also foresees the end of subscriptions and push marketing, and the rise of video.\n“Networks and content providers recognize what they do shapes trends for products,” says Ludovisi. “This is true not only for big studios, but also for television and other IP’s which cannot compete on a Walmart shelf against a major film or classic franchise. To date, several digitally enabled “shop the show” solutions have sprung up and are pitching entertainment companies, but building a significant revenue stream has proven challenging and complex. Mavatar solves all that complexity, providing a substantial additional revenue stream for television and video makers.”\nA pioneer for Japanese telecom , Dr. Sachio Semmoto has taken several companies public. Semmoto has served as Executive Officer of KDDI Corporation and is a Co-founder and Trustee of the Japan Academic Society for Ventures and Entrepreneurs. Semmoto is committed to building investor trust.\n“Many countries have already identified ICOs as a high risk to investors,” Semmoto says. “We want to create an environment where ICO maintains its transparent edge while also having a solid plan for growth that investors can depend on when identifying any viable investment.”\nMavatar is preparing to resume its ICO pre-sale of mCart Token, after receiving contribution from premier asset management and venture capital companies such as CollinStar Capital , Blockchain Ventures, Candou Ventures and as well as other professional investors and entrepreneurs specializing in digital assets, cryptocurrency and Blockchain enabled infrastructure.\nTo join the mCart ICO whitelist, click here .\nAbout Mavatar\nmCart protocol by Mavatar is a decentralized influencer marketing attribution platform that addresses the needs of shoppers, influencers, and marketers by leveraging the smart contract capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain.
