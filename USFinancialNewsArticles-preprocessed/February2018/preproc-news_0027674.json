    "text": "BELFAST (Reuters) - Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May said she asked political parties in Northern Ireland on Monday to make one last effort to restore devolved government and saw the possibility of a resolution to the stalemate very soon.\n“I have urged (the parties) to make one final push for the sake of the people of Northern Ireland,” May told reporters. “It should be possible to see an executive up and running in Northern Ireland very soon.”\nMay traveled to Belfast on Monday in an attempt to persuade political parties to restore devolved government after 13 months of wrangling and avoid the introduction of direct rule from London.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
