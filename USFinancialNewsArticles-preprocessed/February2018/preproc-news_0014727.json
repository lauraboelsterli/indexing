    "text": "All amounts in US dollars unless otherwise indicated\nBROOKFIELD, News, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (TSX:BEP.UN) (NYSE:BEP) (“ Brookfield Renewable ”) today reported an increase in quarterly distributions and financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017.\n“In 2017, we delivered strong results to our unitholders, deployed $625 million of equity, adding solar, wind, distributed generation, and storage capacity in our core markets. We also expanded the franchise into key high-growth markets where we should be able to grow over the coming decades; all while maintaining robust liquidity,” said Sachin Shah, CEO of Brookfield Renewable. “Looking ahead, we will continue to execute on our strategy of capital deployment on a value basis, optimizing cash flows, and delivering strong growth through-the-cycle.\"\n“In light of our results, and with the strong growth ahead of us, we are pleased to announce that our board has declared a 5% increase to the quarterly distribution, bringing our annual payout to $1.96 per unit,” added Mr. Shah.\nFinancial Results For the periods ended December 31 US$ millions (except per unit or otherwise noted) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Unaudited 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total generation (GWh) - Actual generation 11,913 8,728 43,385 34,071 - Long-term average generation 12,198 10,319 42,334 38,982 Brookfield Renewable's share - Actual generation 5,890 4,734 23,968 20,222 - Long-term average generation 6,030 5,739 23,251 22,362 Proportionate Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 295 $ 189 $ 1,142 $ 942 Funds From Operations (FFO) (1) $ 143 $ 54 $ 581 $ 419 Per Unit (1)(2) $ 0.46 $ 0.18 $ 1.90 $ 1.45 (1) Non-IFRS measure. Refer to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Measures”.\n(2) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, weighted average LP Units, Redeemable/Exchangeable partnership units and GP interest totaled 312.6 million and 305.8 million, respectively (2016: 299.1 million and 288.7 million).\nBrookfield Renewable reported proportionate Adjusted EBITDA and FFO of $1.14 billion and $581 million respectively for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $942 million and $419 million for the same period in 2016. These strong results were supported by the advancement of our organic growth initiatives, improvement in generation levels from our assets, and contributions from new acquisitions.\nProportionate adjusted EBITDA and FFO for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $295 million and $143 million compared to $189 million and $54 million for the same period in 2016.\nAppointment of Wyatt Hartley as Chief Financial Officer\nThe Board of Brookfield Renewable is pleased to announce the appointment of Wyatt Hartley as Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Hartley, a CPA, joined Brookfield Asset Management in 2010 where he held a series of senior finance positions. Previously, he served as Chief Financial Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure Group’s American operations, and Chief Financial Officer of Acadian Timber Corp, before joining Brookfield Renewable in 2017 as Senior Vice President, Finance.\nMr. Hartley succeeds Nicholas Goodman, who is assuming the role of Group Treasurer for Brookfield Asset Management, and Brookfield Renewable will therefore continue to benefit from his advice and counsel.\nHighlights from the Year\nWe delivered a total return to shareholders of approximately 25%, and FFO per unit growth of 31% in 2017. Highlights from the year include:\nDeploying approximately $625 million of equity from our balance sheet in new transactions and developments, in line with our targets Commissioned 75 megawatts of new capacity, while progressing an additional 248 megawatts of construction and advanced stage projects that are expected to enter commercial operations in the next four years Added scale solar, wind, storage and distributed generation assets to our portfolio in our core markets in North America, while making small investments in India and China, establishing an operating presence in these markets to support future growth Maintained robust liquidity, ending the year with in excess of $1.5 billion of available capital, through accessing multiple sources of liquidity and monetizing select mature assets for value\nOperating and Financial Results\nOur revenues continue to be largely contracted across the business, with approximately 90% of generation contracted and an average power purchase agreement term of over 15 years. During the year, our hydro assets reported $687 million of FFO supported by generation above long-term average. Generation in North America was particularly strong (7% above average) and we ended the year with reservoirs above long-term average levels. In Brazil, our energy marketing team actively managed our power to protect the business against low hydrology while capturing higher prices. Accordingly, we secured new power purchase agreements for both existing assets and development sites at average prices of R$230 per megawatt-hour. In the fourth quarter, we secured a 30-year power purchase agreement that begins in 2023 at an inflation indexed price of R$221 per megawatt-hour for a new-build 30 megawatt hydro site located in the southeast of the country. We expect to commence construction on this project in 2018. Generation in Colombia was also above average during 2017, and we signed nine power purchase agreements during the year with average term of between five and ten years as we continue to extend duration in that portfolio.\nOur wind facilities delivered $105 million of FFO in 2017. Generation in our wind fleet was 9% below the long-term average during the year with much of the shortfall in North America. Our portfolio in Brazil continues to outperform our expectations with capacity factors that regularly exceed 40%. We added further wind assets to the Brazil portfolio during the year through the acquisition of TerraForm Global. In Europe, we continue to build our wind business largely through a development strategy that consistently generates mid-teen returns in a market where operating assets trade at very high multiples. We monetized two wind farms during the year to take advantage of this value differential, repatriating $150 million to our investors in the project ($60 million to BEP) and crystalizing a 35% return on our invested capital.\nOur solar portfolio now consists of over 1,000 megawatts of utility-scale solar and 400 megawatts of distributed solar generation. The vast majority of these assets are located in the United States and are supported by high quality, utility grade contracts with an average term of 18 years. These facilities were acquired in the fourth quarter through our Terraform Power and Global acquisitions, and therefore contributed modestly to FFO in 2017, but will have full contributions to 2018.\nWe also own and operate interests in three pumped storage facilities in the U.S. and U.K. which contributed $17 million to FFO in 2017. Pumped storage is still the only utility-scale storage method for electricity.\nTransaction Updates\nIn the fourth quarter, we and our institutional partners closed the acquisitions of 51% of TerraForm Power and 100% of Terraform Global, which were previously controlled by SunEdison. Combined, these two transactions added 3,600 megawatts of long duration, contracted solar and wind assets to our portfolio. The assets are fully operational and virtually all recently build. The average portfolio age is approximately 5 years. The assets are located primarily in our core markets of the United States, Canada and Brazil while also including small portfolios of operating assets in India and China.\nSince our acquisition, we have taken meaningful strides to both strengthen TerraForm Power’s balance sheet and grow the business. Subsequent to close of our transaction TerraForm Power executed a broad refinancing plan by purchasing and re-issuing $1.6 billion of new unsecured and secured bonds. This transaction extended the company’s overall maturity profile to 10 years, greatly improved overall financial flexibility through improved covenants, and reduced annual interest costs by almost $20 million. In early February, TerraForm Power announced a $1.2 billion offer to acquire 100% of Saeta Yield – a 1,028 megawatt European solar and wind portfolio. The transaction is expected to be accretive on day one to existing shareholders and should provide compelling opportunities for follow on investment.\nSince closing the acquisition of TerraForm Global, we have begun the process of integrating the assets into our existing operations in Brazil and establishing new offices and advancing growth opportunities in India and China.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position at year end exceeds $1.5 billion. In 2017, we continued to access multiple sources of capital, including through the preferred equity and equity capital markets, and completed several up-financing initiatives. We completed $1.6 billion of project level re-financings, including the issuance of three green bonds for an aggregate value of $1.1 billion.\nDistribution Increase and Declaration\nThe next quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.49 per LP Unit, is payable on March 29, 2018 to unitholders of record as at the close of business on February 28, 2018. This represents an increase of 5% over the prior quarterly distribution of $0.4675 per LP unit. Brookfield Renewable targets a sustainable distribution with increases targeted on average at 5% to 9% annually.\nThe regular quarterly dividends on Brookfield Renewable’s preferred shares and preferred LP units have also been declared.\nDistribution Currency Option\nThe quarterly distributions payable on the Partnership’s LP Units are declared in U.S. dollars. Unitholders resident in the United States will receive payment in U.S. dollars and unitholders resident in Canada will receive the Canadian dollar equivalent unless they request otherwise. The Canadian dollar equivalent of the quarterly distribution will be based on the Bank of Canada daily average exchange rate on the record date or, if the record date falls on a weekend or holiday, on the Bank of Canada daily average exchange rate of the preceding business day.\nRegistered unitholders resident in Canada who wish to receive a U.S. dollar distribution and registered unitholders resident in the United States wishing to receive the Canadian dollar distribution equivalent should contact Brookfield Renewable’s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, in writing at 100 University Avenue, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2Y1 or by phone at 1-800-564-6253. Beneficial unitholders (i.e., those holding their units in street name with their brokerage) should contact the broker with whom their units are held.\nDistribution Reinvestment Plan\nBrookfield Renewable maintains a Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) which allows holders of its LP Units who are resident in Canada to acquire additional LP Units by reinvesting all or a portion of their cash distributions without paying commissions.
