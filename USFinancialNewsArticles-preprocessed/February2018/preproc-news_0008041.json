    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the central bank must maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy as inflation remained distant from its 2 percent target.\nWhile prolonged easing has yet to trigger excess risk-taking by investors, it was adding to strains for regional banks, already suffering from narrowing margins due to an ageing population, Kuroda told parliament.\n“Still, it’s extremely important to achieve our 2 percent inflation target,” Kuroda said. “Japan’s inflation remains distant from our target, so we need to patiently continue with powerful monetary easing.” (Reporting by Leika Kihara Editing by Chang-Ran Kim)\n ",
