(NASDAQ:CTXS) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Results\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, Citrix achieved revenue from continuing operations of $778 million, compared to $735 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, representing 6 percent revenue growth. For fiscal year 2017, Citrix reported annual revenue from continuing operations of $2.82 billion, compared to $2.74 billion for fiscal year 2016, a 3 percent increase.\nGAAP Results\nNet loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $284 million, or $1.93 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $179 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net (loss) income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and 2016 includes restructuring charges of $54 million and $6 million, respectively, for severance and facility closing costs. Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes charges for the estimated impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 related to the transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the U.S. federal tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. Approximately $364 million in tax expense was recorded for the transition tax on overseas earnings, and approximately $65 million in tax expense was recorded related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in total charges of $429 million. The impacts of U.S. tax reform may differ from this estimate, and the estimated charges may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018.\nAnnual net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 was $22 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $470 million, or $2.99 per diluted share for fiscal year 2016. Annual net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 and 2016 includes restructuring charges of $72 million and $67 million, respectively, for severance and facility closing costs. Annual net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 also includes $429 million in charges for the estimated impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 related to the transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nNon-GAAP Results\nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $248 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, compared to $218 million, or $1.38 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and 2016 excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, restructuring charges and the tax effects related to these items. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 also excludes tax impact related to the separation of the GoTo business along with charges for the estimated impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 related to the transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 also excludes separation costs and the tax effect related to this item. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 also reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the company’s convertible note hedges.\nAnnual non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 was $744 million, or $4.85 per diluted share, compared to $700 million, or $4.45 per diluted share for fiscal year 2016. Annual non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 and 2016 excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount, separation costs, restructuring charges and the tax effects related to these items. Annual non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 also excludes tax impact related to the separation of the GoTo business along with charges for the estimated impact from U.S. tax reform related to the transition tax and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Annual non-GAAP net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2017 also reflects the anti-dilutive impact of the company’s convertible note hedges.\n“This quarter, we delivered strong financial results, while at the same time, accelerating innovation across our portfolio and in the cloud. Our sales execution was excellent, driving double-digit product and subscription bookings growth and the fastest revenue growth of the year,” said David Henshall, president and CEO.\n“Our partners and our customers are really embracing our new subscription services, which have jumpstarted the multi-year plan that we presented in October 2017.

These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization primarily related to acquired intangible assets and debt discount, stock-based compensation expenses, charges associated with the Company’s restructuring programs, separation costs, the related tax effect of those items, charges related to the implementation of U.S. tax reform and separation-related tax charges or benefits. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The Company also reflects the effect of anti-dilutive convertible note hedges in the number of shares used in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis. The Company's basis for these adjustments is described below.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company's performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company's executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items that are not used by management when evaluating the Company's historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors.\nManagement typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company's operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company's operating performance due to the following factors:\nThe Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. Amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company's employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.\nUnder GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be accounted for as separate liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance because management believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends. The Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs. Each restructuring activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. While the Company’s operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by the various restructuring charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of the Company’s business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods. Separation costs represent transaction and transition costs associated with preparing businesses for independent operations consisting primarily of financial advisory fees, legal fees, accounting fees, tax services and information systems infrastructure duplication. These charges are not anticipated to be ongoing costs; and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company's business. As such, the Company believes that these expenses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. The Company has convertible note hedges in place to offset potential dilution from the embedded conversion feature in its convertible notes. For GAAP diluted earnings per share purposes, the Company cannot reflect the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges. The Company believes that reflecting the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share provides investors with useful information in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a per share basis. Separation-related tax charges or benefits, which may include reversals of certain state R&D credits due to changes in expectations of realizability as a result of the separation of a significant business of the Company. The Company believes that these items do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. Tax charges resulting from the enactment of U.S. tax reform. These charges are not anticipated to be ongoing costs; and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company’s business. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company's operating results and underlying operational trends as compared to prior periods.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted (\"GAAP\") and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company's liquidity.\nCITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation\n(In thousands, except per share, gross margin and operating margin data - unaudited)\nThe following tables show the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nGAAP gross margin 84.3% Add: stock-based compensation 0.2 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 3.0 Non-GAAP gross margin 87.5% Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nGAAP operating margin 24.4% Add: stock-based compensation 4.9 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 2.9 Add: amortization of other intangible assets 0.8 Add: restructuring charges 6.9 Non-GAAP operating margin 39.9%\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 GAAP net (loss) income from continuing operations $(283,889) $178,575 Add: stock-based compensation 37,901 37,467 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 22,626 12,196 Add: amortization of other intangible assets 6,119 3,627 Add: amortization of debt discount 8,621 8,346 Add: separation costs — 793 Add: restructuring charges 53,697 6,090 Less: tax effects related to above items (33,580 ) (29,571 ) Add: separation-related tax charges 7,600 — Add: charges related to U.S. tax reform 429,400 — Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations $248,495 $217,523 Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Number of shares used in diluted (loss) earnings per share calculations: GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (“WASO”) 147,390 158,196 Add: effect of convertible note hedges and WASO from anti-dilutive shares for GAAP purposes*\n2,356 — Non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding 149,746 158,196\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 GAAP (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations - diluted $(1.93) $1.13 Add: stock-based compensation 0.25 0.24 Add: amortization of product related intangible assets 0.15 0.08 Add: amortization of other intangible assets 0.04 0.02 Add: amortization of debt discount 0.06 0.05 Add: separation costs — 0.01 Add: restructuring charges 0.36 0.04 Less: tax effects related to above items (0.21 ) (0.19 ) Add: separation-related tax charges 0.05 — Add: charges related to U.S. tax reform 2.87 — Add: impact on WASO from anti-dilutive shares for GAAP purposes* 0.02 — Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations - diluted $1.66 $1.38 *Per ASC 260, anti-dilutive shares were excluded from GAAP weighted average shares outstanding due to Q4'17 including a GAAP loss from continuing operations.
