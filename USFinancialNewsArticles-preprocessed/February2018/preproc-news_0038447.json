    "text": "STOCKHOLM, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Sweden’s central bank sees a modest transitional impact of a new accounting standard on regulatory capital ratios for the four major Swedish banks, it said in an economic commentary on Friday.\n“In the long-run, if implemented in a sound way by banks, IFRS 9 can contribute to improve banks’ credit risk management, increase transparency on banks’ asset quality and credit risks, and reduce pro-cyclicality through a more timely recognition of credit losses”, Riksbank staff said.\n“This may eventually improve financial stability.”\nReporting by Daniel Dickson\n ",
