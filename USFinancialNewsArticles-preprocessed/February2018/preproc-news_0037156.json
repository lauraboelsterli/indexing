The 0.7 points drop, the sharpest decrease since the 2008 financial crisis, took the French unemployment rate to its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. The data will be good news for President Emmanuel Macron, who passed a wide-ranging reform of labour rules at the end of September last year. The number of jobless people in mainland France fell by 205,000 in the final three months of 2017, bringing the total number of unemployed to 2.5 million. The unemployment rates for the third and second quarters of last year were revised down by 0.1 points each, INSEE said.
