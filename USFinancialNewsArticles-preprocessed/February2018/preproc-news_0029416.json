    "text": " 27 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago North Korean pair given warm welcome on Pyeongchang debut Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber 3 Min Read GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - North Korean pair skaters Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik made their long-awaited debut at the Pyeongchang Olympics on Wednesday in front of a crowd of euphoric spectators cheering on every jump and lift. The pair were the first North Korean athletes to qualify for the Games but it was unclear for several months whether they would actually compete in South Korea. The sense of anticipation was palpable at the Gangneung Ice Arena before the pairs short programme. Related Coverage A swarm of North Korean female fans wearing red and white tracksuits marched up to the stands, smiling and waiving to passers-by as out of uniform police officer looked on. In the stands, they rhythmically chanted the skaters’ names as they waived flags of the country. A small group of university students supporting better inter-Korean ties brandished a banner that read: “Pyeongchang fairy Ryom Tae Ok, jump toward unification!” Skating to an instrumental cover of “A Day in the Life” by the Beatles, the pair cleanly executed all the elements of their programme with a technically-sound performance that earned them a personal best score of 69.40 points. Figure Skating – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Pair Skating short program competition – Gangneung Ice Arena - Gangneung, South Korea – February 14, 2018 - Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik of North Korea in action. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Bruno Marcotte, a Canadian coach who works with the pair, told Reuters on Tuesday they had been striving for a personal best score close to 70 points in the short programme. Their goal for the long programme is more than 125 points. Their current personal best score for that programme is 119.90.

The skaters were the first North Koreans to qualify for the Games after they finished in the top six at a competition in Germany in September North Korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. They have sent 22 athletes to compete in Pyeongchang, including 12 ice hockey players in a combined North and South Korean women’s team.
