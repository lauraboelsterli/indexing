    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Slovenia came from two goals down in the third period to beat the United States 3-2 in overtime on Wednesday in the opening round of the men’s Olympic hockey tournament.\nA team who have earned a reputation for punching above their weight, Slovenia captain Jan Mursak tied the game with under two minutes to go by tapping home a rebound and scored the winner less than a minute into sudden-death overtime.\n“I‘m proud of my guys, I‘m proud of the team,” said Mursak, who played sporadically with the NHL’s Detroit Red Wings between 2010 and 2012.\n“Hopefully, we can start looking to the next game and surprise somebody else.”\nThe U.S. struck first late in the opening period when Garrett Roe kept a loose puck in the Slovenian zone, carried it behind the net and fed Brian O‘Neill who was streaking into the slot. O‘Neill fired a wrist shot that beat Slovenia goaltender Gasper Kroselj on his stick side.\nREFILE - CORRECTING SLUG Ice Hockey – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men Preliminary Round Match - U.S. v Slovenia - Kwandong Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea – February 14, 2018 - Ryan Stoa (R) of the U.S. in action with Mitja Robar of Slovenia. REUTERS/Brian Snyder In the second period Jordan Greenway, the first African American to play for the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team, tapped in a puck that popped loose from a scrum in front of Kroselj.\n“It was exciting to get my first, but it would have been much better to get a win tonight,” said Greenway, one of four American college players in the U.S. team.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Slovenia, ranked 15th by the International Ice Hockey Federation, got on the board in the third period when Blaz Gregorc threaded a wrist shot through a crowd in front of U.S. goalkeeper Ryan Zapolski.\nA team who never quit, the Slovenians fought their way into the knockout round in Sochi four years ago and finished seventh.\nThe Olympic hockey tournament is being played without NHL players for the first time since the Lillehammer Games in 1994 after the league and International Olympic Committee failed to agree on players’ travel and insurance costs.\nThat has left teams to build their rosters from emerging local talent or from players in other professional leagues, largely from Europe.\nThe Slovenians next face the Olympic Athletes from Russia, who lost to Slovakia 3-2 on Wednesday. The Americans play the Slovaks.\nReporting by Dan Burns, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
