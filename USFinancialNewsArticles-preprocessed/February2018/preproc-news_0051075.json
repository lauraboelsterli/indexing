We are very excited about this next phase of growth for the company as we expand internationally to help our customers with their increasingly global requirements.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue was $180.5 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $137.4 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of 31%. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by a 49% increase in leased CSF and additional interconnection services.\nNet income was $2.8 million for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $0.8 million in the same period in 2016. Net income per basic and diluted common share 1 was $0.03 in 2017, compared to net income of $0.01 per basic and diluted common share in the same period in 2016.\nNet operating income (NOI) 2 was $120.3 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $89.6 million in the same period in 2016, an increase of 34%. Adjusted EBITDA 3 was $104.2 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $73.0 million in the same period in 2016, an increase of 43%.\nNormalized Funds From Operations (Normalized FFO) 4 was $78.4 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $56.4 million in the same period in 2016, an increase of 39%. Normalized FFO per basic and diluted common share was $0.84 in 2017, an increase of 24% over fourth quarter 2016.\nLeasing Activity\nCyrusOne leased approximately 9 MW of power and 86,000 CSF in the fourth quarter, representing $1.5 million in monthly recurring rent, inclusive of the monthly impact of installation charges, or approximately $17.6 million in annualized GAAP revenue 5 , excluding estimates for pass-through power. The weighted average lease term of the new leases, based on square footage, is 61 months (5.1 years), and the weighted average remaining lease term of CyrusOne’s portfolio is 53 months (taking into account the impact of the backlog). Recurring rent churn 6 for the fourth quarter was 1.1%, compared to 2.2% for the same period in 2016.\nPortfolio Utilization and Development\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company completed construction on 164,000 CSF and 20 MW of power capacity across three projects in Northern Virginia, Phoenix and Raleigh-Durham, increasing total CSF across 45 data centers to approximately 3.3 million CSF. CSF utilization 7 as of the end of the fourth quarter was 93% for stabilized properties 8 and 83% overall. In addition, the Company has development projects underway in Dallas, Northern Virginia, Phoenix, Austin and the New York Metro area that are expected to add approximately 163,000 CSF and 39 MW of power capacity.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had gross assets 9 totaling approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of approximately 48% over gross assets as of December 31, 2016. CyrusOne had $2.10 billion of long-term debt 10 , cash and cash equivalents of $151.9 million, and $1.1 billion available under its unsecured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. Net debt 10 was $1.96 billion as of December 31, 2017, representing approximately 25% of the Company's total enterprise value of $7.7 billion, or 4.7x Adjusted EBITDA for the last quarter annualized. Available liquidity 11 was $1.24 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nAs previously announced, CyrusOne completed a $400 million offering of senior notes in early November, using the proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. Also in the fourth quarter, CyrusOne sold approximately 4.8 million shares of its common stock through its at-the-market equity program at an average price of $62.09, raising approximately $296 million in net equity proceeds. As of December 31, 2017, there was $200 million in remaining capacity under the current ATM program.\nDividend\nOn October 30, 2017, the Company announced a dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock for 2017. The dividend was paid on January 12, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 29, 2017.\nAdditionally, today the Company is announcing a dividend of $0.46 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018, a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend compared to 2017. The dividend will be paid on April 13, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 29, 2018.\nGuidance\nCyrusOne is issuing guidance for full year 2018. The annual guidance provided below represents , which are based on current economic conditions, internal assumptions about the Company's existing customer base, and the supply and demand dynamics of the markets in which CyrusOne operates.\nCyrusOne does not provide reconciliations for the non-GAAP financial measures included in the annual guidance provided below due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including net income (loss) and adjustments that could be made for transaction and acquisition integration costs, legal claim costs, lease exit costs, asset impairments and loss on disposals and other charges in its reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant.\nCategory\n2017\nResults\n2018\nGuidance (1)\nTotal Revenue $672 million $810 - 825 million Base Revenue $602 million $735 - 745 million Metered Power Reimbursements $70 million $75 - 80 million Adjusted EBITDA $372 million $460 - 470 million Normalized FFO per diluted common share $3.12 $3.18 - 3.28 Capital Expenditures $915 million $850 - 900 million Development $911 million $845 - 890 million Recurring $4 million $5 - 10 million (1) Full year 2018 guidance assumes the Zenium acquisition closes on April 30, 2018. Development capital\nexpenditures include the acquisition of land for future development. Zenium Acquisition\nDuring the fourth quarter, CyrusOne announced the execution of a definitive agreement with Quantum Strategic Partners Ltd. (“Quantum”), a private investment fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC and certain other sellers named therein, to purchase Zenium, a leading hyperscale data center provider in Europe with four properties in London and Frankfurt, the continent’s two largest data center markets.\nThe transaction is expected to provide several key benefits to CyrusOne, including the following:\nCritical First Step in International Expansion Strategy: The acquisition of Zenium is the first step in executing CyrusOne’s previously announced European expansion strategy, adding four properties in London and Frankfurt, the continent’s two largest data center markets. The European data center market is growing rapidly, with reported take-up over the last eighteen months well over double the prior eighteen-month period. Additionally, there has been strong demand for larger deployments, a market segment for which CyrusOne has unique expertise and capabilities. Establishing a significant European presence is a critical step in CyrusOne’s strategic objective of becoming a global provider. Accelerated Entry into Important Markets with Significant Development / Lease-Up Opportunity: With 22.5 MW of critical load available for development and lease-up, the acquisition meaningfully accelerates CyrusOne’s ability to address the increasingly global needs of its existing customers. At the same time, the Company’s expanding footprint will allow CyrusOne to more effectively compete for opportunities from potential customers looking for a single provider with a geographically diverse presence. Given the significant investment to date, CyrusOne expects to deliver this incremental capacity at an estimated build cost of approximately $115 million, or $5.1 million per MW, while the total construction cost per MW across the assets once fully built out is expected to average $6.5-7.0 million per MW, largely in line with CyrusOne’s current all-in build costs. Experienced Management Team with Similar Operating Philosophy and Customer Focus: The Zenium management team has a proven track record as data center developers and operators with more than 70 years of combined experience. CyrusOne will benefit from this local expertise in site selection and acquisition, data center development, and sales. Similar to CyrusOne, Zenium has a high-quality customer base with a particular emphasis on hyperscale cloud companies. The Zenium portfolio consists of more than 10 customers, with hyperscale companies representing nearly 75% of contracted revenue. More than half of the customers will be new to CyrusOne, including two Fortune 1000 companies. Over 75% of the contracted revenue is generated from investment grade customers, and the weighted average remaining lease term is approximately six years. Significant Operating Leverage: CyrusOne should benefit from significant operating leverage as the combined company expands within London and Frankfurt as well as into new markets, with a new site in Frankfurt already under contract and advanced discussions under way for additional organic site developments in London, Frankfurt, and Dublin. Similarly, as CyrusOne continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities in other markets, the Company expects to be able to leverage the design & construction, sales & marketing, and back-office capabilities of Zenium to generate cost synergies.\nThis transaction is expected to be dilutive to Normalized FFO per diluted common share in the first twelve months following the closing, modestly accretive in the second twelve months, and meaningfully accretive thereafter.\nCyrusOne intends to assume approximately $50 million of debt currently outstanding under an existing EUR credit facility, with total committed capacity of approximately $120 million based on the 12/31/17 spot exchange rate. The balance of the purchase price is expected to be financed through capacity under its $1.1 billion revolving credit facility.\nAppointment of Chief Accounting Officer\nOn February 16, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Howard Garfield as Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer effective February 26, 2018. Mr. Garfield replaces Amitabh Rai who advised the Company of his intention to retire. Mr. Rai will remain as an employee of the company through May 1, 2018 to allow for an orderly transition.\n“We are very grateful to Amit for all his contributions as Chief Accounting Officer to CyrusOne since joining the company in 2015,” said Diane M. Morefield, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. “We wish him the best in his retirement.”\n\"We are also very pleased to have Howard join the CyrusOne leadership team,\" commented Morefield. “He has a long and impressive track record in the REIT and broader real estate industry. I am confident that Howard will play a very valuable role in helping CyrusOne achieve its business objectives and continue to scale for growth.\n\"Mr. Garfield has over 30 years of accounting, tax, treasury and financial experience, serving in senior and executive management positions with national and international real estate companies. Mr. Garfield was most recently with Monogram Residential Trust (NYSE: MORE), serving as Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer from 2009 to September 2017, and Chief Financial Officer from 2009 to 2015. In 2008 and 2009, Mr. Garfield was Senior Vice President with Lehman Brothers in their private equity real estate funds group. Mr. Garfield was previously CFO with Hillwood Development, a real estate private equity firm controlled by Ross Perot, Jr., and MEPC plc, an international real estate company publicly traded in the U.K. and the U.S., with responsibilities over accounting, tax and treasury. Mr. Garfield started his career with Touche Ross, is a certified public accountant and holds a BBA in Business Honors, with an emphasis in accounting, from the University of Texas at Austin.\nUpcoming Conferences and Events\nMUFG Property REIT Corporate Access Day on February 27 in New York City Wells Fargo Real Estate Securities Conference on February 28-March 1 in New York City Raymond James Institutional Investor Conference on March 4-7 in Orlando, Florida Deutsche Bank Media, Telecom & Business Services Conference on March 5-7 in Palm Beach, Florida\nConference Call Details\nCyrusOne will host a conference call on February 22, 2018, at 11:00 AM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Central Time) to discuss its results for 2017.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this release and those discussed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). More information on potential risks and uncertainties is available in our recent filings with the SEC, including CyrusOne's Form 10-K report, Form 10-Q reports, and Form 8-K reports. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any . We undertake no obligation to revise or update any for any reason.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are helpful in understanding the Company's business, as further discussed within this press release. These financial measures, which include Funds From Operations, Normalized Funds From Operations, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Operating Income, Adjusted Net Operating Income, and Net Debt should not be construed as being more important than comparable GAAP measures. Detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures have been included in the tables that accompany this release and are available in the Investor Relations section of www.cyrusone.com .\nManagement uses FFO, Normalized FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, and Adjusted NOI as supplemental performance measures because they provide performance measures that, when compared year over year, capture trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The Company also believes that, as widely recognized measures of the performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other companies, these measures will be used by investors as a basis to compare its operating performance with that of other companies. Other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner, and, as presented, they may not be comparable to others. Therefore, FFO, Normalized FFO, NOI, Adjusted NOI, and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income as measures of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, NOI, Adjusted NOI, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as measures of liquidity or as indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including the ability to pay dividends. These measures also should not be used as substitutes for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n1 Net income / (loss) per common share is defined as net income / (loss) divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period, which were 93.5 million for 2017.\n2 Net Operating Income (NOI) is defined as revenue less property operating expenses. Amortization of deferred leasing costs is presented in depreciation and amortization, which is excluded from NOI. CyrusOne has not historically incurred any tenant improvement costs. Our sales and marketing costs consist of salaries and benefits for our internal sales staff, travel and entertainment, office supplies, marketing and advertising costs. General and administrative costs include salaries and benefits of our senior management and support functions, legal and consulting costs, and other administrative costs. Marketing and advertising costs are not property-specific, rather these costs support our entire portfolio. As a result, we have excluded these marketing and advertising costs from our NOI calculation, consistent with the treatment of general and administrative costs, which also support our entire portfolio. From time to time, there may be non-recurring costs in property operating expenses, and as a result the Company may present Adjusted Net Operating Income (Adjusted NOI) to exclude the impacts of those costs.\n3 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction and integration costs, severance and management transition costs, new accounting standards and systems implementation costs, asset impairments and (gain) loss on disposals, lease exit costs, legal claim costs and other special items. Other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Accordingly, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to others.\n4 Normalized Funds From Operations (Normalized FFO) is defined as Funds From Operations (FFO) plus amortization of customer relationship intangibles, transaction and acquisition integration costs, legal claim costs and lease exit costs, and other special items including loss on extinguishment of debt, severance and management transition costs, and new accounting standards and systems implementation costs, as appropriate. FFO is net (loss) income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP before real estate depreciation and amortization and Asset impairments and loss on disposal. While it is consistent with the definition of FFO promulgated by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, our computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other REITs. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to others. Because the value of the customer relationship intangibles is inextricably connected to the real estate acquired, CyrusOne believes the amortization of such intangibles and impairments of such intangibles is analogous to real estate depreciation and impairments; therefore, the Company adds the customer relationship intangible amortization and impairments back for similar treatment with real estate depreciation and impairments. The Company believes its Normalized FFO calculation provides a comparable measure to that used by others in the industry. However, other REITs may not calculate Normalized FFO in the same manner. Accordingly, the Company’s Normalized FFO may not be comparable to others. In addition, because FFO and Normalized FFO exclude real estate depreciation and amortization and real estate impairments, and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or from market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO and Normalized FFO as measures of our performance is limited. Therefore, FFO and Normalized FFO should be considered only as supplements to net income (loss) as measures of our performance.\n5 Annualized GAAP revenue is equal to monthly recurring rent, defined as average monthly contractual rent during the term of the lease plus the monthly impact of installation charges, multiplied by 12. It can be shown both inclusive and exclusive of the Company’s estimate of customer reimbursements for metered power.\n6 Recurring rent churn is calculated as any reduction in recurring rent due to customer terminations, service reductions or net pricing decreases as a percentage of rent at the beginning of the period, excluding any impact from metered power reimbursements or other usage-based billing.\n7 CSF utilization is calculated by dividing CSF under signed leases for available space (whether or not the contract has commenced billing) by total CSF. CSF Utilized differs from CSF Leased presented in the Data Center Portfolio table because the utilization rate includes CSF for signed leases that have not commenced billing.\n8 Stabilized properties include data halls that have been in service for at least 24 months or are at least 85% utilized.\n9 Gross asset value is defined as total assets plus accumulated depreciation.\n10 Long-term debt and net debt exclude adjustments for deferred financing costs. Net debt provides a useful measure of liquidity and financial health. The Company defines net debt as long-term debt and capital lease obligations, offset by cash and cash equivalents.\n11 Liquidity is calculated as cash, cash equivalents, and temporary cash investments on hand, plus the undrawn capacity on CyrusOne's revolving credit facility.\nAbout CyrusOne\nCyrusOne (NASDAQ: CONE) is a high-growth real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in highly reliable enterprise-class, carrier-neutral data center properties.

Pre-stabilized properties include data halls that have been in service for less than 24 months and are less than 85% utilized. (c) Represents monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of December 31, 2017, multiplied by 12. For the month of December 2017, customer reimbursements were $67.8 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power vary from month-to-month based on factors such as our customers' utilization of power and the suppliers' pricing of power. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power constituted between 10.2% and 12.6% of annualized rent. After giving effect to abatements, free rent and other straight-line adjustments, our annualized effective rent as of December 31, 2017 was $675.7 million. Our annualized effective rent was greater than our annualized rent as of December 31, 2017 because our positive straight-line and other adjustments and amortization of deferred revenue exceeded our negative straight-line adjustments due to factors such as the timing of contractual rent escalations and customer prepayments for services.\n(d) CSF represents the NRSF at an operating facility that is currently leased or readily available for lease as colocation space, where customers locate their servers and other IT equipment. (e) Percent leased is determined based on CSF being billed to customers under signed leases as of December 31, 2017 divided by total CSF.

(l) Critical load capacity represents the aggregate power available for lease and exclusive use by customers expressed in terms of megawatts. The capacity reported is for non-redundant megawatts, as we can develop flexible solutions to our customers at multiple resiliency levels. Does not sum to total due to rounding. 6 of 18 megawatts of power capacity for Phoenix - Chandler VI reported as placed into service in 3Q'17 are under development and are expected to be placed into service in 1Q'18. 6 of 12 megawatts of power capacity for San Antonio IV reported as placed into service in 3Q'17 are expected to be placed into service in late 2018.

(b) Represents the number of customers occupying data center, office and other space as of December 31, 2017. This may vary from total customer count as some customers may be under contract, but have yet to occupy space. (c) Represents the total square feet at a facility under lease and that has commenced billing, excluding space held for development or space used by CyrusOne. A customer’s leased NRSF is estimated based on such customer’s direct CSF or office and light-industrial space plus management’s estimate of infrastructure support space, including mechanical, telecommunications and utility rooms, as well as building common areas. (d) Represents monthly contractual rent (defined as cash rent including customer reimbursements for metered power) under existing customer leases as of December 31, 2017, multiplied by 12. For the month of December 2017, customer reimbursements were $67.8 million annualized and consisted of reimbursements by customers across all facilities with separately metered power. Customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power vary from month-to-month based on factors such as our customers' utilization of power and the suppliers' pricing of power. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, customer reimbursements under leases with separately metered power constituted between 10.2% and 12.6% of annualized rent. After giving effect to abatements, free rent and other straight-line adjustments, our annualized effective rent as of December 31, 2017 was $675.7 million. Our annualized effective rent was greater than our annualized rent as of December 31, 2017 because our positive straight-line and other adjustments and amortization of deferred revenue exceeded our negative straight-line adjustments due to factors such as the timing of contractual rent escalations and customer prepayments for services.\nCyrusOne Inc.\nLease Expirations\nAs of December 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\nYear (a) Number of\nLeases\nExpiring (b)\nTotal Operating\nNRSF Expiring\nPercentage of\nTotal NRSF\nAnnualized\nRent (c)\nPercentage of\nAnnualized Rent\nAnnualized Rent\nat Expiration (d)\nPercentage of\nAnnualized Rent\nat Expiration\nAvailable 1,097,547 18% Month-to-Month 555 56,214 1% $17,836,114 3% $18,047,234 2% 2018 2,249 554,759 10% 133,521,351 20% 136,908,269 18% 2019 1,352 485,080 9% 83,799,237 12% 86,330,774 12% 2020 1,314 483,807 9% 64,655,451 10% 67,967,365 9% 2021 607 499,613 9% 78,682,720 12% 89,013,555 12% 2022 222 538,570 9% 45,783,999 7% 62,049,815 8% 2023 78 162,285 3% 19,934,650 3% 27,242,178 4% 2024 39 223,937 4% 30,482,675 5% 39,275,747 5% 2025 39 178,710 3% 26,985,449 4% 31,523,317 4% 2026 26 577,649 10% 74,754,446 11% 81,745,331 11% 2027 16 396,494 7% 45,812,150 7% 59,126,790 8% 2028 - Thereafter 14 462,036 8% 40,173,329 6% 49,029,966 7% Total 6,511 5,716,701 100% $662,421,571 100% $748,260,341 100% (a) Leases that were auto-renewed prior to December 31, 2017 are shown in the calendar year in which their current auto-renewed term expires.
