    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - SandRidge Energy Inc said on Thursday its chief executive and finance chief are leaving so the U.S. shale producer can pursue a new corporate strategy.\nThe exits are a victory for activist investor Carl Icahn, the company’s largest shareholder, who had blasted for months what he considered management’s ineptitude.\nJames Bennett, who led the company into and out of bankruptcy as CEO, is leaving as of Thursday. Julien Bott, the finance chief, will leave as soon as the company’s annual report is filed with U.S. regulators, SandRidge’s board said in a statement.\nIcahn was not immediately available to comment.
