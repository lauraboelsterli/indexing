    "text": "Reported net income of $211.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $154.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017 Financial flexibility with approximately $932 million of cash at December 31, 2017 Captured annualized $89 million of synergies related to the Alon USA Energy transaction through fourth quarter 2017 Increased regular quarterly dividend by 33 percent to $0.20 per share Repurchased approximately $119.0 million of Delek US shares since November 2017 Approved a new $150.0 million share repurchase authorization Announces $315 million drop down of Big Spring refinery logistics assets to Delek Logistics Announced logistics joint venture to acquire two light products terminals Closed Alon USA Partners LP transaction on February 7, 2018, simplifying corporate structure\nBRENTWOOD, Tenn., Delek US Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:DK) (“Delek US”) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Delek US reported fourth quarter net income of $211.1 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, versus net income of $44.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. On an adjusted basis, Delek US reported net income of $40.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which primarily excludes $166.9 million, or $2.02 per share, related to an income tax benefit from remeasuring certain net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This compares to an adjusted net loss of $(27.9) million, or $(0.45) per basic share on an adjusted basis in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\") was $154.0 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(10.4) million in the prior year period. Reconciliations of net income (loss) reported under U.S. GAAP to adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA are included in the financial tables attached to this release.\nOn a year-over-year basis, during the fourth quarter, improved results were primarily driven by the refining segment. The refining segment contribution margin was $185.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to a contribution margin of $13.2 million in the prior year period. The combination of the contribution from the Alon USA refineries acquired on July 1, 2017, a higher crack spread environment and an increased Midland WTI to Brent crude oil price discount were factors in the year-over-year increase. The logistics segment contribution margin improved to $32.7 million during the quarter compared to $27.1 million in the prior year period. The retail segment contribution margin was $13.3 million, which related to the retail business acquired on July 1, 2017 and does not have comparable prior year period results.\nFor the full year 2017, Delek US reported net income of $288.8 million, or $4.00 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $(153.7) million, or $(2.49) per basic share in 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income was $90.4 million, or $1.26 per diluted share in 2017, compared to a net loss of $(103.3) million, or $(1.68) per basic share in 2016. This change in the adjusted results on a year-over-year basis was primarily due to contribution from the Alon USA operations acquired on July 1, 2017, a higher Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread that averaged $13.01 per barrel in 2017 compared to $9.19 per barrel in 2016 and an increased Midland WTI to Brent crude oil price discount during 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $409.9 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(4.8) million in the prior year period.\nUzi Yemin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek US, stated, \"2017 was a great year for the company as we doubled in size, increased our presence in the Permian Basin and had a strong finish to the year. Progress was made on several fronts as our team focused on initiatives to unlock value. We believe integration of Delek and Alon has been successful so far and approximately $89 million of annualized synergies have been captured from the Alon transaction through the fourth quarter 2017, which surpasses the low end of our previously estimated range. We now expect to capture total annualized synergies of $105 million to $120 million in 2018. To further simplify our corporate structure, we completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding units of Alon USA Partners on February 7. In our logistics segment, a new proposed joint venture was announced in February by Delek Logistics and Green Plains Partners to purchase two light products terminals, which should provide future growth.\"\nYemin concluded, \"We ended the quarter with approximately $932 million of cash. During February, we made progress toward divesting non-core West Coast assets with the announced agreement to sell several asphalt terminals. In addition, the $315 million drop down of the logistics assets at the Big Spring refinery is expected to close in March with an effective date of March 1, providing additional growth to Delek Logistics. We have been focused on returning cash to shareholders through our capital allocation program and we repurchased approximately $119 million of shares from November 2017 to the end of February 23, 2018. Returning cash to shareholders is expected to remain a central theme of our capital allocation program. To support this program, our Board of Directors approved a 33 percent increase in the regular quarterly dividend and a new $150 million share repurchase authorization.\"\nBig Spring Logistics Assets Drop Down\nDelek US and Delek Logistics entered into a definitive agreement whereby Delek Logistics would acquire the Big Spring logistics assets, subject to customary closing conditions. These assets consist of storage tanks and terminals that support Delek US' Big Spring, Texas refinery. In addition, a new marketing agreement will be entered into between the companies for product sales from Big Spring. The expected annual EBITDA of this transaction is approximately $40.2 million and the purchase price is approximately $315.0 million in cash, which equates to a 7.8x EBITDA multiple. This dropdown is expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on the revolving credit facility and is expected to close in March with an effective date of March 1, 2018. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to Delek US Holdings.\nAlon USA Partners LP Transaction\nOn February 7, 2018, Delek US and Alon USA Partners LP (NYSE:ALDW) (\"Alon Partners\") closed the announced transaction, under which Delek US acquired all of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests of Alon Partners that Delek US and its affiliates did not already own in an all-stock for common units merger transaction. Delek US and its affiliates owned approximately 51.0 million common units of Alon Partners, or approximately 81.6% of the outstanding units immediately prior to the transaction date. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the owners of the outstanding common units in Alon Partners that Delek US and its affiliates did not currently own immediately prior to the transaction date received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.49 shares of Delek US common stock for each common unit of Alon Partners.\nSynergies Update\nThrough the fourth quarter 2017, Delek US captured approximately $89.0 million of annualized synergies from the Alon USA acquisition. Delek US is targeting total annualized synergies from the acquisition of Alon USA of $105.0 million to $120.0 million with a midpoint of $112.5 million. This is an increase from the previous range of $85.0 million to $105.0 million. These synergies are expected to be captured during 2018, with 2019 being the first full year of benefit.\nAsset Divestitures\nDelek US is exploring several potential initiatives relating to the California assets acquired in the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017, which it considers non-core to its geographic footprint. The Long Beach and Paramount, California assets, including the Alt Air renewable fuels plant, have been presented as discontinued operations since July 1, 2017. In addition, different options were being evaluated for the West Coast asphalt terminals. The following highlights the asphalt transaction that was announced during the first quarter 2018.\nOn February 12, 2018, a definitive agreement to sell the West Coast asphalt terminals was reached with an affiliate of Andeavor for $75.0 million in cash plus a working capital adjustment. This transaction includes asphalt terminal assets in Bakersfield, Mojave and Elk Grove, California and Phoenix, Arizona, as well as Delek’s 50 percent equity interest in the Paramount-Nevada Asphalt Company, LLC joint venture that operates an asphalt terminal located in Fernley, Nevada. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nLogistics Joint Venture Formation and Terminal Acquisition\nOn February 20, 2018, Delek Logistics and Green Plains Partners LP (NASDAQ:GPP) announced the formation of a joint venture and agreement to acquire two light products terminals from affiliates of American Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:AMID). These light products terminals are located in Caddo Mills, Texas and North Little Rock, Arkansas. The total purchase price for these assets is $138.5 million in cash. Subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, this transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. The 50/50 joint venture is expected to consist of the assets purchased from an affiliate of American Midstream and assets contributed by Delek Logistics. At closing, Delek Logistics is expected to contribute its North Little Rock, Arkansas terminal and its Greenville tank farm located in Caddo Mills, Texas, which will be valued at $24.0 million, along with approximately $57.25 million in cash to the joint venture. Taking into consideration the combination of the assets, synergies and future growth, the joint venture is expected to generate an annualized EBITDA of approximately $19.2 million in 2019. Green Plains Partners will contribute approximately $81.25 million in cash to the joint venture. The operator of the joint venture will be Delek Logistics.\nRegular Quarterly Dividend and Share Repurchase\nDelek US announced today that its Board of Directors had declared its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. Shareholders of record on March 12, 2018 will receive this cash dividend payable on March 26, 2018. This represents a 33 percent increase to the previous regular quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, Delek US repurchased approximately 763,000 shares for $25.0 million, or an average price of $32.78 per share, under the $150.0 million share repurchase authorization. This amount, which was repurchased during December 2017, represents the year-to-date amount for 2017. There was approximately $125.0 million remaining on the share repurchase authorization at December 31, 2017.\nDuring January 1, 2018 through February 23, 2018, approximately 2.5 million shares were repurchased for $93.8 million, or an average price of $37.11 per share. At the end of February 2018, there was approximately $31.2 million remaining under the existing $150.0 million share repurchase authorization. The Board of Directors has approved a new $150.0 million share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date. Including the remaining amount on previously approved authorization, Delek US has $181.2 million of total available authorization to repurchase shares.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, Delek US had a cash balance of $931.8 million and total consolidated debt of $1,465.6 million, resulting in net debt of $533.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, Delek US' subsidiary, Delek Logistics, had $422.6 million of total debt and $4.7 million of cash, which is included in the consolidated amounts on Delek US' balance sheet. Excluding Delek Logistics, Delek US had approximately $927.1 million in cash and $1,043.0 million of debt, or a $115.9 million net debt position.\nRefining Segment\nRefining segment contribution margin was $185.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $13.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016. On a year-over-year basis, results benefited from a higher crack spread environment, wider discount between Midland WTI crude oil and Brent crude oil and the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries acquired in the Alon USA transaction that closed on July 1, 2017. The Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread increased to $14.66 per barrel for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $9.33 per barrel for the same period in 2016.\nRINs expense related to renewable fuels blending obligations increased to approximately $25.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $10.0 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to the addition of the Krotz Springs and Big Spring refineries.\nDuring the fourth quarter the Midland WTI crude oil differential to Brent crude oil was an average discount of $5.95 per barrel compared to $1.63 per barrel in the prior year period. The Midland WTI crude oil differential to Cushing WTI was an average discount of $0.28 per barrel in fourth quarter 2017 compared to an average discount of $0.24 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2016. Contango in the oil futures market decreased to $0.39 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to contango of $0.89 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2016.\nLogistics Segment\nThe logistics segment contribution margin in the fourth quarter 2017 increased to $32.7 million compared to $27.1 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The primary factors that increased contribution margin were a higher gross margin per barrel in west Texas and improved performance from the Paline Pipeline, which were partially offset by the effect of lower volume in the SALA Gathering System and higher operating expenses on a year-over-year basis.\nRetail Segment\nAs a result of the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017, Delek US acquired approximately 300 stores operating primarily in west Texas and New Mexico. For the fourth quarter 2017, net sales for the retail segment were $212.8 million and contribution margin was $13.3 million. Merchandise sales were approximately $84.2 million with an average retail margin of 31.5% and approximately 53.2 million retail fuel gallons were sold at an average margin of $0.17 per gallon. Operating expenses for the retail segment were $23.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017.\nCorporate/Other Segment\nContribution margin from the Corporate/Other segment was $(17.5) million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $(23.4) million in the prior year period. This segment includes the asphalt business acquired in the Alon USA transaction on July 1, 2017. Also, effective July 1, 2017, Delek US revised the structure of its internal financial information, which resulted in a change in the composition of our reportable segments. As a result of these changes, the results of hedging activity previously reported in the refining segment that was not specific to a refinery location is now included in our corporate, other and eliminations segment. Prior year period results include this change. The net hedging loss in the fourth quarter 2017 was $5.9 million compared to a net hedging loss of $16.8 million in the prior year period.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results | Conference Call Information\nDelek US will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Central Time.

These non-GAAP measures include adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and adjusted EBITDA. Delek US believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures reflects operating results that are more indicative of Delek US' ongoing operating performance while improving comparability to prior periods, and, as such, may provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the Company's past financial performance and prospects for the future. Adjusted income or loss, adjusted net income or loss per share EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income or loss, net income or loss per share, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, because adjusted net income or loss, adjusted net income or loss per share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, Delek US' definition may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. See the accompanying tables in this earnings release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nDelek US Holdings, Inc.

Delek US believes that the presentation of adjusted measures provides useful information to investors in assessing its results of operations at each refinery. Because adjusted refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, Delek US' definition may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. (7) Tyler adjusted refining margins exclude the following items. Net inventory valuation benefit - There was approximately $14.8 million and $7.9 million of valuation benefit in the fourth quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. There was approximately $14.5 million valuation and $33.9 million of valuation benefit in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
