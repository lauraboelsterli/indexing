The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). We recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016. (2) As of December 31, 2017, we had granted RSUs and LTIP Units to certain employees, officers, and trustees. RSUs and LTIP Units contain service and market-based vesting components. If the market-based vesting component of these awards was measured as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, 673 and 1,027 common shares would be issued, respectively. These awards are anti-dilutive to GAAP EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and are dilutive to GAAP EPS for all other periods presented. Using a weighted average basis, 1,027 common shares are reflected in diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and 1,004 and 1,294 common shares are reflected in diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The redemption payment occurred on May 16, 2016 (the first business day following the redemption date). We recorded $9.6 million related to the excess fair value of consideration paid over the carrying value of the preferred shares as a reduction to net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2016. (2) Transition related expenses are primarily related to the shareholder-approved liability for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by Related/Corvex beginning in February 2013 in connection with their consent solicitations to remove the former Trustees, elect the new Board of Trustees and engage in related litigation. No transition related expenses were incurred during 2017. There is no future obligation to pay any amounts to Related/Corvex under the shareholder-approved agreement. (3) As of December 31, 2017, we had granted RSUs and LTIP Units to certain employees, officers, and trustees. RSUs and LTIP Units contain service and market-based vesting components. If the market-based vesting component of these awards was measured as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, 673 and 1,027 common shares would be issued, respectively. Using a weighted average basis, our calculations of FFO and Normalized FFO attributable to EQC common shareholders and unitholders per share and unit - basic for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 include 43 and 38 LTIP Units, respectively, that are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per common share attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders (only) . Using a weighted average basis, 596 and 1,027 common shares are reflected in diluted FFO and Normalized FFO attributable to EQC common shareholders and unitholders per share and unit - diluted for three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and 966 and 1,294 common shares are reflected in FFO and Normalized FFO attributable to EQC common shareholders and unitholders per share and unit - diluted for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period. FFO and Normalized FFO are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities. We believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.

NOI is income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. Cash Basis NOI is NOI excluding the effects of straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, and lease termination fees. The quarter-to-date same property versions of these measures include the results of properties continuously owned from October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The year-to-date same property versions of these measures include the results of properties continuously owned from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017. Land parcels and properties classified as held for sale within our condensed consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the same property versions of these measures. We consider these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income (loss) because they help to understand the operations of our properties. We use these measures internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that they provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. Cash Basis NOI is among the factors considered with respect to acquisition, disposition and financing decisions. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income (loss) or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders, operating income (loss) and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate these measures differently than we do.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214006300/en/\nEquity Commonwealth\nSarah Byrnes, Investor Relations\n(312) 646-2801\nir@eqcre.com\nSource: Equity Commonwealth",
