    "text": "February 21, 2018 / 3:20 PM / in an hour U.S. top court refuses to widen whistleblower protections Andrew Chung 1 Min Read WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to broaden protections for corporate insiders who call out misconduct, throwing out a lawsuit brought against a real estate trust by a former employee who had reported alleged wrongdoing internally but not to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The justices ruled 9-0 in favor of Digital Realty Trust Inc , deciding that the Dodd-Frank Act, a 2010 Wall Street reform law, protects whistleblowers from retaliation only if they have brought their claims of securities law violations directly to the SEC.
