    "text": "TEANECK, N.J., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (Nasdaq: CTSH), one of the world's leading professional services companies, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nHighlights - Fourth Quarter 2017\nQuarterly revenue rose to $3.83 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly GAAP diluted EPS was $(0.03), compared to $0.68 in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly non-GAAP diluted EPS 1 was $1.03, compared to $0.87 in the year-ago quarter.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 rose to $3.83 billion, up 10.6% from $3.46 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net loss was $(18) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $416 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. 2017 GAAP net loss included a one-time incremental income tax expense of $617 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\"). Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.03, compared to $0.87 in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP operating margin was 17.2% and non-GAAP operating margin 1 was 19.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Reform Act, which significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other provisions, reducing the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018 and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\n1 Non-GAAP diluted EPS and non-GAAP operating margin exclude stock-based compensation costs, acquisition-related charges, realignment charges and, in the case of non-GAAP diluted EPS, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, the effect of recognition of an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements related to a specific uncertain tax position (for the year ended December 31, 2017), the effect of incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act (for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017) and the effect of incremental income tax expense related to the India cash remittance transaction (for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016). Reconciliations of non-GAAP diluted EPS and non-GAAP operating margin to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of this release.\nDuring the quarter we recorded a one-time provisional income tax expense of $617 million related to the Tax Reform Act, which reduced our GAAP diluted EPS by $1.04 during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. This one-time expense was primarily attributable to the deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We expect our overall effective corporate income tax rate to be approximately 24% for 2018 and 24-26% beginning in 2019.\n\"Consistent and solid execution throughout 2017, along with continued investments to further accelerate the shift to digital during the year, gives us confidence that we can deliver a strong 2018,\" said Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer. \"As companies that are already leaders in their industries integrate their domain knowledge with today's tremendously powerful technologies like artificial intelligence, analytics and cloud, we see a new generation of digital heavyweights emerging. Cognizant is resolved to be the go-to partner to these digital-industrial leaders and also to our fast-growing digital-native clients.\"\nHighlights - Full Year 2017\nRevenue increased to $14.81 billion, up 9.8% from 2016. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.53, compared to $2.55 in 2016. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.77, compared to $3.39 in 2016.\nRevenue for 2017 increased to $14.81 billion, up 9.8% from $13.49 billion for 2016. GAAP net income for 2017 was $1.50 billion, or $2.53 per diluted share, compared to $1.55 billion, or $2.55 per diluted share, for 2016. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.77 in 2017, compared to $3.39 in 2016. GAAP operating margin was 16.8% and non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7% for 2017.\nFirst Quarter & Full Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company is providing the following guidance:\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue expected to be in the range of $3.88 billion to $3.92 billion. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS 2 expected to be at least $1.04. Full year 2018 revenue expected to be in the range of $16.00 billion to $16.30 billion. Full year 2018 non-GAAP diluted EPS expected to be at least $4.53.\n2 A full reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS guidance on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to acquisition-related charges, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, the tax effects of these adjustments, the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense, and any future adjustments to the provision for income taxes as a result of the implementation of the Tax Reform Act, all of which are adjustments to non-GAAP diluted EPS. The reconciling information for non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP EPS guidance that is available without unreasonable efforts is included at the end of this release.\n\"Our full year 2017 results reflect the successful on-going execution of our long-term strategy, which is expected to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, while ensuring we maintain our ability to invest in the business and our financial strength and flexibility,\" said Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. \"Additionally, today we announced a substantial increase in our quarterly dividend. We are also evaluating the longer term impact the new U.S. tax legislation may have on our capital return program.\"\nReturn of Capital Program - Dividend\nThe Company has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on Cognizant Class A Common Stock for shareholders of record at the close of business on February 22, 2018. This dividend will be payable on February 28, 2018. The Company expects to repurchase $1.2 billion of shares by the end of 2018, including the $300 million Accelerated Share Repurchase commenced in December 2017.\nConference Call\nCognizant will host a conference call on February 7, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern) to discuss the Company's fourth quarter 2017 results.

These statements include, but are not limited to, express or implied relating to our expectations regarding opportunities in the marketplace, our shift to digital solutions and services, our anticipated financial performance, our anticipated effective income tax rates, and our capital return and realignment programs. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these . Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these , which speak only as of the date hereof. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially or implied include general economic conditions, changes in the regulatory environment, including with respect to immigration and taxes, and the other factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes references to the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (\"non-GAAP diluted EPS\"). These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of Cognizant's non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.\nWe seek to manage the Company to a non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation costs, acquisition-related charges and, in 2017, realignment charges. Acquisition-related charges include, when applicable, amortization of purchased intangible assets included in the depreciation and amortization expense line on our consolidated statements of operations, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs. Realignment charges include severance costs, lease termination costs, and advisory fees related to non-routine shareholder matters and to the development of our realignment and return of capital programs, as applicable. Further, in 2018, we expect to adjust our non-GAAP operating margin for the anticipated expense associated with the initial funding of Cognizant U.S. Foundation. In addition to excluding the above items, our non-GAAP diluted EPS also excludes (i) net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses, inclusive of gains and losses on related foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2017, the effect of recognition of an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements, (iii) for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the effect of incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act, and (iv) for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, the effect of incremental income tax expense related to the India cash remittance transaction. In all periods presented, our non-GAAP diluted EPS is additionally adjusted for the income tax impact of the above pre-tax items, as applicable. The income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.\nManagement believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how it manages the Company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the Company. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using non-GAAP measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are recurring, namely stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, including amortization of purchased intangibles, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.\n- tables to follow -\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\n$\n3,828\n$\n3,462\n$\n14,810\n$\n13,487\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense\nshown separately below)\n2,360\n2,078\n9,152\n8,108\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n700\n730\n2,769\n2,731\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n111\n93\n408\n359\nIncome from operations\n657\n561\n2,481\n2,289\nOther income (expense), net:\nInterest income\n36\n29\n133\n115\nInterest expense\n(5)\n(4)\n(23)\n(19)\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses), net\n26\n(26)\n67\n(30)\nOther, net\n(1)\n—\n(3)\n2\nTotal other income (expense), net\n56\n(1)\n174\n68\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n713\n560\n2,655\n2,357\nProvision for income taxes\n(732)\n(144)\n(1,153)\n(805)\nIncome from equity method investments\n1\n—\n2\n1\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(18)\n$\n416\n$\n1,504\n$\n1,553\nBasic (loss) earnings per share\n$\n(0.03)\n$\n0.69\n$\n2.54\n$\n2.56\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share\n$\n(0.03)\n$\n0.68\n$\n2.53\n$\n2.55\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding -

We cannot provide the tax effect of stock-based compensation on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort as it is subject to significant fluctuations based on the timing and number of stock options exercised by employees, the price of our stock at the time of such exercises and the price of our stock at the time of vesting of other stock-based awards.\n(b)\nAcquisition-related charges include, when applicable, amortization of purchased intangible assets included in the depreciation and amortization expense line on our consolidated statements of operations, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs. We cannot provide acquisition-related charges on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort as such charges may fluctuate based on the timing, size, and complexity of future acquisitions as well as other uncertainty inherent in mergers and acquisitions.\n(c)\nRealignment charges include severance costs, including costs associated with the voluntary separation program, or VSP, lease termination costs, and advisory fees related to non-routine shareholder matters and to the development of our realignment and return of capital programs, as applicable. The total costs related to the realignment are reported in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated statements of operations. We believe we have incurred most of the costs related to our realignment program in 2017. However, as we continue to evaluate our realignment program, additional expenses may arise in 2018. We cannot provide realignment charges on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort as the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain.\n(d)\nNon-operating foreign currency exchange gains are inclusive of gains and losses on related foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, reported in \"Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net\" in our consolidated statements of operations. Non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses are subject to high variability and low visibility and therefore cannot be provided on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts.\n(e)\nPresented below are the tax impacts of each of our non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNon-GAAP income tax benefit (expense) related to:\nStock-based compensation expense\n$\n41\n$\n12\n$\n101\n$\n49\nAcquisition-related charges\n13\n12\n48\n46\nRealignment charges\n1\n—\n25\n—\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses)\n6\n2\n10\n5\nThe effective tax rate related to each of our non-GAAP adjustments varies depending on the jurisdictions in which such income and expenses are generated and the statutory rates applicable in those jurisdictions.\n(f)\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized an income tax benefit previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements related to a specific uncertain tax position of $55 million. The recognition of the benefit in the first quarter of 2017 was based on management's reassessment regarding whether this unrecognized tax benefit met the more-likely-than-not threshold in light of the lapse in the statute of limitations as to a portion of such benefit.\n(g)\nOn December 22, 2017 the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Reform Act, was signed into law. In connection with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, we recorded a one-time provisional net income tax expense of $617 million comprised of: (i) the one-time transitional tax expense on accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of $635 million, (ii) foreign and U.S. state income tax expense that will be applicable upon repatriation of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, other than our Indian subsidiaries, of $53 million, partially offset by (iii) an income tax benefit of $71 million resulting from the revaluation of U.S. net deferred income tax liabilities to the new lower U.S. income tax rate. The one-time incremental income tax expense reflects certain assumptions based upon our interpretation of the Tax Reform Act as of January 18, 2018 and may change, possibly materially, as we receive additional clarification and guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Reform Act evolves over time. Any additional changes would be reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment in the period in which they are recorded. However, such amounts cannot be provided on a forward looking basis without unreasonable effort.\n(h)\nIn May 2016, our principal operating subsidiary in India repurchased shares from its shareholders, which are non-Indian Cognizant entities, valued at $2.8 billion. As a result of this transaction, we incurred an incremental income tax expense of $238 million in the year ended December 31 2016, of which $24 million was incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\n(i)\nIn 2018, we intend to set up and provide $100 million of initial funding to Cognizant U.S. Foundation. We expect to exclude from our non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share the expense associated with the initial funding in the period in which it is recorded. We anticipate the expense will reduce GAAP operating margin by approximately 60 basis points and GAAP diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.12 per share (after the associated income tax benefit of approximately $0.05 per share).\nThe above tables serve to reconcile the Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to the \"About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of our press release for further information on the use of these Non-GAAP measures.\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nSchedule of Supplemental Information\n(Unaudited)\n(dollars in millions)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\n% Change\n$\n% of total\nSequential\nYear over\nYear\nRevenues by Segment:\nFinancial Services\n$\n1,427\n37.3\n%\n—\n%\n5.4\n%\nHealthcare\n1,125\n29.4\n%\n3.7\n%\n11.9\n%\nProducts and Resources (a)\n782\n20.4\n%\n1.0\n%\n13.7\n%\nCommunications, Media and Technology (b)\n494\n12.9\n%\n2.9\n%\n19.0\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n3,828\n1.6\n%\n10.6\n%\nRevenues by Geography:\nNorth America\n$\n2,947\n77.0\n%\n1.9\n%\n8.5\n%\nUnited Kingdom\n287\n7.5\n%\n(4.7)\n%\n5.1\n%\nRest of Europe\n345\n9.0\n%\n5.5\n%\n31.7\n%\nEurope - Total\n632\n16.5\n%\n0.6\n%\n18.1\n%\nRest of World\n249\n6.5\n%\n0.8\n%\n17.5\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n3,828\n1.6\n%\n10.6\n%\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n% Change\n$\n% of total\nYear over\nYear\nRevenues by Segment:\nFinancial Services\n$\n5,636\n38.1\n%\n5.0\n%\nHealthcare\n4,263\n28.8\n%\n10.1\n%\nProducts and Resources (a)\n3,040\n20.5\n%\n14.3\n%\nCommunications, Media and Technology (b)\n1,871\n12.6\n%\n17.7\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n14,810\n9.8\n%\nRevenues by Geography:\nNorth America\n$\n11,450\n77.3\n%\n8.6\n%\nUnited Kingdom\n1,150\n7.8\n%\n(2.2)\n%\nRest of Europe\n1,248\n8.4\n%\n28.8\n%\nEurope - Total\n2,398\n16.2\n%\n11.8\n%\nRest of World\n962\n6.5\n%\n20.9\n%\nTotal Revenues\n$\n14,810\n9.8\n%\nEmployee Metrics:\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNumber of employees\n260,000\n256,100\n260,200\nNotes:\n(a)\nPreviously referred to as Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics.\n(b)\nPreviously referred to as Other.\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Unaudited)\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(18)\n$\n416\n$\n1,504\n$\n1,553\nAdjustments for non-cash income and expenses\n318\n145\n717\n563\nChanges in assets and liabilities\n536\n43\n186\n(471)\nNet cash provided by operating activities (a)\n836\n604\n2,407\n1,645\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(80)\n(87)\n(284)\n(300)\nNet sales (purchases) of investments\n64\n146\n(82)\n(329)\nPayments for business combinations, net of cash acquired\n(144)\n(149)\n(216)\n(334)\nNet cash (used in) investing activities\n(160)\n(90)\n(582)\n(963)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nRepurchases of common stock\n(332)\n(20)\n(1,889)\n(512)\nNet change in borrowings and capital lease obligations\n42\n(16)\n(20)\n(407)\nDividends paid\n(86)\n—\n(265)\n—\nIssuance of common stock under stock-based compensation plans\n43\n41\n189\n176\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (a)\n(333)\n5\n(1,985)\n(743)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n5\n(35)\n51\n(30)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n348\n484\n(109)\n(91)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of year\n1,577\n1,550\n2,034\n2,125\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n$\n1,925\n$\n2,034\n$\n1,925\n$\n2,034\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nStock Repurchases under Board of Directors' authorized stock\nrepurchase program:\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nShares repurchased (b)\n3.6\n2.2\n—\nRemaining authorized balance\n$ 1,700\nNotes:\n(a)\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an update to the standard on stock compensation, which among other things, changed the classification of the excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the statement of cash flows to cash flows from operating activities. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2017 and conformed prior year presentation. This resulted in a $5 million reduction in net cash used in financing activities and a $5 million increase in the net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and a $24 million reduction in net cash used in financing activities and a $24 million increase in the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(b)\nIn December 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, or the ASR, with a financial institution under our stock repurchase program. Under the terms of the December ASR and in exchange for up-front payment of $300 million, the financial institution initially delivered 3.6 million shares, a portion of the Company's total expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period under the ASR based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock during that period. The December ASR purchase period is scheduled to end during the first quarter of 2018.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cognizant-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300594744.html\nSOURCE Cognizant",
