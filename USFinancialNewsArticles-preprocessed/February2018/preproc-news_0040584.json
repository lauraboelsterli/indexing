    "text": "Jaroslav Halak made a career-high 50 saves as the New York Islanders continued their recent mastery of the New York Rangers with a 3-0 victory Thursday night at Barclays Center.\nHalak made 15 saves in the first, 14 in the second and 21 in the third en route to his first shutout since April 6 at Carolina. Halak posted his 42nd career regular-season shutout and third against the Rangers.\nThe Islanders beat the Rangers for the 10th time in the last 11 meetings by scoring a goal in each period and getting three assists from rookie Matthew Barzal, who leads all first-year players with 46 assists and 62 points. Barzal has nine points in three meetings with the Rangers and recorded his fourth game with at least three assists.\nJosh Bailey scored a power-play goal, Jordan Eberle tallied in the second period and defenseman Thomas Hickey netted the third goal as the Islanders improved to 3-5-1 in their last nine games.\nHenrik Lundqvist made 32 saves and fell to 1-8-2 in his last 11 games against the Islanders.\nThe Rangers lost for the ninth time in 12 games and were blanked for the third time this season despite setting a season high for shots on goal and finishing with at least 50 shots on goal for the first time since Jan. 4, 2014 against Toronto.\nThe Islanders took a 1-0 lead 11 seconds into their first power play.\nJohn Tavares won a faceoff and nine seconds later Bailey lifted a rising wrist shot from the left faceoff circle over Lundqvist’s glove with 15:07 remaining.\nThe Islanders doubled their lead with 4:54 left in the second by completing some strong puck movement.\nShortly after nearly scoring off a scramble, Barzal brought the puck back up ice and fed Leddy, who made a cross-ice pass from the left wing to Eberle in the right circle and he lifted a shot past Lundqvist to reach 20 goals for the fifth straight season and sixth time overall.\nThe lead reached 3-0 3:57 into the third when Hickey’s backhanded pass from the net intended for Cal Clutterbuck went off the skate of Rangers center David Desharnais and trickled under Lundqvist.\nWith 13:05 remaining in the third, a goal by Desharnais was overturned by review due to a distinct kicking motion.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
