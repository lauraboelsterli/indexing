    "text": "Chipotle Mexican Grill is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Tuesday.\nThe burrito chain is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share on $1.12 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.\nChipotle has struggled to regain customer confidence since a series of food-borne illness outbreaks caused diners to flee the restaurant chain two years ago. While the company was able to return to profitability last year, investors and consumers still worry that its trouble is not behind it.\nIn a note to investors last week, UBS analyst Dennis Geiger said that customer review scores of the restaurant have continued to decline and are now below what they were during Chipotle's food safety crisis in 2015.\nWall Street currently expects the company will post same-store sales growth of about 0.8 percent for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.",
