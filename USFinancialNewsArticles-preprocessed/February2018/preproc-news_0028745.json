The performance was fantastic,” Pochettino said. “The team played so well. The first 25-30 minutes of the second half we played amazing football and created a lot of chances. \n“I am very pleased with our players. We have to keep going. \nThe Spurs boss added: ”It is important for the belief of the team (to take seven points in those three games). Football is about trust, confidence and belief. Another clean sheet is good. \n“I am so pleased because this was a key period to fight for the top four. The Champions League is a competition that excites us and the fans.” Writing by Pete Hall,; Editing by Neville Dalton",
