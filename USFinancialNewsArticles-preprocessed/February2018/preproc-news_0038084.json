    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) today reported results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year, including all-time quarterly and annual highs in revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\").\n\"I'm very pleased to report that CBS turned in outstanding fourth-quarter results, including double-digit revenue growth and our 32 nd consecutive quarter of EPS growth, capping off a very strong year in 2017,\" said Leslie Moonves, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, CBS Corporation. \"The CBS Corporation produces many of the most-valuable programming franchises in the world, reaching more viewers than anyone else. This gives us a tremendous advantage as streaming becomes more central to our distribution strategy. As a result, we now have nearly five million subscribers at CBS All Access and Showtime OTT combined. When you add this to our retrans and skinny bundle subscribers, our total subscriber base continues to grow at an accelerated pace. With the backdrop of this changing business model, and the completed separation of our radio business during the fourth quarter, we now have even greater visibility into our operations. Specifically, we expect 2018 to be another strong year for the CBS Corporation, with revenue growth in the high-single digits and EPS growth in the high teens from the record $4.40 we're reporting to you today. So we feel very good about the growth path before us, and we continue to have great confidence in our ability to deliver for our shareholders.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 11% to a record $3.92 billion from $3.52 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. Content licensing and distribution revenues grew 33%, driven by strong growth from both domestic and international licensing sales. Affiliate and subscription fee revenues were up 20%, led by 31% growth in retransmission revenues and fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations as well as growth from digital initiatives, including the Company's owned streaming subscription services. Advertising revenues decreased 3% due to record political advertising sales in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $343 million compared with $484 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income of $739 million increased 1% despite significantly lower high-margin political advertising sales and an increased investment in programming, including for the Company's digital growth initiatives. Adjusted operating income excludes restructuring charges and charges associated with pension derisking activities during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nNet earnings from continuing operations were $40 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $271 million for the same quarter last year. Comparability was affected by several discrete items, including the aforementioned charges and a charge of $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the enactment of federal tax legislation. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $455 million increased 6% from $428 million, driven by the higher adjusted operating income and a lower effective income tax rate in 2017 compared with the prior year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $41 million compared with a net loss of $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The results of CBS Radio Inc. (\"CBS Radio\") have been included in discontinued operations through the date of its disposition. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the results included a noncash loss recognized in connection with the split-off of CBS Radio, and for the fourth quarter of 2016, the results included an impairment charge at CBS Radio. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 1% to $473 million from $476 million for the same prior-year period.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $.10 compared with $.63 for the same quarter in 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 8% to $1.20 from $1.11, driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the shares retired in connection with the split-off of CBS Radio and the Company's share repurchase program.\nDetails of the discrete items excluded from financial results and reconciliations of adjusted results to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this earnings release.\nSplit-off of CBS Radio Inc.\nOn November 17, 2017, the Company announced the completion of the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company accepted 17.9 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock from its stockholders in exchange for the 101.4 million shares of CBS Radio common stock that it owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, CBS Radio was combined with a subsidiary of Entercom Communications Corp. (\"Entercom\") in a merger, and each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Class A common stock. CBS Radio has been presented in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nPension Settlement\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company has permanently assumed the Company's obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain of the Company's pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract reduced the Company's outstanding pension benefit obligation by approximately $800 million, representing approximately 20% of the total obligations of the Company's qualified pension plans, and was funded with pension plan assets. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a one-time accounting charge of $352 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a discretionary contribution of $500 million to prefund its qualified plans.\nFree Cash Flow, Balance Sheet and Liquidity\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, operating cash flow from continuing operations was an outflow of $142 million, which included a discretionary contribution of $500 million to prefund the Company's qualified pension plans, compared with an inflow of $337 million for the same prior-year period. For the 2017 full year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $793 million compared with $1.45 billion for 2016. Operating cash flow for the full year 2017 included discretionary contributions of $600 million to prefund the Company's qualified pension plans and for 2016 included CBS's broadcast of Super Bowl 50. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2017 benefited from higher affiliate and subscription fee revenues. Free cash flow was $102 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $252 million for the same prior-year period, and for the 2017 full year it was $989 million compared with $1.26 billion in 2016.\nIn November 2017, the Company issued $400 million of 2.90% senior notes due 2023 and $500 million of 3.70% senior notes due 2028. The Company used the net proceeds from these issuances to redeem its $500 million outstanding 5.75% senior notes due 2020. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the aforementioned fourth quarter contribution to the Company's pension plans and the repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFull year 2017 revenues increased 4% to a record $13.69 billion from $13.17 billion in 2016. The growth was led by 26% higher affiliate and subscription fee revenues, driven by 27% higher retransmission revenues and fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations; Showtime Networks' distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event; and growth from digital initiatives, including the Company's owned streaming subscription services. Content licensing and distribution revenues also contributed to the revenue increase and were up 8%, reflecting growth in international and domestic licensing sales. These increases were partially offset by 9% lower advertising revenues, mainly resulting from the 2016 broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on the CBS Television Network and record political advertising sales in the prior-year period.\nOperating income decreased 8% to $2.42 billion for 2017 from $2.62 billion for 2016. Operating income for both years included charges for pension settlements and restructuring activities which affected comparability. Adjusted operating income decreased 1% to $2.82 billion in 2017 from $2.86 billion in 2016, reflecting a mix of lower-margin revenues in 2017 and an increased investment in programming.\nNet earnings from continuing operations were $1.31 billion for 2017 compared with $1.55 billion for 2016. Comparability was affected by several discrete items, including the aforementioned charges and a charge in 2017 associated with the enactment of federal tax legislation. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 3% to $1.71 billion for 2017 from $1.66 billion mainly reflecting a lower effective income tax rate in 2017.\nNet earnings were $357 million for 2017 compared with $1.26 billion for 2016. Net earnings included the results of CBS Radio through the date of its disposition, which are presented in discontinued operations. For 2017, discontinued operations included a net loss of $105 million from the split-off of CBS Radio and a market value adjustment of $980 million recorded prior to the split-off to reduce the carrying value of CBS Radio, and for 2016 included impairment charges of $444 million ($427 million, net of tax) at CBS Radio. Adjusted net earnings were down 3% to $1.79 billion for 2017 from $1.84 billion for 2016.\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations was $3.22 for 2017 compared with $3.46 for 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS for 2017 was $4.40, up 7% from $4.11 in 2016, benefiting from lower shares outstanding. During 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 34.1 million shares, including the shares retired in connection with the split-off of CBS Radio.\nDetails of the discrete items excluded from financial results, and reconciliations of adjusted results to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are included at the end of this earnings release.\nConsolidated and Segment Results (dollars in millions)\nThe tables below present the Company's revenues by segment and type; operating income (loss) excluding pension settlement charges, restructuring and merger and acquisition-related costs, and other operating items, net, by segment (\"Segment Operating Income\"); and depreciation and amortization by segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and 2016.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nRevenues by Segment\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEntertainment\n$\n2,818\n$\n2,394\n$\n9,164\n$\n8,877\nCable Networks\n547\n501\n2,501\n2,160\nPublishing\n235\n209\n830\n767\nLocal Media\n450\n526\n1,668\n1,779\nCorporate/Eliminations\n(129)\n(112)\n(471)\n(417)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n3,921\n$\n3,518\n$\n13,692\n$\n13,166\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nRevenues by Type\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAdvertising\n$\n1,745\n$\n1,796\n$\n5,753\n$\n6,288\nContent licensing and distribution\n1,191\n893\n3,952\n3,673\nAffiliate and subscription fees\n923\n770\n3,758\n2,978\nOther\n62\n59\n229\n227\nTotal Revenues\n$\n3,921\n$\n3,518\n$\n13,692\n$\n13,166\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEntertainment\n$\n465\n$\n371\n$\n1,554\n$\n1,519\nCable Networks\n201\n219\n996\n959\nPublishing\n44\n36\n132\n119\nLocal Media\n137\n216\n492\n618\nCorporate\n(108)\n(109)\n(355)\n(354)\nAdjusted Operating Income\n739\n733\n2,819\n2,861\nPension settlement charges\n(352)\n(211)\n(352)\n(211)\nRestructuring and merger and acquisition-related costs\n(63)\n(38)\n(63)\n(38)\nOther operating items, net\n19\n—\n19\n9\nTotal Operating Income\n$\n343\n$\n484\n$\n2,423\n$\n2,621\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEntertainment\n$\n30\n$\n29\n$\n115\n$\n117\nCable Networks\n6\n6\n23\n23\nPublishing\n1\n2\n6\n6\nLocal Media\n11\n11\n45\n44\nCorporate\n9\n9\n34\n35\nTotal Depreciation and Amortization\n$\n57\n$\n57\n$\n223\n$\n225\nEntertainment (CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, Network Ten, CBS Interactive, and CBS Films)\nEntertainment revenues of $2.82 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 18% from $2.39 billion for the same prior-year period. This increase was led by 38% growth in content licensing and distribution revenues, driven by strong growth in both domestic and international licensing sales. Affiliate and subscription fees also contributed to the revenue increase and were up 40%, led by higher station affiliation fees and growth from digital initiatives, including CBS All Access and third-party live television streaming offerings. Advertising revenues increased 4% for the quarter, driven by the inclusion of the results of Network Ten, one of three major commercial broadcast networks in Australia, which the Company acquired in mid-November.\nEntertainment operating income of $465 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 25% from $371 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting the revenue growth, which was partially offset by an increased investment in programming, including costs for CBS All Access.\nCable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network, and Smithsonian Networks)\nCable Networks revenues of $547 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9% from $501 million for the same prior-year period, driven by higher revenues from the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering and growth from the licensing of Showtime content.\nCable Networks operating income of $201 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 8% to $219 million for the same prior-year period, reflecting an increased investment in programming.\nPublishing (Simon & Schuster)\nPublishing revenues of $235 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 12% from $209 million for the same prior-year period. This increase was led by higher print book sales and digital audio sales. Bestselling titles for the fourth quarter of 2017 included Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson, Principles by Ray Dalio, and It by Stephen King.\nPublishing operating income of $44 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 22% from $36 million for the same prior-year period, mainly reflecting the higher revenues.\nLocal Media (CBS Television Stations)\nLocal Media revenues of $450 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 14% from $526 million for the same quarter in 2016, which benefited from record political advertising sales. Growth in retransmission revenues partially offset the decline.\nLocal Media operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $137 million decreased 37% from $216 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting the decline in high-margin political advertising sales.\nCorporate\nCorporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 1% to $108 million from $109 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower employee-related costs.\nAbout CBS Corporation\nCBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) is a mass media company that creates and distributes industry-leading content across a variety of platforms to audiences around the world.

in millions)\nAdjusted Operating Income and Segment Operating Income\nThe following tables set forth the Company's Adjusted Operating Income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company defines \"Adjusted Operating Income\" as operating income excluding pension settlement charges, restructuring charges, merger and acquisition-related costs, and other operating items, net, each where applicable. For each individual reportable segment Adjusted Operating Income is also known as \"Segment Operating Income.\" The Company presents Segment Operating Income as the primary measure of profit and loss for its reportable segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance for segment reporting.\nThe Company uses Adjusted Operating Income (or Segment Operating Income for each segment), as well as Adjusted Operating Income Margin, to, among other things, evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of the Company's operational strength and business performance. The Company believes these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, help improve investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance, and make it easier for investors to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. In addition, these are among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and for the comparison of the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry, and to compare the Company's year-over-year results.\nBecause Adjusted Operating Income is a measure of performance not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income or net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. As Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain financial information that is included in operating income and net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.

The Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations. Free cash flow excludes discretionary contributions to prefund the Company's pension plans because management assesses the Company's ability to generate operating cash flows without considering the impact from discretionary pension contributions, and decisions regarding the timing of pension plan funding are not dependent on the level of operating cash flows generated during the period. The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nManagement believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry.\nAs free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

The Company believes that adjusting its financial results for the impact of these items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management; provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company; and makes it easier for investors, analysts, and peers to compare the Company's operating performance to other companies in its industry and to compare the Company's year-over-year results.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nReported\nPension\nSettlement\nCharge (a)\nRestructuring\nCharges (b)\nTax Items (c)\nOther (d)\nDiscontinued\nOperations\nItems (e)\nAdjusted\nRevenues\n$\n3,921\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n3,921\nOperating income\n$\n343\n$\n352\n$\n63\n$\n—\n$\n(19)\n$\n—\n$\n739\nOperating income margin (f)\n9\n%\n19\n%\nInterest expense\n(121)\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(121)\nInterest income\n19\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n19\nLoss on early\nextinguishment of debt\n(44)\n—\n—\n—\n44\n—\n—\nOther items, net\n(11)\n—\n—\n—\n8\n—\n(3)\nEarnings from continuing\noperations before\nincome taxes\n186\n352\n63\n—\n33\n—\n634\nProvision for income taxes\n(154)\n(115)\n(24)\n129\n(23)\n—\n(187)\nEffective income tax rate\n82.8\n%\n29.5\n%\nEquity in loss of investee\ncompanies, net of tax\n8\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n8\nNet earnings from\ncontinuing operations\n40\n237\n39\n129\n10\n—\n455\nNet earnings (loss) from\ndiscontinued operations,\nnet of tax\n(81)\n—\n—\n3\n—\n96\n18\nNet earnings (loss)\n$\n(41)\n$\n237\n$\n39\n$\n132\n$\n10\n$\n96\n$\n473\nDiluted EPS from\ncontinuing operations\n$\n.10\n$\n.60\n$\n.10\n$\n.33\n$\n.03\n$\n—\n$\n1.15\nDiluted EPS\n$\n(.10)\n$\n.60\n$\n.10\n$\n.33\n$\n.03\n$\n.24\n$\n1.20\nDiluted weighted average\nnumber of common\nshares outstanding\n395\n395\n(a) Reflects a pension settlement charge resulting from the transfer of pension obligations to an insurance company through the purchase of a group\nannuity contract.\n(b) Reflects restructuring charges at Entertainment, Publishing, Local Media and Corporate primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations.\n(c) Reflects a net provisional charge resulting from the enactment of federal tax legislation in December 2017.\n(d) Includes a net gain relating to the disposition of property and equipment, a charge for the early extinguishment of debt and the write-down of an\ninvestment to its fair value.\n(e) Reflects a loss on the split-off of CBS Radio and adjustments to the loss on disposal of the Company's Outdoor advertising business.\n(f) Operating income margin is defined as Operating Income or Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenues.\nCBS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)\n(Unaudited;
