    "text": "February 27, 2018 / 4:51 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Roche says hemophilia drug Hemlibra wins EU approval Reuters Staff 1 Min Read ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss group Roche said on Tuesday the European Commission has approved its drug Hemlibra for people with hemophilia A who have developed resistance to standard treatments. The approval was expected after a panel recommended it last month. The drug was already approved in the United States last year. Hemlibra is among the new medicines that the Basel-based pharmaceuticals maker hopes will offset falling sales of its three biggest drugs, Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin. Some analysts expect peak Hemlibra sales of more than $4 billion a year. ‍​",
