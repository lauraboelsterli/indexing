It forecasts further narrowing in the deficit to C$18.1 billion in 2018-19.\nCanada is one of the few countries with an undisputed triple A credit rating. Its bonds are greatly sought after by international investors.\nEven as the government satisfies the liquidity demand of the market it could be missing an opportunity to lock-in historically low long-term yields.\nCanada is not likely to benefit from reduced borrowing costs going forward, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.\nThe Bank of Canada has raised its benchmark interest rate three times since July to 1.25 percent, while money markets expect two further rate hikes this year. Earlier this month, Canada’s 10-year yield touched its highest since May 2014 at about 2.40 percent.\nCuts to benchmark bond target ranges are planned for some maturities, the report said, and there will be fewer 3-year auctions.\nIssuance of ultra-long bonds, those with a term to maturity of more than 40 years, will continue, subject to favorable market conditions, the report added.\nThe government sold these bonds in August, and then again in November, for the first time since November 2014. It had plans to sell further ultra-long bonds in February but decided not to proceed with the issue.\nSeparately, the government announced its intention to remove from circulation the C$1, C$2, C$25, C$500 and C$1,000 notes, which are not widely used.
