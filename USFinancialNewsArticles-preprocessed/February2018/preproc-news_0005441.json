    "text": "AMSTERDAM, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Dutch telecom company KPN on Wednesday reported a lower-than-expected fourth-quarter core profit, as European rules limiting roaming fees for the use of mobile phones abroad took a bite out of earnings.\nKPN said adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 1.7 percent to 596 million euros ($741.4 million). Analysts polled by Reuters on average had predicted profit of 610 million euros. ($1 = 0.8039 euros) (Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Sunil Nair)\n ",
