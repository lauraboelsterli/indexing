    "text": "2017 Fourth-Quarter Results and Full-Year Include:\nDecreased Total Debt to $898.6 million due to Corporate Restructuring Full-Year Net Income of $1,309.0 million Growth in Stockholders’ Equity to $2,208.4 million\nMEXICO CITY, Grupo TMM, S.A.B. (OTC:GTMAY) (BMV:TMM A) (“TMM” or the “Company” ), a Mexican Maritime-management transportation and logistics Company, reported today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nJosé F. Serrano, chairman and chief executive officer of Grupo TMM, said, “Mexican Energy Reform has revitalized the energy industry here, which has benefitted our Maritime division with domestic customers such as Pemex, as well as new participants including ENI México, Fieldwood Energy E&P Mexico and Hornbeck Offshore Services de Mexico. Additionally our Ports and Terminals division has benefitted with the development of storage and transportation infrastructure to serve the demand for oil refined products from Tuxpan to the central region of Mexico. Our improving operations are the result of strengthening core operations, client diversification strategy and cost optimization plans.”\n“Our successful corporate restructuring in December improved the debt profile of the Company while safeguarding bondholders' rights. According to Grupo TMM Shareholders’ authorization, the Company transferred 85 percent of the shares of TMM Division Maritima, formerly a 100 percent subsidiary, to the holders of the Mexican Trust Certificates. Consequently, Grupo TMM deconsolidated the correspondent liabilities, costs and assets. On the other hand, the Company reached an agreement to cancel the previous capitalization program. Importantly, Grupo TMM will continue to operate the Maritime division, and governance, management, corporate organization and structure of the Company will remain unchanged.”\nMr. Serrano concluded, “Grupo TMM remains committed to excellence in service as well as its cost optimization strategies. We believe the continuing recovery of the Mexican and worldwide energy industry will provide opportunities for growth in the near and long terms.”\nFOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2017 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, consolidated revenues increased $163.6 million to $688.9 million compared to $525.3 million in the same period of 2016, primarily attributable to improved results in the Offshore segment of the Maritime division due to gradual recovery of the oil industry, partially offset by a decrease in tugboats revenues due to increased competition at the Manzanillo Port, as well as increased revenue in the Maintenance and Repair segment of the Ports and Terminals division due to diversification of customers. Year over year, full-year 2017 consolidated revenues were $2,464.9 million in 2017 compared to $2,647.5 million in the same period last year. The Company believes the recovery of the oil industry will continue due to the progress of Mexican Energy Reform.\nConsolidated operating results in the 2017 fourth quarter was a loss of $30.2 million compared to income of $63.5 million in the same period last year, mainly due to higher costs in the tankers segment of the Maritime division. For the full year, 2017 operating loss was $75.4 million compared to operating profit of $90.7 million in the same period last year attributable to higher costs and lower transported volume in the tankers segment. Despite its ongoing improvement, the oil industry crisis negatively impacted results in the first part of 2017 and continue to affect the domestic and international markets.\nIn the 2017 fourth quarter, non-recurrent operations’ expenses were $11.7 million compared to $69.3 million in the same period of 2016. In the 2017 full year, non-recurrent operations’ income was $101.8 million compared to $52.9 million in the same period last year. The declines are principally the result of the sales of assets.\nConsolidated EBITDA in the 2017 fourth quarter was $93.5 million compared to $134.6 million in the same period last year. In the 2017 full year EBITDA was $487.5 million compared to $646.0 million for the 2016 period.\nMaritime revenues in the 2017 fourth quarter increased 34.1 percent to $540.0 million compared to the same period the last year attributable to the gradual recovery of the energy industry, mainly in the Offshore segment, where revenues increased 102.1 percent year over year driven by the uninterrupted hires of the Company’s floating storage and production vessel, “Eco III.” For the full year, 2017 revenues were $1,951.3 million compared to $2,167.6 million in 2016.\nFourth-quarter 2017 Maritime operating profit was $9.8 million compared to $139.2 million in the same period last year, attributable to higher costs in the tanker segment related to a vessel recovery. For the full year, 2017 operating profit was $24.0 million compared to $247.6 million in 2016, mainly due to the lower results in the product tankers and chemical tankers segments, the dry-docking of two vessels and the effects of inclement weather in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017.\nFourth-quarter 2017 Maritime EBITDA was $128.3 million compared to $205.6 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. EBITDA margin was 23.8 percent in the 2017 fourth quarter. For the full year, 2017 EBITDA was $565.0 million compared to $782.1 million in 2016. Full-year 2017 EBITDA margin was 29.0 percent.\nPorts and Terminals revenue increased 21.7 percent in the 2017 fourth quarter to $107.2 million compared to $88.1 million in the same period last year primarily attributable to an improvement of $19.2 million in the Maintenance and Repair segment, as well as higher revenue at Veracruz, Ensenada and Altamira. For the full year, revenue increased 18.2 percent in 2017 to $363.7 million compared to $307.6 million in 2016 mainly due to improved performance in the Maintenance and Repair segment and at Agencies.\nFourth-quarter 2017 Ports and Terminals operating income was $11.0 million compared to $11.4 million in the same period of 2016, mainly attributable to a higher volume of cruise and automotive exports at API Acapulco in the 2016 period. Additionally, the 2017 period was negatively impacted by equipment maintenance and repair costs. For the full year, 2017 operating income increased 22.8 percent to $45.1 million compared to $36.7 million in the 2016 period due to the improved performance in the Maintenance and Repair and Agencies segments.\nIn the 2017 fourth quarter, Ports and Terminals EBITDA was $14.0 million compared to $14.5 million in the same period last year. EBITDA margin was 13.1 percent in the 2017 fourth quarter. Full-year 2017 EBITDA was $57.9 million compared to $49.1 million in 2016. Full-year 2017 EBITDA margin was 15.9 percent.\nWarehousing services revenue increased 20.8 percent to $41.6 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $34.5 million in the same period of 2016, mainly attributable to improved operations by key clients. For the full year, 2017 revenues improved 18.9 percent to $149.9 million compared to $126.1 million in 2016.\nWarehousing operations continued its trend of improving results throughout 2017. Full-year 2017 loss was $31.6 million compared to $44.6 million loss in 2016 due to the Company’s cost optimization strategies and client diversification plan. Grupo TMM provides warehousing habilitation services mainly in the agro-industrial segment supported by FIRA (federal government trust funds for rural development), as well as habilitations services in other segments such as steel and fuels.\nDEBT\nAs of December 31, 2017, TMM’s total net debt was $437.0 million, short-term debt was $502.4 million and free cash flow was $461.6 million. The primary cause of the debt decrease was due to the TMM Division Maritima debt deconsolidation.\nTotal Debt*\n– Millions of Mexican Pesos –\nTo 12/31/17 To 12/31/16 Mexican Trust Certificates $ 0.0 $ 8,958.4 Other Corporate Debt 898.6 1,112.0 Total Debt $ 898.6 $ 10,070.4 Cash 461.6 902.7 Net Debt $ 437.0 $ 9,167.7 Stockholders’ Equity $ 2,208.4 $ 964.0 * Book Value\nHeadquartered in Mexico City, Grupo TMM is a Latin American Maritime transportation company.
