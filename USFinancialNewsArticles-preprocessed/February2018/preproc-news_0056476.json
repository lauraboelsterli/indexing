    "text": " 12 p.m. ET Share \nWhen you raise your profit targets and the stock market yawns... Getty Images JP Morgan Chase's corporate headquarters in New York City. \nBy Aaron Back \nIs this as good as it gets for JPMorgan Chase JPM, -0.91% ? \nThe bank gave nothing but good news on its investor day, among other things raising its medium-term target for return on tangible common equity, a key profitability metric, to 17% from 15%, thanks largely to lower tax rates. \nJP Morganâ€™s shares did nothing. That is not surprising after a 31% rally over the past year, compared with the 20% rise for the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index. Shares now trade at 2.24 times tangible book value, up from 1.8 times a year ago. That valuation may be a bit rich for a 17% return on tangible common equity. \nNot surprisingly, the bank is more optimistic about its stock.",
