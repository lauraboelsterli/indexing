Excluding the extra week from 2016, gross written premium in 2017 would have increased 9.5% during the quarter and 1.0% for the year.\n(2)\nMeasures used in this release that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles (\"non-GAAP\") are defined at the end of this release and reconciled to\nthe most comparable GAAP measure.\n(3)\nAnnualized\nColumns throughout may not foot due to rounding.\nNet earnings per diluted share decreased 31.3% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to a $10.2 million net deferred tax asset write-off resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding the impact of the tax reform, net earnings increased $3.3 million or 15.2%.\nGross written premium increased 3.5% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 driven by new business growth in California and renewal business policy growth and higher average premiums in Texas. Excluding the extra week of premium in 2016, gross written premium increased by 9.5% in the quarter.\nNet earnings per diluted share increased 5.7% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the same period in 2016 due to an increase in underwriting income of $20.0 million or 43.4% driven by a decrease in the accident year combined ratio from 98.4% at December 31, 2016, to 96.5% at December 31, 2017.\nLosses from catastrophes totaled $17.4 million during 2017, compared with $6.9 million in 2016.\nShare and Debt Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Infinity repurchased 48,700 shares at an average price, excluding commissions, of $94.21.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" which anticipate results based on estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These securities, impaired as we have an\nintent to sell, are expected to be sold between February and May 2018. We also intend to sell other securities that are currently in\nunrealized gain positions. The overall impact to the portfolio based on current market values, after security sales during the first and\nsecond quarters of 2018, is expected to be immaterial. The actual impact could be different as market values fluctuate over the transition\nperiod.\nInfinity Property and Casualty Corporation\nBalance Sheets\n(in millions, except book value per

gains Management uses net earnings excluding realized gains as a measure to evaluate the insurance business. The Company believes that net earnings excluding realized gains provides investors a valuable measure of the performance without being obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, which can be volatile on a quarterly basis. Net earnings is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nUnderwriting income measures the insurer's profit on insurance sales after all losses and expenses have been paid and is calculated by deducting losses and loss adjustment expenses and commissions and other underwriting expenses from earned premium. Management uses underwriting income to measure the success of its pricing and underwriting strategies. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of our profitability separately from investments. Net earnings is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nBelow is a schedule that reconciles net earnings to net earnings excluding realized gains and underwriting income:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except EPS)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet earnings\n$\n14.7\n$\n21.6\n$\n45.4\n$\n43.1\nLess:\nRealized gains on investments, pre-tax\n0.3\n1.9\n2.2\n3.1\nProvision for income taxes on capital gains\n(0.1)\n(0.7)\n(0.8)\n(1.1)\nRealized gains on investments, net of tax\n0.2\n1.2\n1.4\n2.0\nNet earnings excluding realized gains, after-tax\n14.5\n20.4\n43.9\n41.0\nLess: Provision for income taxes\n(22.6)\n(9.9)\n(34.6)\n(17.9)\nNet earnings excluding realized gains, pre-tax\n37.2\n30.2\n78.5\n59.0\nLess:\nNet investment income\n9.8\n10.4\n37.3\n35.5\nOther income\n0.4\n0.3\n1.4\n1.0\nInterest expense\n(3.5)\n(3.5)\n(14.0)\n(14.0)\nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n(2.9)\n(2.4)\n(9.8)\n(7.9)\nOther expenses\n(0.8)\n(0.3)\n(2.5)\n(1.7)\nUnderwriting income\n$\n34.2\n$\n25.7\n$\n66.1\n$\n46.1\nNet earnings per diluted share\n$\n1.34\n$\n1.95\n$\n4.10\n$\n3.88\nLess: Realized gains on investments, net of tax\n0.02\n0.11\n0.13\n0.18\nNet earnings excluding realized gains per diluted share\n$\n1.32\n$\n1.84\n$\n3.97\n$\n3.70\nGross written premium is the amount of premium charged for policies issued during a fiscal period (including assumed premium). Management uses gross written premium as a measure of production levels. Earned premium is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nBelow is a schedule that reconciles earned premium to gross written premium:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEarned premium\n$345.9\n$372.6\n$1,371.3\n$1,391.7\nLess: Change in unearned premium\n9.9\n45.9\n(15.5)\n(0.8)\nNet written premium\n335.9\n326.7\n1,386.9\n1,392.5\nLess: Ceded reinsurance\n(4.7)\n(2.4)\n(10.4)\n(9.0)\nGross written premium\n$340.6\n$329.1\n$1,397.3\n$1,401.4\nTangible capital is defined as total capital (long-term debt plus total shareholders' equity) less intangible assets. Infinity reports this non-GAAP measure because it is a measure often used by debt-holders and rating agencies when evaluating financial leverage. Total capital is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nBelow is a schedule that reconciles total capital to tangible capital:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nTotal capital\n$995.3\n$974.2\nLess: Goodwill\n75.3\n75.3\nTangible capital\n$920.0\n$898.9\nInfinity also makes available an investor supplement on its website.
