    "text": "1 COMMENTS Xcerra Corp. XCRA -0.61% has agreed to terminate its sale to a Chinese group, citing difficulty in securing federal approval for the $580 million deal.\nNorwood, Mass.-based Xcerra, which provides testing technology for semiconductors and electronics, said that “despite our best efforts to secure approval, it has become evident that” the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. wouldn’t clear the transaction.\nCFIUS, a multiagency panel, has oversight of deals that could lead to national-security concerns.\nXcerra and Hubei Xinyan Equity Investment Partnership have mutually agreed to terminate their merger agreement, Xcerra president and chief executive Dave Tacelli said in prepared remarks. Xcerra and Xinyan are discussing alternatives to pursue other opportunities in China, he said.\nXinyan is a limited partnership formed for the merger. Technology investor Unic Capital Management Co., an affiliate of Sino IC Capital, is the controlling shareholder of Xinyan’s general partner.\nThe deal was originally announced in April 2017.\nThe U.S. government has previously blocked attempts by Chinese interests to buy makers of the chip technology used in mobile phones, military equipment and other systems. Xcerra provides equipment to test chips but doesn’t actually make them.\nIn August, The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. semiconductor-testing company Cohu Inc . COHU 1.13% was mounting a quiet campaign to derail the deal citing national-security concerns. The deal could have given China access to intellectual property that could accelerate its efforts to become a serious player in the industry, Poway, Calif.,-based Cohu alleged in a six-page white paper it sent last year to an official handling CFIUS matters.\nCohu’s also had said a sale of Xcerra could have disrupted the semiconductor supply chain and led to U.S. job losses if the company had used subsidies from its new owner to improperly undercut U.S. rivals.\nChinese officials and executives have said the national security concerns their U.S. counterparts raise are a pretext and that the U.S. is simply trying to stave off competition.\nXcerra also reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31. Net income rose to $7.9 million, or 14 cents a share, from $2.6 million, or 5 cents a share. Sales fell to $110.3 million from $120.3 million.\nAdjusted earnings were 19 cents a share.\nWrite to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com",
