Barata, a state’s witness for a money laundering probe involving several politicians, also told Peruvian prosecutors that he gave money to two representatives for Fujimori’s party, Fujimori’s attorney Guiliana Loza told reporters in Brazil in comments broadcast live in Peru on local TV channel Canal N. It was not clear if Barata was being accused of any wrongdoing for making campaign contributions. Reporting By Mitra Taj",
