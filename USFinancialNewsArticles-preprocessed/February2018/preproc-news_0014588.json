    "text": "EDINBURGH, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A Scottish court rejected on Tuesday a legal attempt to ask the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether Britain could unilaterally stop the Brexit process if it wanted to.\nThe case was brought by a group of lawmakers who would prefer Britain to stay in the European Union, in an attempt to show that Brexit could be stopped if Britain withdrew its notification of Article 50 -- the process by which Brexit was formally initiated.\nBut judge J. Raymond Doherty of Scotland’s top civil court declined to refer the matter to the ECJ.\n“I am not satisfied that the application has a real prospect of success. Permission to proceed is refused,” he said.\nA lawyer for the group who brought the case said they would appeal against the ruling.
