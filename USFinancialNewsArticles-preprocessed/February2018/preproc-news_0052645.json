He also made 15 saves in the final 20 minutes, including sprawling stops on Hall and Palmieri early in the third and a point-blank stop on Nico Hischier midway through the period.\nChris Stewart capped Minnesota’s second straight three-goal second period. Joel Eriksson-Ek and Mike Reilly also scored as the Wild tallied three times in a span of 5:36 after getting three goals in a span of 4:12 in Monday’s 5-3 win over the New York Islanders.\nEric Staal added an empty-net goal and recorded his 900th career point, becoming the ninth active player to reach the milestone.\nHall recorded a point in his 20th straight appearance with a power-play goal in the first period. Hall, who has scored 26 goals this season, is the fifth player in the last 20 years to record a point in 20 straight appearances.\nThe wrist shot off the right post put New Jersey up 1-0.\nStefan Noesen scored the other goal for the Devils to put them up 2-0, but they still lost their second straight game following a four-game winning streak.\nNoesen put a backhand past Stalock’s stick side after Mikko Koivu blocked Travis Zajac’s initial shot from the low slot.\nMinnesota made it a one-goal game due to a fluky bounce as Reilly’s shot from the right point deflected over goalie Eddie Lack’s stick with 12:32 remaining.\nMinnesota tied it with 7:35 remaining when Eriksson-Ek tapped in Daniel Winnik’s one-handed pass into the vacated side of the net with the edge of his stick.\nThe Wild took the lead after defenseman Andy Greene turned it over and Stewart sped up on a 2-on-1, faked a pass and flicked a wrist shot from the right circle under Lack’s legs.\nLack stopped 21 shots in his third start with the Devils.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
