    "text": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc is open to discussing a buyout offer from Broadcom Ltd that “reflects the true value” of the chipmaker and better addresses concerns about regulatory hurdles to a deal, the company said on Friday.\nQualcomm and Broadcom executives met for the first time on Feb. 14 to discuss the existing acquisition offer.\nQualcomm’s board maintained its view that Broadcom’s existing $121 billion proposal materially undervalues the company and has an unacceptably high level of risk, and is not in the best interests of its stockholders.
