Iowa shot 52.2 percent from the field overall (36 of 69) and 45 percent from 3-point range (9 of 20).\nMichigan State went ahead 90-89 with 2:17 remaining on a 3-pointer by senior Kenny Goins, but Iowa regained the lead at 91-90 with 1:58 remaining on a basket by Cook.\nMichigan State went back ahead 92-91 with 1:02 left on a pair of free throws by Bridges. Following a shot-clock violation on Iowa with just under 32 seconds remaining, Bridges was fouled on an inbounds play and hit two more free throws with 31 seconds left to give the Spartans a 94-91 lead.\nIowa closed within 94-93 with 18 seconds remaining on a basket by Cook, but Langford hit a pair of free throws with 6.3 seconds left to give Michigan State a 96-93 lead.\nBridges stole the ensuing inbounds and was fouled, but he missed two free throws with 3.6 seconds remaining to give Iowa one last chance to tie. A half-court shot at the buzzer by Iowa junior Nicholas Baer hit the front of the rim and bounced off.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
