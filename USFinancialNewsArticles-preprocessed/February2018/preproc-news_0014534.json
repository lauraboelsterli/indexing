The official said this was not a forecast but a budget price, at which the company should be able to meet all this year’s targets.\nFive new projects are set to come on stream this year, CNOOC said, including four offshore China and the Stampede deepwater field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, in which CNOOC has a 25 percent interest.\nLate last year, new output came on stream at the Petrobras-operated Libra Block in Brazil, in which CNOOC holds 10 percent.\nCNOOC also said it expected to see a “significant” increase in its reserve life with the booking of reserves from new projects, including Libra and the Liza field offshore Guyana.\nThe company’s latest production forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are 485 million boe and 500 million boe, respectively.\nThe ramp-up of overseas projects can help CNOOC beat its targeted compound annual growth rate of 2.2 percent through to 2020, Sanford Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge wrote in a note.
