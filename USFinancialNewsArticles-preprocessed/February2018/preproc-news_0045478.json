    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gogo (NASDAQ: GOGO), the leading global provider of broadband connectivity products and services for aviation, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Consolidated Financial Results\nRevenue increased to a record $188.0 million, up 18% from Q4 2016. Service revenue increased to $164.0 million, up 18% from Q4 2016, driven by a 10% increase in commercial aircraft online to 3,231, a 12% increase in ATG business aircraft online to 4,678, and increased customer usage across all segments. Net loss increased to $41.1 million, a 53% increase from Q4 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA (1) grew to a record $24.9 million, up 8% from Q4 2016. Capital expenditures increased to $66.0 million from $48.2 million in Q4 2016. Cash CAPEX (1) increased to $43.1 million from $33.5 million in Q4 2016, primarily due to the planned increase in success-based airborne equipment purchases during this period of heavy 2Ku installations. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $409.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\n\"During the fourth quarter, we executed on our strategic initiatives: installing 2Ku rapidly, engaging more passengers, and winning aircraft,\" said Michael Small, Gogo's President and CEO. \"Our continued rapid deployment of high-bandwidth technologies in 2018 is the catalyst for delivering a great customer experience and long-term revenue and profitability growth.\"\n\"Our record financial results for the quarter lay a strong foundation for 2018 financial performance,\" said Barry Rowan, Gogo's Executive Vice President and CFO. \"With 2Ku aircraft online scaling in 2018 and continued rapid growth of our Business Aviation division, we look forward to delivering another strong year of financial performance as we target achieving positive free cash flow in 2019.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Business Segment Financial Results\nCommercial Aviation - North America (CA-NA)\nCA-NA aircraft equivalents increased to nearly 2,900 aircraft in the quarter, of which approximately 15% were satellite-equipped aircraft. The annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft, or ARPA, for CA-NA satellite-equipped aircraft was $223,000, and the annualized ARPA for CA-NA ATG-equipped aircraft was $131,000. The weighted average peak speed to an aircraft in CA-NA increased to nearly 20 Mbps, approximately doubling from Q4 2016.\nAircraft online reached 2,840, up 164 aircraft from December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, CA-NA had more than 650 awarded but not yet installed 2Ku aircraft, of which approximately 75 are net new aircraft. Take rate reached a record 9.9%, up 36% from 7.3% in Q4 2016, due to increased passenger adoption resulting from airline and third party paid offerings. Total revenue increased to $105.1 million, up 4% from Q4 2016, driven primarily by increased aircraft online equivalents and higher ARPA. Segment profit decreased to $23.5 million, down 6% from Q4 2016, and segment profit margin was 22%.\nCommercial Aviation - Rest of World (CA-ROW)\nCA-ROW revenue doubled year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. Annualized ARPA grew 17% to $201,000 year-over-year. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, CA-ROW ARPA declined as a result of more aircraft from new airline partners coming online during Q4 2017. Annualized ARPA for airlines on which Gogo service was commercially launched prior to 2017 grew 66% year-over-year.\nAircraft online reached 391, up 124 aircraft from December 31, 2016. CA-ROW had approximately 770 net new 2Ku awarded but not yet installed aircraft as of December 31, 2017. Total revenue increased to $16.9 million, up 127% from Q4 2016, driven primarily by higher ARPA and an increase in aircraft online. Segment loss of $24.9 million increased slightly from Q4 2016.\nBusiness Aviation (BA)\nBA service revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $45.5 million. ATG aircraft online increased to 4,678, up 12% year-over-year, as demand for inflight connectivity grew across all market segments, including a 19% increase in light jets and turboprop aircraft online. ATG average monthly service revenue per unit, or ARPU, grew 13% to $2,953.\nEquipment revenue increased to $20.6 million, up 36% from Q4 2016, as demand for the new AVANCE platform continued to build. Total segment revenue increased to $66.0 million, up 28% from Q4 2016. Segment profit increased to a record $26.8 million, up 16% from Q4 2016, and segment profit margin was 41%.\nFull-Year 2017 Consolidated Financial and Operating Results\nGogo was within or exceeded full-year 2017 guidance, including total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Cash CAPEX, and 2Ku installations. 2Ku was installed on more than 470 aircraft in 2017, including more than 130 in CA-ROW, to end the year with more than 550 2Ku equipped aircraft online. For the fourth consecutive year, Gogo installed its inflight connectivity equipment on more than 1,000 combined BA and CA aircraft, substantially more than any other company in the industry. Revenue increased to $699.1 million, up 17% from $596.6 million in 2016. Service revenue increased to $617.9 million, up 20% from $514.3 million in 2016. CA-NA revenue increased to $400.6 million, up 8% from $371.5 million in 2016. BA revenue increased to $240.6 million, up 21% from $199.6 million in 2016. CA-ROW revenue increased to $57.9 million, up 128% from $25.4 million in 2016. Net loss increased to $172.0 million, up 38% from 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA was $58.5 million compared to $67.2 million in 2016. Excluding $4.5 million in charges in Q3 2017 related to write-downs of legacy product lines and the retirement of Gogo test aircraft, net loss was $167.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $63.0 million. Capital expenditures increased to $280.2 million from $176.9 million in 2016. Cash CAPEX increased to $220.5 million, up 66% from $133.1 million in 2016, primarily due to increased success-based airborne equipment purchases for 2Ku installations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of income tax benefits due to a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). TCJA will not have a material impact on our near term financial results as we had approximately $545 million in federal net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and $356 million in state NOLs as of December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company is adopting the new revenue recognition standard, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (\"ASC 606\"), pursuant to which equipment revenue will be recognized at the time of installation, rather than deferred over the life of the airline agreement. The Company is providing guidance for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, under both ASC 606 and the prior revenue recognition standard (ASC 605) to provide greater comparability with our reported results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn our commercial aviation segments, under our contracts with airlines, aircraft operate under either a turnkey or airline-directed commercial arrangement. Starting in 2018, we expect the mix of aircraft operating under the airline-directed model to be significantly higher than in prior years due to the transition of certain existing airlines from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model and new aircraft coming online under the airline-directed model. Our 2018 guidance reflects this business model shift.\nUnder the airline-directed model, airborne equipment revenue and cost, including the co-investment provided for our airline partners, flow through the income statement and are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Under the turnkey model, the impact of airborne equipment co-investment is not included in Adjusted EBITDA because it is recorded as a capital expenditure. As a result, under ASC 605, our Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 is negatively impacted by the shift to the airline-directed model. However, this negative impact is partially offset by certain provisions within ASC 606.\nFor the full year ending December 31, 2018, the Company expects:\nTotal revenue of $865 million to $935 million (or $750 million to $790 million under ASC 605, an increase of 7% to 13% from 2017) CA-NA revenue of $445 million to $485 million, of which approximately 20% is equipment revenue (or $380 million to $415 million under ASC 605) CA-ROW revenue of $125 million to $165 million, of which approximately 50% is equipment revenue (or $75 million to $90 million under ASC 605) BA revenue of $285 million to $295 million (same as under ASC 605) Adjusted EBITDA of $75 million to $100 million (or $65 million to $90 million under ASC 605, an increase of 11% to 54% from 2017). We estimate that 2018 Adjusted EBITDA under ASC 605 would be approximately $15 million higher when adjusting for the accounting impact of the airline-directed model. An increase of 550 to 650 2Ku aircraft online, of which approximately 300 are expected to be in CA-ROW. Total 2Ku aircraft online as of December 31, 2018 of 1,100 to 1,200. Gross capital expenditures of $150 million to $170 million and Cash CAPEX of $110 million to $130 million, of which approximately 35% is related to airborne Cash CAPEX. In addition, we expect airborne equipment inventory purchases related to airline-directed installations of $15 million to $30 million.\nFree Cash Flow is expected to improve from 2017 to 2018 driven by Adjusted EBITDA growth and lower Cash CAPEX. The Company reaffirms its target of becoming Free Cash Flow positive in 2019 and for the full year 2020. The Company will provide an update to its other long-term targets under ASC 606 on the Company's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call in May 2018.\nOn February 22, 2018, the Company will be providing a pre-recorded webcast on the \"Accounting Impact of Business Model Changes and New Revenue Recognition Standard on Commercial Aviation\" which will be available online on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://ir.gogoair.com .\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below\nConference Call\nThe fourth quarter conference call will be held on February 22, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET. A live webcast of the conference call, as well as a replay, will be available online on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://ir.gogoair.com . Participants can also access the call by dialing (844) 464-3940 (within the United States and Canada) or (765) 507-2646 (international dialers) and entering conference ID number 7589067.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report certain non-GAAP financial measurements, including Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX in the supplemental tables below. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX for business planning purposes, including managing our business against internally projected results of operations and measuring our performance and liquidity. These supplemental performance measures also provide another basis for comparing period to period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. These supplemental performance measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA or liquidity with Cash CAPEX, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to net loss attributable to common stock, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net loss attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results, and (iii) use Cash CAPEX in addition to, and not as an alternative to, consolidated capital expenditures when evaluating our liquidity. No reconciliation of the forecasted range for Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, we are not able to provide a reconciliation for the forecasted range of Adjusted EBITDA due to variability in the timing of aircraft installations and deinstallations impacting depreciation expense and amortization of deferred airborne leasing proceeds.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain disclosures in this press release and related comments by our management include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our business outlook, industry, business strategy, plans, goals and expectations concerning our market position, international expansion, future technologies, future operations, margins, profitability, future efficiencies, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information.

any negative outcome or effects of future litigation; our substantial indebtedness; limitations and restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness and our ability to service our indebtedness; our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all; fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to attract and retain customers and to capitalize on revenue from our platform; the demand for and market acceptance of our products and services; changes or developments in the regulations that apply to us, our business and our industry, cyber-attack or other events that could result in reduced demand for our products and services or adverse regulatory changes or developments as referenced above, or otherwise adversely affect our business and industry; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, including key personnel; the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising and our ability to maintain and enhance our brands; our ability to manage our growth in a cost-effective manner and integrate and manage acquisitions;

We define aircraft online as the total number of commercial aircraft on which our equipment is installed and service has been made commercially available as of the last day of each period presented. We assign aircraft to CA-NA or CA-ROW at the time of contract signing as follows: (i) all aircraft operated by North American airlines and under contract for ATG or ATG-4 service are assigned to CA-NA, (ii) all aircraft operated by North American airlines and under a contract for satellite service are assigned to CA-NA or CA-ROW based on whether the routes flown by such aircraft under the contract are anticipated to be predominantly within or outside of North America at the time the contract is signed, and (iii) all aircraft operated by non-North American airlines and under a contract are assigned to CA-ROW. Aircraft equivalents. We define aircraft equivalents for a segment as the number of commercial aircraft online (as defined above) multiplied by the percentage of flights flown by such aircraft within the scope of that segment, rounded to the nearest whole aircraft and expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in the period. This methodology takes into account the fact that during a particular period certain aircraft may fly routes outside the scope of the segment to which they are assigned for purposes of the calculation of aircraft online. Annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (\"ARPA\"). We define annualized ARPA as the aggregate service revenue plus monthly service fees, some of which are reported as a reduction to cost of service revenue for that segment for the period, divided by the number of months in the period, and further divided by the number of aircraft equivalents (as defined above) for that segment during the period, which is then annualized and rounded to the nearest thousand. Annualized Satellite ARPA is calculated based on satellite revenue and satellite aircraft equivalents, within that segment. Annualized ATG ARPA is calculated based on ATG revenue and ATG aircraft equivalents. Gross passenger opportunity (\"GPO\"). We define GPO as the aggregate number of passengers who board commercial aircraft on which Gogo service has been available at any time during the period presented. When actual passenger counts are available directly from our airline partners, we aggregate such counts across flights on Gogo-equipped aircraft. When not available directly from our airline partners, we estimate GPO. Estimated GPO is calculated by first estimating the number of flights occurring on each Gogo-equipped aircraft, then multiplying by the number of seats on that aircraft, and finally multiplying by a seat factor that is determined from historical information provided to us in arrears by our airline partners. The estimated number of flights is derived from real-time flight information provided to our front-end systems by Air Radio Inc. (ARINC), direct airline feeds and supplementary third-party data sources. These aircraft-level estimates are then aggregated with any available airline-provided passenger counts to obtain total GPO. Total average revenue per session (\"ARPS\"). We define ARPS as revenue from Passenger Connectivity, excluding non-session related revenue, divided by the total number of sessions during the period. A session, or a \"use\" of Passenger Connectivity, is defined as the use by a unique passenger of Passenger Connectivity on a flight segment. Multiple logins or purchases under the same user name during one flight segment count as only one session. Connectivity take rate. We define connectivity take rate as the number of sessions during the period expressed as a percentage of GPO. Included in our connectivity take-rate calculation are sessions for which we did not receive revenue, including those provided pursuant to free promotional campaigns and, to a lesser extent, as a result of complimentary passes distributed by our customer service representatives for unforeseen technical issues. For the periods listed above, the number of sessions for which we did not receive revenue was not material.\nBusiness Aviation\nFor the Three Months\nFor the Years Ended\nEnded December 31,\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAircraft online (at period end)\nSatellite\n5,443\n5,500\n5,443\n5,500\nATG\n4,678\n4,172\n4,678\n4,172\nAverage monthly service revenue per aircraft online\nSatellite\n$\n251\n$\n234\n$\n237\n$\n221\nATG\n2,953\n2,622\n2,876\n2,548\nUnits Sold\nSatellite\n109\n110\n412\n477\nATG\n235\n179\n831\n737\nAverage equipment revenue per unit sold (in thousands)\nSatellite\n$\n48\n$\n38\n$\n43\n$\n43\nATG\n61\n57\n57\n57\nSatellite aircraft online.

We define ATG aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide ATG services as of the last day of each period presented. Average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online. We define average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online as the aggregate satellite service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of satellite aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online. We define average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online as the aggregate ATG service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of ATG aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Units sold. We define units sold as the number of satellite or ATG units for which we recognized revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized revenue on twelve AVANCE (formerly Gogo Biz 4G) units that were previously deferred. Average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold. We define average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue earned from all satellite units sold during the period, divided by the number of satellite units sold. Average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold. We define average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue from all ATG units sold during the period, divided by the number of ATG units sold.\nGogo Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Information – Segment Revenue and Segment Profit (Loss) (1)\n(in thousands, Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nCA-NA\nCA-ROW\nBA\nService revenue\n$\n103,224\n$\n15,299\n$\n45,465\nEquipment revenue\n1,895\n1,567\n20,560\nTotal revenue\n$\n105,119\n$\n16,866\n$\n66,025\nSegment profit (loss)\n$\n23,486\n$\n(24,910)\n$\n26,763\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nCA-NA\nCA-ROW\nBA\nService revenue\n$\n95,499\n$\n6,985\n$\n36,403\nEquipment revenue\n5,565\n449\n15,097\nTotal revenue\n$\n101,064\n$\n7,434\n$\n51,500\nSegment profit (loss)\n$\n24,904\n$\n(24,692)\n$\n22,979\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nCA-NA\nCA-ROW\nBA\nService revenue\n$\n393,484\n$\n53,542\n$\n170,880\nEquipment revenue\n7,129\n4,323\n69,732\nTotal revenue\n$\n400,613\n$\n57,865\n$\n240,612\nSegment profit (loss)\n$\n66,802\n$\n(106,978)\n$\n99,409\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nCA-NA\nCA-ROW\nBA\nService revenue\n$\n357,250\n$\n24,198\n$\n132,845\nEquipment revenue\n14,273\n1,180\n66,804\nTotal revenue\n$\n371,523\n$\n25,378\n$\n199,649\nSegment profit (loss)\n$\n71,870\n$\n(87,637)\n$\n82,874\n(1)\nSegment profit (loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, certain non-cash charges (including amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and stock compensation expense) and other income (expense).\nGogo Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Information – Segment Cost of Service Revenue (1)\n(in thousands, Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\nCA-NA\n$\n37,232\n$\n38,478\nBA\n11,345\n9,336\nCA-ROW\n17,963\n13,649\nTotal\n$\n66,540\n$\n61,463\nFor the Years Ended\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\nCA-NA\n$\n149,671\n$\n145,545\nBA\n40,821\n35,027\nCA-ROW\n77,842\n45,506\nTotal\n$\n268,334\n$\n226,078\n(1)\nExcludes depreciation and amortization expense.\nGogo Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Information – Segment Cost of Equipment Revenue (1)\n(in thousands, Unaudited)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\nCA-NA\n$\n1,425\n$\n3,031\nBA\n12,981\n8,633\nCA-ROW\n2,525\n234\nTotal\n$\n16,931\n$\n11,898\nFor the Years Ended\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\nCA-NA\n$\n7,071\n$\n11,366\nBA\n46,632\n36,619\nCA-ROW\n4,851\n665\nTotal\n$\n58,554\n$\n48,650\n(1)\nExcludes depreciation and amortization expense.\nGogo Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\nFor the Three Months\nFor the Years Ended\nEnded December 31,\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nNet loss\n$\n(41,138)\n$\n(26,932)\n$\n(171,995)\n$\n(124,505)\nInterest expense\n30,190\n24,946\n111,944\n83,647\nInterest income\n(965)\n(571)\n(2,964)\n(1,635)\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n(2,942)\n317\n(1,997)\n1,314\nDepreciation and amortization\n48,669\n29,600\n145,490\n105,642\nEBITDA\n33,814\n27,360\n80,478\n64,463\nStock-based compensation expense\n4,814\n4,635\n19,821\n17,621\nAmortization of deferred airborne lease incentives\n(13,717)\n(8,869)\n(41,816)\n(29,519)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n-\n15,406\nAdjustment of deferred financing costs\n-\n-\n-\n(792)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n24,911\n$\n23,126\n$\n58,483\n$\n67,179\nCash CAPEX:\nConsolidated capital expenditures (GAAP) (1)\n$\n(65,992)\n$\n(48,187)\n$\n(280,230)\n$\n(176,881)\nChange in deferred airborne lease incentives (2)\n9,264\n5,876\n18,120\n14,550\nAmortization of deferred airborne lease incentives (2)\n13,601\n8,783\n41,595\n29,241\nCash CAPEX\n$\n(43,127)\n$\n(33,528)\n$\n(220,515)\n$\n(133,090)\n(1)\nSee unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(2)\nExcludes deferred airborne lease incentives and related amortization associated with STCs for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as STC costs are expensed as incurred as part of Engineering, Design and Development.\nFor the Year Ending\nDecember 31, 2018\nCash CAPEX Guidance:\nLow\nHigh\nConsolidated capital expenditures (GAAP)\n$\n(150,000)\n$\n(170,000)\nDeferred airborne lease incentives\n40,000\n40,000\nCash CAPEX\n$\n(110,000)\n$\n(130,000)\nDefinition of Non-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to common stock before income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization of other intangible assets.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt and (iv) adjustment of deferred financing costs. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that, management believes, have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance.\nWe believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Therefore, we believe the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business.\nWe believe the exclusion of the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives from Adjusted EBITDA is useful as it allows an investor to view operating performance across time periods in a manner consistent with how management measures segment profit and loss (see Note 10, \"Business Segments and Major Customers,\" for a description of segment profit (loss) in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). Management evaluates segment profit and loss in this manner, excluding the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, because such presentation reflects operating decisions and activities from the current period, without regard to the prior period decision or the form of connectivity agreements. See \"—Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations—Cost of Service Revenue—Commercial Aviation North America and Rest of World\" in our 2017 10-K for a discussion of the accounting treatment of deferred airborne lease incentives.\nWe believe it is useful to an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the loss on extinguishment of debt and adjustment of deferred financing costs from Adjusted EBITDA because of the non-recurring nature of these charges.\nWe also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management.\nCash CAPEX represents capital expenditures net of airborne equipment proceeds received from the airlines and incentives paid to us by landlords under certain facilities leases. We believe Cash CAPEX provides a more representative indication of our liquidity requirements with respect to capital expenditures, as under certain agreements with our airline partners, we are reimbursed for all or a substantial portion of the cost of our airborne equipment, thereby reducing our cash capital requirements.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gogo-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300602397.html\nSOURCE Gogo",
