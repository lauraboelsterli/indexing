    "text": "LIMA, Peru--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. and subsidiaries (NYSE: CPAC; BVL: CPACASC1) (“the Company” or “Cementos Pacasmayo”) a leading cement company serving the Peruvian construction industry, today announced its consolidated results for the fourth quarter (“4Q17”) and full year (“2017”) ended December 31, 2017. These results have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and are stated in nominal Peruvian Soles (S/).\nFinancial and Operational Highlights:\n4Q17 Highlights\n(All comparisons are to 4Q16 unless otherwise stated)\nSales volume of cement, concrete and blocks increased 7.3%, primarily due to increased sales volume to the self-construction segment and to a pick up in public sector spending. Gross margin was 41.3%; a 1.2 percentage point increase, primarily due to a higher average price of cement. Cement EBITDA increased 13.9%, to S/105.5 million. Cement EBITDA margin increased to 32.2% for the fourth quarter 2017. Consolidated EBITDA decreased 35.7% due to a write-off in the Company’s investment in the Salmueras Sudamericanas S.A. brine project. It is important to note that this is a non-cash capital impairment. Net income from Continuing Operations excluding the non-cash impairment provision would have been S/36.5 million, similar to that of 3Q17, with a 247.7% increase as compared to 4Q16.\n2017 Highlights\n(All comparisons are to 2016 unless otherwise stated)\nSales volume of cement, concrete and blocks decreased by only 0.8%, despite the significant decline in sales volume during the first four months of the year due to Coastal El Niño. It is important to note that year-on-year sales volume has increased steadily every month, from May through the end of the year. Gross margin was 40.1%, in line with that of full year 2016. Cement EBITDA reached S/375.3 million; a decrease of only 2.2%, despite the negative effects of Coastal El Niño on both sales and costs. Cement EBITDA margin was 30.6%, in line with that of the full year 2016. Consolidated EBITDA decreased 12.9%, primarily due to the non-cash impairment provision related to the Salmueras Sudamericanas S.A. brine project. Net income from Continuing Operations excluding the impairment provision would have been S/118.8 million for the full year 2017, in line with that of 2016.\nFor a full version of Cementos Pacasmayo’s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release, please visit http://www.cementospacasmayo.com.pe/investors/ .\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION:\nCementos Pacasmayo will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, to discuss these results at 10:00 a.m. Lima Time/Eastern Time .\nTo access the call, please dial:\n+1 (877) 407-0782 (From within the U.S.)\n+1 (201) 689-8567 (From outside the U.S.)\nThere will also be a live Audio Webcast of the event at:\nhttp://www.investorcalendar.com/event/24616\nAbout Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A.\nCementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. is a cement company, located in the Northern region of Peru.
