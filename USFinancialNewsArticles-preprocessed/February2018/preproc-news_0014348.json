    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 10:34 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Snow blankets Paris and northern France, transport disrupted Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Heavy snowfall across northern France overnight caused widespread travel disruption on Wednesday with hundreds of motorists spending the night in their cars and around 700 travelers sleeping in two Paris train stations. \nFrench authorities set up makeshift shelters at roadsides across the Paris region, near Orly airport to the south of the capital and at the Austerlitz and Montparnasse stations in the city. In all, around 1,500 people had to be sheltered between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. \nSome flights were canceled at Orly, according to the airport’s travel information. \nGovernment spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said authorities had worked to prevent travel chaos as much as possible but that grit on roads was not effective with heavy dumpings of snow. \n“We’re facing an exceptional episode,” he told RTL radio, warding off calls to overhaul France’s transport network. \n“We’re not going to adapt our infrastructure for an exceptional occurrence, for two big snowfalls that happen every four or five years.” People walk on a snow-covered path in the Bois de Vincennes in Paris, France, as winter weather with snow and freezing temperatures arrive in France, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau \nAt least 15 cm of snow fell around the capital’s outlying suburbs, the biggest dump since 2013, the government said. \nFor children and the more adventurous, the weather was a godsend: some carted skis to the top of Montmartre, the steep hill in northern Paris where the Sacre Coeur is located, while impromptu snowball fights erupted on the way to schools.

But they’re lying, there are no trains,” said IT technician Jean-Michel Blanchet, blaming weak investment in regional rail networks for a lack of snow-clearing equipment.
