    "text": " 00 PM / Updated an hour ago Everton up to ninth with easy win over Palace Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 10 (Reuters) - Gylfi Sigurdsson, Oumar Niasse and Tom Davies were on target as Everton eased past Crystal Palace 3-1 on Saturday to climb to ninth in the Premier League table. \nAfter a committed but low-quality first half ended goalless, Everton struck twice within six minutes after the break as Sigurdsson beat Wayne Hennessey with a deflected shot before Niasseâ€™s header doubled the advantage. Slideshow (2 Images) \nMidfielder Davies all but sealed the victory with a low finish in the 75th minute against a Palace side who showed little threat until Luka Milivojevic converted a late penalty after Ashley Williams handled the ball. \nEverton leapfrogged Bournemouth to climb to ninth on 34 points from 27 games. Palace are 14th with 27 points. Reporting by Tom Hayward, editing by Ed Osmond",
