    "text": "(Adds details on quarter, share price)\nFeb 8 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates on Thursday, helped by higher demand for fried chicken and hot wings at its KFC unit, sending its shares up nearly 5 percent in premarket trade.\nKFC same-store sales rose 3 percent, while analysts had estimated a growth of 2.88 percent.\nOverall sales at its restaurants open at least a year rose 2 percent, missing the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate of 2.33 percent, on weaker demand at its Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains.\nYum said separately it would buy a 3 percent stake in online food-ordering company GrubHub Inc for $200 million to increase sales through pickup and deliveries at its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S.\nExcluding items, the company earned 96 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of 80 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue fell 16.4 percent to $1.58 billion, lower than the analysts’ estimate of $1.59 billion.\nThe company said net income rose to $436 million, or $1.26 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $303 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.\nReporting by Nivedita Balu; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
