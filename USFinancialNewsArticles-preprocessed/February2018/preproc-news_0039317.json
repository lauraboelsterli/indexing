    "text": "KELSEYVILLE, CA, Feb. 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vet Online Supply, Inc. (OTC PINK: VTNL) (the Company), announces today a share buyback and dividend program for 2018.\nDan Rushford, CEO, stated, “Our recent purchase orders for January and February 2018 of $529,790 and $245,000 have allowed our Company to start the process to purchase-back shares of the company in order to focus on anti-dilution measures, stock price increases and minimizing the number of shareholders as we target the New York Stock Exchange listing procedures. We are designing a program to provide prorated dividends to our shareholders. Dividend stocks are inflation resistant because as prices rise the profits of a company rise as well. Dividends are based off company profits, and we want our shareholders to benefit and support Vet Online Supply. We are approaching our revenue target sooner than anticipated, and this will assist us in expediting our plan, according to management.”\nThe company received its first retail order from a major CBD retailer on December 13, 2017 for the purchase of 5,000 units of the CBD Pet Treats and CBD Pet Drops for approximately $245,000, and another purchase order of $529,790 for 10,000 units of our CBD Pet Drops and 7,000 units of our CBD Pet Supplement Treats.\nThe company will announce another new private label of its new Pet Performance Product in February 2018. Projected earnings for the Pet Performance Product in 2018 are $1.3M.\nThe company will announce another new breeding franchise in February 2018. Projected earnings for the breeding franchise in 2018 are $1.1M. The breeding franchise business model integrates the Pet Products on a national scale.\nwww.vetonlinesupplies.com\nABOUT VET ONLINE SUPPLY :\nVet Online Supply Inc. is a small US based online retail reseller of proprietary veterinary products.
