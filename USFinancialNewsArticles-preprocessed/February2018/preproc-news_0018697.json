Founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2006, Nintex leveraged its early success with a major global expansion and move to the cloud in 2013. Since then, Nintex has established itself as the leading innovator in intelligent process automation, helping nearly 8,000 enterprises in 90 countries automate millions of critical business processes.\n\"For several years, we've watched Nintex pioneer the workflow and content automation category by delivering best-in-class technology and evolving to the cloud, all while producing impressive growth and financial results,\" said Thoma Bravo Partner Hudson Smith. \"We firmly believe that process automation is highly achievable for many more thousands of enterprises through the Nintex Workflow Cloud. Our goal is to help Nintex achieve its strategic objectives and vision through leveraging the experience and resources of Thoma Bravo. We're excited to become the company's lead investor in its next phase of growth.\"\nHarry Taylor, Managing Director of investor TA Associates noted, \"It's been an amazing transformation for Nintex over the last four years; we're very pleased to have been a key partner to management in creating a new market category and assuming the leadership position.

I look forward to assisting him to continue his career success in his new role.\"\nEric Johnson is a proven SaaS executive with more than two decades of financial and operational experience at mid- and large-sized software companies.
