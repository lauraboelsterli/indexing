    "text": "Published: Feb 28, 2018 2:26 p.m. ET Share \nThe company is reducing the number of ads and introducing a new commercial pod dedicated to up to two advertisers Getty Images \nBy Alexandra Bruell \nComcast Corp.’s CMCSA, +0.30% NBCUniversal is reducing the number of commercials that air during its prime-time television shows, an efforts to boost the value of its advertising as consumers increasingly avoid ads and replace traditional TV with new streaming options. \nThe company on Wednesday announced plans to cut the number of advertisements in commercial breaks by 20% and to decrease advertising time by 10% during its original prime-time programming across its broadcast and cable networks. That means viewers will get to watch more programming during those shows. \nThe reduction in number of commercials doesn’t exactly match up to the reduction in ad time because the company is also introducing a new feature for marketers. NBCU announced a new 60-second commercial pod in the first or last break of a show that will be dedicated to up to two advertisers. The goal is to create a “stronger impact with viewers,” NBC said in a statement. \n“The industry knows that television is already the most effective advertising medium there is, but we need to make the experience better for viewers,” said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising and client partnerships at NBCUniversal, in the statement. “We’re reimagining the advertising experience for consumers, marketers, and the entire industry.”",
