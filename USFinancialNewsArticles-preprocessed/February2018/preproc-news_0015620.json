    "text": "ELYRIA, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Invacare Corporation (NYSE: IVC) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the Fourth Quarter 2017\nReported net sales increased 1.5% to $250.4 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Constant currency net sales (a) decreased 2.3% compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Consolidated constant currency sequential net sales (b) decreased 1.2% compared to the third quarter 2017. Notably, North America/Home Medical Equipment (NA/HME) constant currency sequential net sales were flat. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 27.3% compared to the fourth quarter 2016, primarily as a result of inventory liquidation following previously announced 2017 plant transfers and year-end promotional activities. Operating loss was $7.9 million, or $1.0 million greater than the fourth quarter 2016, primarily related to increased restructuring costs of $2.2 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.54 and adjusted net loss per share (c) was $0.42. Both reflect a negative impact of $0.10 per share from restructuring costs and $0.06 per share of increased interest expense partially offset by a benefit of $0.05 per share related to U.S. tax reform legislation. Free cash flow (d) was positive $20.6 million, which was a $31.1 million improvement compared to the fourth quarter 2016 and a $25.3 million improvement compared to the third quarter 2017. The current quarter benefited from strong improvements in working capital.\nHighlights for the Full Year 2017\nReported net sales decreased 7.7% to $966.5 million compared to 2016. Excluding the divested Garden City Medical, Inc. (GCM), constant currency net sales decreased 5.2% compared to 2016. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased 80 basis points to 27.9% compared to 2016, principally as a result of the strategic mix shift toward mobility and seating products and reduced freight costs partially offset by increased manufacturing costs. Operating loss was $40.2 million, or $24.9 million greater than 2016. Excluding a $7.4 million gain on sale of the GCM business realized in the third quarter 2016, the operating loss increased by $17.6 million compared to 2016 primarily due to increased restructuring costs of $9.8 million and lower net sales. GAAP loss per share was $2.34 and adjusted net loss per share was $1.93. Both reflect a negative impact of $0.36 per share from restructuring costs and $0.21 per share of increased interest expense partially offset by a benefit of $0.05 per share related to U.S. tax reform legislation. Free cash flow usage was $40.0 million compared to usage of $66.7 million in 2016.\nAdditional 2017 Highlights\nFollowing five years of quality systems remediation, the company successfully satisfied the requirements under the consent decree with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to resume full operations at Corporate and the Taylor Street manufacturing facility in Elyria, Ohio, effective July 24, 2017. The company launched over ten new products, including the new Invacare ® TDX ® SP2 Power Wheelchair with LiNX ® Technology and the Invacare ® Platinum ® Mobile Oxygen Concentrator with Connectivity. These two notable products signified the company's launch of product informatics that feature great benefits for both consumers and providers. After several quarters of transformation work, NA/HME started to achieve constant currency sequential net sales growth in the third quarter 2017 compared to the second quarter 2017, which was largely the result of new product offerings and increased commercial effectiveness. The company announced in 2017 approximately $23.4 million in expected annualized cost savings as a result of restructuring activities to streamline operations, drive efficiencies, and reshape the organization around its new business model.\nKey Indicators of the Transformation (1)\n(in millions USD) Q4 17 Q4 16 $ Change\n% Change Net Sales $250.4 $246.7 $3.6 1.5% Constant Currency Net Sales $241.0 $246.7 $(5.7) (2.3)% Gross Margin % of Net Sales 27.3% 27.9% (60 bps) Gross Profit $68.3 $68.7 $(0.4) (0.6)% Constant Currency Selling, General & Administrative Expense (SG&A) (e) $70.8 $74.5 $(3.7) (5.0)% Free Cash Flow $20.6 $(10.6) $31.1 294.6% EBITDA (f) $(3.9) $(3.2) $(0.7) (22.7)% (1) As previously disclosed, the key indicators of the transformation noted in this table are measures of progress used by the company as it moves through its three-phase transformation from a generalist durable medical equipment company toward one more focused on clinically complex products and solutions.\nCEO Summary\nCommenting on the company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, Matthew E. Monaghan, chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated, “2017 was a tremendous year of progress in our transformation across the company. In quality milestones, we had a major step forward with the consent decree. As of July 24, 2017, we were able to sell without restrictions from our Elyria, Ohio power wheelchair manufacturing facility. We launched over ten new products, including two products that move Invacare into the world of informatics - the new Invacare ® TDX ® SP2 Power Wheelchair with LiNX ® Technology and the Invacare ® Platinum ® Mobile Oxygen Concentrator with Connectivity. We also made significant investments to begin to resize our infrastructure around our new business model, as reflected in the reduction of SG&A expense. During the fourth quarter, we generated $20.6 million of free cash flow, which was driven by meaningful improvements in working capital, including the liquidation of inventory we had built up to facilitate our 2017 plant transfers. In 2017, Europe overcame foreign currency headwinds from the beginning of the year and delivered solid performance. Asia/Pacific demonstrated continued improvement. NA/HME continued to stabilize constant currency sequential net sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2017 with growth in mobility and seating and respiratory products. The increase in respiratory sales was largely driven by promotional activities for our new portable oxygen concentrator that launched in October 2017. We have good momentum to build upon in 2018.”\nQ4 17 Segment Results\n(in millions USD) Net Sales Operating Income (Loss) Q4 17 Q4 16 Reported\n% Change\nConstant Currency\n% Change\nQ4 17 Q4 16 % Change Europe $ 144.1 $ 135.3 6.5 % (0.1 )% $ 9.0 $ 9.6 (6.0 )% NA/HME 79.4 85.2 (6.9 ) (7.3 ) (8.6 ) (13.8 ) 38.0 IPG 13.8 14.7 (6.2 ) (6.3 ) 1.3 1.2 2.2 Asia/Pacific 13.1 11.5 14.2 13.9 0.1 0.2 (17.8 ) Europe - Compared to the fourth quarter 2016, the slight decline in constant currency net sales was driven primarily by respiratory products, partially offset by increases in mobility and seating products. Sequential net sales decreased 1.7% compared to the third quarter 2017, which is historically the strongest quarter for the Europe segment. Operating income decreased compared to the fourth quarter 2016 principally due to unfavorable manufacturing variances, including one-time costs related to the company's decision to move certain production from Sweden to France, and increased freight and warranty expenses. These factors were partially offset by favorable net sales mix.\nNorth America/Home Medical Equipment (NA/HME) - Constant currency net sales decreased in all categories compared to the fourth quarter 2016, though mostly in lifestyle and respiratory products. Excluding consumer power products that were discontinued in the fourth quarter 2016, mobility and seating sales increased by 5.4% compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Sequential net sales were flat compared to the third quarter 2017 with growth in mobility and seating and respiratory products offset by declines in lifestyle products. Operating loss improved compared to the fourth quarter 2016 primarily related to lower SG&A and research and development expenses, as well as favorable manufacturing variances, partially offset by year-end promotional efforts. The SG&A decline was driven by reduced product liability expense and employment costs.\nInstitutional Products Group (IPG) - Constant currency net sales decreased compared to the fourth quarter 2016, primarily in bed products. Compared to the third quarter 2017, sequential net sales decreased 1.1%. The segment continued to work through its customer mix shift within the long-term care channel. Operating income increased due to reduced SG&A expense and favorable sales mix.\nAsia/Pacific - Constant currency net sales increased in all product categories compared to the fourth quarter 2016, principally related to mobility and seating products. Compared to the third quarter 2017, sequential net sales decreased 3.6%. Operating income was down slightly as a result of unfavorable net sales mix offset by reduced research and development expenses.\nFinancial Condition\nKey balances on the company's balance sheet and related metrics:\n(in millions USD) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 $ Change\n% Change Cash and cash equivalents $ 176.5 $ 124.2 $ 52.3 42.1 % Working capital (1) 238.9 188.2 50.7 26.9 Total debt (2) 301.4 196.5 104.9 53.4 Long-term debt (2) 299.4 181.2 118.2 65.2 Total shareholders' equity 423.3 422.4 0.9 0.2 Credit agreement borrowing availability (3) 39.9 44.3 (4.4 ) (9.9 ) (1)\nCurrent assets less current liabilities.\n(2)\nLong-term debt and total debt includes debt issuance costs recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability and debt discounts classified as debt or equity.\n(3)\nReflects the combined availability of the company's North American and European asset-based revolving credit facilities. The change in borrowing availability is due to changes in the calculated borrowing base.\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, the company generated $20.6 million of free cash flow compared to usage of $10.6 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter 2017 was driven by reduced inventory and accounts receivable, and increased accounts payable.\nThe company's cash and debt balances increased compared to December 31, 2016 as a result of the net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible debt in the second quarter 2017. Total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $270.0 million in convertible debt and $31.4 million of other debt, principally capital lease liabilities. Long-term debt as of December 31, 2017 included unamortized debt discount of $50.3 million and additional offset for debt fees of $7.7 million related to convertible debt issued in 2016 and 2017. The company had zero drawn on its revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2017.\nThe company's cash conversion days (g) at December 31, 2017 were 67.1 days as compared to 81.9 days at September 30, 2017 and 63.6 days at December 31, 2016. The reduction in cash conversion days compared to third quarter 2017 benefited from reduced inventory levels and increased accounts payable as the result of the company's focus on improving working capital. The increase in cash conversion days compared to 2016 is primarily attributable to increased accounts receivable primarily from customer mix and sales growth.\nAs a result of the new U.S. tax reform legislation, the company recorded a non-cash tax benefit of $1.6 million related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter 2017. The company provisionally does not expect to have a deemed repatriation transition tax liability. The company will provide a complete analysis of its tax liabilities in its Form 10-K filing in March 2018. At December 31, 2017, the company has a U.S. federal tax loss carryforward in excess of $280 million.\nOutlook\nThe company has been executing a multi-year strategic transformation of its overall approach to quality, product mix, commercial execution, supply chain, and product development. Following the stabilization of net sales after several quarters of transformation work, the company anticipates continued improvement in the NA/HME segment. The company expects increased working capital to support growth, especially of NA/HME mobility and seating products, which would include investments in demonstration units and the working capital needed to support the extended Quote: -to-cash process for power wheelchairs. Also, the company will make additional restructuring and capital investments as it continues to reshape the business over the course of 2018.\nAs noted previously, the company is gradually applying the transformation to the Europe segment, which may slightly reduce the segment's net sales as it begins to shift its product mix toward more clinically valued, higher-margin products. Regarding the IPG segment, the company expects its new strategic selling approach in the capital selling environment to continue to take time to yield growth. In its pursuit of increased shareholder value, the company continues to prioritize its emphasis on a culture of quality excellence and achieving its long-term earnings potential.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAs previously announced, the company will provide a conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 8, 2018 at 8:30 AM ET for investors and other interested parties to review its fourth quarter 2017 financial results.
