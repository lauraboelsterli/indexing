    "text": "CAPE TOWN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - South Africaâ€™s ruling ANC party said on Wednesday it wanted the reading of the budget to go ahead as scheduled next Wednesday despite the political uncertainty caused by its order to President Jacob Zuma to step down as head of state.\nThe African National Congress chief whip Jackson Mthembu said if political events were to delay the presentation of the budget, the party would ensure that it is delivered not later than the second week of March.
