Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures presented can be found in the \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section, below.\n\"Our team produced a very strong ending to an eventful year,\" said John Forney, President & CEO of UPC Insurance. \"Earnings for the quarter were the largest in Company history, and all our businesses had excellent momentum as we entered 2018. We are working hard to build on that momentum during the rest of the year.\"\nReturn on Equity and Core Return on Equity\nReturn on Equity is a ratio the Company calculates by dividing the net income for the most recent twelve months by the average stockholder's equity for the most recent twelve months. Core Return on Equity (see calculation below) is a ratio calculated using non-GAAP measures. It is calculated by dividing the core income for the most recent twelve months by the average stockholders’ equity for the most recent twelve months. Core income is an after-tax non-GAAP measure that is calculated by excluding from net income the effect of non-cash amortization of intangible assets, special items such as merger-related professional fees, and realized gains or losses on the Company's investment portfolio. In the opinion of the Company’s management, core income, core income per share and core return on equity are meaningful indicators to investors of the Company's underwriting and operating results, since the excluded items are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Internally, the Company’s management uses core income, core income per share and core return on equity to evaluate performance against historical results and establish financial targets on a consolidated basis. The table above reconciles core income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n($ in thousands) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 27,001 $ (10,517 ) $ 10,145 $ 5,698 Return on equity based on GAAP net income (loss) (1) 23.9 % (16.8 )% 2.2 % 2.4 % Core income (loss) $ 32,992 $ (8,503 ) $ 34,869 $ 12,562 Core return on equity (1) 29.2 % (13.6 )% 7.7 % 5.0 % (1) Return on equity for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is calculated on an annualized basis.

(4) Underlying combined ratio, a measure that is not based on GAAP, is reconciled above to the combined ratio, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures presented can be found in \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section, below.\n(5) Included in both the expense ratio and the combined ratio are $9.8 million and $38.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $3.2 million and $11.1 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively, of merger professional fees and amortization expense predominately associated with the AmCo Holding Company (AmCo) and Interboro Insurance Company mergers. Excluding these additional expenses, the Company would have reported underlying combined ratios of 81.6% and 78.9% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and 84.2% and 85.1% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Quarterly Financial Results\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $27.0 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $10.5 million, or a $0.49 loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to the increase in gross premiums earned and improvement in the Company's underlying loss ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company's total gross written premium increased by $85.3 million, or 51.1%, to $252.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $167.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting the Company's merger with AmCo on April 3, 2017, as well as organic growth in new and renewal business generated in all regions. The breakdown of the quarter-over-quarter changes in both direct written and assumed premiums by region and gross written premium by line of business are shown in the table below.\n($ in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Change $ Change % Direct Written and Assumed Premium by Region (1) Florida $ 135,388 $ 68,697 $ 66,691 97.1 % Gulf 45,835 40,582 5,253 12.9 Northeast 38,871 35,351 3,520 10.0 Southeast 22,042 20,231 1,811 9.0 Total direct written premium by region 242,136 164,861 77,275 46.9 % Assumed premium (2) 10,304 2,242 8,062 359.6 Total gross written premium by region $ 252,440 $ 167,103 $ 85,337 51.1 % Gross Written Premium by Line of Business Personal property $ 181,123 $ 160,399 $ 20,724 12.9 % Commercial property 71,317 6,704 64,613 963.8 Total gross written premium by line of business $ 252,440 $ 167,103 $ 85,337 51.1 % (1) \"Gulf\" is comprised of Hawaii, Louisiana and Texas; \"Northeast\" is comprised of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island; and \"Southeast\" is comprised of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. (2) Assumed premium written for 2017 includes commercial property business assumed from an unaffiliated insurer and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (TWIA) and 2016 premium assumed includes homeowners' business from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens) and TWIA. Loss and LAE decreased by $26.6 million, or 26.9%, to $72.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $98.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Loss and LAE expense as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 38.1 points to 43.4% for the quarter, compared to 81.5% for the same period last year. Excluding catastrophe losses and reserve development, the Company's gross underlying loss and LAE ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been 25.7%, a decrease of 6.9 points from 32.6% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPolicy acquisition costs increased by $16.6 million, or 49.4%, to $50.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $33.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The primary driver of the increase in costs was the result of the managing general agent fees related to AmCo commercial premiums. The remaining change was the result of policy acquisition costs varying directly with changes in gross premiums earned and were generally consistent with the Company's growth in premium production and higher average market commission rates outside of Florida.\nOperating and underwriting expenses increased by $3.5 million, or 66.5%, to $8.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased costs related to the Company's ongoing growth, incurred expenses related to software improvements and costs related to the increase in underwriting reports.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $11.7 million, or 104.8%, to $22.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to amortization costs related to the merger with AmCo.\nYear to Date Financial Results\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $10.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.7 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross premiums earned and improvement in the Company's underlying loss ratio.\nThe Company's total gross written premium increased by $332.7 million, or 47.0%, to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $708.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the Company's merger with AmCo on April 3, 2017, as well as organic growth in new and renewal business generated in the Company's Gulf and Northeast regions.

(2) Assumed premium written for 2017 includes commercial property business assumed from an unaffiliated insurer and TWIA and 2016 premium assumed includes homeowners' business from Citizens and TWIA. Loss and LAE increased by $67.2 million, or 22.5%, to $365.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $298.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Loss and LAE expense as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 2.9 points to 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 65.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding catastrophe losses and reserve development, the Company's gross underlying loss and LAE ratio for the year would have been 25.5%, a decrease of 8.3 points from 33.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company's catastrophe losses included claims from Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall as a category 4 storm in Texas, and Hurricane Irma, which was also a category 4 storm making landfall in Florida. The Company's catastrophe excess of loss and quota share reinsurance limited retained losses to $83.0 million.\nPolicy acquisition costs increased by $57.8 million, or 49.1%, to $175.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the increase in costs was the result of the managing general agent fees paid to AmRisc in relation to AmCo commercial premium. The remaining change was the result of policy acquisition costs varying directly with changes in gross premiums earned and were generally consistent with the Company's growth in premium production and higher average market commission rates outside of Florida.\nOperating and underwriting expenses increased by $7.2 million, or 34.8%, to $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased costs related to the Company's ongoing growth, incurred expenses related to software improvements and costs related to the increase in underwriting reports.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $38.8 million, or 90.3%, to $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to amortization costs related to the merger with AmCo.\nCombined Ratio Analysis\nThe calculations of the Company's loss ratios and underlying loss ratios are shown below.\n($ in thousands) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Loss and LAE $ 72,137 $ 98,738 $ (26,601 ) $ 365,535 $ 298,353 $ 67,182 % of Gross earned premiums 26.3 % 54.2 % (27.9 ) pts 37.1 % 44.7 % (7.6 ) pts % of Net earned premiums 43.4 % 81.5 % (38.1 ) pts 62.4 % 65.3 % (2.9 ) pts Less: Current year catastrophe losses $ 1,399 $ 31,957 $ (30,558 ) $ 116,424 $ 55,842 $ 60,582 Prior year reserve unfavorable (favorable) development 206 7,403 (7,197 ) (2,613 ) 16,988 (19,601 ) Underlying Loss and LAE (1) $ 70,532 $ 59,378 $ 11,154 $ 251,724 $ 225,523 $ 26,201 % of Gross earned premiums 25.7 % 32.6 % (6.9 ) pts 25.5 % 33.8 % (8.3 ) pts % of Net earned premiums 42.4 % 49.0 % (6.6 ) pts 43.0 % 49.4 % (6.4 ) pts (1) Underlying Loss and LAE is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled above to Net Loss and LAE, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures presented can be found in the \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section, below.\nReinsurance Costs as a % of Earned Premium\nExcluding the Company's flood business, for which it cedes 100% of the risk of loss, reinsurance costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 37.6% of gross premiums earned, compared to 30.8% of gross premiums earned for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in this ratio was driven primarily by the Company's quota share reinsurance program, which was in effect for two months in the fourth quarter of 2017 but for only one month during the fourth quarter of 2016. If not for the effects of the quota share reinsurance program, the Company's reinsurance costs as a percent of earned premium would have decreased by 4.1 points during the quarter.\nInvestment Portfolio Highlights\nThe Company's cash and investment holdings totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to $679.3 million at December 31, 2016. UPC Insurance's cash and investment holdings consist of investments in U.S. Government and agency securities, corporate debt and 100% investment grade money market instruments. Fixed maturities represented approximately 76.9% of total investments at December 31, 2017 with a modified duration of 3.9 years compared to 85.3% at December 31, 2016 with a modified duration of 3.7 years.\nBook Value Analysis\nBook value per share increased 12.6% from $11.15 at December 31, 2016, to $12.56 at December 31, 2017, and underlying book value per share increased 11.2% from $11.11 at December 31, 2016 to $12.35 at December 31, 2017. An increase in the Company's retained earnings, along with an increase in paid in capital as a result of the AmCo merger, drove the increase in our book value per share and underlying book value per share. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, as shown in the table below, also impacted our underlying book value per share.\n($ in thousands, except for per share data) December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Book Value per Share Numerator: Common stockholders' equity $ 537,125 $ 241,327 Denominator: Total Shares Outstanding 42,753,054 21,646,614 Book Value Per Common Share $ 12.56 $ 11.15 Book Value per Share, Excluding the Impact of Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (AOCI)\nNumerator: Common stockholders' equity $ 537,125 $ 241,327 Accumulated other comprehensive income 9,221 822 Stockholders' Equity, excluding AOCI $ 527,904 $ 240,505 Denominator: Total Shares Outstanding 42,753,054 21,646,614 Underlying Book Value Per Common Share (1) $ 12.35 $ 11.11 (1) Underlying book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure and is reconciled above to book value per common share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures presented can be found in the \"Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures\" section, below.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe believe that investors' understanding of UPC Insurance's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP measures. Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nCombined ratio excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses, prior year reserve development and ceding commission income earned (underlying combined ratio) is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses, prior year development, and ceding commission income earned related to the Company's quota share reinsurance agreement from the combined ratio. The Company believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by current year catastrophe losses, losses from lines in run-off, prior year development, and ceding commission income earned. Current year catastrophe losses cause the Company's loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio. Prior year development is caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Ceding commission income compensates the Company for expenses it incurs in generating the premium ceded under the Company's quota share reinsurance agreement. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most direct comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio should not be considered as a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\nNet Loss and LAE excluding the effects of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development (underlying Loss and LAE) is a non-GAAP measure which is computed by subtracting the effect of current year catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development from Loss and LAE. The Company uses underlying loss and LAE figures to analyze the Company's loss trends that may be impacted by current year catastrophe losses and prior year development on the Company's reserves. As discussed previously, these two items can have a significant impact on the Company's loss trends in a given period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most direct comparable GAAP measure is net loss and LAE. The underlying loss and LAE measure should not be considered a substitute for net losses and LAE and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\nOperating Expenses excluding the effects of ceding commission income earned, merger expenses, and amortization of intangible assets (underlying expense) is a non-GAAP measure which is computed by subtracting ceding income earned related to the Company's quota share reinsurance agreement, merger expenses and amortization of intangibles. Ceding commission income compensates the Company for expenses it incurs in generating the premium ceded under the Company's quota share reinsurance agreement. Merger expenses are directly related to past mergers and are not reflective of current period operating performance. Similarly, amortization expense is related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired through mergers and therefore the expense does not arise through normal operations. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most direct comparable GAAP measure is operating expenses. The underlying expense measure should not be considered a substitute for the expense ratio and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\nNet Income excluding the effects of merger expenses, non-cash amortization of intangible assets and realized gains (losses), net of tax (core income) is a non-GAAP measure which is computed by adding merger expenses, net of tax, and amortization, net of tax, to net income and subtracting realized gains (losses) on our investment portfolio net of tax, from net income. Merger expenses are directly related to past mergers and are not reflective of current period operating performance. Similarly, amortization expense is related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired through merger and therefore the expense does not arise through normal operations. Investment portfolio gains (losses) vary independent of the Company's operations. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance. The most direct comparable GAAP measure is net income. The core income measure should not be considered a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business.\nConference Call Details\nDate and Time:\nFebruary 21, 2018 - 4:30 P.M.

These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private 1995. These forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” \"endeavor,\" \"project,\" “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “would,” “estimate,” or “continue” or the negative variations thereof or comparable terminology. We believe these statements are based on reasonable estimates, assumptions and plans. However, if the estimates, assumptions or plans underlying the forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements may be found in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the “Risk Factors” section in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 REVENUE:\nGross premiums written $ 252,440 $ 167,103 $ 1,040,848 $ 708,156 Decrease (increase) in gross unearned premiums 21,933 15,119 (54,825 ) (41,327 ) Gross premiums earned 274,373 182,222 986,023 666,829 Ceded premiums earned (108,178 ) (61,061 ) (400,533 ) (209,898 ) Net premiums earned 166,195 121,161 585,490 456,931 Investment income 5,323 2,893 17,812 10,679 Net realized gains 621 69 67 547 Other revenue 10,447 7,310 51,051 18,960 Total revenues\n$ 182,586 $ 131,433 $ 654,420 $ 487,117 EXPENSES: Losses and loss adjustment expenses 72,137 98,738 365,535 298,353 Policy acquisition costs 50,142 33,572 175,444 117,658 Operating expenses 8,655 5,198 27,675 20,524 General and administrative expenses 22,937 11,197 81,762 42,956 Interest expense 965 326 3,247 723 Total expenses\n154,836 149,031 653,663 480,214 Income (loss) before other income 27,750 (17,598 ) 757 6,903 Other income 59 20 153 100 Income (loss) before income taxes 27,809 (17,578 ) 910 7,003 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 808 (7,061 ) (9,235 ) 1,305 Net income (loss) $ 27,001 $ (10,517 ) $ 10,145 $ 5,698 OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Change in net unrealized gains (losses) on investments 138 (10,934 ) 10,647 (629 ) Reclassification adjustment for net realized investment\ngains\n(621 ) (69 ) (67 ) (547 ) Income tax benefit (expense) related to items of other\ncomprehensive income\n2,026 4,154 (2,181 ) 378 Total comprehensive income (loss) $ 28,544 $ (17,366 ) $ 18,544 $ 4,900 Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 42,526,045 21,449,910 37,152,768 21,417,486 Diluted 42,753,303 21,645,141 37,375,340 21,614,443 Earnings per share Basic $ 0.63 $ (0.49 ) $ 0.27 $ 0.27 Diluted $ 0.63 $ (0.49 ) $ 0.27 $ 0.26 Dividends declared per share $ 0.06 $ 0.06 $ 0.24 $ 0.23 Consolidated Balance Sheets\nIn thousands, except share amounts\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nASSETS Investments available for sale, at fair value: Fixed maturities $ 762,855 $ 494,516 Equity securities 63,295 28,398 Other investments 28,381 5,733 Short-term investments 137,115 50,785 Total investments $ 991,646 $ 579,432 Cash 139,160 99,903 Accrued investment income 5,577 3,735 Property and equipment, net 17,291 17,860 Premiums receivable, net 75,275 38,883 Reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses 395,774 24,028 Prepaid reinsurance premiums 201,904 132,564 Goodwill 73,045 14,254 Deferred policy acquisition costs 103,882 65,473 Intangible assets 45,271 12,371 Other assets 11,096 11,183 Total Assets $ 2,059,921 $ 999,686 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Liabilities: Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 482,232 $ 140,855 Unearned premiums 555,873 372,223 Reinsurance payable 149,117 99,891 Payments outstanding 41,786 21,933 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 46,594 26,124 Other liabilities 85,830 43,158 Notes payable 161,364 54,175 Total Liabilities $ 1,522,796 $ 758,359 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' Equity: Preferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 1,000,000 authorized; none issued or\noutstanding\n— — Common stock, $0.0001 par value; 50,000,000 shares authorized; 42,965,137 and\n21,858,697 issued; 42,753,054 and 21,646,614 outstanding, respectively\n4 2 Additional paid-in capital 387,145 99,353 Treasury shares, at cost; 212,083 shares (431 ) (431 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 9,221 822 Retained earnings 141,186 141,581 Total Stockholders' Equity $ 537,125 $ 241,327 Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity $ 2,059,921 $ 999,686\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006278/en/\nUnited Insurance Holdings Corp.\nJessica Strathman\nSEC Reporting Manager\n727-895-7737\njstrathman@upcinsurance.com\nOR\nINVESTOR RELATIONS:\nThe Equity Group\nAdam Prior\nSenior Vice-President\n212-836-9606\naprior@equityny.com\nSource: United Insurance Holdings Corp.",
