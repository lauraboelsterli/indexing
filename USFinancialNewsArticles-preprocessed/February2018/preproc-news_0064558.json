    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ) could play a role in the consolidation of Italy’s banking sector under the right conditions, a top Treasury official said on Wednesday.\nFabrizio Pagani said on the sidelines of a conference it was to be hoped that Italy’s banks became involved in a process of consolidation.\nBut he said he was not aware of any ongoing merger talks involving Monte dei Paschi which last year was rescued by the state.\nWhen asked who the Tuscan bank could tie up with, Pagani said “it’s too early to say”.\nEconomy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told La Stampa newspaper on Saturday Monte dei Paschi was on the right track but that there were no plans to merge it with a rival.\nReporting by Elisa Anzolin, writing by Stephen Jewkes; editing by Agnieszka Flak\n ",
