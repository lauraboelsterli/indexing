    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) said on Friday it would recall 11,700 cars to fix their engine management software after it discovered that the wrong programming had been installed on its luxury 5- and 7-Series models.\n“In the course of internal tests, the BMW Group has discovered that a correctly developed software update was mistakenly assigned to certain unsuitable model-versions,” the company said in a statement.\n“The BMW Group informed the relevant authorities immediately.”\nBMW issued the statement after a report in news weekly Der Spiegel suggested it had installed software that manipulated emissions of harmful gases such as nitrogen oxide, something its management has always denied.\nCompetitor Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) reached a multi-billion-dollar U.S. settlement after admitting installing so-called “defeat devices” on its diesel models designed to game emissions tests.\nVW has been roiled by the “Dieselgate” emissions scandal, which has forced it to set aside 25.8 billion euros ($31.7 billion) to cover fines and related costs, of which it has paid out nearly 20 billion euros.\nBMW said the models affected were 5- and 7-Series cars made between 2012 and 2017 containing high-performance diesel engines and three turbo chargers.\nBMW did not say where the cars were but said it would cooperate with the relevant authorities on further steps.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Writing by Douglas Busvine, editing by David Evans\n ",
