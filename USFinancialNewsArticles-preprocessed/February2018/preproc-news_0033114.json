    "text": "Apple , Amazon.com and Netflix were among the top gainers as stocks rebounded Monday from multi-month lows hit Friday.\nSemiconductor stocks Micron , Lam Research and Advanced Micro Devices also led advancers, as did MercadoLibre , a Latin American e-commerce company.\nSome stocks were moving on company-specific news.\nCSRA soared 31 percent Monday after news General Dynamics would acquire the government IT contractor for $6.8 billion.\nCboe Global Markets gained 3.3 percent Monday, steadying after a drop of 20 percent last week. The exchange reported quarterly results that narrowly missed expectations, after reporting higher expenses.\nSome of the exchange's better known products are focused on market volatility. Many hedge funds and individual investors bet heavily on calm markets, and found themselves on the wrong side of the trade when the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX) spiked to its highest in more than two years Tuesday.\nMajor U.S. stock indexes climbed nearly 5 percent or more Monday from their lows hit Friday, when stocks posted their worst week in two years.\nEvelyn Cheng Writer Robert Hum Producer, CNBC.com Related Securities Symbol Price Change %Change GD --- LRCX --- MU --- AMD --- CSRA --- ",
