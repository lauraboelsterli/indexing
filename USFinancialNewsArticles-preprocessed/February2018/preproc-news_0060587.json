    "text": "JOHNSON CITY, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Banc Intranets , a provider of secure, web-based enterprise content management solutions for financial institutions, announced that Southeastern Credit Union (Valdosta, Ga.) is leveraging its DirectorsLink ® board portal to strengthen director supervision and securely centralize board and committee documents.\nServing more than 29,000 members, Southeastern Credit Union sought board meeting software capable of providing its directors with secure remote access to its monthly board packets and committee documents. The credit union selected DirectorsLink based on the portal’s enhanced compatibility with Apple iPad ® devices; its ability to easily segment access to information based on both role and committee assignments; and the portal’s flexibility in visual customization to match the credit union’s existing branding and color scheme.\n“DirectorsLink is uniquely compatible with Apple iPads, which our credit union recently elected to provide board members in order to improve our monthly meetings and digitize certain processes,” said Michael Gudely, CEO of Southeastern Credit Union. “Not only does the portal provide our directors and committee members with an easy-to-use platform, but it also offers enhanced functionality to streamline meetings, including digital annotations and board polling that can be conducted directly through the portal.”\n“Southeastern Credit Union’s ability to maintain momentum, drive member engagement and see sustainable growth requires flexibility and a high-level of organization from the top-down,” said Mark Anderson, founder and CEO of Banc Intranets. “Utilizing DirectorsLink enables credit union leadership to better manage the many responsibilities and risks inherent to their position, allowing its board to focus on making important decisions that support its membership and their communities.”\nAbout Banc Intranets\nEstablished in 2002, Banc Intranets, LLC is a leading provider of secure, web-based enterprise content management solutions for financial institutions.
