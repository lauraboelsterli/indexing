    "text": "(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday signed into law a bill strongly opposed by hospitals and physician groups that extends the statute of limitations for cancer-related medical malpractice lawsuits.\nKnown as Lavernâ€™s Law, the bill provides patients with a two-and-a-half year timeframe to bring a malpractice claim from when they discover an error or a missed diagnosis involving cancer. The law is named after Brooklyn resident Lavern Wilkinson, who died in 2013 at age 41 after doctors failed to detect that she had a curable form of lung cancer.\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2nu5PIz\n ",
