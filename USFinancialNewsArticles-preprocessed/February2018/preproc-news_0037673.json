    "text": "MILWAUKEE, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- EnSync, Inc. (NYSE American: ESNC), dba EnSync Energy Systems (\"EnSync Energy\") , a leading developer of innovative distributed energy resources (DERs), today announced second quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Highlights\nRevenue during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 179% to $4.8 million compared to $1.7 million in the year ago period, with revenue largely being contributed by 8 power purchase agreement (\"PPA\") projects; Gross margins improved to 24.2% during the second quarter compared to 0.3% in the year ago quarter, and gross margins of 12.5% in the immediately preceding quarter as the Company becomes more efficient and profitable on its PPA construction and sales efforts; Closed the largest single sale in company history, a PPA for a large multi-residential property on Oahu; Completed commissioning of Time Warner project at a key data center site on the island of Hawaii and commenced operation of two additional projects on the island of Oahu; Signed PPAs for three additional Hawaii projects including a PPA with the Polynesian Cultural Center, a top tourist attraction in Hawaii, operated by the Brigham Young University Hawaii campus; Received a purchase order for a Micro-Utility system that will ship to East Africa, the first order for EnSync on the continent; Shipped a repeat order Matrix Energy Management system to Schneider Electric; Sold our Menomonee Falls building for net proceeds of $1.7 million; and Signed a Partnership Agreement with Lower Electric LLC for rapid entry into the high growth Illinois renewables market.\nManagement Discussion\n\"We are now solidly engaged in driving sales across several different markets,\" commented, Brad Hansen, CEO of EnSync Energy. \"Specifically, we continue to make progress in our commercial and industrial (\"C&I\") markets in Hawaii and California, where we have 13 PPA projects in our backlog in various stages of execution. We recently sold the single largest C&I PPA project in EnSync Energy's history and have a number of others in our pipeline. In addition to our C&I opportunities, we are advancing our focus on the independent utility market where we recently announced an order for a micro-utility system in East Africa, and announced today's partnership with Lower Electric which is expected to enable us to enter the evolving Illinois market later this year. Finally, we are maintaining our focus on power electronic system sales where we continue to ship systems to Schneider Electric. Each of these market areas have the potential to dramatically increase Company revenues and margins, and our prospects for future growth remain very positive.\"\n\"We continue to perform well on selling and constructing PPA projects. Our gross margins in the second quarter of 24.2% were above our stated expectations of 10% to 20% as we enhanced efficiencies in the procurement, construction and sale process. Given the success we have had, we're now confident enough in our execution to adjust the gross margin target range to 15% to 25% going forward.\"\n\"Overall, we're extremely happy with our performance in the second quarter which is arguably the best operating quarterly performance in the Company's history. Our products and execution are yielding great results which we'll look to build upon going forward. With the success we have achieved with our existing markets, and now with new markets, partners, products and services being regularly announced, we feel it's a very exciting time at EnSync,\" Hansen concluded.\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $4.8 million compared to $1.7 million in the year ago period. Revenue during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 quarter was largely derived from PPA contracts in Hawaii that are recognized on a percent of completion basis. In addition to the PPA sales, revenue was also recognized from system sales of the Company's MatrixÂ® Energy Management system and DER Flex TM platform.\nGross margins improved to 24.2% during the second quarter compared to 0.3% in the year ago quarter, and compares to gross margins of 12.5% in the immediately preceding first quarter. The improved gross margin is attributable to the elimination of numerous non-recurring charges incurred in the year ago period as part of entering the market with this new PPA business model, and further efficiencies in the procurement, construction and sale process. In particular, the margin improvement was primarily driven by lower procurement costs on certain PPA projects in the final stages of construction and favorable margin on a PPA project sold in the second quarter. The Company's expectation is that gross profit margins on future PPA sales should be between 15% and 25%.\nAdvanced Engineering and Development costs were $1.2 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.1 million in the year ago period. Selling, General and Administrative expenses decreased to $2.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $3.0 million in the year ago period due to decreases in legal expenses and stock-based compensation. Total Advanced Engineering and Development costs and Selling, General and Administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation of $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively) was $3.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $3.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company intends to hold at or below these levels going forward.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders was $(2.6) million, or $(0.05) per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $(4.4) million, or $(0.09) per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nCash balance at December 31, 2017 was $5.9 million compared to $9.1 million at September 30, 2017.\nEstimated backlog value for PPA projects, components and systems as of the date of this announcement is approximately $11.4 million.\nConference Call Information\nDate: Tuesday, February 13, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. CT)\nDomestic participant dial in #: (877) 283-0524 or (412) 317-5232\nConference code #: 10116984\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
