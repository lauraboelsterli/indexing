    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday said he saw a “a good chance” of rapprochement between Poland and the European Union.\nJuncker said he had spoken “at length” with the Polish prime minister and the EU’s deputy head had also held meetings with Polish counterparts in recent days.\n“We are keeping up our dialogue and I think there is a good chance the Polish positions will move toward ours,” Juncker told a news conference on Wednesday.\nThe EU executive deployed Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty for the first time in December, giving Warsaw three months to reverse judicial reforms. If it does not, the executive could call on other member states to prepare sanctions.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel\n ",
