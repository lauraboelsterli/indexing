    "text": "102 COMMENTS Public-school teachers in West Virginia went on strike Thursday, shutting schools across the state, as unions rejected pay and benefits proposals by state lawmakers.\nThe walkouts affected some 270,000 students, according to the latest enrollment figures from the state Education Department. The department had announced school closures for all 55 counties in the state Wednesday night.\nA second day of walkouts was planned for Friday. The strike appeared to be the most widespread in the state’s history. In 1990, a teacher walkout shut schools in 47 counties for 11 days.\nThe state’s two main teachers unions have rejected pay increases proposed by the state legislature. A House bill passed this week would grant the state’s teachers a 2% raise this year and a 1% increase in each of the next two years.\nAnother sticking point for unions is rising health-care costs at the state Public Employees Insurance Agency. A House bill would freeze premiums and benefits for a year, by diverting $29 million in funding to the statewide public-employee insurance plan.\nMore U.S. News\nEducation Bill Brings Out Unusual Lobbying Suspects February 23, 2018 U.S. Colleges Are Separating Into Winners and Losers February 21, 2018 Trump Administration Looking at Bankruptcy Options for Student Debt February 20, 2018 The Rise of the Jumbo Student Loan February 16, 2018 “The problem is it’s only a one year fix,” said Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association. “It doesn’t address the real issue, which is continued cost increases and continuing to fund it on the backs of the employees.”\nRepublican House Speaker Tim Armstead said the pay increase was the largest teachers had seen in decades. “This is a strong package that represents our commitment to making our teachers and public employees our top priority,” he said.\nRepublican Gov. Jim Justice said earlier this month it would be a “crying shame” if teachers went on strike over pay and benefits. A spokesman for the governor couldn’t immediately be reached to comment.\nThe state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, called the work stoppage illegal and said his office would support “ any relevant state agency or board with legal remedies they may choose to pursue to uphold the law.\"\nMr. Lee of the teachers union said members were aware of the attorney general’s statement but decided to proceed with the strike. “We’ll deal with the legal issues as they come,” he said.\nThere are roughly 19,000 teachers in the state, including 15,000 who are unionized, Mr. Lee said. He said teachers last received a raise in 2014.\nStarting teachers in West Virginia earn $32,435 a year on average, and the average teacher salary is $44,701, according to the West Virginia Education Association.\nWrite to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com",
