    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ION Geophysical Corporation (NYSE: IO) today announced the successful completion of a public equity offering to begin delevering its business. ION issued and sold 1,820,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $27.50 per share, and warrants to purchase an additional 1,820,000 shares of ION's common stock. The net proceeds from this offering were $47,547,500, excluding transaction expenses. The net proceeds will primarily be used to retire ION's third lien indentures of $28,500,000 on or prior to the May 15, 2018 maturity date and for general corporate purposes. The warrants have an exercise price of $33.60 per share, are immediately exercisable and expire on March 21, 2019. If the warrants are exercised in full prior to their expiration, ION would receive additional proceeds of $61,152,000.\n\"The successful equity offering is not only an endorsement of our asset light strategy, but also a recognition of the velocity in our business and our underlying value,\" stated Brian Hanson, ION's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"While we had sufficient liquidity to retire the third lien bond maturing this May, these additional funds will further strengthen our balance sheet and enable us to be opportunistic and support continued diversification into adjacent markets. I'm really pleased with the transaction. The combination of the capital we raised today plus the potential exercise of the warrants in the next 13 months, along with our current liquidity and free cash flow throughout 2018, should position us with excess cash by early 2019 well in advance of the second lien indentures coming due in 2021.\"\nAbout ION\nION develops and leverages innovative technologies, creating value through data capture, analysis and optimization to enhance critical decision-making, enabling superior returns.
