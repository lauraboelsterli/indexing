Products segment revenue grew 1 percent. Services segment revenue grew 10 percent with growth in every region. Managed and Support Services grew 17 percent. Operating margin - GAAP operating margin was 26.1 percent of revenue compared with 21.4 percent in the year-ago quarter driven by higher revenue in the current quarter as well as higher restructuring charges in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.4 percent of revenue, compared with 28.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. Improved non-GAAP results reflect higher revenue and associated earnings. Taxes - The GAAP effective tax rate was 223.4 percent, compared to 32.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. Charges related to tax reform accounted for $874 million of GAAP tax expense for the quarter. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.8 percent compared with 30.7 percent in the year-ago quarter, resulting in higher non-GAAP tax expense of $11 million. Cash flow - The company generated $761 million in operating cash, up $248 million from the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow 3 was $740 million, up $287 million. The cash flow was driven by higher operating earnings and improved working capital performance. Capital Allocation - The company repurchased $125 million of its common stock and paid $76 million in cash dividends.\nOTHER SELECT FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue - Revenue increased 6 percent including acquisitions. Organic revenue growth was 3 percent led by North America organic growth of 3 percent. Products segment revenue grew 3 percent led by higher North America system revenue, while the Services segment grew 9 percent on Managed and Support Services growth in all regions. Operating margin - For the full year, GAAP operating margin was 20.1 percent of revenue, compared with 17.7 percent for the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.3 percent of revenue, compared with 23.6 percent for the prior year, driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses. Taxes - The 2017 GAAP effective tax rate was 114.1 percent, compared to 33.5 percent for the prior year. Charges related to tax reform accounted for $874 million of GAAP tax expense for the year.

Backlog - The company ended the year with record backlog of $9.6 billion, up $1.2 billion from the year-ago quarter. Products segment backlog was up 25 percent or $382 million, and Services was up 13 percent or $860 million.

As a result of the highlighted items identified during Q4 2017, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations within our GAAP Consolidated Statement of Operations, while reporting income on a non-GAAP basis. An adjustment is shown to reflect the dilution of 7.2 million dilutive shares outstanding in Q4 2017.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nIn addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nOrganic Revenue: Reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters. Management believes organic revenue helps it and investors better identify the underlying trends of established and ongoing operations by excluding the effects of acquisitions which can obscure period to period comparisons.\nHighlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related transaction costs, tangible and intangible asset impairments, restructuring charges, non-cash pension adjustments, significant litigation and other contingencies, significant gains and losses on investments, and the income tax effects of significant tax matters, including recently enacted tax reform legislation, from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. For the purposes of management's internal analysis over operating performance, the company uses financial statements that exclude highlighted items, as these charges do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.\nShare-based compensation expense: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.\nIntangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its Non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements, primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.\nDetails of the above items and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.\nBUSINESS RISKS\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable federal securities law.

Total Highlighted Items $ 5.50 $ 6.38 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ 2.10 $ 5.46 * Under U.S. GAAP, the accounting for a net loss from continuing operations results in the presentation of dilutive earnings per share equal to basic earnings per share, as any increase in basic shares would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share. As a result of the highlighted items identified during Q4 2017, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 within our GAAP Consolidated Statement of Operations, while reporting income on a non-GAAP basis over the same periods. An adjustment is reflected to correct for the dilution of 7.2 million dilutive shares outstanding in Q4 2017 and 6.4 million dilutive shares outstanding for the full of 2017.\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201006508/en/\nMEDIA CONTACT\nTama McWhinney\nMotorola Solutions\n+1 847-538-1865\ntama.mcwhinney@motorolasolutions.com\nor\nINVESTOR CONTACT\nChris Kutsor\nMotorola Solutions\n+1 847-576-4995\nchris.kutsor@motorolasolutions.com\nSource: Motorola Solutions, Inc.",
