Adjusted subscription backlog, together with professional services revenue guidance, provides 90% coverage of total revenue based on the midpoint of our full-year 2018 total revenue guidance range.

Revenue retention rate 5 remained over 99%. Medidata launched its new Strategic Monitoring suite, which is the only industry solution designed to both meet and exceed the newest European regulations for risk management (ICH E6 (R2)). Six enterprise customers have implemented the new suite. In addition, TESARO, a leading oncology biopharmaceutical company selected it in the fourth quarter. Medidata is leading the industry with breakthrough, next-generation data and analytics innovations. In the fourth quarter, the company’s Synthetic Control offering was recognized with a prestigious SCRIP Award for Best Technological Development in Clinical Trials - Sponsor Focused, and named the PM360 Innovation Product of the Year for 2017.\n“I am pleased with our performance in 2017.

We are confident about our long-term opportunity creating value for our customers and shareholders.”\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the full-year 2018, the Company now expects:\nTotal revenue between $624 and $648 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth 6 at the midpoint.

While changes in the stock price could change the fully diluted share count, Medidata is assuming 61 million fully diluted shares.\nThe operating and net income measures above reflect Medidata’s non-GAAP financial guidance and the corresponding GAAP equivalents to its guidance.\nConference Call\nThe company plans to host its investor conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time.

(“Medidata”), including, but not limited to, statements about Medidata’s forecast of financial performance, products and services, business model, strategy and growth opportunities, and competitive position. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. In particular, the risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks associated with possible fluctuations in our financial and operating results; errors, interruptions or delays in our service or our web hosting; integration activities, performance and financial impact of acquired companies; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved versions of our products; changes in our sales and implementation cycles; competition; our ability to retain and expand our customer base or increase new business from those customers; our ability to hire, retain, and motivate our employees and manage our growth; regulatory developments; litigation; and general developments in the economy. For additional disclosure regarding these and other risks faced by Medidata, see disclosures contained in Medidata’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the “Risk Factors” section of Medidata’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. You should consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements included in this press release and not place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and Medidata undertakes no obligation to update such statements as a result of new information.\n(1) Total multi-year subscription backlog is unadjusted for renewals.\n(2) Non-GAAP Financial Information\nMedidata provides non-GAAP operating income, net income, and net income per share applicable to common stockholders data as additional information for its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, wire transaction recovery, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. Adjusted non-GAAP net income excludes the tax-effected impact of amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense, wire transaction recovery, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures, and as an important factor in determining variable compensation. In addition, investors frequently have requested information from management regarding depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation, and management believes, based on discussions with investors, that these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ ability to assess Medidata’s historical and projected future financial performance. While management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. One limitation of non-GAAP operating income is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Medidata compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which are attached to this press release.\n(3) On September 18, 2014, Medidata discovered that it had been the subject of a fraud involving the transfer of $4.8 million to an overseas account. Medidata commenced legal action, alleging that its insurer had wrongly denied coverage with regard to the loss. On July 21, 2017, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Medidata’s motion for summary judgment, and denied the insurer’s motion. In light of this ruling, operating costs and expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2017 include recognition of the amount that is probable to be recovered, up to the amount of the originally recorded loss. Any potential recovery amounts that are in excess of the amount of the loss, such as interest, have not been recognized.\n(4) Adjusted subscription backlog equals subscription backlog plus outstanding intra-year renewals valued at an amount equal to the contracts to be renewed.\n(5) Revenue retention rate is calculated as the percentage of prior year revenue attributable to customers retained in the current year.\n(6) Growth rates based on 2017 revenue after full retrospective adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606. Supplemental information about the anticipated impact of ASC 605 to 606 transition on prior period results is attached to this press release.\n(7) A tabular reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures is attached to this press release.\nMEDIDATA SOLUTIONS, INC.

We exclude these amounts for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating income and adjusted non-GAAP net income because we believe they are not indicative of our continuing operations or meaningful when comparing current to past results. (2) Amount represents the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. (3) Non-cash interest expense includes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs on our 1.00% convertible senior notes issued in 2013 and amortization of issuance costs on our credit agreement entered into in 2017. We exclude this incremental non-cash interest expense for purposes of calculating adjusted non-GAAP net income. We believe that excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because such incremental non-cash interest expense does not generate a cash outflow, nor do the debt issuance costs represent a cash outflow except in the period of issuance; therefore both are not indicative of our continuing operations. (4) Tax impact calculated using a 40% tax rate. The table above presents a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP operating income, net income, and net income per share applicable to common stockholders for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, wire transaction recovery, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. Adjusted non-GAAP net income excludes the tax-affected impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, wire transaction recovery, adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration, and non-cash interest expense.\nMEDIDATA SOLUTIONS, INC.
