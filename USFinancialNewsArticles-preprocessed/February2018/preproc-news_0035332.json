Robb, a seasoned search executive with more than 20 years of experience identifying and placing C-Suite talent in the Healthcare, Private Equity/Venture Capital and Life Sciences sectors, has joined Diversified Search as a Managing Director. Robb will work under the umbrella of San Francisco-based BioQuest, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diversified Search in 2016. She will be based in Boston, where Diversified is opening the first New England office in its history.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Robb (Photo: Business Wire)\n“We are delighted to have such a talented and deeply connected search executive as Molly join the Diversified team,” said Dale E. Jones, the CEO of Diversified Search. “We have no doubt her deep roots, particularly in the Biotechnology and Life Sciences spaces, will be key to making our new Boston office a success and driving our continued impressive growth.”\nRobb comes to Diversified from Horton International, where she served as a Managing Director specializing in recruiting senior-level healthcare investors and operating leaders within Healthcare Private Equity and Venture Capital and both public and private Life Sciences companies. Prior to Horton, she worked in Korn Ferry’s Healthcare Private Equity and Venture Capital practice, splitting her time between the Los Angeles and Boston offices.\nRobb began her search career in Los Angeles as a Search Consultant at Baeder/Murphy & Associates, and later worked as an Associate both at Korn Ferry and at Heidrick & Struggles, in San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively. She was then named Search Director at Ken Clark International in Newport Beach, California. Following that, she moved east, where she has lived for the past thirteen years.\n“I am enthusiastic about Boston’s thriving innovation economy,” Robb said, “and the synergy that can be generated by coupling the firm’s deep network within the Medical Device, Healthcare Services, and Board of Director sectors with my passion for working with healthcare investors and operators within Biotechnology and Healthcare Private Equity and Venture Capital.”\nDiversified’s new office will officially open April 1 inside 60 State Street, located in the busy Government Center section of the city.\n“We are thrilled to have Molly as part of the BioQuest family, and to mark the beginning of this exciting chapter in the bustling New England technology corridor,” said Roger Anderson, the co-founder and Managing Director of BioQuest. “Her passion and drive in both the Venture Capital and Biotechnology spaces will be an invaluable asset in our booming Life Sciences practice.”\nABOUT DIVERSIFIED SEARCH\nHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Diversified Search is the largest female-owned and founded firm in the search industry.
