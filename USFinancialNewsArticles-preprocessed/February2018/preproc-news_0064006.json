    "text": "VANCOUVER, Wash., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrett Business Services, Inc. (“BBSI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:BBSI), a leading provider of business management solutions, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nNet revenues up 11% to $244.7 million. Non-GAAP gross revenues up 14% to $1.4 billion. Net income up 30% to $10.5 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.0 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights vs. 2016\nNet revenues up 9% to $920.4 million. Non-GAAP gross revenues up 13% to $5.3 billion. Net income up 34% to $25.2 million, or $3.33 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.8 million, or $2.55 per diluted share.\n“We had a strong finish to a strong year which is setting us up well for 2018 and beyond,” said Michael Elich, president and CEO of BBSI. “We delivered solid growth across all of our markets and added an additional 120 net new clients in the quarter for a total of 693 net new for the year. These results continue to be driven by the value we bring to our clients every day, our better-than-90% retention rate and the width of new business pipelines.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 11% to $244.7 million compared to $221.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal non-GAAP gross revenues in the fourth quarter increased 14% to $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same year-ago quarter (see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below). The increase was primarily due to the continued build in the Company’s PEO client count and same-customer sales growth, which was partially offset by a decrease from staffing revenues.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 30% to $10.5 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.0 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues in 2017 increased 9% to $920.4 million compared to $840.6 million in 2016.\nTotal non-GAAP gross revenues increased 13% to $5.3 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the continued build in the Company’s PEO client count and same-customer sales growth, which was partially offset by a decrease in staffing revenues.\nNet income in 2017 was $25.2 million or $3.33 per diluted share compared to $18.8 million or $2.55 per diluted share in 2016. Net income for 2017 included approximately $0.10 per diluted share in costs associated with accounting and securities law issues compared to $0.69 in 2016.\nOutlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be approximately $4.45. This assumes approximately $0.06 per diluted share in estimated costs associated with outstanding accounting and securities law issues, as well as a lower effective tax rate of approximately 20% resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nBBSI expects non-GAAP gross revenues for the next 12-month period (through December 31, 2018) to increase approximately 14%.\nConference Call\nBBSI will conduct a conference call tomorrow, February 28, 2018 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.

The gross revenues and cost of revenues information below, although not in accordance with GAAP, is presented for comparison purposes and because management believes such information is more informative as to the level of the Company’s business activity and more useful in managing its operations.\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) Fourth Quarter Ended Year Ended Non-GAAP (in thousands) December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Gross revenues: Professional employer services $ 1,387,389 $ 1,211,584 $ 5,138,298 $ 4,526,225 Staffing services 43,995 44,856 162,386 166,662 Total gross revenues 1,431,384 1,256,440 5,300,684 4,692,887 Gross cost of revenues: Direct payroll costs 1,210,852 1,061,743 4,469,845 3,951,021 Payroll taxes and benefits 100,419 88,334 404,687 357,867 Workers' compensation 71,163 63,026 267,621 238,463 Total gross cost of revenues 1,382,434 1,213,103 5,142,153 4,547,351 Gross margin $ 48,950 $ 43,337 $ 158,531 $ 145,536 A reconciliation of net revenues to non-GAAP gross revenues is as follows:\n(Unaudited) Quarter Ended December 31, Net Revenue Gross Revenue (in thousands) Reporting Method Reporting Method (GAAP)\nNon-GAAP Adjustments (Non-GAAP) 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues: Professional employer services $ 200,731 $ 176,242 $ 1,186,658 $ 1,035,342 $ 1,387,389 $ 1,211,584 Staffing services 43,995 44,856 - - 43,995 44,856 Total revenues $ 244,726 $ 221,098 $ 1,186,658 $ 1,035,342 $ 1,431,384 $ 1,256,440 Cost of revenues $ 195,776 $ 177,761 $ 1,186,658 $ 1,035,342 $ 1,382,434 $ 1,213,103 (Unaudited) Year Ended December 31, Net Revenue Gross Revenue (in thousands) Reporting Method Reporting Method (GAAP)\nNon-GAAP Adjustments (Non-GAAP) 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues: Professional employer services $ 758,046 $ 673,924 $ 4,380,252 $ 3,852,301 $ 5,138,298 $ 4,526,225 Staffing services 162,386 166,662 - - 162,386 166,662 Total revenues $ 920,432 $ 840,586 $ 4,380,252 $ 3,852,301 $ 5,300,684 $ 4,692,887 Cost of revenues $ 761,901 $ 695,050 $ 4,380,252 $ 3,852,301 $ 5,142,153 $ 4,547,351 About BBSI\nBBSI (NASDAQ:BBSI) is a leading provider of business management solutions, combining human resource outsourcing and professional management consulting to create a unique operational platform that differentiates it from competitors.
