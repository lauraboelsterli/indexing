    "text": "CNBC.com Alessandro Di Ciommo | NurPhoto | Getty Images CEO of Softbank Group Masayoshi Son attending a news conference in Tokyo on February 8, 2017. \nReinsurance giant Swiss Re spiked to a 52-week high Wednesday on a possible Softbank deal. \nSwiss Re said it's in talks with Softbank about a \"potential minority investment\" and that the discussions are \"at a very early stage,\" according to a company release. \nThe Japanese investment conglomerate is eyeing a stake in Swiss Re that could be worth as much as $10 billion, according to a Wall Street Journal report , which first reported the talks. \nSoftbank could ultimately purchase up to a third of Swiss Re's shares, the newspaper reported. \nThe Swiss company sells insurance to insurers, which fits with Softbank's previous investments in ride-sharing companies like Uber and some of its global rivals, Didi Chuxing, Ola and Grab. These companies spend a significant amount of money on insuring drivers. \nShares of Swiss Re jumped more than 9 percent in midday trading.",
