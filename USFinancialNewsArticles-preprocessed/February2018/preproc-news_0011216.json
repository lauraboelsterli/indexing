    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Royal Financial, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCQX:RYFL), incorporated under the laws of Delaware on December 15, 2004, for the purpose of serving as the holding company of Royal Savings Bank (the “Bank”), announced earnings for the second quarter end of fiscal year 2018 and the calendar year-end deferred tax asset (the “DTA”) adjustment.\nFor the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $1.7 million, or ($0.69) per common share, compared to $630,000 or $0.25 per common share, for the second quarter ended December 31, 2016. The net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $373,000, or ($0.15) per common share, compared to $894,000, or $0.36 per common share, for the six months ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of Results of Operation for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe Company reported a net loss of $1.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to a net profit of $630,000 in the same period of fiscal 2017. The net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2017, was $373,000, a decrease of $1.3 million from the same period of fiscal 2017. The decrease was caused by the January 1, 2018 federal tax rate change having a negative effect on the DTA, increases in non-interest expense and cost of funds, offset by increases in interest income.\nFor the quarter end December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes was $2.2 million compared to the provision for income taxes at the quarter end of December 30, 2016, of $260,000, an increase of $1.9 million. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R.1, more commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which decreased the corporate income tax rate from 35.00% to 21.00%, effective January 1, 2018. Based on the decrease to the federal tax rate, the Company had a one-time downward adjustment of the DTA of $2.0 million, or a loss of $0.80 per share. This adjustment was recorded as additional income tax expense reducing net income by approximately $2.0 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increased $584,000 from December 31, 2016. Total interest income for loans, including fees, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, increased $661,000 from the same period of fiscal 2017, which was offset by the decrease in interest income from securities. The Company liquidated securities to fund loan growth in fiscal year 2017. This increase in interest income is offset by the increase in total interest expense due to higher cost of funds for borrowings and deposit accounts.\nTotal non-interest income decreased $71,000 from December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income is due to the one-time gain on acquisitions of $160,000 in December 2016. This gain resulted from the sale of two NHS pools that were inherited through the Park Federal Bank acquisition. This was offset by increases in secondary mortgage market fees of $44,000, an increase in service charge income of $9,000, and income of $33,000 from the leasing of excess office space in Bank branches.\nThe provision for loan losses at the quarter end of December 31, 2017, was $90,000, an increase of $45,000 from the prior year. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was to provide for the increased growth in the loan portfolio.\nTotal non-interest expenses increased $572,000 from December 31, 2016. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily caused by the increase of $580,000 in merger and acquisition expense. The Company booked a one-time expense of $650,000 at December 31, 2017 to accrue for the expected costs associated with the December 15, 2017 acquisition of the insured deposits and other assets of Washington Federal Bank for Savings, FDIC failure.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017\nThe Company’s total assets increased $142.1 million, or 44.8%, to $459.2 million at December 31, 2017, from $317.1 million at June 30, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $120.4 million, to $135.2 million at December 31, 2017 from $14.8 million at June 30, 2017. The increase in cash was due to the acquisition of the Washington Federal Bank for Savings insured deposits and certain assets.\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $17.9 million, or 7.32%, to $263.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $245.7 million at June 30, 2017. Growth in the portfolio was the result of funding additional commercial loans, which were collateralized by commercial real estate and multi-family properties.\nOther real estate owned decreased $142,000 since June 30, 2017, to one property booked at $310,000 at December 31, 2017. The change was due to the sale of a one-to-four family residential property. The property is recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nThe DTA decreased $1.5 million, to $10.5 million, at December 31, 2017 from $12.0 million at June 30, 2017. The Company wrote down the DTA $2.0 million as of December 31, 2017, to comply with the new federal tax rate. The Company still holds a $600,000 State DTA valuation reserve that will be reviewed over the next two quarters as the Company re-evaluates future earnings with the increase in assets due to the recent acquisition of Washington Federal Bank for Savings.\nDue to the recent and close to quarter end acquisition of the insured deposits and certain assets of Washington Federal Bank for Savings, the Company is in a transitional stage of accounting and has booked a Preliminary Intangible of $1.8 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, the Core Deposit Intangible increased $295,000, to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 from $919,000 at June 30, 2017.\nTotal deposits increased $138.8 million, or 52.1%, to $405.2 million at December 31, 2017 from $266.5 million at June 30, 2017. Growth in deposits was the result of the acquisition of $136.9 million insured deposits from Washington Federal Bank for Savings.\nThe note payable increased $9.5 million to $14.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $4.9 million at June 30, 2017. The increase in the note payable was due to a capital injection request from the Bank to properly capitalize the Bank for the acquisition of Washington Federal Bank for Savings.\nThere were no Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nTotal stockholders’ equity decreased $634,000, to $33.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $33.7 million at June 30, 2017, which was primarily the result of a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $291,000 for the period and the net loss of $373,000.\nFor the six months ended December 2017, the Bank paid cash dividends of $700,000.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $1.9 million, or 0.72% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, as compared to $1.7 million, or 0.67% of total loans, at June 30, 2017. In addition to the allowance for loan losses, net purchase discount on acquired loans was $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 million at June 30, 2017. Individual loan discounts are being accreted into interest income over the life of the loans; however, they can offset loan losses upon loan default. Nonperforming loans totaled $777,000, or 0.29% of outstanding loans, at December 31, 2017 compared to $327,000 or 0.13%, at June 30, 2017.\nThe Bank is required to maintain regulatory capital sufficient to meet the Tier 1 capital leverage ratio, and the risk-based ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital of at least 4.0%, 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with ratios of 10.77%, 17.73%, 17.73% and 18.67%, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2017, the book value per common share was $13.20 compared to the book value per common share of $13.45 at June 30, 2017, for shares outstanding of 2,507,112 for both periods. The tangible book value per share was $11.98 at December 30, 2017, compared to tangible book value per share of $13.08 at June 30, 2017. The decrease in tangible book share was the result of the addition of the Intangible Assets for the acquisition of the Washington Federal Bank for Savings insured deposits and certain assets.\nThe complete audited consolidated financial statements for 2017 and 2016 are available at www.royalbankweb.com\nAbout Royal Financial, Inc.\nRoyal Savings Bank offers a range of checking and savings products and a full line of home and commercial lending solutions.
