For charter parties with variable rates among periods or consecutive charter parties with the same charterer, the recognized gross daily charter rate represents the weighted average gross daily charter rate over the duration of the applicable charter period or series of charter periods, as applicable. In case a charter agreement provides for additional payments, namely ballast bonus to compensate for vessel repositioning, the gross daily charter rate presented has been adjusted to reflect estimated vessel repositioning expenses. In case of voyage charters the charter rate represents revenue recognized on a pro-rata basis over the duration of the voyage from load to discharge port less related voyage expenses. The start date represents either the actual start date or, in the case of a contracted charter that had not commenced as of February 9, 2018, the scheduled start date. The actual start date and redelivery date may differ from the referenced scheduled start and redelivery dates depending on the terms of the charter and market conditions and does not reflect the options to extend the period time charter. Vessel sold and leased back on a net daily bareboat charter rate of $6,500 for a period of 10 years, with a purchase obligation at the end of the 10th year and purchase options in favor of the Company after the second year of the bareboat charter, at annual intervals and predetermined purchase prices. A period time charter of ten years at a gross daily charter rate of $23,100 for the first two and a half years and of $24,810 for the remaining period. In January 2017, the period time charter was amended to reflect substitution of the initial charterer with its subsidiary guaranteed by the initial charterer and changes in payment terms; all other charter terms remained unchanged. The charter agreement grants the charterer an option to purchase the vessel at any time beginning at the end of the seventh year of the charter, at a price of $39 million less a 1.00% commission, decreasing thereafter on a pro-rated basis by $1.5 million per year. The Company holds a right of first refusal to buy back the vessel in the event that the charterer exercises its option to purchase the vessel and subsequently offers to sell such vessel to a third party. The charter agreement also grants the charterer the option to extend the period time charter for an additional twelve months at a time at a gross daily charter rate of $26,330, less 1.25% total commissions, which option may be exercised by the charterer a maximum of two times.\nThe contracted employment of fleet ownership days as of February 9, 2018, was:\n2018 (remaining) 53 % 2018 (full year) 58 % 2019 16 % 2020 8 % Order book, newbuilds capital expenditure requirements and liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the remaining order book of the Company consisted of one newbuild vessel; our wholly-owned subsidiary Pinewood Shipping Corporation has contracted to acquire Hull No. 1552 , with scheduled delivery date in June 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the aggregate remaining capital expenditure, relating to the purchase consideration of newbuilds, amounted to $27.6 million payable within 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had secured $16.9 million of preferred equity financing for Hull 1552 and had the capacity to borrow against two unencumbered vessels.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had liquidity of $68.7 million consisting of $58.4 million in cash and bank time deposits and $10.3 million in restricted cash.\nAs of February 9, 2018, the aggregate remaining capital expenditure, relating to the purchase consideration of newbuilds, amounted to $27.1 million payable within 2018.\nAs of February 9, 2018, we had liquidity of $79.5 million consisting of $70.9 million in cash and bank time deposits and $8.6 million in restricted cash, in addition to $16.9 million of financing arrangements, and the capacity to borrow against two unencumbered vessels.\nDividend Policy\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has not declared a dividend to its common stock holders for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company had 101,535,996 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of February 9, 2018.\nThe Company declared in January a cash dividend of $0.50 per share on its 8.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Shares (NYSE:SB.PR.B), on its 8.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Shares (NYSE:SB.PR.C) and on its 8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Shares (NYSE:SB.PR.D) for the period from October 30, 2017 to January 29, 2018 payable on January 30, 2018 to the respective shareholders of record as of January 23, 2018.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company.

The Company operated 38.04 vessels on average during the fourth quarter of 2017, earning a TCE 6 rate of $11,944, compared to 37.00 vessels and a TCE rate of $8,936 during the same period in 2016.\nVessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses, which include dry-docking cost and initial supplies expenses, increased by 9% to $13.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2016, as a result of: i) increased average number of vessels by 3% to 38.04 vessels for the fourth quarter of 2017, from 37.00 vessels for the same period in 2016, ii) increased maintenance and spare parts costs to $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2016.\nImpairment loss: Consistent with prior practices, we have reviewed all our vessels for impairment and four of our vessels were found to be impaired. We have recorded impairment charge of $91.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of writing down these vessels to their estimated fair market value. Impairment charge is a non-cash item.\nInterest expenses : Interest expense increased to $5.6 million of 2017, compared to $5.1 million for the same period in 2016, as a result of the increased USD LIBOR 8 affecting the weighted average interest rate of our loans and credit facilities.\nVoyage expenses: Voyage expenses decreased by 60% to $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2016, mainly due to decreased vessel repositioning expenses as a result of improved market conditions.\nDaily vessel operating expenses 5 : Daily vessel operating expenses, which are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period, increased by 5% to $3,914 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $3,711 for the same period in 2016.\nDaily general and administrative expenses 5 : Daily general and administrative expenses, which include management fees payable to our Managers 7 increased by 8% to $1,175 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1,083 for the same period in 2016.\n5 See Table 2.\n6 Time charter equivalent rates, or TCE rate, represents the Company’s charter revenues less commissions and voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of our available days during such period.\n7 Safety Management Overseas S.A. and Safe Bulkers Management Limited, each a related party referred in this press release as “our Manager” and collectively “our Managers’’.\n8 London interbank offered rate.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information and Other Data SAFE BULKERS, INC.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. The Company believes that including these supplemental financial measures assists our management and investors in (i) understanding and analyzing the results of our operating and business performance, (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (iii) monitoring our financial and operational performance in assessing whether to continue investing in us. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance from period to period because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financings, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally further eliminates the effects from loss on sale of assets, gain/(loss) on derivatives, gain on debt extinguishment, other operating income/(expense), early redelivery cost, impairment loss and gain/(loss) on foreign currency, items which may vary from year to year and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Furthermore, the calculation of Adjusted Net income/(loss) generally eliminates the effects of loss on sale of assets, gain/(loss) on derivatives, gain on debt extinguishment, other operating income/(expense), early redelivery cost, impairment loss and gain/(loss) on foreign currency, items which may vary from year to year and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under US GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) should not be considered as substitutes for net income and other operations data prepared in accordance with US GAAP or as a measure of profitability. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, are frequently used as measures of operating results and performance, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items.\nTABLE 2: FLEET DATA AND AVERAGE DAILY INDICATORS Three-Month\nPeriod Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve-Month\nPeriod Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 FLEET DATA Number of vessels at period end 37 39 37 39 Average age of fleet (in years) 6.68 7.51 6.68 7.51 Ownership days (1) 3,404 3,500 13,390 13,858 Available days (2) 3,382 3,500 13,329 13,788 Operating days (3) 3,321 3,492 13,024 13,673 Fleet utilization (4) 97.6 % 99.8 % 97.3 % 98.7 % Average number of vessels in the period (5) 37.00 38.04 36.58 37.97 AVERAGE DAILY RESULTS Time charter equivalent rate (6) $8,936 $11,944 $7,659 $10,451 Daily vessel operating expenses (7) $3,711 $3,914 $3,698 $3,810 Daily general and administrative expenses (8) $1,083 $1,175 $1,149 $1,163",
