    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 12:56 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago U.S. vows new North Korea sanctions ahead of Olympics face-off Hyonhee Shin , Tim Kelly 6 Min Read \nSEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence vowed tough new sanctions against North Korea and called it the world’s most tyrannical regime on Wednesday, two days before he is due to attend the winter Olympics, along with two of the North’s most senior officials. \nSpeaking in Tokyo on his way to South Korea, which is hosting the Games over the next three weeks, Pence said he would soon announce the stepped-up sanctions in an effort to pressure the North to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes. \nThe Games, being staged 80 km (50 miles) from the heavily militarised border between the Koreas, is set for an awkward political encounter, with Pence as well as the North Korean leader’s younger sister attending Friday’s opening ceremony. \nSouth Korea wants to use the event to re-engage with North Korea and open the way for talks to resolve one of the world’s most dangerous crises, in which U.S. President Donald Trump and Pyongyang have swapped nuclear threats. \n“I‘m announcing today the United States of America will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever,” Pence said after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \n“We will continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programme once and for all.” \nWashington has been leading a global campaign to force North Korea to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States and has taken a tougher line recently than its allies in Seoul, exposing tensions that South Korean President Moon Jae-in could struggle to conceal at the Olympics. \nPence has voiced scepticism that the North Korea will use the Games for crude propaganda. As his guest at the opening ceremony, he is taking the father of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died last year after being imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months. \nSitting in the same stadium as VIP guests will be Kim Yo Jong, 28-year-old sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and Kim Yong Nam, North Korea’s nominal head of state. \nJapan’s Abe, whose nation has been within range of North Korean missiles for decades, will also attend the ceremony. \nKim Yo Jong would be the first member of the Kim family to cross the border to the South. She is a propaganda official and was blacklisted last year by the U.S. Treasury Department over alleged human rights abuses and censorship. \n“It shows the North’s resolve to defuse tension on the Korean peninsula,” Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom told a news briefing. \nPence has not ruled out the prospect of meeting North Korean officials during the Games, but President Trump, whose daughter and adviser Ivanka will attend the Olympic closing ceremony, has cast doubt on the value of U.S. talks with Pyongyang any time soon. \n“We will not allow North Korea to hide behind the Olympic banner the reality that they enslave their people and threaten the wider region,” Pence said. Members of a conservative civic group attend an anti-North Korea protest at a port in Donghae. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nThe White House has also cautioned against reading too much into remarks Pence made en route to Japan. \nAnalysts said that while Seoul appeared keen to set up a U.S.-North Korea meeting, the chances of this happening did not look high. \n“The fact that the U.S. is bringing along Otto Warmbier’s father suggests that their interest in engaging with the North Koreans while in Korea is pretty low,” Abraham Denmark, a senior defence official for East Asia under former President Barack Obama, told a conference call organised by the Wilson Center think tank. \nThe United States has said repeatedly that any future talks with North Korea must have the aim of North Korea’s denuclearisation, something Pyongyang has rejected. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters travelling with him on a visit to Jamaica that he did not anticipate a meeting at the Olympics, but “it just depends on the circumstances as to whether this is the right time or not.” Slideshow (4 Images) \nHe added that sanctions pressure would continue “until North Korea gets on a pathway to giving up its nuclear weapons”. \n“That is an important message for the North Koreans to understand. Until you do something meaningful - sending some athletes and an orchestra down to Seoul, to show us that yes, you can play sports and you enjoy music - that doesn’t change anything,” he said. \nDuring his visit to Japan, Pence visited a Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, Japan’s last line of defence against any possible North Korean missile strike. \nNorth Korea test-fired ballistic missiles over Japan last year, as well as a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that climbed to an altitude of more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles) before splashing into Japanese waters. \nAbe said he and Pence had agreed in talks that they could “never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea”.
