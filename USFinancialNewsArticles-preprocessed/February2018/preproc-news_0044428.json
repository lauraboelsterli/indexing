He joined RCG in 2015 as Executive Vice President & CFO, after spending more than seven years at R.J. O'Brien & Associates. Joining that firm in 2008 as Controller, he was promoted to Senior Vice President & CFO in 2010. During his tenure there, Manumaleuna helped navigate through the industry's newly enhanced customer protection rules and helped manage significant growth in the firm's customer segregated funds.\nManumaleuna began his career as an auditor at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (now CME Group) in 1997, after which he served as Controller for several FCMs, including LFG, LLC, which later became a division of Refco, and Calyon Financial.

In 2006, he transitioned to RCG's Risk Department, where he supervised all risk management functions and became Senior Vice President of Risk. In that role, he helped develop industry-leading risk analytic software. He left RCG in 2012 to serve as Treasurer for Peak6 Advisors, and he returned to the firm in 2014 in his most recent role.\nOriginally a soybean trader at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, Mackey later became an interest rate broker at the Chicago Board of Trade, executing orders for institutional customers and major investment banks before he left the trading floor to join RCG. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from DePaul University, and he serves on the Board of Directors of the DePaul University Arditti Center for Risk Management.
