These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm-based strains integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy, and are designed to access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T-cell immunity, activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T cells to eliminate tumors. Advaxis has four franchises in various stages of clinical and near-clinical development: HPV-associated cancers, individualized neoantigen immunotherapy, cancer-specific hotspot mutation immunotherapies and prostate cancer.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: statements regarding the timing, success and anticipated use of proceeds for the proposed offering.
