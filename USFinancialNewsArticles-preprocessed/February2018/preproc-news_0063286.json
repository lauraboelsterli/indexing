    "text": "Estonia: Estonia to investigate Danske Bank after new money-laundering allegations February 28th, 2018 Europe \nEstonia’s financial regulator said on Tuesday it would open an investigation into Danske Bank ( DANSKE.CO ) after media reported it had been aware of money-laundering allegations at its Estonian branch as far back as 2013. \nEstonia’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) said it would look at whether Danske, Denmark’s biggest bank, knowingly withheld information from the regulator during a series of inspections it conducted at its Estonian branch in 2014. \n“We will immediately start a new investigation and we will be asking for the information that was not provided to us earlier,” Livia Vosman, head of communications at the FSA, told Reuters. \nThe full original article can be found at reuters.com",
