Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the terms, expected proceeds and closing of the offering. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Uncertainties and risks may cause SITO's actual results to be materially different than those expressed in or implied by SITO's forward-looking statements. For SITO, this includes that closing conditions may not be met. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those listed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements due to these risk factors. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents that we reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and have filed as exhibits thereto with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, except as may be required by applicable law. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.\nMedia Contact:\nKatie McGovern\nSHIFT Communications\nsito@shiftcomm.com\nIR Contact:\nRob Fink\nHayden IR\nrob@haydenir.com\nSource:SITO Mobile, Ltd.",
