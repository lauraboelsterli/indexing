    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLBank Atlanta) today approved a fourth quarter 2017 cash dividend at an annualized rate of 5.16 percent.\n“The support of our shareholders is critical to the success of our cooperative,” said FHLBank Atlanta Chair of the Board of Directors, Gary Garczynski. “The board of directors is pleased to return value to our shareholders with this strong fourth quarter dividend.”\nThe dividend rate is 3.70 percentage points over the daily average three-month LIBOR yield for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend will be calculated on shareholders’ capital stock held during that period. The dividend will be credited to shareholders’ daily investment accounts at the close of business on February 6, 2018.\nIf you have questions, please contact FHLBank Atlanta’s Funding Desk at 1.800.536.9650, ext. 8011.\nAbout FHLBank Atlanta\nFHLBank Atlanta offers competitively-priced financing, community development grants, and other banking services to help member financial institutions make affordable home mortgages and provide economic development credit to neighborhoods and communities.
