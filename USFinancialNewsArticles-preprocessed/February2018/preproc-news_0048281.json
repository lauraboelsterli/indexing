CHARLES, Mo., Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Railcar Industries, Inc. (ARI or the Company) (NASDAQ:ARII) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. John O'Bryan, President and CEO of ARI, commented,\n\"Our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 reflect the continued downturn in the North American railcar market cycle. Due to oversupply in the marketplace, demand for both tank and hopper railcars remains focused on smaller orders of more specialized railcars. During 2017, pricing has been very competitive and customers have been cautious about placing new orders. At this point in the market cycle, we are focused on a disciplined approach to aligning our production with industry demand.\nOur diversified and growing lease fleet, which has increased to over 13,100 railcars as of December 31, 2017, continues to provide cash flows while utilization remains strong. Our railcar services segment continued to provide consistent earnings and performed maintenance services on our lease fleet, through our expanded network including repair and retrofit services at our Marmaduke, Arkansas manufacturing facility.\nIn 2017, we developed ARI’s sales and lease management team to support our customers and provide opportunities for future growth. Late in the fourth quarter of 2017, railcar inquiry levels increased, and our sales team has been actively meeting with customers to understand their needs and offer innovative solutions for their fleet strategies. We are well positioned to optimize ARI's production plan to meet customers' requirements.\"\nFourth Quarter Revenue Summary\nTotal consolidated revenues were $132.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 21% when compared to $167.5 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues in the manufacturing and railcar services segments, partially offset by increased revenues in the railcar leasing segment.\nManufacturing revenues were $80.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 30% compared to $114.9 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of fewer railcar shipments for direct sale for both hopper and tank railcars with a higher mix of hopper railcars sold, a higher percentage of railcar shipments going to the Company's lease fleet, and more competitive pricing during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, ARI shipped 720 direct sale railcars and shipped 389 railcars for the Company's lease fleet, compared to 1,005 direct sale railcars and 307 railcars for the lease fleet during the same period in 2016. Railcars for the lease fleet represented 35% of ARI’s railcar shipments during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 23% for the same period in 2016. Shipments and orders for railcars on long-term leases not only help maintain a steady level of production during the manufacturing period, but also help provide future cash flows while the lease fleet continues to maintain a strong utilization rate. Because revenues and earnings related to leased railcars are recognized over the life of the lease, the Company's quarterly and annual results may vary depending on the mix of lease versus direct sale railcars that the Company ships during a given period.\nManufacturing revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017, on a consolidated basis, exclude $37.0 million of revenues related to railcars built for the Company's lease fleet compared to $30.8 million for the same period in 2016. Revenues related to railcars built for the Company's lease fleet increased due to a higher volume of railcars built for lease, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Such revenues are based on an estimated fair market value of the leased railcars as if they had been sold to a third party and are not recognized in consolidated revenues as railcar sales. Rather, lease revenues are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract over the life of the lease.\nRailcar leasing revenues were $34.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 2% compared to $33.5 million for the same period in 2016. The primary reason for the increase in revenue was an increase in the number of railcars on lease, partially offset by a decline in weighted average lease rates compared to the same period in 2016. ARI had 13,138 railcars in its lease fleet at the end of 2017 compared to 11,268 railcars in its lease fleet at the end of 2016.\nRailcar services revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $18.0 million, a decrease of 6% compared to $19.1 million of revenues for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to performing more intercompany work related to the FRA's Revised Directive, for which the revenue is eliminated in consolidation, partially offset by increased demand, additional capacity from ARI's mobile repair operations and additional repair volume due to added capacity for railcar services at the Company's Marmaduke tank railcar production facility.\nConsolidated earnings from operations were $17.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 54% over $37.4 million for the same period in 2016. Consolidated operating margins decreased to 12.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 22.3% for the same period in 2016. These decreases were primarily driven by lower earnings from operations in the Company's manufacturing segment.\nThe manufacturing segment experienced a loss from operations on a consolidated basis of $1.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to earnings from operations of $19.5 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was due to fewer overall railcar shipments for direct sale, as discussed above, more competitive pricing on both hopper and tank railcars, increased warranty costs of approximately $5 million, and higher costs associated with the lower production rates at the Company's railcar facilities. As the Company adjusts its production schedules and output of new railcars, it continues to monitor and control overhead spending and employee levels. Estimated profit on railcars built for the Company’s lease fleet was $2.1 million and $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is excluded from manufacturing earnings from operations. Profit on railcars built for the Company's lease fleet is based on an estimated fair market value of revenues as if the railcars had been sold to a third party, less the cost to manufacture.\nRailcar leasing earnings from operations on a consolidated basis were $21.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $22.5 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by increased costs due to maintenance and services related to lease re-assignments, lower rates on certain lease renewals and increased rent abatement related to railcars being shopped in conjunction with the FRA's Revised Directive, all partially offset by an increase in the number of railcars in the Company's lease fleet in 2017.\nRailcar services earnings from operations on a consolidated basis were $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to performing more intercompany services related to the FRA's Revised Directive, for which the revenue is eliminated in consolidation, partially offset by increased demand and additional capacity from ARI's mobile repair operations and additional repair volume due to added capacity for railcar services at the Company's Marmaduke tank railcar production facility.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $9.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $10.5 million for the same period in 2016. This $0.7 million decrease was primarily due to decreases in incentive and stock-based compensation expense, both partially offset by increased bad debt expense and increased compensation costs relating to additional personnel hired in connection with increasing our sales and marketing team and other supporting groups relating to transitioning lease fleet management in-house. Certain expenses related to the management of the Company's lease fleet, including the management fee paid to American Railcar Leasing, LLC (ARL), were recorded within cost of sales prior to the sale of ARL to an unaffiliated third party (the ARL Sale), which was consummated on June 1, 2017. Subsequent to the ARL Sale, as personnel and other related expenses have been brought in-house, the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses supporting our leasing business have increased, but our fleet management expenses in total have decreased due to cost savings related to railcar management fees.\nNet earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $111.9 million, or $5.86 per share, compared to $22.3 million, or $1.16 per share, in the same period of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by the impact of the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\"), partially offset by decreased consolidated earnings from operations. A reconciliation of our net earnings and earnings per share excluding adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act (both non-GAAP financial measures) is set forth in the supplemental disclosure attached to this press release.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, modifies policies, credits, and deductions and has international tax consequences. The rate reduction is effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a one-time income tax benefit of $107.3 million, or $5.62 per share, related to the 2017 Tax Act. The fourth quarter 2017 income tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act may require further adjustments in 2018 due to anticipated additional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, changes in the Company’s assumptions, completion of 2017 tax returns, and further information and interpretations that become available.\nEBITDA, adjusted to exclude share-based compensation and other income related to short-term investment activity (Adjusted EBITDA), was $33.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $51.8 million for the comparable quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased earnings from operations as discussed above. A reconciliation of the Company’s net earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (both non-GAAP financial measures) is set forth in the supplemental disclosure attached to this press release.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nConsolidated revenues for 2017 were $476.8 million compared to $639.1 million in 2016. The Company shipped 2,418 railcars for direct sale and 1,874 railcars for lease in 2017 compared to 3,922 railcars for direct sale and 914 railcars for lease in 2016. Railcars built for the lease fleet represented 44% of ARI's railcar shipments in 2017 compared to 19% in 2016.\nConsolidated earnings from operations for 2017 were $80.7 million, a decrease of 38% from $130.1 million in 2016. Consolidated earnings from operations for 2017 and 2016 excluded $16.3 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of profit on railcars built for the lease fleet that is eliminated in consolidation. The decrease in consolidated earnings from operations was primarily driven by lower earnings from operations in the Company's manufacturing segment, as the Company had fewer direct sale railcar shipments during 2017, combined with increased warranty costs and higher costs associated with lower production volumes and more competitive pricing during 2017. This was combined with lower earnings from operations in the railcar leasing and railcar services segments and higher selling, general and administrative costs.\nConsolidated operating margins were 16.9% in 2017 compared to 20.4% in 2016. These decreases were primarily due to fewer overall direct sale shipments, with a higher mix of hopper railcars in 2017, which generally have lower margins than tank railcars, combined with increased warranty costs, more competitive pricing on both hopper and tank railcars, and higher costs associated with the lower production rates at the Company's railcar facilities. Operating margins in 2016 were negatively impacted by the $12.3 million loss contingency recognized related to the FRA's Revised Directive.\nOur total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 14.1% in 2017 compared to 2016. This $4.5 million increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs relating to additional personnel hired in connection with increasing our sales and marketing team and other supporting groups relating to transitioning lease fleet management in-house, higher legal expenses, and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense and decreased consulting expenses. Prior to the ARL Sale, certain expenses related to the management of the Company's lease fleet, including the management fee paid to ARL, were recorded within cost of sales. Subsequent to the ARL Sale, as personnel and other related expenses have been brought in-house, the Company's selling, general and administrative expenses related to our leasing business have increased, but our fleet management expenses in total have decreased due to cost savings related to railcar management fees.\nNet earnings in 2017 were $142.2 million, or $7.45 per share, compared to $72.7 million, or $3.74 per share in 2016. This increase was driven primarily by the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, resulting in a tax benefit of $107.3 million, as discussed above, and an increase in other income primarily driven by gains realized on the sale of short-term investments, both partially offset by decreased earnings from operations as discussed above and lower earnings from ARI's joint ventures due to a decline in industry demand and the idling of the Ohio Castings joint venture in early 2017. A reconciliation of our net earnings and earnings per share excluding adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act (both non-GAAP financial measures) is set forth in the supplemental disclosure attached to this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $141.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $46.5 million from $188.0 million in 2016. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased earnings from operations as discussed above. A reconciliation of the Company’s net earnings to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (both non-GAAP financial measures) is set forth in the supplemental disclosure attached to this press release.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nThe Company’s earnings have contributed to cash flow from operations of $131.5 million in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, ARI had working capital of $168.6 million, including $100.2 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $545.6 million of debt outstanding, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $4.6 million, and borrowing availability of $200.0 million under a revolving loan.\nThe Company paid dividends totaling $30.5 million during 2017. At the board meeting in February, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per share of common stock of the Company to shareholders of record as of March 16, 2018 that will be paid on March 23, 2018.\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2017 under its stock repurchase program. Board authorization for approximately $164.0 million remains available for further share repurchases.\nBacklog\nARI’s backlog as of December 31, 2017 was 1,940 railcars, with an estimated market value of $172.6 million. Of the total backlog, we currently expect 389 railcars, or 20%, having an estimated market value of $39.8 million, will be placed into the Company's lease fleet. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company received orders for approximately 2,000 railcars, primarily for direct sale for both tank and hopper railcars, which significantly increased the backlog from December 31, 2017. While inquiry levels have moderately improved recently, we expect 2018 industry shipments to be in line with 2017, consistent with industry forecasts. These orders received in early 2018 were for customers' delivery needs both in 2018 and 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast\nARI will host a webcast and conference call on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 10:00 am (Eastern Time) to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 financial results.

The ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nNet earnings excluding tax adjustments represents net earnings before a one-time adjustment related to the impact of the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\"). The Company believes that net earnings excluding tax adjustments is a useful measure to investors in evaluating ARI’s operating performance compared to prior quarters as the impact of the 2017 Tax Act is not expected to be repeated. The calculation of net earnings excluding tax adjustments excludes the income tax benefit recognized by the Company related to its revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. Net earnings excluding tax adjustments is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Accordingly, when analyzing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider net earnings excluding tax adjustments in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows provided by operating activities or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The calculation of net earnings excluding tax adjustments is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS TO EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA (In thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net earnings $ 111,852 $ 22,286 $ 142,177 $ 72,663 Income tax (benefit) expense (97,825 ) 10,398 (75,960 ) 41,537 Interest expense 5,394 5,587 21,854 22,803 Interest income (475 ) (425 ) (1,621 ) (1,785 ) Depreciation 14,780 13,487 57,526 52,216 EBITDA $ 33,726 $ 51,333 $ 143,976 $ 187,434 Expense (income) related to stock appreciation rights compensation 68 643 (158 ) 751 Other income on short-term investment activity — (180 ) (2,314 ) (180 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 33,794 $ 51,796 $ 141,504 $ 188,005 EBITDA represents net earnings before income tax expense, interest expense (income), and depreciation of property, plant and equipment. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating ARI’s operating performance compared to that of other companies in the same industry. In addition, ARI’s management uses EBITDA to evaluate operating performance. The calculation of EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. These items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall operating performance of a company’s business. EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Accordingly, when analyzing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows provided by operating activities or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The calculation of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before share-based compensation expense (income) related to stock appreciation rights (SARs) and other income related to our short-term investments. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, and therefore uses Adjusted EBITDA for that purpose. The Company’s SARs, which settle in cash, are revalued each period based primarily upon changes in ARI’s stock price. Management believes that eliminating the expense (income) associated with share-based compensation and income associated with short-term investments allows management and ARI’s investors to understand better the operating results independent of financial changes caused by the fluctuating price and value of the Company’s common stock and short-term investments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, when analyzing operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows provided by operating activities or other statements of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES, INC.\n100 Clark Street, St. Charles, Missouri 63301\namericanrailcar.com\n636.940.6000\nSource:American Railcar Industries, Inc.",
