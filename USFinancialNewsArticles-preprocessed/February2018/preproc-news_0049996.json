Looking ahead, we’re very optimistic about our future.”\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2016\nNet sales increased $41.9 million, or 14.2%, to $337.0 million, driven primarily by volume growth. Net sales of Dry Foods increased $25.9 million, or 10.8%, to $265.9 million while net sales of Wet Foods, Treats and Other Products increased $16.0 million, or 28.9%, to $71.1 million.\nGross profit increased $19.9 million, or 15.1%, to $151.9 million and gross margin was 45.1%, up 40 bps compared with 44.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable product mix and supply chain efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher distribution costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $3.1 million, or 4.4%, to $75.0 million. Adjusted SG&A, which excludes litigation expenses and costs incurred in preparing for our public offerings, increased $4.6 million, or 6.5%. This increase was primarily due to our ongoing investment in advertising and marketing consistent with our brand building strategy.\nNet income increased $18.8 million, or 54.1%, to $53.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $34.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Net Income, which excludes litigation expenses and costs incurred in preparing for our public offerings, increased $17.9 million, or 50.2%, to $53.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 51.4% to $0.27, compared to $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Full Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales increased $124.8 million, or 10.9%, to $1,274.6 million, primarily driven by volume growth. Net sales of Dry Foods increased $79.3 million, or 8.5%, to $1,013.5 million, while net sales of Wet Foods, Treats and Other Products increased $45.5 million, or 21.1%, to $261.1 million.\nGross profit increased $73.4 million, or 14.2%, to $589.1 million and gross margin was 46.2%, up 130 bps compared with 44.9% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorable product mix and supply chain efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher distribution costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $23.1 million, or 8.8%, to $285.8 million. Adjusted SG&A, which excludes litigation expenses and costs incurred in preparing for our public offerings, increased $30.0 million, or 11.8%. This increase was primarily due to our ongoing investment in advertising and marketing consistent with our brand building strategy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, Blue Buffalo Company, Ltd. (\"BBC\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the previously disclosed Nestlé Purina lawsuit. In connection with the settlement agreement, the Company recorded a charge of $32.0 million.\nNet income increased $63.3 million, or 48.6%, to $193.5 million, or $0.97 per diluted share in 2017, as compared to $130.2 million, or $0.65 per diluted share in 2016. Adjusted Net Income increased $38.0 million, or 24.3%, to $194.8 million in 2017, compared to $156.8 million in 2016. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share in 2017 increased 24.5% to $0.98, compared to $0.79 in 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $193.9 million in 2017 compared with $127.2 million in 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 increased by $66.6 million as 2016 included a $32.0 million payment related to a settlement agreement with respect to the previously disclosed Nestlé Purina lawsuit.\nCash and cash equivalents were $282.2 million as of December 31, 2017 as compared to $292.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The significant change that impacted 2017 was the remeasurement of deferred taxes in connection with the reduction in the corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The impact of these adjustments increased our net income for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 by $5.4 million.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects to deliver net sales between $1,400 million and $1,430 million and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.20 to $1.24.\nInformation Regarding Today’s Announcement of Definitive Merger Agreement with General Mills, Inc.\nIn a separate press release issued this morning, Blue Buffalo announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with General Mills, Inc. under which General Mills, Inc. will acquire Blue Buffalo for $40.00 per common share, in cash, or an enterprise value of approximately $8.0 billion. For further information on the transaction, please visit http://ir.bluebuffalo.com to access a copy of the press release.\nIn light of this announcement, Blue Buffalo no longer plans to update financial guidance and will not hold its investor conference call on fourth quarter 2017 results, previously planned for 5 pm ET on February 27, 2018.\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted Income Taxes, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Gross Profit, in this press release as management uses these measures in assessing our operating performance, and we believe they are helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties, in evaluating the performance of companies in our industry. We also believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to management and investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as measures of our comparative operating performance from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. Please see the schedules to this press release for additional information and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measure. With respect to our expectations under “Full Year 2018 Outlook” above, for Adjusted Diluted EPS a reconciliation to the closest corresponding GAAP financial measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to litigation expenses and public offering costs excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure. We expect the variability of these charges to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nAbout Blue Buffalo\nBlue Buffalo, based in Wilton, CT, is the nation's leading natural pet food company, providing natural foods and treats for dogs and cats under its BLUE Life Protection Formula, BLUE Wilderness, BLUE Basics, BLUE Freedom, and BLUE Natural Veterinary Diet lines.
