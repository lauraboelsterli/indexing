(NASDAQ: NUVA), the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive, procedurally-integrated solutions, announced the appointment of John A. DeFord, Ph.D. to the Company's Board of Directors, effective upon the filing of the Company's Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDr. DeFord has more than 25 years of experience in the medical device industry, with particular expertise overseeing clinical advancement through innovative R&D and technology-based initiatives. He currently serves as Senior Vice President, Research and Development, Interventional Segment for BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company). He joined BD following its December 2017 acquisition of C.R.

In that role, Dr. DeFord was responsible for R&D and clinical affairs functions across five global corporate divisions.\n\"We are pleased to welcome John to the NuVasive Board,\" said Gregory T. Lucier, chairman and chief executive officer of NuVasive, Inc. \"We expect John's experience driving innovative products and technology programs at other large medical device companies will help inform our own strategic direction as we quicken the tempo of our product launches and expand our efforts toward software development and a focus on systematizing spine surgery.\"\n\"I am thrilled to have the opportunity to support NuVasive's leadership in spine,\" said Dr. DeFord. \"I have long admired NuVasive as an industry innovator and look forward to sharing my clinical and business perspectives as a member of the Board to help the Company deliver even greater value to its surgeon customers, patients and shareholders.\"\nAs a result of Dr. DeFord's appointment, the NuVasive Board of Directors consists of 10 directors, nine of whom are independent. Dr. DeFord will stand for reelection at the Company's annual meeting where Mr. Lesley Howe and Dr. Peter Farrell will retire from the NuVasive Board when their current terms expire, pursuant to the Company's director retirement age policy.\nPrior to his 13-year tenure at C.R. Bard, Dr. DeFord held various executive positions including president and chief executive officer with Cook Incorporated, now a multi-billion dollar privately-held medical device manufacturer, and served as managing director at Early Stage Partners LP, a venture capital firm focused on advanced materials, medical/biotechnology and information technology companies.\nPublished in numerous scientific journals, Dr. DeFord is currently a member of the executive faculty at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management and Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering. Dr. DeFord earned a B.S. and M.S. in electrical engineering and a Ph.D. in electrical/biomedical engineering from Purdue University. He holds numerous patents and multiple industry honors.\nAbout NuVasive\nNuVasive, Inc.
