    "text": "ANKARA, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday called on Cyprus not to “overstep the mark” in the eastern Mediterranean, after Greek Cypriots accused the Turkish military of obstructing a vessel exploring for natural gas over the weekend.\nSpeaking to members of his ruling AK Party in parliament, Erdogan said Turkish warships and security units were monitoring developments in the region.\nThe European Union on Monday called on Turkey to avoid threats and “refrain from any actions that might damage good neighbourly” ties after Cyprus.
