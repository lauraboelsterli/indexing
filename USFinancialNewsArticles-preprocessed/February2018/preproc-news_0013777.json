    "text": "Sean Monahan scored twice and New Jersey native Johnny Gaudreau netted one goal and one assist as the Calgary Flames collected all their offense in the second period and held on for a 3-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Thursday night at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.\nCalgary’s backup goalie David Rittich provided another strong performance between the pipes with 30 saves, 11 of them in a one-sided third period, to record the win and improve his record this season to 5-1-2. It’s Calgary’s third consecutive victory following a six-game losing skid.\nAfter a scoreless opening frame, Monahan put the Flames on the board four minutes into the second period, tallying for his fourth straight game by pouncing on a rebound and beating Devils goalie Keith Kinkaid.\nThe hosts drew even, but Gaudreau made it 2-1 with a breakaway tally he completed with a five-hole backhand. Gaudreau, who’s netted three goals and six points in a four-game point-scoring streak, finally scored his first goal against the Devils. The diminutive standout who’s in the top five in league scoring went into the game having recorded eight assists in seven previous meetings with the Devils.\nThen Monahan collected his second of the game and league-high 10th game-winning goal when he cashed in his own rebound with less than two minutes left in the second period. The first attempt hit the post, and he raced around the net to get the second chance for his 27th goal of the season.\nThe Flames pulled themselves back into a playoff spot.\nTaylor Hall netted a rebound goal that made it a 1-1 game and then assisted Pavel Zacha’s third-period power-play tally. In Hall’s last 12 games, he’s amassed eight goals and 18 points.\nKinkaid stopped 22 shots for the Devils. He faced only one shot on goal in the third period.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
