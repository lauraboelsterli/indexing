All other brand names, product names, or trademarks belong to their respective holders.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCyberArk believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income is helpful to our investors. These financial measures are not measures of the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income or net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income is calculated as operating income excluding share-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, facility exit costs and amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. Non-GAAP net income is calculated as net income excluding share-based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, facility exit costs, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments as well as the impact of a one-time adjustment to our deferred tax asset as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017.\nThe Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation acquisition related expenses, facility exit costs, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and the one-time impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allows for more meaningful comparisons of its period to period operating results. Share-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees. Share based compensation expense has varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash expense. The Company believes that expenses related to its acquisitions, facility exit costs, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and the one-time impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, do not reflect the performance of its core business and impact period-to-period comparability.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the Company’s reported financial results. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. CyberArk urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measures to evaluate its business.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements, which express the current beliefs and expectations of CyberArk’s (the “Company”) management.
