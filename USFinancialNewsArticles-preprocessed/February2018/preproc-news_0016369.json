These results represent the second consecutive year of achieving or exceeding full-year guidance since we re-established the process of issuing it two years ago.\"\n\"We had a solid fourth quarter, and signings and backlog entering 2018 are strong. We have begun the new year focused on ongoing execution of our go-to-market strategy and continued financial discipline.\"\nSummary of Full-Year 2017 Business Results\nCompany:\n2017 revenue of $2.74 billion came in at the high end of the guidance range of $2.65-2.75 billion, driven by strong execution against the company's go-to-market strategy. These results represent a 2.7 percent year-over-year decline (a 370 basis-point improvement versus the rate of decline in 2016), or a 3.3 percent decline on a constant-currency basis (3) .\nOperating profit margin (which includes cost-reduction and other charges and pension expense) was 0.2 percent, down 150 basis points versus 2016. The company exceeded guidance on non-GAAP operating profit margin, (6) which was 8.5 percent, up 80 basis points year over year, reflecting ongoing focus on cost discipline and improving the company's cost structure overall.\nIn 2017, operating cash flow was $166 million. 2017 adjusted free cash flow exceeded full-year guidance of $130-170 million, coming in at $199 million, versus $278 million in 2016. At December 31, 2017, the company had $734 million in cash and cash equivalents, up $363 million year-over-year.\nThe company's pension deficit declined $390 million from the previously-reported amount to end 2017 at $1.78 billion.\nNet loss for 2017 was $65 million, versus a net loss of $48 million in 2016. Unisys recorded a benefit for refunds of U.S. alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") credits of $50 million in 2017, $29 million of which is a result of U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (7) for 2017 was up 4.0 percent year over year to $400 million.

Working with a partner, Unisys will provide these services as a building block for USDA's IT modernization efforts. Public: The European Central Bank (\"ECB\"), a key institution of the European Union and the central bank for the euro and monetary policy of the eurozone, signed a contract for Unisys to manage its IT operations. This includes next generation digital workplace services for end user support, service desk, data center and network management; designed to improve availability of services and end user experience. ECB is a new client for Unisys. Commercial: Unisys signed a contract with a U.S.-based pharmaceutical company for infrastructure and security services, including Unisys Stealth ® microsegmentation software, designed to optimize their environment via the cloud and meet the company's digital transformation objectives. Unisys is providing intelligent and adaptive IT services that will deliver continued innovation for improved business outcomes. Financial Services: Business process transformation company Sutherland Global selected Unisys' innovative banking solution Elevate™ to deliver efficient, scalable and regulatory-compliant omnichannel banking to its UK mortgage customers with services set to launch later in 2018.\nConference Call\nUnisys will hold a conference call today at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results. The listen-only webcast, as well as the accompanying presentation materials, can be accessed on the Unisys Investor website at www.unisys.com/investor . Following the call, an audio replay of the webcast, and accompanying presentation materials, can be accessed through the same link.\n(1) Total Contract Value - TCV is the estimated total contractual revenue related to signed contracts including option years and without regard for cancellation terms. New business TCV represents TCV attributable to new scope for existing clients and new logo contracts.\n(2) Annual Contract Value – ACV represents the revenue expected to be recognized during the first twelve months following the signing of a contract.\n(3) Constant currency - The company refers to growth rates in constant currency or on a constant currency basis so that the business results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to facilitate comparisons of the company's business performance from one period to another. Constant currency is calculated by retranslating current and prior period results at a consistent rate.\nNon-GAAP and Other Information\nAlthough appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the company's results reflect charges that the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations and that can make its profitability and liquidity results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or to its competitors' results. These items consist of pension and cost-reduction and other expense. Management believes each of these items can distort the visibility of trends associated with the company's ongoing performance. Management also believes that the evaluation of the company's financial performance can be enhanced by use of supplemental presentation of its results that exclude the impact of these items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with prior or future period results. The following measures are often provided and utilized by the company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to compare results to other companies in our industry.\n(4) Free cash flow - The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes this liquidity measure gives investors an additional perspective on cash flow from on-going operating activities in excess of amounts used for reinvestment.\n(5) Adjusted free cash flow - Because inclusion of the company's pension contributions and cost-reduction and other payments in free cash flow may distort the visibility of the company's ability to generate cash flow from its operations without the impact of these non-operational costs, management believes that investors may be interested in adjusted free cash flow, which provides free cash flow before these payments. This liquidity measure was provided to analysts and investors in the form of external guidance and is used by management to measure operating liquidity.\n(6) Non-GAAP operating profit - The company recorded pretax pension expense and pretax charges in connection with cost-reduction activities and other expenses. For the company, non-GAAP operating profit excluded these items. The company believes that this profitability measure is more indicative of the company's operating results and aligns those results to the company's external guidance which is used by the company's management to allocate resources and may be used by analysts and investors to gauge the company's ongoing performance.\n(7) EBITDA & adjusted EBITDA – Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") is calculated by starting with net income (loss) attributable to Unisys Corporation common shareholders and adding or subtracting the following items: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes pension expense, cost-reduction and other expense, non-cash share-based expense, and other (income) expense adjustment. In order to provide investors with additional understanding of the company's operating results, these charges are excluded from the adjusted EBITDA calculation.\n(8) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share - The company has recorded pension expense and charges in connection with cost-reduction activities and other expenses. Management believes that investors may have a better understanding of the company's performance and return to shareholders by excluding these charges from the GAAP diluted earnings/loss per share calculations. The tax amounts presented for these items for the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share include the current and deferred tax expense and benefits recognized under GAAP for these amounts.\nAbout Unisys\nUnisys Corporation is a global information technology company that specializes in providing industry-focused services and software solutions integrated with leading-edge security to clients in the government, commercial and financial services markets.
