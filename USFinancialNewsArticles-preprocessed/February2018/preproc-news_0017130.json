    "text": "SHANGHAI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - China and Hong Kong stocks rose sharply in early trading on Wednesday following Tuesday’s heavy sell-off, inspired by a rebound on Wall Street.\nSentiment in China also improved after major state media assembled a chorus of support for the stock market while companies announced stock purchases, share buybacks and suspensions of share disposal plans.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index, which on Tuesday registered its biggest single-day drop in two years, gained 1.0 percent to reach 3,405.46 points at 1:45 GMT.\nThe blue-chip CSI300 Index rose 1.1 percent to 4,194.52 points.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng benchmark, which in the previous session had its worst day since August 2015, rebounded 2.4 percent to 31,339.22 points.
