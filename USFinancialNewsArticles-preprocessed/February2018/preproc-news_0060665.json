    "text": "PLAINVIEW, N.Y., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Edgewise Energy is developing and aggregating energy projects in the New York-area market that provide the greatest value for the electric grid and its commercial customers. Commercial property owners often find themselves running on the payment treadmill, making ongoing and ever-increasing payments for utilities and upkeep. But some have stepped away from the treadmill and opted to benefit from revenue-generating solutions offered by New York-based Edgewise Energy ( https://edgewise.energy ) , a Commercial Energy Solutions Integrator and Aggregator. Edgewise Energy helps turn energy-draining buildings into power-producing generators, while creating recurring revenue for property owners through best suited energy technology, programs and financing. In recognition of the increased demand for its energy assessment, design and deployment services, the company has promoted and expanded its team to better serve its property owner and manager customers.\nEdgewise Energy is positioning itself to participate in greater market opportunities that are currently being promoted through policies such as New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo's NY REV initiative to satisfy the state's energy requirements using renewable energy and energy efficiency by 2030.\nSammy Chu (Lindenhurst, NY) has been named Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Edgewise Energy. He was formerly Chief Innovation Officer. James Emlock remains in the role of Chairman and Founder. He was formerly CEO. Dan Kartzman joins as Senior Advisor; Dan Whitson joins as Senior Director of Operations.\nSammy Chu is a proven leader in promoting market adoption of energy efficiency. At Edgewise Energy, he leads the professional services team in providing assessments and guidance for commercial energy efficiency to property owners. Chu was Founding Director of Town of Babylon's Long Island Green Homes Program, the first operationalized property assessed clean energy program (PACE) in the country. As Chief of Staff to Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone, he was the lead county official charged with recovery from Super Storm Sandy. He serves as Chairman of the Long Island chapter of the US Green Building Council and Vice Chairman of the Suffolk County Planning Commission.\nJames Emlock (Huntington Bay, NY) manages the growth and direction of Edgewise Energy based on his long entrepreneurial experience running successful start-ups. His experience introducing products and services to under-served markets, coupled with his ability to coordinate the efforts of research scientists, engineers and business professionals toward a common goal, ideally suits the leadership of the next-gen energy company. He is a 36-year veteran of the high tech medical industry and he has held executive sales management positions with Dow Chemical, Gambro and Fresenius.\nDan Kartzman (Brooklyn, NY) a recognized leader in the field of residential energy efficiency, is fixated on scaling the deployment of energy efficiency as part of the solution to climate change. He previously served as Senior Advisor of Energy Efficiency Market Development for the state of New York where he designed a pay-for-performance market to bring the full value of a generated unit of energy efficiency into the marketplace. Prior to entering public policy, Dan was founder and president of Powersmith, a full service, comprehensive residential energy-efficiency company.\nDan Whitson (Greenlawn, NY) leads operations for Edgewise Energy. Prior to joining the team, Whitson built a solar division for Green Audit USA, while simultaneously revamping company operations to maximize efficiency and profitability. Earlier, he worked for Powersmith where he headed the Auditing Department before developing and launching a new solar division.\nWant to Learn More?\nEdgewise Energy helps property owners turn their buildings into power plants for their communities.
