Our fourth quarter of 2017 represented another strong quarter, with homebuilding revenues of $623.3 million, up 32%, new home deliveries of 1,058 homes, up 17%, average sales price of $589,100, up 12%, and the dollar value of orders of $351.3 million, up 24%,” said Matthew R. Zaist, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Zaist continued, “As we expected, the fourth quarter proved to be a continuation of our improvements in our GAAP homebuilding gross margins, which were 18.9%, an increase of 80 basis points above the third quarter of 2017, 240 basis points above the second quarter of 2017 and 190 basis points year-over-year. Our fourth quarter results included operating margin improvement of 150 basis points year-over-year, which is a testament to improving our operating discipline around land acquisition and cost control, as well as the strength of our Western markets.\n“In addition, we are extremely pleased with our balance sheet, ending the year with total liquidity of approximately $344.9 million, which includes cash of $182.7 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of $162.2 million, and net debt to capital of 49.6%.”\nThis morning, the Company also announced in a separate press release that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire RSI Communities, a Southern California and Texas based homebuilder, along with three related real estate assets, with approximately 11,000 lots owned and controlled as of December 31, 2017. Assuming the RSI acquisition closes in March, on a combined basis, the Company currently expects its results for the full year 2018 to include deliveries of approximately 4,400 to 4,750 units, home sales revenue of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, and expects community count by year-end 2018 of approximately 125 active selling communities.\nOperating Results\nHome sales revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $623.3 million, as compared to $473.2 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 32%. The increase was driven by a 17% increase in deliveries to 1,058 homes, compared to 902 in the fourth quarter of 2016, combined with an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered to $589,100, up 12% from the prior year.\nThe dollar value of orders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $351.3 million, an increase of 24%, from $284.1 million in the year-ago period. Net new home orders for the quarter were 672, up 19% from 564 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The overall increase in net new home orders was driven by a 17% increase in the monthly absorption rate from 2.4 sales per community in the year-ago period to 2.8 sales per community in the current period.\nThe dollar value of homes in backlog was $433.0 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 5% compared to $410.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by a 12% increase in units in backlog to 822 from 733 in the year-ago period.\nHomebuilding gross margin percentage for homes closed during the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.9%, up from 17.0% gross margin percentage in the year-ago period and 18.1% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage for the quarter was 24.4%, up from 21.6% adjusted gross margin percentage in the prior year period and 23.6% in the third quarter of 2017.\nSales and marketing expense was 4.5% of homebuilding revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, and general and administrative expenses slightly increased to 4.7% of homebuilding revenue, compared to 4.5% in the year-ago quarter.\nThe recently enacted tax reform laws led to a one-time charge in the fourth quarter of $23.1 million, related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset at the lower corporate tax rate, which is included in provision for income taxes in the accompanying income statement. The Company’s effective tax rate was 52.1% for the full year 2017, excluding such impact, the Company’s effective tax rate was 33.0%.\nBalance Sheet Update\nAt quarter end, cash and cash equivalents totaled $182.7 million, real estate inventories totaled $1.7 billion, total assets were $2.1 billion and total equity was $860.6 million. Total debt to book capitalization was 54.5%, and net debt to total capital (net of cash) was 49.6% at December 31, 2017, compared to 58.6% and 57.6% at December 31, 2016, respectively.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results, as well as the pending RSI Communities acquisition, today, Tuesday, February 20, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time.
