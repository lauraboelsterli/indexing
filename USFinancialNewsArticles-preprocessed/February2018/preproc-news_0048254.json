Known for its Koskenkorva vodka brand, Altia generated sales of 359 million euros ($442 million) and an operating margin of 7.3 percent last year. It has recently acquired cognac brands Larsen, Renault and Xante. The flotation is part of the centre-right coalitionâ€™s plan to sell shares in state-owned companies. The government said it would retain a significant stake in the company after the listing. ($1 = 0.8129 euros) (Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",
