    "text": "Airlines were canceling flights and waiving changes fees Friday as a winter storm brought heavy snow to airports in the Midwest and Great Lakes.\nNationwide, more than 1,075 flights had been canceled and another 440 delayed as of 9 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.\nThe bulk of the cancellations were concentrated at three airports: Chicago O'Hare, Chicago Midway and Detroit . O'Hare is a major hub for both American and United while Midway is one of the busiest bases for Southwest . Detroit is a busy hub for Delta .\nRead more from USA Today:\nMike Pence doesn't speak with North Koreans at opening ceremony \n25 best counties in the U.S. \nScenes of abandonment: Defunct venues on the road to Vegas \n\nSouthwest had canceled its entire Friday morning schedule at both Midway and Detroit, but said it hoped to resume flights at noon local time at each airport.\nBeyond Chicago and Detroit, other notable airports seeing a weather-related spike in cancellations were Milwaukee and Grand Rapids, Mich . In Canada , the same storm was snarling flights at Toronto Pearson â€“ that nation's busiest air hub.\nMost big carriers were waiving change fees for customers ticketed to fly to the region during the storm. Details varied by airline, but they generally allowed fliers to make one change to their itineraries without paying change fees or recalculated fares. Airports included in the waivers also varied by carrier, but they covered a spread of destinations from Iowa and Minnesota east through western New York state and Ontario.\nIn the U.S. , nearly all of Friday's cancellations were made preemptively on Thursday as airlines tried to get ahead of the storm. Still, the tally of delayed and canceled flights could grow Friday as snow continues to fall across the region.\nScroll down for links to the winter-weather waivers currently in place at big North American carriers:\nAir Canada \nAlaska Airlines \nAmerican \nDelta \nJetBlue \nFrontier \nSouthwest \nSpirit \nUnited",
