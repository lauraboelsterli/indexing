    "text": "The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note backed off from a four-year high Monday afternoon as the stock market took another leg downward.\nThe yield on the 10-year yield briefly touched 2.885 percent overnight Monday, its highest level since Jan. 16, 2014 when the 10-year yielded as high as 2.893 percent. It first hit a four-year high on Friday.\nAt the latest reading, 10-year Treasury note was down roughly 8 basis points from its overnight high at 2.805 percent at 2:43 p.m. ET, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was largely unchanged at 3.08 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nTreasurys saw some buying as some investors fled for the safety of income in the wake of a stock market sell-off, keeping a lid on rate gains. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points Monday afternoon, adding to last week's sell-off.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- During Friday's session, the 10-year Treasury yield hit that four-year high on the back of a better-than-expected jobs report, which showed a rise in wages.\nThe Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy had added 200,000 jobs in January , beating a Reuters economists' poll of 180,000. The government also said that wages rose 2.9 percent on an annualized basis, sending interest rates upward as inflation fears brewed.\nThe Labor Department also revised upward its reading on December's wage numbers, from 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent. The news put international and domestic markets on a roller coaster ride, with markets trading sharply lower Monday.\nMeanwhile, the ISM non-manufacturing index hit 59.9 in January, well above the 56.5 expected by a survey of Reuters economists, a sign of continued expansion in the economy's service sector.\nWhile no major speeches by members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are set to take place, Monday will mark the beginning of a new chapter for one Fed member.\nFormer Fed Governor Jerome Powell is taking on the role of chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, inheriting the position from the first female chair, Janet Yellen.\nâ€” CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.",
