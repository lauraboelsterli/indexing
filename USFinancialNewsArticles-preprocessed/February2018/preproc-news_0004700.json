    "text": "DUNMORE, Pa., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FNCB Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQX:FNCB) (“FNCB”), the parent company of Dunmore-based FNCB Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, for 2017, compared to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share, for 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, FNCB recorded a net loss of $6.1 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, FNCB recognized additional, non-recurring income tax expense of $8.0 million resulting from the revaluation of FNCB’s net deferred tax assets following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) on December 22, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, FNCB’s adjusted net income, which excludes the non-recurring income tax expense related to the revaluation of FNCB’s net deferred tax assets, was $8.1 million, or $0.49 per basic and diluted share, compared to $6.3 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share, in 2016, an improvement of $1.8 million, or 29.2%. For the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted net income, excluding the non-recurring income tax expense related to revaluation of the net deferred tax assets was $1.9 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, an improvement of $0.4 million, or 24.2%, from $1.5 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter of 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Act into law, which, among other things, reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from a maximum corporate income tax rate of 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Generally accepted accounting principles required FNCB, upon enactment of the Act, to revalue its net deferred tax asset, resulting in an $8.0 million reduction in their value. This non-cash, non-recurring valuation adjustment has been recorded as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. Going forward, FNCB expects to benefit from the lower corporate income tax rate.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nFNCB Bancorp, Inc. named to the 2018 OTCQX Best 50 list. Dividends declared for 2017 totaled $0.13 per share, an increase of 44.4% compared to $0.09 per share for 2016. Net interest income increased $2.5 million, or 8.2%, to $33.0 million in 2017 from $30.5 million in 2016. Net loans grew $38.7 million to $761.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $722.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 5.4%. Non-performing assets decreased $0.9 million, or 14.6%, from $6.4 million at December 31, 2016 to $5.5 million at the close of 2017. FNCB accelerated the payment of $5.0 million in principal on the subordinated debt due September 1, 2018 to September 1, 2017.\n“Our strong operating performance continued through the fourth quarter illustrated by solid organic loan and deposit growth, improved earning asset yields and a continued focus on improving efficiency and maintaining stable non-interest expense levels,” said Gerard A. Champi, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Although FNCB recognized a significant one-time, non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to the revaluation of its net deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the new tax law, fourth quarter and 2017 adjusted net income, excluding this charge, were up significantly, and we believe FNCB will realize significant future benefit from the recent tax law changes that are well in excess of the related one-time charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Importantly, the partial write-down of FNCB’s deferred tax assets had no significant impact on FNCB’s regulatory capital ratios, liquidity, or its ability to continue to pay regular cash dividends. We’re excited by the anticipated positive and ongoing earnings impact that we believe FNCB will recognize in the future from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and we believe that the reduction in corporate income tax rates will accelerate our efforts to build value for FNCB shareholders.”\nFor the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, dividends declared and paid were $0.04 and $0.13 per share, respectively. In comparison, dividends declared and paid for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 were $0.03 per share and $0.09 per share, respectively. The closing price of FNCB’s common stock was $7.30 per share at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.25 per share from the closing price of $6.05 per share at December 31, 2016. The price appreciation, combined with dividends declared, equated to a total return for shareholders of 22.8% for 2017.\nReturn on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity were 0.01% and 0.15%, respectively, in 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, return on average assets and return on average shareholders’ equity were (2.09%) and (24.98%), respectively. Return on average assets was 0.55% and 0.57%, respectively, and return on average shareholders’ equity was 6.43% and 6.82%, respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016.\nSummary Results for 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased $1.1 million to $8.8 million compared to $7.7 million for the same period of 2016. FNCB’s tax-equivalent net interest margin improved 24 basis points to 3.35% for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 3.11% for the same quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017 net interest income increased $2.5 million, or 7.9%, to $33.0 million in 2017 from $30.5 million in 2016. The tax-equivalent net interest margin widened 10 basis points to 3.23% in 2017 from 3.13% in 2016. The margin improvement for both the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 reflected strong growth in earning assets, coupled with increases in earning asset yields, partially offset by increases in FNCB’s cost of funds.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, non-interest income increased $0.5 million to $1.9 million from $1.4 million for the same quarter of 2016. The 37.2% increase was largely due to an increase in other income of $0.3 million and net gains on the sale of investment securities of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest income increased $1.0 million, or 16.5%, to $7.2 million from $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Similarly, the yearly improvement primarily reflected a $0.6 million, or 66.4%, increase in net gains on the sale of securities, coupled with a $0.4 million increase in other income.\nNon-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.6 million, or 8.9%, to $7.8 million from $7.2 million for the same period of 2016. The increase primarily resulted from a $0.4 million increase in other expenses, coupled with higher salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expense, data processing costs and professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, non-interest expense increased $0.5 million, or 1.9%, to $28.1 million compared to $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAsset Quality\nTotal non-performing assets decreased $0.9 million, or 14.6%, to $5.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $6.4 million at December 31, 2016. The improvement was primarily due to reductions in other real estate owned and other non-performing assets of $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively, comparing December 31, 2017 and 2016. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $0.3 million increase in non-accrual loans to $2.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $2.2 million at December 31, 2016. Despite the increase in non-accrual loans, FNCB’s loan delinquency rate (total delinquent loans as a percentage of total loans) improved to 0.72% at December 31, 2017 from 0.81% at the end of 2016.\nThe ratio of non-performing loans to total loans was 0.34% and 0.31% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.17% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.15% at the end of 2016. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.02%, compared to 0.21% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Position\nTotal assets decreased $33.3 million, or 2.8%, to $1.162 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.196 billion at December 31, 2016. Loans, net of net deferred loan costs and unearned income grew $39.4 million, or 5.4%, to $770.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $731.3 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, securities available for sale increased $14.4 million, or 5.2%, to $290.4 million at December 31, 2017 from $276.0 million at the end of 2016. Total deposits decreased $12.7 million, or 1.3%, to $1.002 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.015 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease in total deposits reflected cyclical deposit trends of public funds, coupled with the anticipated exit of short-term funds in the first quarter of 2017 that were received at the end of 2016 related to the sale of a municipal utility. Despite the decrease from year-end 2016, FNCB experienced strong growth in both non-interest bearing and interest-bearing deposits throughout the remainder of 2017. Total deposits grew $79.0 million, or 8.6%, from $923.4 million at March 31, 2017.\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $89.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $90.4 million at December 31, 2016. The $1.2 million reduction was due primarily to dividends declared and paid of $2.2 million, partially offset by common shares issued through the dividend reinvestment and optional cash purchase plans of $0.4 million and stock-based compensation of $0.3 million.\nFNCB’s total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage ratio were 12.08% and 7.74%, respectively at December 31, 2017, a slight improvement compared to 12.06% and 7.53%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The ratios exceeded the 10.00% and 5.00% required to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Basel III capital framework for U.S. Banking organizations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release references adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted net income represents net income, excluding the $8.0 million non-recurring additional income tax expense resulting from the revaluation of FNCB’s net deferred tax assets required by the change in the statutory corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. Management believes this presentation provides the reader with supplemental information that gives a more concise understanding of the impact from the required revaluation of deferred tax assets and facilitates period-to-period comparisons.\nAvailability of Filings\nCopies of FNCB’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on form 10-Q will be provided upon request from: Shareholder Relations, FNCB Bancorp, Inc., 102 East Drinker Street, Dunmore, PA 18512 or by calling (570) 348-6419.
