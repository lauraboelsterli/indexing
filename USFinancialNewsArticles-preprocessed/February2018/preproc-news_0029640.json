    "text": "1 COMMENTS Forbes has a new message for its network of largely unpaid contributors: Only the strong will survive, but they’ll be paid.\nThe financial news publisher is putting each of its 1,500 contributors on a contract that guarantees them a minimum of $250 a month beginning immediately. This new plan also calls for Forbes to review its roster of contributors periodically and cut 10% of the worst performers every year.\nThis strategy makes Forbes the latest publisher to adjust its approach toward contributor networks as the focus in the media industry turns to quality content. HuffPost killed its unpaid contributor network earlier this year, citing rising worry about misleading news stories on social media and elsewhere. The digital-media startup Axios launched a small network of paid freelancers earlier this year to cover international happenings, the same week newspaper publisher Tronc TRNC 0.59% announced its intention to create a network of “deep micro-niche vertical entrepreneurs.”\nRethinking Forbes’ contributor network is one of the first big initiatives from Chief Content Officer Randall Lane, who was promoted in December. He says the number of contributors and full-time staffers won’t decrease, and the changes are being enacted to reward quality contributions.\n“What we’re doing with these guarantees is offering some certainty to encourage people to post,” said Mr. Lane, who added that the budget for the contributor network will increase.\nAbout 60% of Forbes’ contributors were unpaid before today’s change, with the rest creating content under a variety of different contracts, Mr. Lane said. The company compensates paid contributors based on the number of repeat visitors each post attracts, with an additional $250 bonus added on for those who write an unspecified amount of posts a month.\nMr. Lane declined to provide additional details about the pay scale. More than 100 contributors made “well into the five figures” from the contributor program in 2017, with five contributors earning more than $200,000, according to a blog post written to accompany the announcement. But those are outliers.\nForbes has long touted its contributor network as an important driver of growth for a print magazine reinventing itself for the digital era. The company’s audience has grown steadily over the past two years. In early 2016, Forbes’ monthly digital readership averaged 44.5 million unique visitors every month, according to comScore. By the last six months of 2017, its audience had climbed to an average of 53.9 million, according to comScore.\nIn the early days, the logic of contributor networks was clear: More articles meant more readers, which equated to more pageviews and more advertising revenue. Using contributors required less overhead.\nThat changed, in part, as concerns over “fake news” caused readers and advertisers to place a premium on vetted articles.\nAt Axios, one contributing newsletter writer splits ad revenue with the company, said Jim VandeHei, the founder and chief executive of Axios. He says Axios World is aimed at maximizing the amount of informative content on the website, not pursuing a larger audience for its own sake.\n“The lesson of every fad in media—be it traffic, video or free contributors—is it is a scam. And bad business, if done in the service of scale-only or cost-cutting,” Mr. VandeHei said. “But, if your every move is done in service of what the consumer truly desires, you can build a big, beautiful media business.”\nThe focus on quality content is mirrored at HuffPost. Maintaining a wide-open platform “made a lot of sense in 2005” when HuffPost was launched and blogging tools weren’t yet widely adopted, said Lydia Polgreen, the editor in chief of HuffPost. Now that anyone can blog and misinformation is commonplace, advertisers are less interested in being next to articles that haven’t been vetted. There are fewer pieces, but the average audience for each has increased significantly, she said.\n“In the current environment, it’s very clear that vetted, quality information gets a huge premium from the perspective of advertisers and audiences,” Ms. Polgreen said.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nAt Axios, one contributing newsletter writer splits ad revenue with the company.
