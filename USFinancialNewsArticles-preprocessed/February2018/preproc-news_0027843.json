supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures:\nAdjusted income from operations attributable to shareholders of Genpact Limited, or adjusted income from operations; Adjusted income from operations margin; Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to shareholders of Genpact Limited, or adjusted diluted earnings per share; and Revenue growth on a constant currency basis.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations of Genpact's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP financial measures should be carefully evaluated.\nPrior to July 2012, Genpact's management used financial statements that excluded significant acquisition-related expenses, amortization of related acquired intangibles, and amortization of acquired intangibles at the company's formation in 2004 for its internal management reporting, budgeting and decision making purposes, including comparing Genpact's operating results to that of its competitors. However, considering Genpact's frequent acquisitions of varying scale and size, and the difficulty in predicting expenses relating to acquisitions and the amortization of acquired intangibles thereof, since July 2012 Genpact's management has used financial statements that exclude all acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles for its internal management reporting, budgeting and decision-making purposes, including comparing Genpact's operating results to those of its competitors. For the same reasons, since April 2016 Genpact's management has excluded the impairment of acquired intangible assets from the financial statements it uses for internal management purposes. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded in the period in which an acquisition is consummated.\nGenpact's management also uses financial statements that exclude stock-based compensation expense. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting ASC 718 \"Compensation-Stock Compensation,\" Genpact's management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude such expenses allows investors to make additional comparisons between Genpact's operating results and those of other companies. Additionally, in its calculations of such non-GAAP financial measures, Genpact's management has adjusted other income and expenses, certain gains, losses and impairment charges attributable to equity-method investments, and gains or losses attributable to non-controlling interests because management views these interests as part of its ongoing operations. For the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share, the combined current and deferred tax effect is determined by multiplying each pre-tax adjustment by the applicable statutory income tax rate.\nGenpact's management provides information about revenues on a constant currency basis so that the revenues may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our true business performance. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period's foreign currency exchange rates adjusted for hedging gains/losses in such period.\nAccordingly, Genpact believes that the presentation of adjusted income from operations, adjusted income from operations margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share and revenue growth on a constant currency basis, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin versus income from operations and income from operations margin calculated in accordance with GAAP is that these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain recurring costs and certain other charges, namely stock-based compensation and amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information on the GAAP amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin.\nThe following tables show the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures from GAAP for the year and three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017:\nReconciliation of Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Income from Operations Margin\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands)\nYear ended December 31,\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017\nIncome from operations\n$\n340,777\n$\n328,627\n$\n98,091\n$\n72,049\nAdd: Stock-based compensation\n25,113\n35,685\n6,769\n13,283\nAdd: Amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets\n25,023\n35,467\n6,816\n11,390\nAdd: Acquisition-related expenses\n1,956\n5,886\n120\n131\nAdd: Other income (expense), net\n10,120\n26,238\n2,948\n17,227\nLess: Equity-method investment activity, net\n(7,698)\n(4,543)\n(1,362)\n24\nAdd: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest\n2,137\n2,270\n232\n944\nAdjusted income from operations\n$\n397,428\n$\n429,630\n$\n113,614\n$\n115,048\nAdjusted income from operations margin\n15.5\n%\n15.7\n%\n16.7\n%\n15.7\n%\nReconciliation of Adjusted Diluted EPS 9\n(Unaudited)\n(Per share data)\nYear ended December 31,\nThree months ended December 31,\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.28\n$\n1.34\n$\n0.38\n$\n0.34\nAdd: Stock-based compensation\n0.12\n0.18\n0.03\n0.07\nAdd: Amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets\n0.12\n0.18\n0.03\n0.06\nAdd: Acquisition-related expenses\n0.01\n0.03\n—\n—\nLess: Tax impact on stock-based compensation\n(0.03)\n(0.05)\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nLess: Tax impact on amortization and impairment of acquired\nintangibles\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n(0.01)\n(0.02)\nLess: Tax impact on acquisition-related expenses\n—\n—\n—\n—\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n1.46\n$\n1.62\n$\n0.43\n$\n0.43\nThe following tables show the reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures from GAAP for the year ending December 31, 2018:\nReconciliation of Outlook for Adjusted Income from Operations Margin\n(Unaudited)\nYear ending\nDecember 31, 2018\nIncome from operations margin\n12.4\n%\nAdd: Estimated stock-based compensation\n1.4\n%\nAdd: Estimated amortization of acquired intangible assets\n1.3\n%\nAdd: Estimated acquisition-related expenses\n0.1\n%\nAdd: Estimated other income (expense), net\n0.6\n%\nLess: Estimated equity-method investment activity, net\n—\nAdjusted income from operations margin\n15.8\n%\nReconciliation of Outlook for Adjusted Diluted EPS 10\n(Unaudited)\n(Per share data)\nYear ending December 31, 2018\nLower\nUpper\nDiluted EPS\n$\n1.39\n$\n1.43\nAdd: Estimated stock-based compensation\n0.23\n0.23\nAdd: Estimated amortization of acquired intangible assets\n0.21\n0.21\nAdd: Estimated acquisition-related expenses\n0.01\n0.01\nLess: Estimated tax impact on stock-based compensation\n(0.06)\n(0.06)\nLess: Estimated tax impact on amortization of acquired intangibles\n(0.07)\n(0.07)\nLess: Estimated tax impact on acquisition-related expenses\n—\n—\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n1.70\n$\n1.74",
