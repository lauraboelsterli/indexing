    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ankura announced today the appointment of Dr. Scott Lipkin as a Managing Director. Based out of the Philadelphia office, Dr. Lipkin brings more than 28 years of combined experience as a podiatric physician/surgeon, clinical research investigator, institutional review board chair, human research protection program administrator, executive research administrator, and management consultant. His expertise is in the domain of research consulting, with focus on human subject protections, research compliance, and research operations.\nDr. Lipkin was a member of the medical staff of Lehigh Valley Health Network for 25 years and was chief of the division of podiatric surgery from 2000-2010. He obtained certification with the American Board of Podiatric Surgery in 1992 and over the next 15 years participated as principal or sub-investigator on 16 clinical trials related to diabetic foot wounds and wound healing.\nFor over 20 years, Dr. Lipkin's work focused on the area of human subject protections, at Lehigh Valley Health Network, serving as an institutional review board member and chair. He led LVHN through the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protections Program process. He was also director of the Research Participant Protection Office, where he designed and implemented policies and procedures for research conflict of interest, research compliance, quality improvement, community outreach, and education.\nIn 2010, Dr. Lipkin transitioned from clinical practice to serve full time in an administrative role, taking on the position of chief of the newly created Network Office of Research and Innovation at Lehigh Valley Health Network. He joined FTI Consulting in 2014 as a managing director where he helped develop the firm's clinical research and compliance practice.\nAnkura Senior Managing Director F. Lisa Murtha stated, \"Scott's experience in the healthcare field of clinical research, human subject protections, and research compliance is unparalleled. As Ankura continues to build its healthcare compliance team, the addition of Scott offers our clients the best possible advice on clinical research, human subject protection, and research compliance, all areas of critical importance to the healthcare industry today.\"\nDr. Lipkin said, \"The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape that governs clinical research requires deep expertise and experience to provide superior client service and that is what defines Ankura. I am excited to be a part of Ankura's healthcare compliance team, working with many who are the leading talent in the industry today.\"\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scott-lipkin-joins-ankura-as-a-managing-director-300601218.html\nSOURCE Ankura",
