United, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, bumped passengers at a rate of 0.23 per 10,000 passengers. American Airlines ( AAL.O ), the country’s largest airline, had a rate of 0.38 per 10,000. \nWhile a record-breaking year for airline safety and performance, 2017 was also a time of reckoning for carrier customer service practices, after a series of unflattering headlines and public relations nightmares shined a critical light on the industry. \nAfter the United Airlines incident and a subsequent congressional inquiry into the matter, major U.S. carriers announced changes to their booking policies. These included increasing the maximum passenger incentive for passengers to forgo their flights, which rose to nearly $10,000 in the cases of United and Delta. \nSouthwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) said the carrier would no longer overbook its flights. In 2017, Southwest bumped passengers at a rate of 0.53 per 10,000 passengers, ranking number nine out of 12 airlines measured. \nPrior to the United incident, just one of the major U.S. carriers, JetBlue ( JBLU.O ), had a policy explicitly stating it would not overbook its flights. In 2017, JetBlue bumped passengers at a rate of 0.41 out of 10,000 passengers. \nIn December, the number of customer complaints about U.S. carriers filed with the Transportation Department dropped to 628 from 1,254 in December 2016.
