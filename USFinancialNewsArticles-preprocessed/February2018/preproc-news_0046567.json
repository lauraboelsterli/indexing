    "text": "February 21, 2018 / 2:49 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Bank of England rates could rise more than thought, says chief economist Andy Bruce , David Milliken 4 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Wednesday he thought there was a chance that interest rates would need to rise faster than the BoE’s central view in order to bring inflation to target. “I would judge the risks to the (Monetary Policy Committee‘s) latest projections, for both UK demand and inflation, as lying to the upside,” Haldane wrote in an annual report to parliament. Both the world economy and Britain could well do better than the BoE’s most recent forecasts, he added. “In my view, this would put the balance of risks to the path of interest rates necessary to return inflation sustainably to target to the upside,” Haldane said. Carney and his fellow BoE interest rate-setters said this month they would need to raise borrowing costs sooner and by more than they had expected previously if the economy performed in line with their forecasts. Britain’s economy has lagged behind stronger growth in much of the world, due largely to the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote. But it has held up better than expected at the time of the shock referendum decision to leave the European Union. Some BoE officials as recently as last year had emphasised the dangers of raising rates prematurely. But Haldane took a different view. “Historically the thing that has really killed jobs has been central banks stepping on the brakes too late,” he told lawmakers of parliament’s Treasury Committee.

REUTERS/Victoria Jones/Pool ”We are absolutely clear we don’t want to be back there again because it’s bad news for jobs. “And that means going in this limited and gradual way to head things off in advance, to prevent having to step on the brakes -- a hand-brake turn,” he said. BoE Governor Mark Carney, also speaking in parliament on Wednesday, said the most important factor for Britain’s economy remained the approach of Brexit in 2019 and its impact on confidence in the country. “There will be some very big developments over the course of this year around (the) future of our relationship with the European Union, which will have an impact on the expectations of households and businesses and therefore on the economic outlook,” he said. “Monetary policy is nimble. It will react to those expectations.” Haldane said if British economic growth held up at around the rates seen during 2017, that would justify the view among officials that some withdrawal of stimulus would be needed. The second “key factor” would a continuation of price pressures -- particularly in wage growth -- in the early months of this year. Official data published on Wednesday showed overall wage growth remained stable in annual terms during the three months to December, although some economists said a month-by-month breakdown pointed to higher annual pay growth ahead. Haldane said he thought it very likely that January 2018 data would show a marked pick-up in wage growth, which he expected would soon reach an annual rate of 3 percent. A Reuters poll of economists last week suggested borrowing costs are likely to rise in May, earlier than previously thought.
