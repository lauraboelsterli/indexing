Thanks to steady demand at our active projects, contract sales in this quarter grew to US$802 million, or over RMB5.4 billion, above the high end of our guidance range of RMB4.6 billion to RMB 4.8 billion. This consequently drove our full-year contract sales growth to 40.0% from the previous year, above our guidance range of 35% to 37%.\"\n\"During the fourth quarter, we commenced pre-sales on two new projects in China -- Zhengzhou International New City III and Zhengzhou Fancy City II (North),\" continued Mr. Zhang, \"and we continued to take advantage of market conditions to increase our land bank with six projects for development and three construction management service projects are in the pipeline. These projects are mainly located in our existing markets, with solid track records, and we believe they will drive our long-term growth. Furthermore, our under planning stage projects in both China and the U.S. continue to proceed as expected.\"\n\"We remain cautious about the market as the government's restrictive policy continues, but we are optimistic about our ability to adjust to the environment and deliver strong financial results. We will continue to seek additional avenues of growth in our core development business as well as our new construction management service business. We remain committed to our shareholders and are proud to have achieved 24 consecutive quarterly dividends thus far,\" concluded Mr. Zhang.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nContract Sales\nContract sales in China totaled US$795.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to US$347.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and US$597.5 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Company's GFA sales in China were 443,600 square meters in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 222,000 square meters in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 369,500 square meters in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe average selling price (\"ASP\") per square meter sold in China was RMB12,118 (US$1,794) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to RMB10,401 (US$1,566) in the fourth quarter of 2016 and RMB10,994 (US$1,616) in the third quarter of 2017.\nContract sales in the United States totaled US$6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company commenced pre-sales of two new projects in the fourth quarter of 2017, Zhengzhou International New City III and Zhengzhou Fancy City II (North), which contributed 23.6% and 24.8% of total GFA sales and total contract sales, respectively.\nBreakdown of GFA Sales and ASPs by Project in China\nProject\nQ4 2016\nQ3 2017\nQ4 2017\nUnsold\nGFA\nASP\nGFA\nASP\nGFA\nASP\nGFA\n(m 2 , 0 00s)\n(RMB)\n(m 2 , 000s)\n(RMB)\n(m 2 , 000s)\n(RMB)\n(m 2 , 000s)\nXingyang Splendid II\n21.4\n6,213\n1.4\n6,973\n1.6\n11,650\n55.8\nKunshan Royal Palace\n2.0\n23,137\n6.2\n25,987\n1.3\n24,232\n2.0\nJinan Royal Palace\n29.1\n8,798\n29.7\n12,457\n35.5\n12,404\n101.4\nXuzhou Colorful City\n2.5\n11,791\n0.6\n11,138\n31.4\n11,246\n15.1\nChengdu Thriving Family\n8.5\n9,621\n10.2\n15,061\n15.8\n10,724\n30.2\nChangsha Xinyuan Splendid\n12.1\n9,461\n7.4\n13,726\n4.2\n18,379\n13.0\nSanya Yazhou Bay No.1\n2.7\n12,723\n1.6\n15,313\n2.7\n27,497\n61.7\nXi'an Metropolitan\n19.4\n10,781\n7.2\n9,497\n21.2\n9,719\n36.8\nZhengzhou Xindo Park\n22.8\n6,419\n8.1\n8,552\n11.3\n11,110\n17.7\nJinan Xin Central\n9.0\n12,214\n9.2\n12,151\n16.9\n11,477\n38.7\nHenan Xin Central I\n5.5\n9,673\n28.5\n4,093\n9.5\n12,890\n15.8\nZhengzhou Fancy City I\n2.8\n14,594\n18.8\n5,155\n2.0\n14,004\n8.4\nZhengzhou Fancy City II (South)\n9.6\n12,353\n2.9\n13,995\n4.4\n15,899\n6.0\nTianjin Spring Royal Palace\n2.4\n6,934\n6.2\n11,617\n2.5\n12,590\n150.1\nKunshan Xindo Park\n0.6\n19,060\n11.5\n22,198\n12.7\n22,311\n18.2\nZhengzhou International New\nCity I\n48.6\n10,717\n35.3\n10,141\n33.9\n4,401\n33.2\nHenan Xin Central II\n9.0\n10,920\n28.0\n8,379\n10.4\n11,858\n20.1\nXingyang Splendid III\n-\n-\n47.4\n7,217\n18.9\n7,237\n39.3\nChangsha Mulian Royal Palace\n-\n-\n32.8\n11,291\n21.6\n12,899\n36.9\nZhengzhou International New\nCity II\n-\n-\n69.0\n13,783\n76.7\n13,711\n30.3\nZhengzhou International New\nCity III\n-\n-\n-\n-\n73.6\n14,058\n148.6\nZhengzhou Fancy City II (North)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n31.2\n9,499\n77.2\nOthers\n14.0\n-\n7.5\n-\n4.3\n-\n82.5\nTotal\n222.0\n10,401\n369.5\n10,994\n443.6\n12,118\n1,039.0\nRevenue\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company's total revenue increased 44.3% to US$729.0 million from US$505.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased 51.1% from US$482.4 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$177.9 million, or 24.4% of revenue, compared to a gross profit of US$126.8 million, or 25.1% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a gross profit of US$108.8 million, or 22.6% of revenue, in the third quarter of 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses were US$77.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to US$52.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and US$51.0 million for the third quarter of 2017.

During the fourth quarter of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, the Landmark Protection Committee approved Xinyuan's landmark protection plan and awarded the Company a Certificate of Appropriateness.

The Company continues to follow the required governmental procedures for the future construction needs of this project.\nUpdate on Construction Management Service Business\nLeveraging its experience and resources in the industry to provide value to companies that would like to own buildings but have no property development expertise, Xinyuan started its construction management service business in the third quarter of 2017 with its first project in Guangzhou.

This business section will supplement Xinyuan's core traditional project development business for future growth.

For first quarter of 2018, contract sales are expected to be on par with the prior year first quarter period and the Company expects significant pressure on earnings in the first quarter due to slower sales associated with Chinese New Year and increased interest expense associated with new debt from land acquisitions in late 2017.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call at 8:00 am ET on February 09, 2018 to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results.
