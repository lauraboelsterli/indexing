During this quarter, we announced our strategic partnership with Tencent and JD.com, which we believe will contribute meaningfully to our customer growth and market share gain. In addition, we are delighted to have become the sponsor and exclusive Chinese e-commerce partner for London Fashion Week, further strengthening our leadership in our core categories and solidifying our strong position in the fashion industry. Through this partnership, we aim to introduce more desirable brands to the Vipshop platform and increase our exposure in the global fashion scene.\"\nMr. Donghao Yang, Chief Financial Officer of Vipshop, further commented, \"In the fourth quarter of 2017, we delivered robust financial results. Our topline increased by 27% year over year, which was above the high-end of our guidance range. Driven by improved customer loyalty and stickiness, our average revenue per customer increased by a solid 22% year over year. We believe the high-quality traffic from Tencent and JD.com will boost our topline growth, enabling us to achieve further operating leverage in the long run.\"\nRecent Business Highlights\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Vipshop received strategic investment of approximately US$863 million from Tencent and JD.com in consideration for newly issued Class A ordinary shares of Vipshop (the \"Investment Shares\") representing approximately 10% of Vipshop's total issued shares. As a result, Tencent and JD.com beneficially own, taking into account any existing holding, approximately 7% and 5.5%, respectively, of Vipshop's total issued shares. The Investment Shares are subject to a two-year lock-up period, and Tencent and JD.com have the right to appoint a director and an observer, respectively, to Vipshop's board of directors. In order to maintain director and board observer rights after the lock-up period, Tencent and JD.com have to increase their holdings of Vipshop's total shares issued to 12% and 8%, respectively, unless otherwise agreed to by Vipshop. Concurrently with the strategic investment, Tencent, JD.com and Vipshop established strategic partnerships, through which Vipshop will have traffic access on WeChat Wallet, JD.com's main page, and JD.com's WeChat Discovery shopping portal. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Vipshop's average revenue per customer increased by 22% year over year, driven by the robust 22% year-over-year increase in average number of orders per customer. During the quarter, 84% of customers were repeat customers, up from 75% in the prior year period. Approximately 96% of orders were placed by repeat customers, up from 92% in the prior year period. For the full year of 2017, more than 71% of customers were repeat customers, up from 67% in the prior year, and 95% of orders were placed by repeat customers, up from 94% in the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Vipshop added a local warehouse in Quanzhou, China, which brings the Company's total number of local warehouses to fifteen as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company expanded its overseas warehousing space by adding new locations in Italy and the United Kingdom, bringing its total international warehousing capacity to approximately 53,000 square meters.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, Vipshop delivered approximately 99% of its orders through its in-house last mile delivery network, up from 91% in the prior year period.

As of December 31, 2017, close to one million customers enrolled in the Company's Super VIP Paid Membership Program. The average revenue per customer and shopping frequency of the program's paid members increased significantly year over year.

Vipshop recently added a number of popular domestic and international brands to its platform, such as Vera Wang and Jil Sander Navy. On January 25, 2018, Vipshop announced that it has become a sponsor and the exclusive Chinese e-commerce partner for London Fashion Week, one of the most influential fashion events worldwide. Through this sponsorship and partnership, Vipshop aims to introduce more trendy and authentic British brands to Chinese consumers via its powerful platform.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates\" and similar statements. Among other things, the business outlook and quotations from management in this announcement, as well as Vipshop's strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. Vipshop may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about Vipshop's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: Vipshop's goals and strategies; Vipshop's future business development, results of operations and financial condition; the expected growth of the online discount retail market in China; Vipshop's ability to attract customers and brand partners and further enhance its brand recognition; Vipshop's expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of flash sales products and services; competition in the discount retail industry; fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in Vipshop's filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release, and Vipshop does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), except that the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the detailed notes required by Accounting Standards Codification 270 Interim Reporting (\"ASC270\"), have not been presented. Vipshop uses non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders, non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders per diluted ADS, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating income margin, non-GAAP net margin attributable to Vipshop's shareholders, and free cash flow, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders is net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment loss of investments, and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions and equity method investments. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders per diluted ADS is computed using non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders divided by weighted average number of diluted ADS outstanding for computing diluted earnings per ADS. Non-GAAP income from operations is income from operations excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income margin is non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of total net revenue. Non-GAAP net margin attributable to Vipshop's shareholders is non-GAAP net income attributable to Vipshop's shareholders as a percentage of total net revenue. Free cash flow is the operating cash flow adding back the impact from Internet financing activities and less capital expenditures, which include purchase of property and equipment, purchase and deposits of land use rights, and purchase of other assets. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of share-based compensation, impairment loss of investments and amortization of intangible assets adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, impairment loss of investments, and amortization of intangible assets. Free cash flow enables the Company to assess liquidity and cash flow, taking into account the impact from Internet financing activities and the financial resources needed for the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform. Share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. One of the key limitations of free cash flow is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Vipshop Holdings Limited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this release.\nInvestor Relations Contact\nJessie Fan\nTel: +86 (20) 2233-0732\nEmail: IR@vipshop.com\n[1] \"Active customers\" are defined as registered members who have purchased from the Company or the
