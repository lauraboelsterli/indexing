    "text": "MACAU, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (Nasdaq:MLCO) (“Melco” or the “Company”), a developer, owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment casino resort facilities in Asia, today reported its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$1,332.6 million, representing an increase of approximately 12% from US$1,192.9 million for the comparable period in 2016. The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to higher rolling chip revenues across all properties and higher mass market table games revenues in Studio City and City of Dreams Manila, partially offset by lower mass market table games revenues in City of Dreams in Macau.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$129.0 million, compared with operating income of US$116.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 11%.\nAdjusted property EBITDA (1) was US$339.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to Adjusted property EBITDA of US$304.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing an increase of 12%. The year-on-year improvement in Adjusted property EBITDA was mainly attributable to the higher contribution from Studio City and Altira Macau driven by increased casino revenues, partially offset by lower contribution from City of Dreams in Macau.\nNet income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited for the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$81.2 million, or US$0.17 per ADS, compared with US$43.3 million, or US$0.09 per ADS, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2017 of US$9.8 million was related to Studio City and City of Dreams Manila.\nMr. Lawrence Ho, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “After three consecutive years of decline, Macau’s gaming revenue rebounded strongly in 2017 with approximately 20% growth compared to 2016 on a year-on-year basis. In 2018, we expect another year of robust growth for Macau, as the market benefits from the improving demand environment, the anticipated completion of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and the ongoing build-out of Cotai.\n“Mass and Premium Mass gaming should remain the primary drivers of Macau’s future growth, which is consistent with our long-held vision for the evolution of the market. Our first mover advantage and our strong determination to offer the best integrated resort experience have enabled City of Dreams to remain a leader in Macau’s premium mass gaming market, despite multiple new resorts opening. To further solidify our leadership position in this important market segment, we have executed on an extensive upgrade to our flagship property, City of Dreams, which includes the announced launch of the Forbes 5-star “NÜWA” hotel, the rebranding and redevelopment of The Count:Down, and the eagerly awaited opening of Morpheus, the cornerstone of the final phase of development for City of Dreams, which is set to be a true landmark for all of Macau.\n“At Studio City, we are embarking on a series of property upgrades to refine the entertainment offerings and improve accessibility into the resort, which we believe will facilitate the continuing ramp up that Studio City has experienced over the past several quarters. We will also continue to explore the phase 2 expansion of Studio City which we believe will augment the existing room inventory and entertainment offerings and contribute to the continued growth and development of this property.\n“In The Philippines, City of Dreams Manila delivered another strong quarter with all gaming segments continuing to enjoy robust year-on-year growth, despite new supply within Entertainment City.\n“Aiming at optimizing our operating excellence, we have announced the redeployment of our senior operating management with David Sisk appointed as the Property President of City of Dreams Macau and Geoff Andres appointed as Property President of Studio City. Both of them have demonstrated their innovative spirit and their expertise in delivering strong growth. We believe the cross-pollination of new ideas and management initiatives will provide an opportunity for all our integrated resorts to benefit from performance improvements.\n“The board has, after evaluating the company’s current liquidity position and future expected capital needs, decided to increase the quarterly cash dividend by 50% to US$0.045 per ordinary share, which is equivalent to US$0.135 per ADS, from the previous quarterly dividend of US$0.03 per ordinary share.\n“Lastly, Japan continues to be a core focus of ours. With the passage of the Integrated Resorts (IR) implementation bill, the country will take a major step forward toward the development of the next generation of integrated resorts that will operate in this incredibly exciting, yet currently underpenetrated, tourism destination. With our high quality assets, dedication to world-class entertainment offerings, market-leading social safeguards and compliance culture, and commitment to being an ideal partner to local governments and communities alike, we believe Melco is in a strong position to help Japan realize the vision for integrated resort development with unique Japanese touch.”\nC it y of Dreams Fourth Quarter Results\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net revenue at City of Dreams was US$612.6 million compared to US$661.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. City of Dreams generated Adjusted EBITDA of US$169.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with Adjusted EBITDA of US$188.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

We recorded US$10.5 million of capitalized interest during the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to the development of Morpheus at City of Dreams.\nThe year-on-year decrease of US$36.8 million in net non-operating expenses was primarily a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt and costs associated with debt modification arising from the refinancing of the Studio City project facility in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as lower other finance costs in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization costs of US$133.5 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 of which US$14.3 million was related to the amortization of our gaming subconcession and US$5.7 million was related to the amortization of land use rights.\nFinancial Position and Capital Expenditure\nTotal cash and bank balances as of December 31, 2017 were US$1.5 billion, including US$9.9 million of bank deposits with original maturities over three months and US$45.5 million of restricted cash, primarily related to Studio City.

These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (the “ Company ”) may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) growth of the gaming market and visitations in Macau and the Philippines, (ii) capital and credit market volatility, (iii) local and global economic conditions, (iv) our anticipated growth strategies, (v) gaming authority and other governmental approvals and regulations, and (vi) our future business development, results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “target”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions. Further information regarding these and other risks, uncertainties or factors is included in the Company’s filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of this press release, and the Company undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(1) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, development costs, property charges and other, share-based compensation, payments to the Philippine parties under the cooperative arrangement (the “ Philippine Parties ”), land rent to Belle Corporation, net gain on disposal of property and equipment to Belle Corporation and other non-operating income and expenses. \"Adjusted property EBITDA\" is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, development costs, property charges and other, share-based compensation, payments to the Philippine Parties, land rent to Belle Corporation, net gain on disposal of property and equipment to Belle Corporation, Corporate and Others expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA are presented exclusively as supplemental disclosures because management believes they are widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA as measures of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA because they are used by some investors as ways to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures, and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA as supplements to financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income as indicators of the Company's performance, as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA do not include depreciation and amortization or interest expense and, therefore, do not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company compensates for these limitations by using adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA as only two of several comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.\nSuch U.S. GAAP measurements include operating income, net income, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other recurring and nonrecurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted property EBITDA. Also, the Company's calculation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are provided herein immediately following the financial statements included in this press release.\n(2) “Adjusted net income” is net income before net gain on disposal of property and equipment to Belle Corporation, pre-opening costs, development costs, property charges and other, loss on extinguishment of debt and costs associated with debt modification, net of noncontrolling interests and taxes calculated using specific tax treatments applicable to the adjustments based on their respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited per share (“ EPS ”) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes they are widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. Reconciliations of adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are provided herein immediately following the financial statements included in this press release.\nAbout Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited\nThe Company, with its American depositary shares listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ:MLCO), is a developer, owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment casino resort facilities in Asia.
