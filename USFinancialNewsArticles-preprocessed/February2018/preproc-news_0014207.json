    "text": "(Adds detail on IT costs)\nLONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain’s TSB Bank expects to pay more in fees to Lloyds Banking Group for using its former owner’s banking platform, as it posted a profit fall in 2017 as a result of the payments.\nSince it was taken over by Spain’s Banco Sabadell in 2015, TSB has been using Lloyds’ IT infrastructure, at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds each year.\nTSB said on Friday its operating costs rose by 16.7 percent to 821 million pounds in 2017 while its profit before tax fell to 162.7 million pounds, primarily due to a 122 million pound increase in the fees payable to Lloyds.\nThe fall in the bank’s profit was also as a result of a non-recurring gain from the sale of its interest in Visa Europe, worth 32.5 million pounds, in the previous year.\nTSB said it will finally migrate off the Lloyds platform and onto a newly-built one this year, but until the roll-out is complete, it remains tied into fee increases.\nThe bank also named a new chairman, with former Standard Chartered banker Richard Meddings, a non-executive director at TSB, succeeding Will Samuel with immediate effect.
