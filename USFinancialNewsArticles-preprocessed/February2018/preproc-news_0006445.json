Similar lapses have occurred at Kobe Steel and Toray Industries Inc, and incorrect final inspection procedures have been found at automakers Nissan and Subaru.\nAs of now, it does not appear that any laws have been broken, the company said. The products in question are likely to have been shipped to 121 corporate customers, it said.\nPresident Nabeshima said the company would set up an internal investigative committee to make thorough checks on the issue and come up with measures to prevent their recurrence by around April.\nCosmo Energy Holdings has a 52.7 percent voting right in Maruzen Petrochemical. Other major shareholders include Ube Industries, Denka Co and JNC Corp.\nA Cosmo Energy spokeswoman said some of the products in question had been manufactured by Maruzen’s naphtha cracker at its Chiba plant, adding that it had rectified the misconduct by late January. The revelation would not lead to a halt in manufacturing units operated by Maruzen or Cosmo, she said.\nShares in Cosmo Energy fell as much as 10 percent before closing down 2.5 percent, against a 0.9 percent decline in the Nikkei average.
