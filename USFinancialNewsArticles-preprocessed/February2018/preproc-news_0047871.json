(Photo: Business Wire)\nTalisker Club provides a private club experience to Tuhaye and Empire Pass Residents that includes access to the Club’s private amenities. Five generations of a Member’s family enjoy access to a wide range of Club facilities and activities.\nTuhaye is a 2,000-acre community nine miles east of Park City on the Jordanelle Reservoir. It features a Mark O’Meara Signature golf course, clubhouse, spa, fitness, kids’ camp, tennis courts, miles of hiking trails, and outdoor-activity programming.\nEmpire Pass is anchored by the Tower Club, a private on-mountain club with a full-service ski locker facility, a kids’ program, heated pools, spas and fitness. Unique to Talisker is The Outpost, an outdoor adventure center at Bonanza Flats.\n“The Talisker Club lifestyle is incomparable,” said Mark Enderle, a partner in Storied Development. “Few places have the caliber of four-season amenities offered with the Club, not to mention the proximity to a village with the charm of Park City. We look forward to working closely with our Members, the local brokerage community and engaging the national market to re-introduce the Talisker Club.”\n“The properties associated with the Talisker Club are among the premier residential offerings in the West,” said Storied Development partner Mark Yarborough. “With a refreshed vision, an infusion of new capital, and a commitment to providing remarkable experiences for members, their families and guests, there is no limit to Talisker Club’s potential.”\nCurrently, homesites are being offered in Tuhaye. Plans for a limited new property release are slated for mid-2018. New construction Tuhaye amenities and marketing outreach are set to begin this spring.
