    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 6:34 PM / in a few seconds Trump Jr.'s wife hospitalized after suspicious powder scare: police Jonathan Allen , Peter Szekely 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Vanessa Trump, the daughter-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, and two other people were taken to a New York hospital on Monday after she opened a piece of mail containing an unidentified white powder that was later determined to be non-hazardous, officials said. \nVanessa Trump, the wife of the president’s eldest son Donald Jr., was hospitalized after she complained of nausea following her exposure, New York officials said. \n“The substance had arrived by mail and it was addressed to Donald Trump Jr.,” said New York Police Department spokesman Carlos Nieves. \nThree patients from the household were transported to the NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center for further evaluation, said Fire Department spokeswoman Sophia Kim. \nThe three included Vanessa Trump’s mother, although she had not complained of symptoms, the police spokesman said. \nThe package had a Boston postmark, ABC News and the New York Post reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. NYPD officials declined to comment on that detail. \nU.S. authorities have been on alert for mail containing white powder since 2001, when envelopes laced with anthrax were sent to media outlets and U.S. lawmakers, killing five people.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo \nPresident Trump spoke with his daughter-in-law on Monday afternoon, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, declining further comment on the investigation. \nThe U.S. Secret Service, which is charged with protecting members of the president’s family, has joined the investigation, said spokesman Jeffrey Adams. Slideshow (9 Images) \nThe apartment building where the incident occurred is in Manhattan’s Sutton Place neighborhood close to the East River. The apartment may be the home of Vanessa Trump’s mother, local news outlets reported. \nDonald Jr. has been in the public eye for his role in a 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with a Russian attorney and others after the Trump campaign was offered potentially damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. \nCongress has held probes into that meeting and whether it was part of a Russian campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \nRussia denies trying to influence the election. Trump dismisses any talk of collusion. \nIn 2016, white powder, which also proved harmless, was sent to the home of Eric Trump, Trump Jr.’s brother.
