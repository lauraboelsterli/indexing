    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Northleaf Capital Partners (Northleaf) is pleased to announce that Matt Shafer has joined the firm as a Managing Director, based in New York. Matt will contribute to the ongoing success of Northleaf’s private equity program, focusing on the origination and execution of secondary market opportunities. As the firm continues to expand its global private markets investment management platform, Matt will launch and lead Northleaf’s New York office, which is scheduled to officially open in the spring of 2018. Matt will be joined in New York by Brad Blowes and Mitch Reeves, members of Northleaf’s private equity investment team who will be relocating from Northleaf’s Toronto office.\n“We are delighted to welcome Matt to the team to drive the continued development of our successful secondaries track record,” said Michael Flood, Managing Director and Head of Private Equity. “Matt’s established relationships, reputation and wealth of experience in North American private markets transactions reinforce our ability to deliver strong returns and exceptional outcomes to our investors.”\nMatt joins Northleaf from Vision Capital, where he was a Partner and served as Head of the Americas business. Matt led the sourcing, analysis and execution of private equity and structured capital investments and served on corporate boards for private equity-backed companies across the consumer, industrial and business services sectors. Previously, Matt was a Managing Director at Nomura International (formerly Lehman Brothers) in London. Matt began his career at CIBC World Markets, where he worked in both New York and London. “I am thrilled to be joining Northleaf as it continues to expand its presence in the U.S. I look forward to working with the Northleaf team to extend the firm’s global private markets capabilities in New York,” he said.\nNorthleaf’s global private markets investment platform continues to grow. The firm manages more than US$10 billion in private equity, private credit and infrastructure capital and Northleaf’s team numbers more than 100 professionals. The addition of the New York office will complement Northleaf’s existing offices in Toronto, Montreal, London, Chicago and Menlo Park, and its representative office in Melbourne. Northleaf has launched its seventh global private equity fund and its second specialist private equity secondaries fund, and recently announced the final close of its global private credit fund with more than US$670 million in capital commitments.\n“The establishment of our New York office represents an important milestone for Northleaf’s global strategy,” said Stuart Waugh, Managing Partner of Northleaf. “We are adding talent to our investment team, extending our global office network and enhancing our ability to provide our investors with access to highly differentiated private markets investments. Importantly, we are also ensuring the continuity of Northleaf’s culture and approach with the relocation of existing team members to join the New York team. These benefits will extend across Northleaf’s integrated private markets investment platform.”\nAbout Northleaf Capital Partners\nNorthleaf Capital Partners is an independent global private markets fund manager with more than US$10 billion in private equity, private credit and infrastructure commitments under management on behalf of public, corporate and multi-employer pension plans, endowments, foundations, financial institutions and family offices.\nNorthleaf’s 100+ person team, located in Toronto, Montreal, London, New York, Chicago and Menlo Park, and a representative office in Melbourne, is focused exclusively on sourcing, evaluating and managing private markets investments globally.
