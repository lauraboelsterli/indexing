That, critics say, represents a conflict of interest and gives the appearance of Trump profiting from the presidency.\nTrump Jr. dismissed those claims on Tuesday, calling them \"nonsense.\"\nExpressing frustration about having to pause business development during his father's term, Trump Jr. described it as \"an understandable opportunity cost,\" claiming his family didn't get credit for \"for doing the right thing.\"",
