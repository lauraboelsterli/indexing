    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Anthem, Inc. (“Anthem”) (NYSE: ANTM) announced today that it has successfully remarketed $1.25 billion principal amount of its 1.90% remarketable subordinated notes due 2028 (the “Remarketed Notes”) originally issued as a part of Anthem’s offering of its corporate units (the “Corporate Units”) on May 12, 2015 (the “Remarketing”). As a result of the Remarketing, the annual interest rate on the Subordinated Notes was reset to 4.324%. Proceeds from the Remarketing will be used to purchase U.S. Treasury securities that will be pledged to secure the stock purchase obligations of the holders of the Corporate Units. The Remarketing is expected to close on March 2, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The purchasers of the Remarketed Notes intend to transfer the Remarketed Notes to Anthem on March 2, 2018 in exchange for $1.25 billion principal amount of senior notes due 2028 and a cash payment of $3.49 per Remarketed Note. We intend to cancel the Remarketed Notes upon receipt.\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.\nAbout Anthem\nAnthem is working to transform health care with trusted and caring solutions.
