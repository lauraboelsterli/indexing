    "text": "TUKWILA, Wash., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- U-Haul® will soon offer a contemporary self-storage facility at 2925 S. 112th St. thanks to the acquisition of the former Boeing® airline customer support offices. U-Haul acquired the pair of five-story towers on Feb. 9.\nU-Haul Moving & Storage of Duwamish is currently operating out of a temporary showroom and offering truck and trailer sharing, moving supplies, towing equipment and more.\nOnce the 323,758-square-foot space is renovated, it will hold approximately 3,800 self-storage units with high-tech security features and indoor climate-control and heating options. U-Box portable moving and storage containers, U-Haul Remote 24/7® access, a U-Haul Re-Use center for gently used household goods and materials, the Take A Box, Leave A Box® program, and much more will also be available on the 12.89-acre lot.\n\"This location will help us bring truck sharing and self-storage to the community of Tukwila and nearby SeaTac, Burien, South Park, Allentown, Glendale and Riverton-Boulevard Park,\" stated Kim Merow, U-Haul Company of South Seattle president. \"We are excited to be in this area and serve our customers more effectively and sustainably.\"\nContact U-Haul Moving & Storage of Duwamish at (206) 792-7317 or stop by to see our progress. Hours of operation are 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Monday-Saturday. Reserve equipment at uhaul.com or contact Reservations at 1-800-GO-UHAUL.\nThe recent acquisition of the Tukwila facility was driven by U-Haul Company's Corporate Sustainability initiatives: U-Haul® supports infill developments to help local communities lower their carbon footprint. Our adaptive reuse of existing buildings reduces the amount of energy and resources required for new-building materials and helps cities reduce their unwanted inventory of unused buildings.\nBy repurposing the former Boeing buildings store, U-Haul prevented the use of 5,526 tons of metal manufacturing and transportation (the amount of steel used to make 5,571 passenger cars); avoided 18,420 tons of new concrete pours (enough to create 372 miles of concrete blocks); kept 24,173 tons of building and demolition debris out of landfills (avoiding 930 dump trucks traveling 19,524 miles); and stopped 29,578,361 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere (the carbon emissions of 2,269 large SUVs or pickup trucks for one year).\n\"We purchased these buildings because we wanted to make sure they were preserved,\" Merow said. \"They have an interesting look to them and we are excited to maintain them. We want to repurpose them, not only to protect the environment, but also to provide needed self-move and self-storage services to these communities.\"\nMerow expects to hire a staff of 20 or more Team Members when the facility is fully operational. U-Haul will look to hire locally to promote job growth within the South Seattle community. U-Haul always encourages local contractors to bid on renovation work.\nThe arrival of U-Haul Truck Share 24/7 is revolutionizing the moving industry through its more convenient, more secure way to pick up and return a truck. U-Haul live verification technology allows rental transactions to be carried out entirely on a smartphone at any hour – day or night. There are no membership fees.
