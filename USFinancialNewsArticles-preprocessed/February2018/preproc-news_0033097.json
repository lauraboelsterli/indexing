    "text": "(Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG ( ROG.S ) said on Thursday it would buy the rest of the privately held U.S. cancer data company Flatiron Health Inc for $1.9 billion to speed up development and delivery of breakthrough medicines for cancer patients. \nFlatiron, backed by Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ), taps into myriad data points on individual cancer cases to help doctors select promising outcomes for their patients. It also stores billing data, doctors' notes and related information.( bit.ly/2EL5OKg ) \nRoche currently owns 12.6 percent stake in Flatiron. In 2016, Roche led a $175 million investment into Flatiron, in part to help the Swiss company make the case that its new cancer medicines should command a premium. \nRoche had said it initially invested in Flatiron on grounds the partnership would not only help it develop new medicines but also help guide how those medicines are made available to patients. \nRoche said in December it would buy U.S. cancer drug specialist Ignyta Inc for $1.7 billion in a deal to broaden its oncology portfolio. \nIn 2014, Google Ventures ( GOOG.O ) led a $130 million investment in Flatiron as healthcare had become a hot area for venture capital, especially companies related to health, data and software. ( reut.rs/2CnuZxb ) \nRoche and Flatiron expect the deal to close in the first half of 2018, after which the latter will continue its operations as a separate entity. \nAllen & Company LLC is the financial adviser to Flatiron Health and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is its legal counsel. Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is acting as legal counsel to Roche. \nReporting by Akankshita Mukhopadhyay in Bengaluru and John Miller in Zurich; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
