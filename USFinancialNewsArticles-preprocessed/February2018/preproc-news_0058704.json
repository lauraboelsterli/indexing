Opel, which is in the process of being bought by French carmaker PSA Group, said a successor will be named as soon as possible. “Ulrich Schumacher has led the transformation of Human Resources at Opel/Vauxhall in Europe in the last five years and developed the function into an important part of the company strategy,” Opel Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said. In November, PSA Group Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said pledges to avoid forced layoffs at Opel will depend on the success of the planned restructuring of the loss-making German division.
