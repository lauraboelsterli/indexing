    "text": "1564 COMMENTS PARKLAND, Fla.—Authorities in Florida have charged the teen arrested for the mass shooting at a high school Wednesday with premeditated murder for each of the 17 people killed, and acknowledged that there might have been a lost chance to intervene.\nAuthorities from President Donald Trump to the local school superintendent also expressed frustration with the continued scourge of school violence, and stressed the need to double down on efforts to prevent attacks.\nNikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former student at the high school who had been expelled, was apprehended nearby Wednesday afternoon and has been officially charged with the killings, according to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office.\nMore\nGunman Kills 17 at Florida High School Shooting Victims: a ‘Jokester’ Coach; an Avid Soccer Player; Youth Volunteers Suspect’s ‘Unhealthy Obsession’: Killing Small Animals, Extreme Gun Fascination A Call From a Child During the Shooting: A Parent’s Story Trump Plans Summit on School Safety Recent School Shootings in U.S. Mr. Cruz legally purchased the AR-15 rifle used in the shooting at a Broward County gun shop about a year ago, according to a law-enforcement official. The sheriff said the suspect also had “countless” gun magazines.\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation official confirmed the FBI received a tip in September about a disturbing comment on YouTube, which the tipster said came from a person with the screen name “nikolas cruz.”\nComment from a person using the screen name ‘nikolas cruz’ on a BenTheBondsman YouTube video. Photo: Youtube “Im going to be a professional school shooter,” the comment said.\nBut the FBI said it wasn’t able to confirm that the comment came from Wednesday’s shooting suspect.\n“The FBI conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment,” said Robert Lasky, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Miami field office, at a press conference.\nBen Bennight, a 36-year-old bail bondsman in Mississippi, said he contacted the FBI after seeing the comment on one of his YouTube posts. He also said he reported the comment as spam to YouTube, which took it down.\nA video screen grab shows Nikolas Cruz at Broward County Jail. Photo: miguel guttierez/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images FBI agents visited Mr. Bennight at the time and returned on Wednesday, he confirmed in an interview, where he said he felt the agency took the issue seriously. One agent told him they were limited in how they could respond because it wasn’t a direct threat, Mr. Bennight said.\n“I wish the information could have prevented something like this from happening,” he said in a new YouTube video, posted after the shooting.\nThe shooting in Parkland, Fla., an affluent suburb near Fort Lauderdale, left both students and teachers dead, according to Sheriff Scott Israel. Most of the victims were killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the sheriff said, and all their families have been notified. More than a dozen people were also wounded.\nLocation of Shooting 95\nWest\nPalm\nBeach\nFLORIDA\nParkland\n27\nPARKLAND\n75\nFort\nLauderdale\nThe\nEverglades\nThe\nEverglades\nMiami\n41\nMarjory Stoneman\nDouglas High School\nAtlantic\nOcean\n20 miles\n869\n20 km\n95\nWest\nPalm\nBeach\nFLORIDA\nParkland\n27\nPARKLAND\n75\nFort\nLauderdale\nThe\nEverglades\nThe\nEverglades\nMiami\n41\nMarjory Stoneman\nDouglas High School\nAtlantic\nOcean\n20 miles\n869\n20 km\n95\nWest\nPalm\nBeach\nFLORIDA\nParkland\n27\nPARKLAND\n75\nFort\nLauderdale\nThe\nEverglades\nThe\nEverglades\nMiami\n41\nMarjory Stoneman\nDouglas High School\nAtlantic\nOcean\n20 miles\n869\n20 km\n95\nWest Palm\nBeach\nFLORIDA\nParkland\n27\n75\nFort Lauderdale\nThe Everglades\nMiami\n41\n20 miles\nAtlantic\nOcean\n20 km\nPARKLAND\nMarjory Stoneman\nDouglas High School\nThe\nEverglades\nSource: Google Earth (image)\nFive people remained hospitalized at two area hospitals, some in critical condition Thursday, said doctors with the Broward Health hospital system at the news conference. Eight others had been discharged or were close to being sent home, they said.\nIt remains unclear if anything Mr. Cruz did or said was enough to raise a red flag, though acquaintances portrayed him as troubled.\nMr. Cruz developed a reputation in his upscale neighborhood in Parkland as a socially-awkward menace known to steal the mail of his neighbors, run through the yards of other homes and hurt animals, according to neighbors and classmates.\nIn a speech Thursday, President Donald Trump praised teachers and first responders after a gunman killed 17 in a Florida school, and pledged to hold a summit to address school safety. Photo: Getty Images “Something was off with him,” said Brody Speno, 19 years old, who went to elementary and middle school with Mr. Cruz. Back when they were in the fifth grade, Mr. Speno said he saw Mr. Cruz try to kill a squirrel by throwing rocks at it. “He was always up to no good,” Mr. Speno said.\nAt least 17 people have been killed and more than a dozen injured after a gunman opened fire at a Parkland, Fla., high school. The suspect was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Photo: Associated Press Authorities had been going through his social-media accounts, which contained “very, very disturbing” information, Sheriff Israel said, without elaborating.\nA white supremacist group, Republic of Florida, told the Anti-Defamation League that Mr. Cruz was affiliated with the group, according to an ADL spokesman. The Republic of Florida didn’t return calls for comment.\nSpeaking to a sheriff’s association in Washington, D.C., Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that advance signals are typical before attacks like the school shooting.\n“Perhaps we haven’t been effective enough in intervening immediately to deal with that,” he said. “It appears that we’ve seen that again in this case.”\nDeadly Legacy Number of fatalities in some of the deadliest mass shootings in the U.S. 10\n60\n1985\n’90\n1991 Killeen, Texas\n23\n1999 Columbine High School, Colo.\n13\n2000\n2007 Virginia Tech\n32\n’10\n2016 Orlando, Fla.\n49\n2017 Las Vegas\n58\n’17\nNote: Fatalities don’t include shooters\nSource: news reports\nAuthorities cannot arrest everyone they believe is dangerous, but “we can and we must do better,” Mr. Sessions said.\nIn an address to the nation Thursday morning, Mr. Trump said he planned to convene a meeting of the nation’s governors and state attorneys general in which he would make school safety “our top priority.”\nThe president made no reference to gun laws during a six-minute speech at the White House. Instead, his speech aimed to console those shaken by the latest mass shooting in the U.S. and vowed to “tackle the difficult issue of mental health.”\n“It it not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference—we must actually make that difference,” Mr. Trump said.\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, said state lawmakers in Tallahassee will have a conversation next week about school safety and keeping guns away from mentally ill people.\n“The violence has to stop,” the governor said. “We cannot lose another child in this country to violence in the school.”\nBroward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie, who has said he wasn’t aware of warning signs before the attack, put the focus on weapons.\n“Now is the time for this country to have a real conversation on sensible gun-control laws,” he said. “Our students are asking for that conversation.”\nWednesday’s school shooting is the deadliest since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six adults were killed. It is the third-deadliest school shooting in modern U.S. history, after Sandy Hook and the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech.\nWednesday’s incident is the sixth high-school shooting so far this year that resulted in injury or death, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control and against gun violence. There have been about 30 school days in 2018.\n—Kate King, Lisa Schwartz, Jim Oberman, Scott Calvert, Dan Frosch, Melissa Korn and Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.\nWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com , Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com",
