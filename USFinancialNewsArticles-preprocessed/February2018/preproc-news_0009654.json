    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., Snowflake Computing , the data warehouse built for the cloud , today announced it has hired Christian Kleinerman as VP of Product and Amritesh Chaudhuri as VP of Product Marketing, and has appointed Mario Duarte as VP of Security. Kleinerman will oversee the continued growth and innovation of Snowflake's products. Chaudhuri will lead product marketing, bringing extensive experience in successfully taking cloud solutions to market. Duarte has extensive experience deploying product and company-wide security programs and will continue to advance the industry- and country-specific security requirements Snowflake customers require. All of these business functions constitute significant areas of investment and growth in the wake of the company's January round of growth funding.\n\"The quality of talent Snowflake attracts and retains validates our leadership in this growing market and our values-based approach as a company,\" Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia said. \"Christian, Amritesh and Mario's industry leadership will be crucial to accelerating product innovation, enhancing our go-to-market strategy and advancing our enterprise-grade security for customers to help enterprises uncover maximum value from their data.\"\nChristian Kleinerman joins Snowflake from Google, where he served as Director of Product Management at YouTube, leading infrastructure and data systems. Previously, Christian spent 13 years at Microsoft, where he ran the company's data warehousing product portfolio as general manager.\n\"Data is the fuel of the future and Snowflake is the company leading that charge,\" Kleinerman said. \"With a modern architecture built from the ground up, this revolutionary technology is already changing the way customers conduct business. Snowflake represents a unique opportunity to join an experienced leadership team and further expand on the company's success.\"\nPrior to joining Snowflake, Amritesh Chaudhuri served as VP of Oracle Cloud, where he led global growth and adoption for Oracle's Cloud Platform across a broad portfolio, including application development, application and data integration and emerging technologies such as mobile, chatbots, IoT, blockchain and AI.\n\"Snowflake is fast becoming the lifeblood of the data economy,\" Chaudhuri said. \"The problem we are solving, effectively helping enterprises to maximize their data, is a very difficult and complex one, and no other company is in a better position to do so. I'm looking forward to contributing to the hyper growth of Snowflake as we help customers drive innovation with data.\"\nMario Duarte is a veteran security professional who has worked in the retail, health care and financial sectors for two decades. He has built and managed security teams, developed and implemented security programs and has managed PCI and HIPAA compliance initiatives for medium and large organizations.\n\"Security has been a pillar of Snowflake's architecture and culture since day one and it's what drives us to embrace strong security safeguards in all facets of our business,\" Duarte said. \"This strong security ethos empowers us to protect our customers valuable data assets against existing and emerging security threats. Snowflake's cloud-built data warehouse-as-a-service is uniquely designed to meet rigorous compliance requirements such as FedRAMP, which in turn help to accelerate our customers' compliance initiatives.\"\nThe expansion of Snowflake's leadership team comes on the heels of Snowflake's $263 million funding round led by ICONIQ Capital, Altimeter Capital and newcomer Sequoia Capital, and joined by existing investors Capital One Growth Ventures, Madrona Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures and Wing Ventures. With these new additions, Snowflake is placing an emphasis on further developing its award-winning solution and continuing to build on the company's corporate momentum.\nAbout Snowflake Computing\nSnowflake is the only data warehouse built for the cloud.
