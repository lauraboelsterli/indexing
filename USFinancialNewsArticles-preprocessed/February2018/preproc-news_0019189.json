    "text": "PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellie Mae ® (NYSE:ELLI), the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nRevenues of $112.9 million, up 17% from $96.2 million in 2016 Net income of $9.9 million 1 , down from $10.9 million in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $28.5 million, down from $29.4 million in 2016 11,000 Encompass seats booked\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nRevenues of $417.0 million, up 16% from $360.3 million in 2016 Net income of $52.9 million 1 , up from $37.8 million in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $122.6 million, up from $113.1 million in 2016 40,800 Encompass seats booked\n“It was a great finish to the year as we continued to gain market share and extend Encompass further into the enterprise segment,” said Jonathan Corr, president and CEO of Ellie Mae. “Our fourth quarter financial results exceeded expectations while seat bookings of 11,000 were also better than expected as more lenders are recognizing the power of the Encompass NG Lending Platform to increase productivity and efficiency.”\n“During the year we made significant progress extending our leadership position. We introduced new products, including our Encompass Connect Suite of solutions, which leverage our new open and scalable architecture, completed the acquisition of Velocify which accelerates our delivery of the front end digital experience, and continued the development and rollout of our next generation lending platform. We see tremendous long-term growth opportunities as we drive toward our goal of end-to-end automation of the mortgage process,” concluded Mr. Corr.\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $112.9 million, compared to $96.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.9 million 1 , or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $10.9 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 net income 1 reflects the impact of changes to the GAAP tax treatment of stock compensation benefits 1 and a benefit resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n1 Please see paragraph titled, “Note Regarding Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting Standard.”\nOn a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to $16.2 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $28.5 million, compared to $29.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP and non-GAAP per share results for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the effect of an additional 3.2 million shares of Common Stock from our follow-on equity offering in August 2016.\nTotal revenue for 2017 was $417.0 million, compared to $360.3 million for 2016. Net income for 2017 was $52.9 million 1 , or $1.48 per diluted share, compared to $37.8 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for 2016. Full year 2017 net income 1 reflects the impact of changes to the GAAP tax treatment of stock compensation benefits 1 and a benefit resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income for 2017 was $58.9 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared to $60.6 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $122.6 million, compared to $113.1 million for 2016. GAAP and non-GAAP per share results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the effect of an additional 3.2 million shares of Common Stock and 1.3 million weighted average shares of Common Stock, respectively, from our follow-on equity offering in August 2016.\nFirst Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nOur guidance is provided utilizing ASC 605. We are in the process of finalizing our guidance under ASC 606, and we will present an updated guide under both ASC 606 and ASC 605 when we report results for the first quarter of 2018. We will adopt ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASC 606 could have an effect on the timing of both revenue recognition and the recognition of costs to obtain contracts including commissions.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, our revenue is expected to be in the range of $107.0 million to $109.0 million. Net loss is expected to be in the range of $(9.0) million to $(8.0) million, or $(0.26) to $(0.23) per basic share, which reflects additional implementation costs related to the adoption of ASC 606 and the amortization of intangible assets and integration costs related to the Velocify acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.4 million to $3.4 million, or $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share, which reflects the non-GAAP tax adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $13.6 million to $15.6 million. Per share guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 36 million.\nFor the full year 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $495.0 million to $505.0 million. Net income is expected to be in the range of $10.0 million to $14.0 million, or $0.28 to $0.38 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $61.0 million to $65.0 million, or $1.68 to $1.78 per diluted share, which reflects the non-GAAP tax adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $126.7 million to $132.0 million. Per share guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 37 million.\nAdditional information about the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their related GAAP financial measures, is set forth below under the section entitled, “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nQuarterly Conference Call\nEllie Mae (the “Company”) will discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results today, February 8, 2018, via teleconference at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. To access the call, please dial 877-723-9502 or 719-325-4835 at least five minutes prior to the 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time start time. A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://investor.elliemae.com . An audio replay of the call will be available through February 22, 2018 by dialing 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and entering access code 3311197.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEllie Mae provides investors with the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, and free cash flow in addition to the traditional GAAP operating performance measure of net income as part of its overall assessment of its performance. Adjusted net income consists of net income plus stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and the non-GAAP income tax adjustments. EBITDA consists of net income plus depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangible assets, and income tax provision, less other income, net. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted gross profit consists of gross profit plus stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets that are included in cost of revenues. Free cash flow consists of net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment and internal-use software. Ellie Mae uses adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross profit as measures of operating performance because they enable period to period comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in the age and depreciable lives of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital market conditions. The Company also believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross profit because the amount of non-cash expense associated with stock-based awards made at certain prices and points in time (a) do not necessarily reflect how the Company’s business is performing at any particular time and (b) can vary significantly between periods due to the timing of new stock-based awards. The non-GAAP income tax adjustments are calculated based on the annual non-GAAP effective tax rate, which quantifies the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments and reverses the one-time measurement of the tax impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the excess tax benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 for GAAP purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and have limitations as analytical tools. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, net income, operating income, gross profit, operating cash flow or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company cautions that other companies in Ellie Mae’s industry may calculate adjusted net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, and free cash flow differently than the Company does, further limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, gross profit to adjusted gross profit, and operating cash flow to free cash flow is included in the tables below.\nNote Regarding Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting Standard\nEllie Mae adopted an accounting standard issued in 2016 whereby excess tax benefit generated upon the settlement or exercise of stock awards are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital but are instead recognized as an income tax benefit. The adoption was effective January 1, 2017, and the Company recognized a benefit to GAAP net income of $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This also had the accounting effect of increasing net cash provided by operating activities by $10.2 million and $4.8 million and a corresponding $10.2 million and $4.8 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nDisclosure Information\nEllie Mae uses the investor relations section on its website as the means of complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, we recommend that investors should monitor Ellie Mae’s investor relations website in addition to following Ellie Mae’s press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.\nAbout Ellie Mae\nEllie Mae (NYSE:ELLI) is the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry.

(2) Acquisition-related costs include third-party transaction costs incurred for legal and other professional services in relation to our recent acquisition. These costs are non-recurring and are not related to the on-going operating results in the period. (3) For the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the non-GAAP effective tax rates are 38.3% and 32.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the non-GAAP effective tax rates are 35.1% and 35.3%, respectively. The non-GAAP income tax adjustments are calculated based on the annual non-GAAP effective tax rate, which quantifies the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments and reverses the one-time measurement of the tax impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the excess tax benefits from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 for GAAP purposes. (4) As a result of the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”) in the first quarter of 2017, the Company has retrospectively applied the standard to its condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in which the Company no longer classifies the excess tax benefits from employee stock plans as a reduction from operating cash flows.
