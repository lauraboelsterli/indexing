    "text": "GERMANTOWN, Maryland and HILDEN, Germany, January 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nQIAGEN N.V. (NYSE: QGEN) (Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) announced today it has entered into an agreement to acquire STAT-Dx, a privately-held company developing the next generation of multiplex diagnostics for one-step, fully integrated molecular analysis of common syndromes using a novel system based on real-time PCR technology and proven QIAGEN chemistries.\nThe system, to be branded as QIAstat-Dx subject to closing of the transaction that is planned for the second quarter of 2018, enables scalable Sample to Insight processing of up to 48 molecular targets simultaneously to diagnose syndromes such as serious respiratory or gastrointestinal(GI) infections, as well as for use in oncology. With cost-efficient, easy-to-use assays suitable for any clinical sample type, the system can provide qualitative as well as quantitative insights in about one hour into the precise cause of various syndromes. QIAGEN believes this proprietary system has the capabilities to help drive greater dissemination of molecular testing.\nBased on the proprietary DiagCOREÂ® technology, the system was unveiled in April 2017 at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology (ECCMID) and received a first CE-IVD marking in January 2018. The first two tests, which are extensive respiratory and gastrointestinal panels, are to be launched in Europe in the second half of 2018, in the U.S. in 2019 following regulatory clearance, and in other markets worldwide pursuant to the respective regulatory timelines. Additional tests are in development that span infectious diseases, immune response monitoring, oncology and companion diagnostics.\nPlease find the full press release here\nLink: https://corporate.qiagen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2018/20180131_stat_dx?sc_lang=en\nContacts :\nQIAGEN\nInvestor Relations\nJohn Gilardi, +49-2103-29-11711\ne-mail: ir@QIAGEN.com\nPublic Relations\nDr. Thomas Theuringer, +49-2103-29-11826\ne-mail: pr@QIAGEN.com\nSOURCE Qiagen N.V.",
