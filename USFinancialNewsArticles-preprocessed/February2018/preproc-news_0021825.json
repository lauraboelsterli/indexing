    "text": "BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TriMas (NASDAQ:TRS) today announced that the Company has added two new leaders to its organization. Jan van Dijk has joined TriMas as its vice president of tax and treasury and will be located at the Company’s global headquarters in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Additionally, Al Malizia has accepted the position of vice president of operations, and will directly oversee TriMas’ Arrow Engine business located in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n“We are excited about the addition of these two talented leaders, both with demonstrated track records of success, to TriMas,” said Thomas Amato, TriMas president and chief executive officer. “With more than 25 years of tax, treasury management, finance and transaction related experience, Jan will be a valuable addition to the leadership team. Al comes to TriMas with significant operational and management experience, including roles focused on business performance, manufacturing plant start-ups, Lean initiatives and operational turnarounds.”\nAs vice president of tax and treasury, Mr. van Dijk will be responsible for the Company’s global tax and treasury functions, including the implementation of tax structuring alternatives, tax-related compliance matters, global cash management and managing relationships with banks and other third party service providers. Prior to joining TriMas, Mr. van Dijk spent 17 years at Metaldyne Performance Group (and its predecessor company, Metaldyne), where he held various accounting, tax and finance positions, including division controller, corporate controller and most recently, vice president, tax and treasurer. He also worked previously for Corus Group in the Netherlands in various roles including treasury controller, and at Ernst & Young LLP as a senior accountant.\nAs vice president of operations, Mr. Malizia will be directly responsible for TriMas’ Arrow Engine business, while also leveraging key resources and facilitating the sharing of best practices with other TriMas businesses, all consistent with the TriMas Business Model. Most recently, he has worked with TriMas in a consultant capacity for the past year and has led the successful consolidation of two facilities. Mr. Malizia comes to TriMas with significant operational and management experience, as well as experience in sales, marketing, customer relationships and strategic international initiatives. Prior to joining TriMas, he was the principal of Arete America, LLC, consulting with companies to improve their performance. Earlier in his career, Mr. Malizia held numerous manufacturing and management roles at Metaldyne, TRW and Dura Automotive.\nIn connection with these new additions, the Company also announced that Terry Simons, vice president of tax and treasury, and Len Turner, president of Arrow Engine, have left the Company to pursue other interests. “We thank Terry and Len for their years of service at TriMas and wish them the best in their future endeavors,” said Mr. Amato.\nAbout TriMas\nTriMas is a diversified industrial manufacturer of products for customers in the consumer products, aerospace, industrial, petrochemical, refinery and oil & gas end markets with approximately 4,000 dedicated employees in 13 countries.
