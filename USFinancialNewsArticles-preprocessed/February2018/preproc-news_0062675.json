    "text": "Jared McCann scored with 1:14 left in overtime to lift the Florida Panthers to a 3-2 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs at BB&T Center on Tuesday.\nAleksander Barkov and Jonathan Huberdeau also had goals for the Panthers (29-25-6).\nDominic Moore and Zach Hyman scored for the Maple Leafs (39-20-7).\nFlorida goaltender Roberto Luongo stopped 37 shots in improving his record to 4-1-0 since his return from injury.\nToronto backup goalie Curtis McElhinney had 28.\nAaron Ekblad flipped a backhanded pass into the neutral zone in overtime, and McCann skated in and fired the game-winning goal over McElhinneyâ€™s blocker to give the Panthers their third straight win to open their six-game homestand.\nThe club finished February with a 9-3-0 record and is 10-3-0 in the last 13.\nThe two clubs met one week ago in Toronto as the Maple Leafs were victorious, 1-0, behind a goal from James van Riemsdyk and a shutout from Frederick Andersen.\nOn their second power play of the first period, Florida cashed in when Huberdeau slipped a pass from behind the Toronto goal to Barkov, who was standing near the post.\nThe All-Star center roofed his 21st goal over McElhinney at 11:02 for a 1-0 lead, giving him 16 points in his last 10 games.\nHuberdeau skated through the slot past Tomas Plekanec, held the puck patiently and guided a nifty shot in for his 19th goal and a 2-0 lead at 1:42 of the second.\nMoore capitalized on a Florida turnover at 2:53, putting Toronto on the board with his sixth goal off a loose puck that Luongo could not find.\nHyman tied it at 2 with his 12th marker off a fancy drop-pass at 12:34 by William Nylander, who leaned past Keith Yandle on his way through the slot to set up the goal.\nWith the game knotted at 2 through two spirited periods of play, neither team scored in the final period, but McElhinney stopped McCann on a late power play.\nLuongo also stopped Nazem Kadri in the last seconds, forcing overtime.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
