    "text": "Airbus on Thursday took a new 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion) hit on its A400M military transport plane, lifting charges on Europe's troubled defense project above 8 billion euros and clouding\nhigher-than-expected underlying profits.\nEurope's largest aerospace group posted adjusted 2017 operating profit of 4.253 billion euros on revenues of 66.767 billion euros and predicted a 20 percent rise in the widely watched core profit item.\nAnalysts were on average expecting adjusted 2017 operating profits of 3.996 billion euros and revenues of 67.343 billion, according to a poll conducted for Reuters.\nThe A400M charge comes after Airbus last week reached a provisional agreement with seven European NATO buyer nations over further delays in deliveries for the new troop carrier.\nAirbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a results statement that the deal would \"significantly reduce the remaining programme risks\".\nAirbus announced an 11 percent dividend hike. It also reaffirmed a target of around 800 jetliner deliveries for 2018, subject to the performance of its engine manufacturers.\nAirbus is in the midst of a switchover on its best-selling A320 family to an upgraded model with new engines but has been beset by delays in engine supplies mainly from Pratt & Whitney.\nThe impact of a new problem discovered with those engines a week ago is \"under assessment,\" Airbus said.\n\"The A320neo ramp-up remains challenging and requires that the engine suppliers deliver in line with commitments,\" it added.\nThe planemaker, which competes with Boeing , reported \"good progress\" on the production of the new A350 wide-body jet and reiterated plans to reach an output of 10 a month by end-year.\nAirbus also said it had reached an agreement with European credit agencies that will allow Airbus to apply for export credits on a case by case basis.\nThe funding was suspended in 2016 when Airbus was reported to have made misleading applications, triggering a corruption probe.\nHowever, Airbus took a 117 million euro fourth-quarter charge following a settlement with German prosecutors over a corruption case linked to a fighter sale to Austria, including some 35 million euros of ongoing legal costs.",
