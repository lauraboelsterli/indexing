    "text": "By Chris Morris 9:35 AM EST \nIt’s getting more and more crowded to fly in coach—but there’s a chance the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) could step in. \nThe FAA is set to announce the results of its review of seat sizes and leg room in the near future. That review could prevent airlines from further reducing the space available to passengers as carriers cram a few extra seats on board. \nThe review, which followed a judge’s order in July, is looking at the safety implications of tighter seats. Seat pitch, better known as leg room by most flyers, has dropped from an average of 35 inches to 31 inches , with some airlines only offering 28 inches. Seat widths have gone from 18 inches to 16.5 inches. \nThe issue has become contentious enough that legislators have introduced bills to stop airlines from further shrinking seat and leg room, but so far those have failed to make much headway. \nPassengers are backing up the complaints with their wallets. In 2016, airline profits were down over $11 billion . SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
