Krushelnitsky, who won bronze in Pyeongchang with his wife Bryzgalova in mixed doubles curling, tested positive for meldonium, a drug that aids endurance. He has denied taking banned substances. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Wednesday it would hear a case against Krushelnitsky on Thursday. Reporting by Maxim Rodionov; Editing by Toby Davis",
