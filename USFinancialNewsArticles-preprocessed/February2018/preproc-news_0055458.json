    "text": " 49 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Wales to meet Springboks in one-off test in Washington Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Wales will take on South Africa in a one-off test in Washington on June 2 marking the first contest between top-tier national teams to be held in the U.S. capital. Warren Gatland’s side will take on the Springboks at the RFK Stadium in what will be the first of three tests on their tour of the Americas. They next travel to Argentina for tests in San Juan on June 9 and Santa Fe on June 16. Promoters Rugby International Marketing, the commercial arm of USA Rugby, confirmed the clash on Monday and said that tickets would go on sale on March 13. “This summer is a vital period for us as we continue the countdown to the Rugby World Cup in 2019 and another fixture helps us along the way in our preparation and enables us to test ourselves further,” Gatland said. The test in Washington will be Wales’ fifth on U.S. soil, although all previous clashes there have been against the hosts. “The opportunity to expand the already great Welsh support base and Welsh brand is very exciting for us as especially in such a large demographic and audience as the U.S.,” said Welsh Rugby Union Group CEO Martyn Phillips. “The match in Washington allows us to take Springbok rugby to America and to potentially expand the team’s appeal to a very large audience,” South Africa Rugby CEO Jurie Roux said.
