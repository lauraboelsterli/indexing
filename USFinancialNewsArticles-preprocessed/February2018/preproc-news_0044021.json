    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - A car bomb exploded in the Kurdish-dominated city of Qamishli in northeastern Syria on Sunday, killing five people and injuring seven, Syrian state news agency (SANA) said, citing a source in the police headquarters of Hasakeh province.\nThe explosion targeted al-Hay al-Gharbi in the city, SANA reported.\nThe Kurdish YPG militia controls swathes of northeastern Syria including most of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located.\nIt was not immediately clear what the explosion targeted in the Qamishli, which is in the northern rural area of Hasakeh.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain based war monitor, said the last explosion to target the city was in September, when a motorcycle exploded near the financial administration, killing a child and injuring several other people.\nEditing by Edmund Blair\n ",
