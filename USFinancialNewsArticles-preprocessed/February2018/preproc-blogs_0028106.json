    "text": "UPDATE 1-Brazil's Lojas Renner misses profit estimates as costs jump Gram Slattery and Flavia Bohone Published 6:36 PM ET Thu, 8 Feb 2018 Reuters \n(Adds more results, EBITDA) \nBRASILIA, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Lojas Renner SA, Brazil's biggest apparel retailer, missed fourth-quarter profit estimates on Thursday, as a sharp increase in costs outpaced growing revenue amid an aggressive expansion drive. \nIn a statement, Renner said net income totaled 332 million reais ($101 million), up 10.7 percent from the same period a year earlier. Analysts projected profit of 377 million reais in the period, according to consensus estimates compiled by Reuters. \nSame-store sales, a measure of sales at stores open for at least 12 months, climbed 8.7 percent from the same period a year before in the fourth-quarter, below an estimate of 9.6 percent by analysts at BTG Pactual. \nOperational costs, meanwhile, shot up 22.8 percent, with a heavy increase in general and administrative costs putting pressure on margins. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 6.3 percent in the quarter to 603 million reais, below a Reuters estimate of 661 million reais. \nRenner, based in the southern city of Porto Alegre, has become an investor-darling as an effective transition from a traditional department store to a tech-savvy fast-fashion retailer - combined with a consumer-led rebound in Brazil - has boosted sales and profit. Shares in 2017 climbed over 70 percent. \nHowever, results have occasionally come in below analysts' lofty expectations. \n(Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Chris Reese and Diane Craft)",
