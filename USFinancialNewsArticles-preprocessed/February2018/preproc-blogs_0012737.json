    "text": "Lululemon Athletica CEO Laurent Potdevin is resigning from the retailer, effective immediately, the company announced Monday. \nLululemon said Potdevin \"fell short of ... standards of conduct\" to respect employees and show integrity. Meanwhile, the company's board of directors has started searching for a new global CEO. Potdevin will also be removed from his position on the board. \n\"While this was a difficult and considered decision, the Board thanks Laurent for his work in strengthening the company and positioning it for the future,\" Glenn Murphy, executive chairman of Lululemon's board, said in prepared remarks. \n\"Culture is at the core of lululemon, and it is the responsibility of leaders to set the right tone in ourorganization,\" he added. \"Protecting the organization's culture is one of the Board's most important duties.\" \nLululemon shares were falling more than 3 percent after market close Monday on the news. \nLululemon promoted three members of its management team — Celeste Burgoyne, Stuart Haselden and Sun Choe — to oversee more day-to-day operations, marketing, e-commerce growth, product innovation and supply chain enhancements. \n\"We believe this trio of leaders will take lululemon from strength to strength,\" Murphy said. \nWhile the underlying motive remains unclear, some see Potdevin's departure as a \"blow to Lululemon,\" especially in today's tumultuous retail environment. \n\"Although we see Executive Chairman Glenn Murphy as a capable pair of hands in the short term, Lululemon needs a CEO to guide it as it expands overseas and tries to make further gains in its home market,\" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said. \"It is crucial that the right person is selected, but it is equally appointment that the task is undertaken with urgency so that Lululemon doesn't lose momentum.\" \nPotdevin had recently been spearheading Vancouver-based Lululemon's growth in the men's category, as well as the company's rapid expansion into China. \nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",
