    "text": "DUBLIN, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq: JAZZ) today announced financial results for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2017 and provided financial guidance for 2018.\n\"2017 was a pivotal year for Jazz as we delivered record revenues while achieving two global regulatory approvals, launching an innovative new treatment for AML and advancing numerous early- and late-stage development programs,\" said Bruce Cozadd, chairman and chief executive officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. \"We enter 2018 energized by the strong U.S. launch of Vyxeos and the early enthusiasm we've seen from the prescriber community; prepared for executing on Xyrem growth opportunities; looking forward to continuing the progress we've made in our pre-clinical and clinical development programs; excited about advancing solriamfetol through the regulatory approval process; and financially nimble to aggressively pursue opportunities to further diversify our commercial and R&D portfolio.\"\nGAAP net income for 2017 was $487.8 million, or $7.96 per diluted share, compared to $396.8 million, or $6.41 per diluted share, for 2016. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $232.2 million, or $3.79 per diluted share, compared to $116.7 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net income for 2017 was $676.7 million, or $11.04 per diluted share, compared to $627.2 million, or $10.14 per diluted share, for 2016. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $180.5 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, compared to $165.6 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn the full year and fourth quarter 2017, the company recorded a net tax benefit on a GAAP basis of $148.8 million, or $2.43 per diluted share, resulting from provisional estimates based on the company's analysis of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Act). Given the significant complexity of the U.S. Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury, and the potential for additional guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the U.S. Tax Act, these provisional estimates may be adjusted during 2018. The net tax benefit resulting from the U.S. Tax Act has been excluded from adjusted net income and the related per share measures for the full year and fourth quarter 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts and percentages)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nTotal revenues\n$\n436,399\n$\n396,621\n10\n%\n$\n1,618,693\n$\n1,487,973\n9\n%\nGAAP net income\n$\n232,207\n$\n116,689\n99\n%\n$\n487,848\n$\n396,831\n23\n%\nAdjusted net income\n$\n180,493\n$\n165,637\n9\n%\n$\n676,718\n$\n627,162\n8\n%\nGAAP EPS\n$\n3.79\n$\n1.91\n98\n%\n$\n7.96\n$\n6.41\n24\n%\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n2.95\n$\n2.71\n9\n%\n$\n11.04\n$\n10.14\n9\n%\nTotal Revenues\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nXyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution\n$\n312,477\n$\n291,204\n$\n1,186,699\n$\n1,107,616\nErwinaze® / Erwinase® (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi)\n47,755\n56,771\n197,340\n200,678\nDefitelio® (defibrotide sodium) / defibrotide\n36,299\n29,672\n133,650\n108,952\nVyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection\n24,071\n—\n33,790\n—\nPrialt® (ziconotide) intrathecal infusion\n6,058\n6,055\n27,361\n29,120\nOther\n3,435\n8,912\n22,559\n30,895\nProduct sales, net\n430,095\n392,614\n1,601,399\n1,477,261\nRoyalties and contract revenues\n6,304\n4,007\n17,294\n10,712\nTotal revenues\n$\n436,399\n$\n396,621\n$\n1,618,693\n$\n1,487,973\nTotal revenues increased 9% in 2017 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 primarily due to an increase in net product sales of Xyrem and Defitelio and the launch of Vyxeos.\nXyrem net product sales increased 7% in both 2017 and in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016. Xyrem net product sales growth in 2017 was negatively impacted by payer mix throughout 2017 and operational changes that delayed some prescription fulfillment in the second half of 2017.\nErwinaze/Erwinase net product sales decreased 2% in 2017 and 16% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 net product sales were lower compared to fourth quarter 2016 due to higher ordering patterns in the fourth quarter 2016 resulting from the availability of product following an extended supply disruption in late 2016. Throughout 2017, the company experienced global supply challenges for Erwinaze. The company is currently experiencing temporary supply disruptions in the U.S. and other countries and expects that there may be further supply disruptions during 2018.\nDefitelio/defibrotide net product sales increased 23% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes and a full year of U.S. Defitelio sales after launch in April 2016. Net product sales increased 22% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in sales volume outside of the U.S. The company continues to expect inter-quarter variability in Defitelio net sales given that veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is an ultra-rare disease. The recognition, diagnosis and early treatment of VOD with multi-organ dysfunction in adult patients remains an educational priority.\nVyxeos net product sales were $33.8 million in 2017 and $24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Vyxeos launched in the U.S. in August 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nGAAP:\nCost of product sales\n$\n25,248\n$\n33,656\n$\n110,188\n$\n105,386\nGross margin\n94.1\n%\n91.4\n%\n93.1\n%\n92.9\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n143,050\n$\n127,141\n$\n544,156\n$\n502,892\n% of total revenues\n32.8\n%\n32.1\n%\n33.6\n%\n33.8\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n65,995\n$\n44,158\n$\n198,442\n$\n162,297\n% of total revenues\n15.1\n%\n11.1\n%\n12.3\n%\n10.9\n%\nAcquired in-process research and development\n$\n8,000\n$\n—\n$\n85,000\n$\n23,750\nNon-GAAP adjusted:\nCost of product sales\n$\n23,782\n$\n32,177\n$\n104,376\n$\n100,797\nGross margin\n94.5\n%\n91.8\n%\n93.5\n%\n93.2\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n121,414\n$\n108,204\n$\n454,938\n$\n404,837\n% of total revenues\n27.8\n%\n27.3\n%\n28.1\n%\n27.2\n%\nResearch and development\n$\n43,276\n$\n39,619\n$\n162,072\n$\n146,466\n% of total revenues\n9.9\n%\n10.0\n%\n10.0\n%\n9.8\n%\nOperating expenses changed over the prior year periods primarily due to the following:\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased in 2017 and in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis due to higher headcount and other expenses resulting from the expansion of the company's business and the launch of Vyxeos in the U.S., partially offset by a contract termination fee of $11.6 million paid in 2016 to eliminate a potential future royalty obligation related to Vyxeos. SG&A expenses in 2016 on a GAAP basis included transaction and integration costs of $13.1 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased in 2017 and in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. R&D expenses in 2017 reflected an increase in expenses related to the company's ongoing pre-clinical and clinical development programs and regulatory activities, including an increase in headcount, partially offset by a decrease in costs following the completion of three solriamfetol Phase 3 studies in 2017. R&D expenses in 2017 and in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a GAAP basis included $18.5 million of payments related to an amended license and option agreement with Pfenex Inc. Acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2017 included an upfront payment of $75.0 million to ImmunoGen, Inc. related to entry into a collaboration and option agreement.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and investments were $601.0 million, and the outstanding principal balance of the company's long-term debt was $1.8 billion. In 2017, the company issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.50% exchangeable senior notes due 2024, repaid a total of $850.0 million of borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, made upfront and milestone payments totaling $104.5 million and used $98.8 million to repurchase approximately 704,000 ordinary shares under the company's share repurchase program at an average cost of $140.34 per ordinary share.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2018, the company enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of defibrotide for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease in adult and pediatric patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.\nIn February 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) added Vyxeos to the Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NCCN Guidelines now include a Category 1 recommendation for use of Vyxeos for adult patients 60 years of age or greater with newly-diagnosed therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. The Category 1 recommendation indicates that, based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that Vyxeos is appropriate for these patients.\nIn December 2017, the company submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking marketing approval for solriamfetol, an investigational medicine for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nJazz Pharmaceuticals' full year 2018 financial guidance is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):\nRevenues\n$1,860-$1,930\nTotal net product sales\n$1,845-$1,910\n-Xyrem net sales\n$1,310-$1,340\n-Erwinaze/Erwinase net sales\n$190-$220\n-Defitelio/defibrotide net sales\n$145-$165\n-Vyxeos net sales\n$130-$155\nGAAP gross margin %\n93%\nNon-GAAP adjusted gross margin % 1,5\n93%\nGAAP SG&A expenses\n$608-$648\nNon-GAAP adjusted SG&A expenses 2,5\n$525-$555\nGAAP R&D expenses\n$232-$263\nNon-GAAP adjusted R&D expenses 3,5\n$205-$225\nGAAP effective tax rate\n18%-21%\nNon-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate 4,5\n17%-19%\nGAAP net income per diluted share\n$7.15-$8.45\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share 5\n$12.65-$13.25\n1.\nExcludes $5-$9 million of share-based compensation expense from estimated GAAP gross margin.\n2.\nExcludes $83-$93 million of share-based compensation expense from estimated GAAP SG&A expenses.\n3.\nExcludes $17-$23 million of share-based compensation expense and $10-$15 million of milestone payments from estimated GAAP R&D expenses.\n4.\nExcludes the income tax effect of adjustments between GAAP reported and non-GAAP adjusted net income.\n5.\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.

The company has a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates with a focus in the areas of sleep and hematology/oncology. In these areas, Jazz Pharmaceuticals markets Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution, Erwinaze® (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi), Defitelio® (defibrotide sodium) and Vyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection in the U.S. and markets Erwinase® and Defitelio® (defibrotide) in countries outside the U.S. For country-specific product information, please visit www.jazzpharmaceuticals.com/products . For more information, please visit www.jazzpharmaceuticals.com and follow us on Twitter at @JazzPharma .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Jazz Pharmaceuticals' financial results and guidance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company uses certain non-GAAP (also referred to as adjusted or non-GAAP adjusted) financial measures in this press release and the accompanying tables. In particular, the company presents non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure) and its line item components, as well as certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures derived therefrom, including non-GAAP adjusted gross margin percentage, non-GAAP adjusted income tax provision and non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure) and its line item components exclude from reported GAAP net income (and the related per share measure) and its line item components certain items, as detailed in the reconciliation tables that follow, and in the case of non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure), adjust for the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and, for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017, the U.S. Tax Act benefit. In this regard, the components of non-GAAP adjusted net income, including non-GAAP cost of product sales, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and non-GAAP research and development expenses, are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall non-GAAP adjusted net income measure.\nThe company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors and analysts. In particular, the company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors' and analysts' ability to meaningfully compare the company's results from period to period and to its forward-looking guidance, and to identify operating trends in the company's business. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are regularly used by investors and analysts to model and track the company's financial performance. Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management also regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the company's business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part on certain of these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures are important internal measurements for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management, the company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts since these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the company uses in assessing its own operating performance and making operating decisions.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the company's condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the company has ceased, and may in the future cease, to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in this press release and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis press release contains , including, but not limited to, statements related to Jazz Pharmaceuticals' future financial and operating results, including 2018 financial guidance and the potential for 2018 adjustments to the company's provisional tax estimates, the company's expectations regarding its ability to execute on Xyrem growth opportunities, continuing progress in the company's pre-clinical and clinical development programs, advancing solriamfetol through the regulatory approval process, the potential for future opportunities to diversify the company's commercial and research and development portfolio and the company's ability to execute on those opportunities, the company's expectations for future Erwinaze supply disruptions and inter-quarter variability in Defitelio net sales, and other statements that are not historical facts. These are based on the company's current plans, objectives, estimates, expectations and intentions and inherently involve significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such as a result of these risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with: maintaining or increasing sales of and revenue from Xyrem, such as the potential U.S. introduction of a generic version of Xyrem before the entry dates specified in the company's settlements with certain companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Xyrem or on terms that are different from those contemplated by the settlements; ongoing patent litigation and related proceedings; effectively commercializing the company's other products and product candidates; the time-consuming and uncertain regulatory approval process, including the risk that the company's regulatory submissions, including the solriamfetol NDA and the marketing authorization application for Vyxeos in the European Union, may not be approved by applicable regulatory authorities in a timely manner or at all; protecting and enhancing the company's intellectual property rights; delays or problems in the supply or manufacture of the company's products and product candidates; complying with applicable U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory requirements; government investigations and other actions; obtaining and maintaining appropriate pricing and reimbursement for the company's products; pharmaceutical product development and the uncertainty of clinical success, including risks related to failure or delays in initiating or completing clinical trials; identifying and acquiring, in-licensing or developing additional products or product candidates, financing these transactions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; potential restrictions on the company's ability and flexibility to pursue share repurchases and future strategic opportunities as a result of its substantial outstanding debt obligations; the ability to achieve expected future financial performance and results and the uncertainty of future tax and other provisions and estimates; and other risks and uncertainties affecting the company, including those described from time to time under the caption \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports (Commission File No. 001-33500), including the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and future filings and reports by the company, including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Other risks and uncertainties of which the company is not currently aware may also affect the company's and may cause actual results and timing of events to differ materially from those anticipated. The herein are made only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the , even if they are subsequently made available by the company on its website or otherwise. The company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement any to reflect actual results, new information, future events, changes in its expectations or other circumstances that exist after the date as of which the were made.\nJAZZ PHARMACEUTICALS PLC\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear
