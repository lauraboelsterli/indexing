The Company’s method of calculating TCE is consistent with industry standards and is determined by dividing voyage revenues (net of voyage expenses) by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage and are paid by the charterer under a time charter contract, as well as commissions. TCE revenues, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with revenues from the Company’s vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, because it assists the Company’s management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. TCE is also a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Please see below for a reconciliation of TCE rates to voyage revenues.\n(6) Daily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days net of laid-up days for the relevant time period.\nDrybulk, Tanker and Gas Carrier Segments Summary Operating Data (unaudited) - continued\n(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for TCE rate, which is expressed in Dollars, and voyage days)\nDrybulk Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Voyage revenues $ 8,745 $ 25,808 $ 30,777 $ 65,724 Voyage expenses (2,098 ) (3,536 ) (7,349 ) (9,900 ) Time charter equivalent revenues $ 6,647 $ 22,272 $ 23,428 $ 55,824 Total voyage days for fleet 1,221 1,952 6,404 6,534 Time charter equivalent (TCE) $ 5,444 $ 11,410 $ 3,658 $ 8,544\nTanker Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Voyage revenues $ - $ 9,786 $ - $ 20,858 Voyage expenses - (3,529 ) - (8,818 ) Time charter equivalent revenues $ - $ 6,257 $ - $ 12,040 Total voyage days for fleet - 368 - 911 Time charter equivalent (TCE) $ - $ 17,003 $ - $ 13,216\nGas Carrier Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Voyage revenues $ - $ 7,000 $ - $ 10,316 Voyage expenses - (238 ) - (378 ) Time charter equivalent revenues $ - $ 6,762 $ - $ 9,938 Total voyage days for fleet - 241 - 355 Time charter equivalent (TCE) $ - $ 28,058 $ - $ 27,994\nDryShips Inc.\nFinancial Statements\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(Expressed in Thousands of U.S. Dollars\nexcept for share and per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 REVENUES: Voyage revenues $ 12,844 $ 42,593 $ 51,934 $ 100,716 12,844 42,593 51,934 100,716 EXPENSES: Voyage expenses 2,461 7,308 9,209 19,704 Vessel operating expenses 9,009 18,973 45,563 59,348 Depreciation 871 6,334 3,466 14,966 Vessels impairment, (gain)/loss on sales and other 64,507 (4,425 ) 106,343 (4,125 ) Goodwill impairment charge 7,002 - 7,002 - General and administrative expenses 14,333 7,334 39,708 30,972 Other, net 1,014 219 (258 ) 900 Operating income/(loss) (86,353 ) 6,850 (159,099 ) (21,049 ) OTHER INCOME / (EXPENSES): Interest and finance costs, net of interest income (1,713 ) (5,029 ) (8,776 ) (13,342 ) Gain on debt restructuring 10,465 - 10,477 - Loss on private placement - - - (7,600 ) Other, net 85 (32 ) 166 (553 ) Total other expenses, net 8,837 (5,061 ) 1,867 (21,495 ) Net income/(loss) (77,516 ) 1,789 (157,232 ) (42,544 ) Earnings/(losses) on affiliate - 9,666 (41,454 ) 9,666 Net income/(loss) attributable to DryShips Inc. $ (77,516 ) $ 11,455 $ (198,686 ) $ (32,878 ) Net income/(loss) attributable to DryShips Inc. common stockholders (84,607 ) 11,455 (206,381 ) (30,073 ) Earnings/(Losses) per common share, basic and diluted $ (53,078.42 ) $ 0.11 $ (455,587.20 ) $ (0.85 ) Weighted average number of shares, basic and diluted (1) 1,594 103,088,937 453 35,225,784 (1) Share and per share data for 2016 give effect to a cumulative 1-for-980 reverse stock split between April 11, 2017 and July 21, 2017.\nDryShips Inc.\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Expressed in Thousands of U.S. Dollars) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Cash, cash equivalents, including restricted cash (current and non-current) $ 76,774 $ 30,226 Other current and non-current assets 21,406 133,379 Advances for vessels under construction - 31,898 Vessels, net 95,550 749,088 Total assets 193,730 944,591 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Total debt 133,428 216,969 Total other liabilities 10,528 10,920 Total stockholders’ equity 49,774 716,702 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 193,730 $ 944,591 Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, vessel and investment impairments and certain other non-cash items as described below and gains or losses on interest rate swaps.
