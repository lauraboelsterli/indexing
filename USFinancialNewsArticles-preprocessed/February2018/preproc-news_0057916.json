    "text": "COVENTRY, England, Feb 26 (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Monday that Britain must be able to influence the European Union’s trade deals if the country signs up to a new customs union with the bloc after Brexit.\nAnswering questions after giving a speech setting out Labour’s stance on Brexit, Corbyn also said Britain needed a customs union deal with the EU to ensure there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
