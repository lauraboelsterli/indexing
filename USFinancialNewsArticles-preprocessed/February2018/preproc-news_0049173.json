    "text": "Published 10 Hours Ago Updated 8 Hours Ago The special counsel's investigation has already delivered more than a dozen indictments and collected several guilty pleas. Robert Mueller's plans have dogged the Trump administration and surprised reporters since the special counsel was appointed in May 2017. Getty Images Robert Mueller \nIt's too soon to know where or how the special counsel's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election will end. \nBut far from being a \" witch hunt ,\" former FBI Director Robert Mueller 's investigation has already delivered well over a dozen indictments and collected several guilty pleas. \nThe special counsel's investigation has dogged the Trump administration and surprised reporters since it began in May 2017 — from the sudden guilty plea in October of relative unknown George Papadopoulos to the surprise indictment of 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities in February. \nBelow is an up-to-date list of all charges filed by the special counsel's office: George Papadopoulos George Papadopoulos sitting in on a policy meeting with President Trump. \nCharged Oct. 3, 2017 Pleaded guilty Oct. 5, 2017 \nPapadopoulos, a foreign policy aide to Donald Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign, was the first person to plead guilty to charges from the special counsel's office. \nThe young advisor, just 30 years old at the time he pleaded guilty, reportedly sparked the Russia investigation in the first place, according to a report from The New York Times . \nHe allegedly told an Australian diplomat during the campaign that Russians had damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the Times reported.The Australian was so alarmed that he passed the information to American officials. \nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty to one count of lying to FBI agents about \"the timing, extent, and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials.\" Paul Manafort Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Paul Manafort \nCharged Oct. 27, 2017 Pleaded not guilty Oct. 30, 2017 \nManafort is a lobbyist deeply connected to the governments of Russia and Ukraine and who also served as Trump's campaign chief for a time. \nHe was charged with numerous counts, including conspiracy against the United States, money laundering, lying to investigators and failing to register as a foreign agent. The special counsel alleges, among other charges, that Manafort and his associate, Rick Gates, laundered millions of dollars they received from a Ukrainian political party bolstered by Russia. Rick Gates Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty Images Former Trump campaign official Rick Gates leaves Federal Court on December 11, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nCharged Oct. 27, 2017 Pleaded not guilty Oct. 30, 2017 \nGates was a lobbyist, a Trump campaign official and a longtime associate of Manafort's. \nHis charges, announced on the same day as those against Manafort and Papadopoulos, included counts of conspiracy against the United States, money laundering, lying to investigators and failing to register as a foreign agent, among others. \nGates pleaded not guilty to the charges and is a defendant as part of the same case as Manafort. In recent weeks, his lawyers have made a motion to withdraw as his counsel, prompting him to write statements to the court as his own defense in at least one instance. \nGates may be close to a guilty plea for charges relating to fraud and may be willing to testify against Manafort, multiple outlets have reported. Michael Flynn Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty Images Gen. Michael Flynn, former national security adviser to US President Donald Trump, leaves Federal Court on December 1, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nCharged Nov. 30, 2017 Pleaded guilty Dec. 1, 2017 \nCampaign surrogate and former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn was expelled from the White House, allegedly for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \nFlynn, after being interviewed by the special counsel, was charged with one count of lying to federal investigators — also for making misleading statements about his connection to Kislyak. \nFlynn said that he will cooperate with Mueller's team. He adamantly denied \"false accusations of 'treason' and other outrageous acts,\" and said his guilty plea reflects \"a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country.\" 13 Russian individuals Yevgeny Prigozhin \nCharged Feb. 16, 2018 \nIn a surprising turn of events, a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities Feb. 16 for their attempts to sow discord in American democratic elections through \"information warfare.\" \nSpecifically, Mueller's office alleges that Russian entities, primarily the so-called Internet Research Agency, used social media, stolen online payment accounts and more, in part for the purposes of \"supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump ('Trump Campaign') and disparaging Hillary Clinton.\" \nEleven of the individuals were charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. The remaining two individuals were also charged with counts of aggravated identity theft, and one of those two was further charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. Richard Pinedo \nCharged Feb. 2, 2018 Pleaded guilty Feb. 2, 2018 \nPinedo, a 28-year-old California man, was charged with one count of identity fraud for his alleged role in selling bank account numbers to Russians that would help them circumvent online payment companies' security measures. \nPinedo pleaded guilty on Feb. 2, although his indictment was not announced until Feb. 16. Alex van der Zwaan Alex van der Zwaan arrives at Federal District Court in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018. \nCharged Feb. 16, 2018 Pleaded guilty Feb. 20, 2018 \nVan der Zwaan pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to federal authorities investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. \nThe 33-year-old Dutch national is the son-in-law of a Russian oligarch and is a former associate at top law firm Skadden, Arps. \nVan der Zwaan admitted making false or misleading statements regarding email communications with Rick Gates.",
