    "text": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Monday called for a long-term budget deal, as federal lawmakers face a deadline this week to pass legislation to continue funding government.\n“We would like to see ... a two-year agreement on budget caps that gives certainty to our federal agencies, to our military,” White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters during a briefing. Government funding expires on Thursday.\n“Moving from stop-gap measure to stop-gap measure is no way to govern,” he said.\nReporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
