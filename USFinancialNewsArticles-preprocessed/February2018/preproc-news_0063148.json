EBITDA consists of net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt and acquisition and integration related costs. A reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures is presented below to net loss, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance and are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not comparable across reporting periods or that do not otherwise relate to the Company’s ongoing operating results\nOur use of the term EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitation as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\ndoes not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt; and eliminates the impact of income taxes on our results of operations; and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and both measures do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements; and does not reflect the significant non-recurring charge associated with the amortization of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt; and does not reflect the significant acquisition and integration related costs related to mergers and acquisitions; and does not reflect the significant non-cash stock compensation expense which should be viewed as a component of recurring operating costs; and other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures.\nWe compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include gross profit, net loss, net loss per share and other performance measures.\nIn evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses like those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nReconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss\n(In thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (44,383 ) $ (14,261 ) $ (106,782 ) $ (74,216 ) Add: Interest expense, net 7,813 881 17,491 2,588 Income tax (benefit) provision (654 ) 150 (225 ) 510 Depreciation expense 1,305 634 3,771 2,176 Amortization expense 6,097 1,963 15,324 6,094 EBITDA (29,822 ) (10,633 ) (70,421 ) (62,848 ) Stock-based compensation 16,969 2,636 30,597 7,723 Amortization of warrants and loss on extinguishment of debt 12,665 — 14,122 8,454 Acquisition and integration related costs 2,557 — 13,196 6,959 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,369 $ (7,997 ) $ (12,506 ) $ (39,712 ) Media:\nCourtney McLeod\n914-265-6789\ncmcleod@teladoc.com\nInvestors:\nWestwicke Partners\nJordan E.
