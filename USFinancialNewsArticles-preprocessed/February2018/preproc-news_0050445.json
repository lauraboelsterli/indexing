    "text": "3 COMMENTS The automation revolution is coming into fashion.\nThe clothing industry was among the first to be mechanized. Electric sewing machines have been in use for well over a hundred years. But they require skilled human hands to guide the materials.\nNow robotic and computer-enhanced machine technologies are beginning to come into use — reducing the number of workers needed for mass production of clothing.\nThe Journal witnessed one such example in a garment factory in Bangladesh. There, a German-made machine -- which looks like a large printer -- knits sweaters for brands such as H&M and Zara. \nWatch more Moving Upstream videos here Elsewhere, we observed how a new generation of Japanese-made machines from the Yuho Sewing Machine Co. is automating even more complex and time-consuming sewing tasks. \nSoftwear Automation, an Atlanta-based firm that develops automated tools for apparel factories, says that its “sewbots” will be used next year in a Little Rock, Ark., factory operated by Chinese garment producer Tinyuan Garments Co.\nAutomation could help bring some apparel production back to places with more-expensive labor, including the U.S.\nThis episode of Moving Upstream is the third in a series that looks at the “ Robotics Revolution .”",
