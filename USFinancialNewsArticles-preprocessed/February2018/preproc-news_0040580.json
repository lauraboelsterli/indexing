    "text": "NATICK, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ: CGNX) today announced financial results for the fourth-quarter and full-year of 2017. Table 1 below shows selected financial data for Q4-17 compared with Q4-16 and Q3-17, and the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. All periods presented reflect the two-for-one stock split paid in Q4-17.\nIn Q4-17, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in a one-time charge to tax expense of $83 million, or $0.46 per share. This amount includes the estimated U.S. tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, the revaluation of deferred tax positions to the new lower U.S. tax rate, and the recharacterization of certain income under the law. Excluding the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform and other discrete tax items, Cognex set new fourth quarter records for revenue, net income and earnings per share, all from continuing operations.\nTable 1\nRevenue\nIncome/(loss)\nfrom\nContinuing\nOperations\nIncome/(loss)\nper share from\nContinuing\nOperations\nNon-GAAP\nIncome/(loss)\nper share from\nContinuing\nOperations*\nQuarterly Comparisons\nCurrent quarter: Q4-17 $180,365,000 ($26,897,000) ($0.16) $0.25 Prior year’s quarter: Q4-16 $129,322,000 $38,253,000 $0.22 $0.20 Change: Q4-16 to Q4-17 39% (170%) (173%) 25% Prior quarter: Q3-17 $259,739,000 $102,348,000 $0.57 $0.51 Change: Q3-17 to Q4-17 (31%) (126%) (128%) (51%) Annual Comparisons\nYear ended 12/31/2017 $747,950,000 $177,178,000 $0.99 $1.22 Year ended 12/31/2016 $520,753,000 $149,827,000 $0.86 $0.79 Change: 2016 to 2017 44% 18% 15% 54% *Excludes tax adjustments. A reconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP is shown in Exhibit 2 of this news release.\n“What a fantastic year for Cognex!” exclaimed Dr. Robert J. Shillman , Founder and Chairman of Cognex. “We set new records for annual revenue, net income and earnings per share, all from continuing operations. Our commitment to our long-term strategy continues to deliver impressive results.”\n“Our 2017 achievements reflect the hard work of Cognoids around the world and the entrepreneurial spirit that is an integral part of our corporate culture,” said Robert J. Willett , Chief Executive Officer of Cognex. “We celebrate our success while staying focused on the long term. We believe the markets for our products continue to have significant growth potential as manufacturers look to automate a broadening range of industrial tasks.”\nMr. Willett continued, “Market dynamics were strong in 2017 and that has continued into the first quarter of 2018. Even though Q1 will likely be the lowest revenue quarter of the year, we will invest in new product development, expand our sales force and develop our IT and other infrastructure so that we are ready for the growth we expect in the years to come.”\nSummary of the Year\nFor 2017, Cognex reported record financial results from continuing operations, even with the impact of U.S. tax reform. Each of the three largest industries contributing to revenue—consumer electronics, automotive and logistics—showed double-digit growth, as did all the company’s major geographic regions. Operating income expanded to 35% of revenue from 31% for 2016, even as the company invested for future growth.\nDetails of the Quarter\nStatement of Operations Highlights – Fourth Quarter of 2017\nCognex reported record fourth quarter revenue in 2017. Revenue increased 39% from Q4-16 and declined 31% from Q3-17. Year-on-year growth came from a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, logistics and automotive. The sequential decrease was due to the Q3-17 timing of large orders from the consumer electronics industry. Outside that industry, revenue increased by more than 10% on a sequential basis. Gross margin was 77% for Q4-17 compared with 76% for Q3-17 and 79% for Q4-16. Gross margin decreased year-on-year due primarily to higher service revenue in Q4-17. The increase on a sequential basis is due to a higher margin on product sales than in Q3-17. Research, Development & Engineering (RD&E) expenses increased 39% from Q4-16 and 3% from Q3-17. RD&E increased both year-on-year and sequentially due to additional engineering resources and product development costs. Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 41% from Q4-16 and decreased 1% from Q3-17. SG&A increased year-on-year due to investments in sales resources and higher employee-related costs, including commissions and travel. The sequential decrease was a result of the timing of marketing initiatives. Cognex reported foreign currency losses of $1,027,000 in Q4-17 and $127,000 in Q3-17, and a foreign currency gain of $478,000 in Q4-16. The foreign currency loss in Q4-17 resulted primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable balances reported in one currency and collected in another. Investment and other income was $2,923,000 in Q4-17, $2,476,000 in Q4-16 and $2,030,000 in Q3-17. Investment income increased both year-on-year and sequentially because of higher yields and a higher average invested balance. Also contributing to the increase on a sequential basis was an expense in Q3-17 associated with changes to the fair value of contingent consideration related to recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate was 150% in Q4-17, 11% in Q4-16 and 9% in Q3-17. Prior to the new U.S. tax law in December 2017, the tax rate was 18% in all periods presented, excluding tax adjustments (which are summarized in Exhibit 2). Notably, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in a tax adjustment in Q4-17 of $83 million. This amount includes estimated U.S. tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, the revaluation of net deferred tax assets to the new lower U.S. tax rate, and the recharacterization of certain income under the law. The impact of U.S. tax reform may differ from this estimated tax adjustment, and the estimated charges may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018.\nBalance Sheet Highlights – December 31, 2017\nCognex’s financial position as of December 31, 2017, continued to be very strong, with $828 million in cash and investments and no debt. Cash and investments increased by $83 million from the end of 2016, mainly as the result of $224 million in cash generated from operations and $55 million in cash received from the exercise of employee stock options. Cash outflows included $124 million spent to repurchase Cognex common stock, $29 million in dividends paid to shareholders, $29 million for capital expenditures, and $26 million for acquisitions. Cognex intends to continue to repurchase shares of its common stock in Q1-18, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors. Accounts receivable increased by $64 million, or 115%, from the end of 2016 due to the company’s substantial revenue growth in 2017 and the timing of invoicing for a material customer. Inventories increased by $41 million, or 152%, from the end of 2016 to support the company’s higher business level and to build safety stock. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $39 million, or 75%, from the end of 2016 due to higher accruals for company bonus and sales commissions, both resulting from the company’s strong performance in 2017, and from increased headcount. The bonus and sales commissions will be paid in Q1-18. Income taxes payable increased substantially from the end of 2016 primarily due to the one-time charge recorded in Q4-17 for estimated U.S. tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. Cognex expects to pay that liability over the 8-year period allowed by the Tax Act.\nFinancial Outlook – Q1 2018\nThis financial outlook assumes the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”) that became effective on January 1, 2018. Cognex does not believe this standard will have a material impact on total revenue. For a historical perspective, Exhibit 5 of this news release includes the company’s quarterly Statement of Operations for 2017 adjusted for the impact of the new standard.\nRevenue for Q1-18 is expected to be between $165 million and $175 million, which represents growth between 19% and 26% year-on-year. On a sequential basis, Cognex expects the typical seasonal decline from Q4 to Q1 in factory automation. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid-70% range, which is within Cognex’s target range for gross margin under the new revenue recognition standard. Operating expenses are expected to increase by mid-single digits on a sequential basis due primarily to the company’s investments in engineering and sales. The effective tax rate is expected to be 14% before discrete tax items, reflecting the new U.S. corporate tax rate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nExhibit 2 of this news release includes a reconciliation of certain financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP. Cognex believes these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful because they allow investors to more accurately compare Cognex results over multiple periods using the same methodology that management employs in its budgeting process and in its review of Cognex’s operating results. Non-GAAP presentations exclude the following: (1) stock option expense for calculating non-GAAP adjusted operating income and net income from continuing operations (because these expenses have no current effect on cash or the future uses of cash, and they fluctuate because of changes in Cognex’s stock price), and (2) certain one-time discrete events, such as tax adjustments (because these costs are outside of Cognex’s normal business operations). Cognex does not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. The tax effect of items identified in the reconciliation is estimated by applying the effective tax rate to the pre-tax amount. However, if a specific tax rate or tax treatment is required because of the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction where the item was recorded, the tax effect is estimated by applying the relevant specific tax rate or tax treatment, rather than the effective tax rate.\nAnalyst Conference Call and Simultaneous Webcast\nCognex will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).
