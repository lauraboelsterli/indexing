    "text": "Continues to take a substantial approach to further enhancing investment in projects in both domestic and international markets\nBANGKOK, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (PTTGC), Thailand's largest integrated petrochemical and refining business, today announced it earned a net profit of 39,298 million baht in 2017, the highest ever for the company since it was established. PTTGC's higher profit is due to several factors including an increase in sales, more efficient production, higher product margins, and benefits resulting from the company's Project Max. PTTGC continues to move ahead with its investment plans for mega projects in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and a petrochemical complex in the United States, as well as market expansion for plastics in the high-potential CLMV markets, particularly Myanmar and Vietnam.\nOutstanding operating results in 2017\nMr. Supattanapong Punmeechaow, President and CEO of PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (PTTGC), announced the company's dramatically-increased operating results for 2017. PTTGC's sales revenue for 2017 reached 436,745 million baht, a 24% increase compared to 2016; with an adjusted EBITDA of 60,622 million baht for 2017, a 35% increase compared to 2016, and a net profit of 39,298 million baht for 2017 (earnings per share of 8.79 baht), up 53% compared to the previous year.\nFor the company's turnover in Q4/2017, operating profit increased due to greater production and higher product prices, in line with the rise in oil prices. PTTGC's olefins business and derivative products generated the company's Q4/2017 net profit of 9,559 million baht (earnings per share of 2.02 baht).\nIn 2017, the company realized an operating profit of 2,919 million baht from Project Max, a wide-ranging initiative to improve organizational efficiency that began at the end of 2016. PTTGC also gained profits of 3,360 million baht from its investments in associated companies and joint ventures. Much of this was due to the transfer of shares for six companies in industry sectors including petrochemicals, propylene, biochemicals, and related services from PTT PLC.\nKey milestones in 2017\nFor the petroleum market in 2017, the price of crude oil increased by 29% to USD53.18 per barrel. This increase was the result of greater cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC producers to more tightly control production capacity. The price of crude oil is expected to be at around USD 55 per barrel in 2018. Utilization rate for PTTGC's refineries increased 103% in 2017, compared to an increase of 19% in 2016. Utilization rate for PTTGC's aromatics business increased 80% in 2017. Utilization rate for PTTGC'solefins and derivatives; Olefins increased 96% and Polyethylene increased 113% in 2017. The price of ethylene increased 5% to USD 1,091 per ton during 2017, while the price of polyethylene increased 4% to USD 1,207 per ton last year.\nPTTGC's achievements in 2017 and business direction for 2018\n1) Project Max: The savings generated by this initiative to increase company-wide operating efficiency, which started in late 2016, contributed 2,919 million baht to PTTGC's operating profits.\n2) Update on investments\n2.1) EEC: Investments in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC)\nOlefins Reconfiguration Project (ORP)\nPTTGC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Samsung Engineering Co., Ltd.

The investment is expected to total around 30,000 to 35,000 million baht.\n2.5) Sales and Marketing Restructuring\nCustomer Solution Center (CSC): PTTGC aims to implement strategic plans in closer collaboration with its customers in the plastics industry by establishing the Customer Solution Center (CSC), to more closely support customer requirements.
