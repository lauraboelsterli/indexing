The panel is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hicks did answer a question about whether she had ever lied for her boss, saying she had told \"white lies\" for Trump on occasion. Hicks told the panel she had not lied about anything substantive. Published 3 Hours Ago The Associated Press Getty Images White House Communications Director and presidential advisor Hope Hicks waves to reporters as she arrives at the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center February 27, 2018 in Washington, DC. \nPresident Donald Trump's longtime aide Hope Hicks declined to answer questions about her time in the White House during a nine-hour, closed-door interview with the House intelligence committee, saying she was advised not to. \nThe panel is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia . As one of Trump's closest aides, Hicks is a key eyewitness to his actions over the past several years. She was his spokeswoman during the 2016 presidential campaign and is now White House communications director. \nThe top Democrat on the intelligence panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff , said after the meeting was over that Hicks answered questions about her role in Trump's campaign and answered some questions about the transition period between the election and the inauguration. But she would not answer any questions about events since Trump took the oath of office, similar to some other White House officials who have spoken to the committee. Schiff said Hicks did not assert any type of executive privilege, but just said she had been advised not to answer. \nHicks did answer a question about whether she had ever lied for her boss, saying she had told \"white lies\" for Trump on occasion, according to a person familiar with the testimony. The person, who declined to be named because the committee's interviews are not public, said Hicks told the panel she had not lied about anything substantive. \nRepublican Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida, a member of the intelligence panel who was in the interview, said Hicks' answer was completely unrelated to the Russia investigation. \n\"When specifically asked whether or not she was instructed to lie by the president, or the candidate, with regard to Russia, the investigation or our investigation, the answer to that question was no,\" Rooney said. \"And that's our jurisdiction. Not whether or not he asked her to cancel a meeting for him, or something like that.\" \nWhile the investigation is focused on Russian interference during the campaign, House investigators also had questions about her time in the White House, including her role in drafting a statement responding to news reports about a 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians. That statement has been of particular interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating matters related to the Russian meddling and potential obstruction of an ongoing federal inquiry. \nThe White House has said the president was involved in drafting the statement after news of the meeting broke last summer. The statement said the meeting primarily concerned a Russian adoption program, though emails released later showed that Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , enthusiastically agreed to the sit-down with a Russian lawyer and others after he was promised dirt on Trump's presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton . Hicks was with the president on Air Force One while they were writing the initial statement. \n\"All of our questions about what went into that statement went unanswered,\" Schiff said. \nAs the interview wore on, Hicks and her lawyer relented on one area of questioning â€” the transition period between the election and the inauguration. She initially refused to answer all those questions, but Schiff said it became clear to the House lawmakers that she had answered questions about that time period in a separate interview with the Senate intelligence panel. That committee is also investigating the meddling and spoke to Hicks several months ago. \nAfter House lawmakers argued that she should treat the two committees equally, Hicks and her lawyer conferred with the White House, Schiff said. She then began to answer some questions related to the transition. Schiff said Democrats had asked for a subpoena after she refused to answer questions, but Republicans had declined to issue one. \nThat marks a difference from the GOP response to former White House strategist Steve Bannon , who also refused to answer questions, including about the transition. Republicans subpoenaed him during his interview in January when he declined to answer, but Bannon has yet to fully co-operate, despite a return visit to the panel two weeks ago. The House is now considering whether to hold Bannon in contempt. \nRooney, who is one of the Republicans leading the Russia probe, said he didn't think Hicks should be subpoenaed, saying she was \"very forthright and open to the questions that we've had.\" \nHicks arrived shortly after 10 a.m. through a rear entrance to the committee's interview space and did not answer shouted questions from reporters. In the hours before Hicks' arrival, Trump tweeted several times, quoting cable news commentators who said they hadn't seen evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia. One tweet encouraged investigations of Clinton. And a closing tweet simply said, \"WITCH HUNT!\" ",
