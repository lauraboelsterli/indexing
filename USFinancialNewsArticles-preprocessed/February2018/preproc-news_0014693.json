    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IES Holdings, Inc. (or “IES” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IESC) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Results during the quarter were adversely impacted by a preliminary $31.3 million charge related to the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which went into effect January 1, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenue of $198 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 3% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Income from operations of $3.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of $4.0 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Net loss attributable to IES for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $29.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, which includes a $31.3 million charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (as further discussed below) Adjusted net income attributable to IES (a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined below) for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $2.4 million, a decrease of $3.6 million compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2017 Backlog of approximately $337 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $331 million as of September 30, 2017 and approximately $328 million as of December 31, 2016\nManagement Commentary\nRobert Lewey, President, stated, “While our Residential and Communications segments had excellent performance, our Infrastructure Solutions and Commercial & Industrial segments did not meet our expectations during the quarter. Our Infrastructure Solutions segment continues to face headwinds, which are driven by sluggish demand from our industrial customers, and was also impacted by underperformance on certain projects during the quarter. Our Commercial & Industrial segment was negatively impacted by project delays, an increase in self-insurance reserves and continuing costs at our wind-down branches. We expect to see improved performance from both segments going forward and we remain committed to executing on our overall growth strategy and maintaining a strong balance sheet.”\nTracy McLauchlin, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Our results during the quarter were impacted by the federal tax reform enacted in December 2017 and the recording of a non-cash charge of $31 million as a write-down of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our continued strong cash flow has resulted in a year-over-year increase in our cash balances despite using cash to fund three acquisitions and support our growth and expansion. We remain well positioned to use our liquidity to fund our growth strategy.”\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act Impact\nAt September 30, 2017, the Company had deferred tax assets of $86.2 million. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other changes, reduced the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of this change, we recorded a preliminary charge of $31.3 million as a write-down of net deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated impact of the new statutory tax rate. This charge may be adjusted in future quarters and has no impact on our cash taxes paid.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nThe Company estimates that it has available Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (NOLs) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $378 million at September 30, 2017, including approximately $142 million resulting from the additional amortization of personal goodwill. The Company's common stock is subject to a Rights Plan dated November 8, 2016, which is intended to assist in limiting the number of 5% or more owners of the Company’s common stock and, thereby reduce the risk of a possible “change of ownership” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Any such “change of ownership” under these rules would limit or eliminate the ability of the Company to use its existing NOLs for federal income tax purposes. There is no guarantee that the Rights Plan will achieve the objective of preserving the value or realization of the NOLs.\nStock Buyback Plan\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has authorized and previously announced a stock repurchase program for purchasing up to 1.5 million shares of our common stock from time to time. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Adjustments\nThis press release includes adjusted net income attributable to IES and, in the non-GAAP reconciliation table included herein, adjusted net income before taxes, both of which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Management believes that these measures provide useful information to our investors by distinguishing certain noncash events such as our valuation allowances release and write-down of our net deferred tax assets, and that these measures, when reconciled to net income attributable to IES, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, help our investors to better identify underlying trends in the operations of our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our financial performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.\nFor further details on the Company’s financial results, please refer to the Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017, to be filed Commission (“SEC”) by February 6, 2018, and any amendments thereto.\nAbout IES Holdings, Inc.\nIES is a holding company that owns and manages diverse operating subsidiaries, comprised of providers of industrial infrastructure services to a variety of end markets. Our approximately 3,500 employees serve clients in the United States.
