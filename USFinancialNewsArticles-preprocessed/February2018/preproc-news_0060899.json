    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday was set to hear a high-stakes case that could deprive unions representing police, firefighters and certain other public employees of a key source of funds -- millions of dollars in fees they can collect annually from non-members.\nDueling groups of protesters gathered outside the white marble courthouse ahead of the scheduled one-hour argument.\nThe nine justices will weigh a challenge backed by anti-union groups to the legality of fees that workers who are not members of public-sector unions must pay to help cover the costs of collective bargaining with state and local governments.\nUnion-backed protesters held signs saying \"America needs union jobs,\" while those supporting the challengers had signs saying \"stand with Mark,\" a reference to the plaintiff in the case, Illinois state worker Mark Janus.\nTwo dozen states require payment of these so-called agency fees, covering roughly 5 million public-sector workers. A Supreme Court ruling disallowing these fees would deal a setback to American organized labor at a time when the movement already is in a reduced state compared to the past.\nDepriving unions of agency fees could undermine their ability to spend in political races. They typically back Democratic candidates over Republicans.\nThe justices considered a similar case in 2016, and after hearing arguments appeared poised to overturn a 1977 Supreme Court precedent that let unions force non-members covered by contracts negotiated by organized labor to pay fees in lieu of union dues to help cover non-political union expenditures.\nBut the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia the following month left the court with an even split of conservatives and liberals, and its 4-4 ruling in March 2016 failed to settle the legal question.\nRepublican President Donald Trump's appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year restored the Supreme Court's 5-4 conservative majority. Gorsuch could cast the deciding vote in dooming agency fees.\nThe 2016 case was brought by non-union California public school teachers. Janus, the plaintiff in the current case, is a child-support specialist for the state of Illinois who opted not to join the union that represents employees like him, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).\nIn both cases, the challengers argued that being forced to pay the agency fees to unions whose views they may not share violates their rights to free speech and free association under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\nUnions in both cases contended that mandatory agency fees are needed in order to eliminate the problem of what they call \"free riders\" -- non-members who benefit from union representation, for example through salary and working conditions obtained in collective bargaining -- without actually paying for it.\nMore than a hundred people loudly demonstrated outside the courthouse.\nDexter Guptill, a computer support technician for the American Federation of Teachers, said that if the justices rule against the unions, \"my co-workers would wind up being forced to spend their effort representing essentially free riders.\"\nTwenty-four states have agency fee requirements. While 28 states have so-called right-to-work laws that prohibit mandatory agency fees, Wisconsin and Michigan have exceptions for police officers and firefighters that permit agency fees covering those workers. In those right-to-work states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower.\nFederal employee unions cannot collect agency fees.
