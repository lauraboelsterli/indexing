    "text": "February 23, 2018 / 7:32 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago Standard Life Aberdeen sells insurance unit to Phoenix for 3.24 billion pounds Carolyn Cohn , Simon Jessop 2 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Life Aberdeen ( SLA.L ) on Friday said it would sell an insurance unit to Phoenix Group ( PHNX.L ) for 3.24 billion pounds ($4.51 billion), as it posted 2017 pretax profit of 1 billion pounds. The deal will see SLA receive 2.3 billion pounds in cash and a 19.9 percent stake in Phoenix, it said in a statement, completing its planned exit from the capital-intensive insurance business to focus on asset management. SLA said the deal is for its Standard Life Assurance Limited, founded in 1825 and one of the UK’s oldest life and pensions businesses, although it will retain its UK retail platforms and financial advice business. The assurance business is primarily based in Britain, with operations in Ireland and Germany, and serves around 4.5 million customers and clients, it said. As part of the transaction, SLA said it would expand the companies’ existing strategic partnership and look to be “the asset manager of choice” for Phoenix. “Today’s announcement represents a logical next step in Standard Life Aberdeen’s journey to build a world-class investment company positioning us strongly for the future,” said SLA co-Chief Executives Martin Gilbert and Keith Skeoch. Published alongside the confirmation of the deal with Phoenix, first reported Thursday, was the company’s first set of annual results since it formed last year through the 11 billion pound merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management. SLA said in a separate statement that Gerry Grimstone would stand down as chairman at the end of 2019. Reporting by Carolyn Cohn; editing by Simon Jessop and Huw Jones",
