    "text": "TORONTO, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FirstService Corporation (TSX:FSV) (NASDAQ:FSV) (\"FirstService\") announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on the outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and Multiple Voting Shares of the Company (together, the \" Common Shares \") over the previous US$0.1225 per Common Share and declared a quarterly dividend of US$0.135 per Common Share. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2018 to holders of Common Shares of record at the close of business on March 29, 2018.\nAt this distribution level, the Company’s dividend on an annualized basis will be US$0.54, up from US$0.49 per year. The growth in the dividend represents the third consecutive 10% increase since FirstService became a new public company through its mid-2015 spin-off. FirstService’s consistent growth in annual cash flow and conservative balance sheet provide strong support for the increased distribution to its shareholders, while fully preserving flexibility to fund growth opportunities across its businesses.\nThe dividend on Common Shares is an \"eligible dividend\" for Canadian income tax purposes.\nAbout FirstService Corporation\nFirstService Corporation is a North American leader in the property services sector, serving its customers through two industry-leading service platforms: FirstService Residential, North America's largest manager of residential communities; and FirstService Brands, one of North America's largest providers of essential property services delivered through individually branded franchise systems and company-owned operations.\nFirstService generates more than $1.5 billion in annual revenues and has more than 17,000 employees across North America. With significant insider ownership and an experienced management team, FirstService has a long-term track record of creating value and superior returns for shareholders. The Subordinate Voting Shares of FirstService trade on the NASDAQ and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"FSV\".\nFor the latest news from FirstService Corporation, visit www.firstservice.com\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release includes or may include forward-looking statements.
