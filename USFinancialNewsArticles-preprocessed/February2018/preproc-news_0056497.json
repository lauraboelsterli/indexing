    "text": " 11 PM / in 10 minutes No sign of violations in Geely purchase of Daimler stake: Merkel Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is open towards its trading partners and at a first look, there are no obvious violations linked to Geely’s ( 0175.HK ) acquisition of a $9 billion stake in Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ), Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday. “We are open to our trading partners and at a first look there are no violations in this regard,” she told reporters. She added that there were questions about possible holes in transparency around disclosure requirements but that was a matter for BaFin financial sector regulator. “Our aim is to keep a sustainable car industry in Germany - that is our political, strategic aim.” Reporting by Madeline Chambers; Editing by Thomas Escritt",
