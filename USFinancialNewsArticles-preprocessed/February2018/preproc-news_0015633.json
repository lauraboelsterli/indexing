    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 8:05 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago U.S. FDA approves Gilead's three-drug HIV regimen Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s three-drug regimen to treat HIV-1 infection. \nThe treatment, Biktarvy, is a once-daily tablet that combines three previously approved drugs - bictegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, the company said. \nIt is available to patients who have been on a stable regimen for at least three months. \nBiktarvy has a boxed warning about the risk of post-treatment acute increase of hepatitis B. \nThe approval puts GlaxoSmithKline’s HIV businesses under threat as the company has been facing slowing demand and new competition. \nGilead’s shares were up 3.45 percent at $83.16 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.
