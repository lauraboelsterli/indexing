    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Bank Indonesia (BI) will manage the rupiah currency to reflect economic fundamentals while still maintaining market mechanisms, senior deputy governor Mirza Adityaswara told an economic forum on Thursday.\nThe rupiah touched its weakest since October 27 on Thursday. It has dropped around 1.7 percent since the end of January amid the global equity sell-off. [EMRG/FRX]\nBI governor Agus Martowardojo said earlier this week that the rupiah’s movements this year had been within a “fair” range.\nReporting by Maikel Jefriando; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
