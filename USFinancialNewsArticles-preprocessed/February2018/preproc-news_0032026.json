(\"iQiyi\"), has submitted a draft registration statement on Form F-1 in compliance with the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") for a proposed initial public offering of iQiyi and listing of iQiyi's American depositary shares representing its ordinary shares on a major stock exchange in the U.S. (the \"Proposed IPO\"). The Proposed IPO is expected to commence as capital markets conditions permit and is subject to iQiyi's public filing of the registration statement with the SEC in compliance with the Securities Act, and the SEC declaring such registration statement effective. The proposed number of American depositary shares to be offered and sold in the Proposed IPO has not yet been determined. Baidu expects to remain iQiyi's controlling shareholder after the completion of the Proposed IPO.\nThis announcement is being made pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135 under the Securities Act. This press release is not intended to, and does not, constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, in the United States or elsewhere, and it is not intended to, and does not, constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. Any public offering of securities to be made in the United States will be made by means of a prospectus that may be obtained from the issuer or the selling security holder and that will contain detailed information about the issuer and management, as well as financial statements.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Baidu expects net revenues to be between RMB19.86 billion ($3.05 billion) and RMB20.97 billion ($3.22 billion), representing a 25% to 32% increase year over year. Excluding disposed businesses, such as mobile games and Baidu Deliveries, the guidance represents a 29% to 36% increase year over year. This forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to substantial uncertainty.\nStarting on January 1, 2018, Baidu adopted a new revenue accounting standard (ASC 606). The most significant impact will be the reclassification of value added tax from cost of revenues to net against revenues. If presented net of value added tax, revenues for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately 5.6% lower than currently presented. The above guidance reflects Baidu's new reporting requirement. If presented on the same basis as 2017, gross revenues are expected to be between RMB 21.05 billion ($3.24 billion) and RMB22.23 billion ($3.42 billion), representing a 25% to 32% increase year over year.\nConference Call Information\nBaidu's management will hold an earnings conference call at 8:00 PM on February 13, 2018, U.S. Eastern Time (9:00 AM on February 14, 2018, Beijing/Hong Kong Time).

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nBaidu believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core business operating results, such as operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, but also other items that are infrequent or unusual in nature.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company's results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data.\nNon-GAAP operating profit represents operating profit excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu represents net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses and the gain or loss associated with the issuance of shares by Baidu's equity method investees at a price higher or lower than the carrying value per share. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents diluted earnings per ADS calculated based on non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu. Adjusted EBITDA represents operating profit excluding depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation expenses.
