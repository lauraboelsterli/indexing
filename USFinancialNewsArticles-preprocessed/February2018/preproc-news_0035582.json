    "text": "BANGKOK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Airports of Thailand Pcl (AOT) said on Wednesday net profit rose 22.3 percent in the first quarter, beating estimates, as the country’s main airports operator benefited from a tourism boom last year.\nNet profit came in at 6.2 billion baht ($197.70 million), it said in a statement, above expectations of 5.8 billion baht in a Reuters poll.\nNearly 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year, aiding growth for hotels, malls and the airport operator, and the country expects that figure to grow by 6 percent in 2018.\nAOT, which operates six international airports including the country’s main Suvarnabhumi airport, said revenue from passenger fees, and aircraft landing and parking charges rose 16.4 percent to 8.2 billion baht in the three months ended December.\nRent and fees from concessions and services were also up 15 percent at 6.4 billion baht from a year earlier, the majority state-owned company said.\nAs tourist arrivals surge, AOT said it will accommodate demand by developing airport infrastructure.\nIt may also increase management of airports under its portfolio to include those currently managed by the government, it said.\nRapid expansion of low cost airlines and cheaper airfares also helped growth, AOT said.
