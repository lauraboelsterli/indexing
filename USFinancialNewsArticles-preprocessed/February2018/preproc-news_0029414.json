At Dec. 31, 2017, the company's total debt outstanding was $281.4 million, compared to $283.7 million at Dec. 31, 2016.\n\"Our financial results in 2017 were driven by the strong year-over-year growth of our proprietary products, VIVITROL and ARISTADA, our base royalty and manufacturing business and our strategic alliance with Biogen for BIIB098. We exited the year well positioned to execute on our key strategic initiatives in 2018,\" commented James Frates, Chief Financial Officer of Alkermes. \"Looking ahead, 2018 will be a transformative year for Alkermes. Our financial expectations for 2018 reflect important investments that will drive future value as we advance our late-stage pipeline and prepare for the anticipated launch of ALKS 5461, with the planned expansion of our commercial organization midyear. We also expect solid growth for VIVITROL and ARISTADA, and remain committed to driving awareness and advancing the treatment paradigm for these important medicines.\"\nRecent Events:\nALKS 5461: In January 2018, Alkermes submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). ALKS 5461 was granted Fast Track status by the FDA in October 2013 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. BIIB098: Biogen and Alkermes announced a license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of BIIB098 for the treatment of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Under the terms of the agreement, Alkermes granted Biogen an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize BIIB098 and Biogen will pay Alkermes a mid-teens royalty on worldwide net sales of BIIB098. Biogen is responsible for all development and commercialization expenses, effective Jan. 1, 2018. Alkermes may also receive milestone payments for BIIB098 with a maximum aggregate value of $200 million upon certain clinical and regulatory achievements. ARISTADA: A NDA was filed with the FDA for Aripiprazole Lauroxil NanoCrystal ® Dispersion (AL NCD ), a novel, investigational product designed for initiation onto ARISTADA. A target action date of June 30, 2018 was assigned to the AL NCD NDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). VIVITROL: Results from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded X:BOT study, comparing extended-release naltrexone (VIVITROL) and buprenorphine-naloxone, were published in The Lancet. Data from the study demonstrated that, once treatment was initiated, both medications were equally safe and effective in preventing relapse to opioid dependence . ALKS 4230: Preclinical data on ALKS 4230 was presented at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting. The data showed that treatment with ALKS 4230 significantly delayed tumor growth and led to accumulation of tumor-killing T cells in the tumor microenvironment in individualized and humanized melanoma xenograft models of tumor immunology.\n\"We are making significant progress in advancing our pipeline of late-stage CNS development candidates, highlighted by the recent submission of the ALKS 5461 NDA, the recently announced license and collaboration agreement with Biogen to develop and commercialize BIIB098, and as we near completion of enrollment in the six-month pivotal weight study for ALKS 3831,\" said Richard Pops, Chief Executive Officer of Alkermes. \"Alkermes has worked for many years toward this moment. With a diversified CNS business and significant news flow expected across our pipeline of development candidates in 2018, we are focused on executing on our business strategy to bring these important potential new medicines to patients and creating value for our shareholders.\"\n2018 Expected Milestones\nThe following outlines the company's expected milestones for 2018.

For more information, please visit Alkermes' website at www.alkermes.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes information about certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), including non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) adjusts for one-time and non-cash charges by excluding from GAAP results: share-based compensation expense; amortization; depreciation; non-cash net interest expense; certain other one-time or non-cash items; and the income tax effect of these reconciling items.\nThe company's management and board of directors utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance. The company provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with the company's results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, are useful in identifying underlying trends in ongoing operations. However, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures as indicators of operating performance. Further, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share should not be considered measures of our liquidity.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables included in this press release.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements set forth in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including, but not limited to, statements concerning: future financial and operating performance, business plans or prospects; the likelihood of continued revenue growth from the company's commercial products, including the growth of VIVITROL and ARISTADA; the therapeutic and commercial value of the company's marketed and development products and patient access to such products; expectations concerning the timing and results of clinical development activities, including the timing of the phase 3 clinical trial enrollment completion and data readout for ALKS 3831, the timing of the presentation of ALKS 3831 phase 1 metabolic study data, the phase 1 data readout and timing of development activities for ALKS 4230, the timing of data from the EVOLVE-MS-2 head-to-head gastrointestinal study and the potential $50 million option payment by Biogen, the submission of the NDA for BIIB098, the acceptance of the NDA for ALKS 5461 by the FDA, and the timing of FDA review of the NDA for ALKS 5461; and expectations concerning the timing and results of commercial activities, including the expected launch of ALKS 5461.
