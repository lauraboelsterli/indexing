    "text": "Turns out Elon Musk wasn't kidding.\nOn Tuesday SpaceX sent Musk's personal Tesla Roadster into space on its successful first test flight.\nThe Falcon Heavy is the largest rocket launched into space since the NASA Saturn V in the early 1970s.\nIt is common for rockets to carry a dummy payload during test flights. Musk and company decided to load the rocket with an original Tesla Roadster with a SpaceX suit-wearing dummy in the driver's seat.\nSpaceX successfully landed all three boosters that propelled the rocket, but the rocket's second stage, with the Roadster on top, was launched into an orbit around the sun.\nThe above photo is a picture of the car, with dummy driver, soon after it entered orbit.\nThe photo above is a frontal view.\nAbove is a view of the Roadster's dashboard, with a message displayed on the screen.\nShortly after the launch, Musk tweeted out a live camera shot of the dummy, called \"Starman\" after the David Bowie song that could be heard playing toward the end of the launch.\nMusk\nMusk unveiled a second generation Roadster in November that boasted eye-popping specifications.\nThe full video of Wednesday's launch is below:",
