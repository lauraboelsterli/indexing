    "text": "SAN JOSE, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Costa Rica will join other coffee-producing nations in the region and start planting robusta, lifting a 30 year-ban on a crop that is more resistant to diseases and rising temperatures than arabica trees, the Minister of Agriculture said on Friday.\nThe agriculture ministry has issued a resolution that would allow for the production of robusta varieties, but it still needs to be signed by President Luis Guillermo Solis before it takes effect.
