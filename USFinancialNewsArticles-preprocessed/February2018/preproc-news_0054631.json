    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA, Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- World Poker Fund Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK: WPFH), a leading developer and operator of online technology, gaming platforms and brands, announces that it has appointed new directors in furtherance of its plans to develop, acquire and convert casinos worldwide.\nNEW BOARD OF DIRECTOR APPOINTMENTS\nAs part of its plan to uplist onto the OTCQB Market, WPFH has named Chad Gordon, Esq. and Randy Doten to serve as additional independent members on its Board of Directors. Under the recent changes to the QB level market announced by OTC Markets, WPFH can qualify for this higher market level on completion of an audit of its financial reports for the last full fiscal year provided that it has and maintains a Board of Directors with a majority of Independent members. The addition of Mr. Gordon and Mr. Doten to the WPFH Board will have that effect.\nChad Gordon is a lawyer and broker with nearly two decades of experience in gaming, gaming regulation, real estate and corporate issues. Mr. Gordon has represented tribal governments throughout the United States on tribal economic diversification and all aspects of gaming, casino, and Native American law. Mr. Gordon received his B.A from U.C. Santa Barbara, M.A. from UCLA, and J.D. from the UCLA School of Law.\nRandy Garcia Doten has served as President, Secretary, and Director of several publicly traded companies. He has successfully implemented marketing and production campaigns for talk, radio and game shows. Mr. Doten also runs several well-known and successful celebrity-owned businesses including high-end celebrity restaurants and sports & entertainment companies. He is an avid connoisseur of casinos and slot machines all over the world.\n“GO GREEN, WIN GREEN™” CASINO DEVELOPMENT\nWPFH is currently working on furthering its “Go Green, Win Green™” plans by acquiring an existing hotel in the Dominican Republic and completing its casino expansion. This will be WPFH’s second “Greensino™” project, after its recently announced Castilblanco Luxury Resort project in Spain.\nBoth projects are designed to develop luxury casinos with no adverse environmental impact in and on the surrounding region. These projects will be themed around celebrities and athletes, in keeping with WPFH’s business model of working with the biggest and best stars to bring them to the gaming and casino worlds.\n“While WPFH has provided top flight branding and celebrities in the gaming world, being able to do so while remaining environmentally responsible is such a rewarding challenge. This is a desire and strong commitment from many of our celebrity partners, and I think we have exceeded expectations. We are providing luxury that you can not only feel good in, but feel good about. We believe that everyone will want to come PLAY in our Greensinos™. Go Green, Win Green!” says Travis Kasper, Chairman & CEO of WPFH.\nABOUT WORLD POKER FUND HOLDINGS, INC.\nWorld Poker Fund Holdings, Inc. is a leading developer and operator of online technology, gaming platforms and brands.
