    "text": "Michael Amadio and Anze Kopitar scored two goals each Saturday as the Los Angeles Kings snapped a three-game losing streak with a 4-2 defeat of the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center in Buffalo.\nJonathan Quick made 33 saves for Los Angeles, which notched its second win of a seven-game road trip that ends Monday in Chicago and Tuesday in Winnipeg. The Kings tied Anaheim for fourth place in the Pacific Division, just a point behind Calgary and Minnesota for the final Western Conference playoff spot.\nLos Angeles came out of the gate flying, outshooting the Sabres 19-8 in the first period. Goalie Robin Lehner kept Buffalo in contention with 18 stops in the period, but Amadio beat him at 11:26 for his third goal. He took a pass from Andy Andreoff and shoveled a wrister from the right circle that trickled through Lehner’s pads.\nKopitar and Amadio blew the game open with three goals in a 5:33 span of the second period. Kopitar made it 2-0 at 12:02 with his 24th tally of the season. Dustin Brown took the puck away near the blue line and fed Kopitar on a 2-on-1, and he deked Lehner out of the crease before sliding a backhand into the net.\nIt became 3-0 at 16:08. Andy Iafallo set up Kopitar from behind the net after Brown dumped the puck in, and Kopitar flicked a wrister from the left circle that made its way through Lehner’s pads.\nAmadio capped the outburst at 17:35, wiring a wrister from the slot after maneuvering around a defender to get into the slot. That was the end of Lehner’s day, as he was replaced by Chad Johnson after allowing four goals on 30 shots.\nMarco Scandella enabled Buffalo to avoid a shutout with his second goal 30 seconds into the third period. The defenseman collected a loose puck just inside the blue line and boomed a slapper past Quick.\nRasmus Ristolainen made the final score a bit more respectable with an unassisted goal, his fifth of the season, at 16:42.\n-- Field Level Media\n ",
