    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is preparing for a U.S. government shutdown if Congress does not pass a funding bill by midnight, an OMB official said on Thursday.\n“The Office of Management and Budget is currently preparing for a lapse in appropriations. As we stated earlier today, we support the Bipartisan Budget Act and urge Congress to send it to the president’s desk without delay,” the OMB official said.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh\n ",
