    "text": "PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Independence Realty Trust, Inc. (“IRT”) (NYSE: IRT), a multifamily apartment REIT, today announced its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results.\nResults for the Fourth Quarter\nNet income (loss) allocable to common shares of $6.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to ($41.0) million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Core Funds from Operations (“CFFO”) per share of $0.18 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.17 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA of $21.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $18.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nResults for the Full Year\nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders of $30.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to ($9.8) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Core Funds from Operations (“CFFO”) per share of $0.73 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.79 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA of $81.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $74.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nSame-Store Property Operating Results\nFourth Quarter 2017\nCompared to Fourth Quarter\n2016 (1)\nTwelve Months Ended\n12/31/17 Compared to Twelve\nMonths Ended 12/31/16 (1)\nRental income 3.1% increase 3.4% increase Total revenues 3.5% increase 3.9% increase Property level operating expenses 2.1% increase 2.5% increase Net operating income (“NOI”) 4.3% increase 4.8% increase Portfolio average occupancy 100 bps increase to 94.7% 80 bps increase to 94.6% Portfolio average rental rate 2.3% increase to $1,021 2.8% increase to $1,015 NOI Margin 60 bps increase to 60.7% 50 bps increase to 60.1% (1) Same store portfolio for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes 42 properties, which represent 11,677 units.\n“IRT’s 2017 performance highlights our ability to consistently deliver strong operating returns, while simultaneously transforming the portfolio and solidifying our balance sheet,” said Scott Schaeffer, IRT’s Chairman and CEO. “We continue to be rewarded for our commitment to owning and operating high-quality, middle-market communities across core non-gateway markets, underlined by 4.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in 2017. We are dedicated to operating a portfolio of apartment communities that will deliver outstanding long-term returns. Our recently completed nine-community portfolio acquisition and disposition of legacy Class C assets during 2017 has upgraded our portfolio composition and enhanced our economies of scale. Our execution has generated significant momentum to continue to drive outsized NOI growth and remain on track to achieve our long-term objectives.”\nProperty Acquisitions\nDuring the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end, IRT completed the acquisition of the remaining five properties related to the nine-community portfolio transaction, initially announced on September 5, 2017. The nine-community portfolio totaled 2,352 units and was acquired for a gross purchase price of $228.1 million. IRT assumed $58.5 million of property level debt in association with three of the acquired assets.\nOn January 4, 2018, IRT completed the acquisition of a 312-unit community located in Columbus, OH for approximately $36.8 million. IRT used available cash and borrowings from its line of credit to complete the acquisition. As of January 2, 2018, the community was 94.6% occupied with average rent of $1,066.\nProperty Dispositions\nOn November 28, 2017, IRT completed the disposition of a 432-unit community located in Jackson, MS for a gross sale price of $27.2 million. IRT recognized a gain on sale of this community of approximately $3.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. The community was held for sale and represented the final of four legacy Class C communities that were sold during 2017 for a gross sale price of $86.8 million.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn November 11, 2017, IRT announced that it entered into a seven-year, $100 million unsecured term loan that will reach maturity in November 2024. The proceeds will reduce borrowings currently outstanding under the revolving portion of IRT’s $300 million unsecured credit facility. The term loan bears interest at a spread over LIBOR, based on IRT’s overall leverage. At closing, the spread to LIBOR was 165 basis points. To continue IRT’s practice of reducing exposure to floating interest rates, IRT purchased a collar that caps LIBOR at 2.00%, subject to a floor on LIBOR of 1.25%, during the entire seven-year term.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nDuring the fourth quarter, IRT issued 1,164,900 shares of our common stock under the At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement dated August 4, 2017. The shares were issued at an average price of $10.38 and net proceeds from the issuances were approximately $11.9 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, recurring capital expenditures for the total portfolio were $1.6 million, or $118 per unit. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, recurring capital expenditures for the total portfolio were $7.1 million, or $532 per unit.\n2018 EPS and CFFO Guidance\nIRT is announcing 2018 full year guidance. EPS per diluted share is projected to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.31. CFFO per diluted share is projected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.79. A reconciliation of IRT's projected net income allocable to common shares to its projected CFFO per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, is included below. Also included below are the primary assumptions underlying this estimate. See Schedule II to this release for further information regarding how IRT calculates CFFO and Schedule V to this release for management’s definition and rationale for the usefulness of CFFO.\n2018 Full Year EPS and CFFO Guidance (1) Low\nHigh\nNet income allocable to common shares $0.26 $0.31 Earnings per share $0.26 $0.31 2018 EPS and CFFO Guidance Net income allocable to common shares $0.26 $0.31 Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 0.43 0.43 Share base compensation 0.03 0.03 Amortization of deferred financing fees 0.02 0.02 CORE FFO per diluted share allocated to common shareholders $0.74 $0.79 (1) This guidance, including the underlying assumptions, constitutes forward-looking information.

We believe average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. This metric, when presented, reflects the average effective rent per month.\nAverage Occupancy\nAverage occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before acquisition and integration expenses and certain other non-operating gains or losses related to items such as asset sales, debt extinguishments, acquisition related debt extinguishment expenses, gains on the TSRE merger, and management internalization expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are each non-GAAP measures. We consider each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it eliminates interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration expenses and other non-operating gains and losses, which permits investors to view income from operations without these non-cash or non-operating items. IRT’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA differs from the methodology used for calculating Adjusted EBITDA by certain other REITs and, accordingly, IRT’s Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA reported by other REITs.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Core Funds From Operations (“CFFO”)\nIRT believes that FFO and CFFO, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and IRT in particular. IRT computes FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses on sales of real estate and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.\nCFFO is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company’s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, including stock compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of other items not included in FFO, amortization of deferred financing costs, acquisition and integration expenses, and other non-operating gains or losses related to items such as defeasance costs we incur when we sell a property subject to secured debt, asset sales, debt extinguishments, acquisition related debt extinguishment expenses, gains on the TSRE merger, and management internalization expenses, from the determination of FFO. IRT incurs acquisition expenses in connection with acquisitions of real estate properties and expenses those costs when incurred in accordance with GAAP. As these expenses are one-time and reflective of investing activities rather than operating performance, IRT adds back these costs to FFO in determining CFFO.\nIRT’s calculation of CFFO differs from the methodology used for calculating CFFO by certain other REITs and, accordingly, IRT’s CFFO may not be comparable to CFFO reported by other REITs. IRT’s management utilizes FFO and CFFO as measures of IRT’s operating performance, and believes they are also useful to investors, because they facilitate an understanding of IRT’s operating performance after adjustment for certain non-cash or non-operating items that are required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately compare IRT’s operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO, CFFO and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, IRT believes that FFO and CFFO may provide IRT and our investors with an additional useful measure to compare IRT’s financial performance to certain other REITs. Neither FFO nor CFFO is equivalent to net income or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and CFFO do not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor CFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of IRT’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of IRT’s liquidity.\nInterest Coverage\nInterest coverage is a ratio computed by dividing our Adjusted EBITDA by our interest expense.\nNet Debt\nNet debt, a non-GAAP measure, equals total debt less cash and cash equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of total debt to net debt (Dollars in thousands).\nAs of December 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nJune 30, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nTotal debt $ 778,442 $ 731,625 $ 764,521 $ 765,695 $ 743,817 Less: cash and cash equivalents (9,985 ) (10,128 ) (6,271 ) (10,065 ) (20,892 ) Total net debt $ 768,457 $ 721,497 $ 758,250 $ 755,630 $ 722,925 IRT presents net debt because management believes it is a useful measure of IRT’s credit position and progress toward reducing leverage. The calculation is limited in that IRT may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar for dollar basis.\nNet Operating Income\nIRT believes that Net Operating Income (“NOI”), a non-GAAP measure, is a useful measure of its operating performance. IRT defines NOI as total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, asset management fees, property management fees, acquisition expenses and general administrative expenses. In connection with our management internalization which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, we modified our calculation of NOI to exclude property management expenses. We retrospectively adjusted previously reported NOI to conform to this change. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate our performance on a same store and non-same store basis because NOI measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance.\nSame Store Properties and Same Store Portfolio\nIRT reviews its same store portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year. Properties are added into the same store portfolio if they were owned at the beginning of the previous year. Properties that are held-for-sale or have been sold are excluded from the same store portfolio.\nTotal Gross Assets\nTotal Gross Assets equals total assets plus accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization, including fully depreciated or amortized real estate and real estate related assets. The following table provides a reconciliation of total assets to total gross assets (Dollars in thousands).\nAs of December 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nJune 30, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nTotal assets $ 1,450,624 $ 1,405,212 $ 1,317,177 $ 1,306,986 $ 1,294,237 Plus: Accumulated Depreciation (a) 84,097 76,664 68,433 68,262 60,719 Plus: Accumulated Amortization 16,517 15,670 15,254 15,341 15,287 Total gross assets $ 1,551,238 $ 1,497,546 $ 1,400,864 $ 1,390,589 $ 1,370,243 (a) Includes previously recognized depreciation on properties that are classified as held-for-sale\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005621/en/\nIndependence Realty Trust, Inc.\nEdelman Financial Communications & Capital Markets\nTed McHugh and Lauren Tarola, 212-277-4322\nIRT@edelman.com\nSource: Independence Realty Trust, Inc.",
