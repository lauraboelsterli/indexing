    "text": "Alex Tuch scored from outside the crease with 5:12 remaining to give the Vegas Golden Knights a 4-3 victory over the Washington Capitals in a battle of division leaders Sunday afternoon in Washington.\nTuch came towards the crease from goalie Philipp Grubauer’s right and got off a bit of a weak shot. However, Grubauer (27 saves) couldn’t control the puck, and it slid through the crease and just over the line inside the right post.\nWashington challenged for goalie interference but the play stood.\nThe victory put Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury (20 saves) into 13th place on the all-time wins list (390), moving him past Dominik Hasek.\nVegas now leads the Pacific Division with 74 points, and Washington remains in first in the Metropolitan Division (65 points).\nWashington coach Barry Trotz passed Lindy Ruff for fifth place on the NHL’s all-time games coached list. Trotz now has coached 1,494 games and needs six more to become the fifth person to make it to the milestone of 1,500 games.\nAlso for the Caps, T.J. Oshie was fined $5,000 for his cross-check on Pittsburgh’s Kris Letang in Friday loss to the Penguins.\nThis was the first time that the expansion Golden Knights ever have played in Washington, although they did beat the Capitals in Vegas (3-0) earlier this season.\nThere is a bit of a connection between the two teams. Vegas general manager George McPhee held the same job from 1997-2014 with the Caps.\nThe teams traded goals throughout this game. Washington scored first and Vegas second in the first, second and third periods.\nChandler Stephenson scored his third goal in three games for a 1-0 Washington lead in the first before Ryan Carpenter notched his initial goal with Vegas, tying the game.\nIn the second period, Matt Niskanen (one goal, one assist) gave the Capitals a 2-1 edge with a shot from the high slot before Reilly Smith tied it with a goal from in front.\nNicklas Backstrom put Washington up 3-2 with his goal 52 seconds into the third period before Smith tied it on his second goal, a wrist shot at 9:21.\nCarpenter finished with one goal and one assist for Vegas. Pierre-Edourd Bellemare and Jonathan Marchessault both posted two assists in the victory.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
