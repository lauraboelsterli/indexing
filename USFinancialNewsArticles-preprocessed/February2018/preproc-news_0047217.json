    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 6:26 AM / Updated an hour ago VEON Q4 core profit falls nearly 4 pct, hurt by Uzbek currency devaluation Reuters Staff 1 Min Read AMSTERDAM, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mobile telecommunications company Veon said on Thursday its fourth-quarter core profit fell nearly 4 percent to $753 million, mainly due to the devaluation of the Uzbek som. Veon, formerly known as Vimpelcom, said its 2018 performance will continue to be impacted by “the currency liberalization and a number of strategic transactions.” “We expect flat-to-low single-digit organic growth for both group revenue and EBITDA,” it said.
