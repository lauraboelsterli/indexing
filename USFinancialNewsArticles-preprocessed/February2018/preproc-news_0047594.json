LIVECHAT - ASSET CLASSES IN BUBBLE? Market players seem to be divided on the quality of the equity rally in 2017. While most believe that it's growth and fundamentals based, a select few disagree and call it a bubble. Jesse Colombo, Economic Analyst and Contributing Editor (Forbes) is among those. We seek to understand why he thinks a bubble exists and what are the ways (if any) to take pre-emptive action.

GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Mueller ups pressure on Trump campaign aides with new charge U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Tuesday stepped up pressure on two former Trump campaign aides to cooperate in his probe into possible collusion with Russia, unsealing a criminal charge against a lawyer for lying to Mueller's investigators. • GM offers $2.8 billion investment in S.Korea over 10 yrs - S.Korea official General Motors has proposed $2.8 billion of fresh investment into its South Korean operations over the 10 years as part of its plan to restructure the embattled unit, a South Korean senior government official said. • Qualcomm deals blow to Broadcom's bid with sweetened NXP deal U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday unveiled a sweetened $44 billion agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV, its most defiant move in its defense against a hostile $121 billion bid from Broadcom Ltd. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,379.50, up 0.49 pct from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, tracking overnight greenback strength underpinned by gains in U.S. Treasury yields ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting minutes due post market hours. • Indian government bonds are likely to fall in early trade tracking firm U.S. yields and ahead of the release of India’s latest monetary policy minutes. GLOBAL MARKETS • The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday to snap a six-session winning streak as a sharp decline in Walmart weighed heavily, but gains in Amazon and chip stocks helped the Nasdaq hold near the unchanged mark. • Stock markets dipped after a long winning run on Wall Street ended overnight, while the dollar gained momentum as yields on U.S. Treasury debt headed for highs not seen in four years. • Oil prices fell; weighed down as the U.S. dollar moved further away from three-year lows hit last week. • Gold extended its fall as the dollar remained strong on rising treasury yields, while investors awaited the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting for cues on the pace of interest rate hikes this year.
