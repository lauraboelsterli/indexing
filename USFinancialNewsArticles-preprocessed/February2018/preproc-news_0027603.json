    "text": "CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) â€” The average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline jumped 7 cents nationally over the past three weeks to $2.65.\nIndustry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the increase is due to higher crude oil costs.\nThe current gas price is 34 cents above where it was a year ago.\nGas in San Francisco was the highest in the contiguous United States at an average of $3.42 a gallon. The lowest was in Tucson, Arizona, at $2.26 a gallon.\nThe U.S. average diesel price is $3.04, up 5 cents from three weeks ago.",
