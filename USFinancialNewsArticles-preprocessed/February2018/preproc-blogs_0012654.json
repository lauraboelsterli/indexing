    "text": "U.S. stocks plunged Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points in an extremely volatile day for the market. The biggest one-day selloff in history effectively erased all of the market’s gains since the first of the year.\nBitcoin continues to fall, losing half of its value since the beginning of 2018 . Meanwhile, only two stocks rose yesterday--TripAdvisor was up 3.7% and baking soda manufacturer Church and Dwight was up 2.4%. Dow stocks alone lost more than $300 billion, but these drops do not technically amount to a market crash. A market crash is generally defined by an abrupt and rapid decline of 20% or more. We’re not quite there yet.\nThe losses after the opening bell on Tuesday morning sent the Dow into a correction , a 10% decline from its high less than two weeks ago. Global stock markets declined for the fourth consecutive day Tuesday, after experiencing record highs just over a week ago.\nAll of this volatility has investors and Wall Street worried. Check out the gallery above to see what it was like inside the stock market on Monday.",
