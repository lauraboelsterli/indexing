    "text": "NEWARK, N.J., Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PSEG announced today that Barb Short will be the company's new Chief Diversity Officer. In addition, Short will head the PSEG Foundation and oversee the company's community involvement as Senior Director, PSEG Corporate Citizenship and Culture. She will replace Ellen Lambert, who has retired. In her retirement, Lambert plans to volunteer with the United Nations to improve maternal health and survivability during and after pregnancy.\nShort comes to PSEG from CECP: The CEO Force for Good, where she served as Managing Director, Corporate Leadership. Short will begin Feb. 15 and will report to Derek DiRisio, President, PSEG Services Corp.\n\"Ellen has done a great job focusing our company on building a culture that values Diversity and Inclusion,\" DiRisio said. \"Barb's experience in nonprofits and various New Jersey corporations will allow her to build on that foundation overall, as well as take our D&I efforts to a new level -- an area that is very important to our employees, community leaders, customers and shareholders. Barb has had the opportunity to lead best practice initiatives in both the Diversity and Inclusion and Corporate Social Responsibility areas, and I look forward to seeing her implement those practices at PSEG.\"\nAt CECP, Short helped to reposition and strengthen the organization, as she served as an adviser to its Fortune 500 executives on their corporate societal investment strategies through oversight of CECP's best-in-class annual Summit and events, launching new initiatives focused on building a culture of purpose and workforce equity, and leading one-on-one and team engagements. She previously served as Director, Global Inclusion and Corporate Social Responsibility at Quest Diagnostics, and President, Quest Diagnostics Foundation. Short has held roles in corporate communications and marketing with several New Jersey companies, as well as with leading organizations focused on equity and inclusion.\n\"PSEG stands as a leader in societal investment in our state, in our communities and among its large corporate peers,\" Short said. \"This kind of distinction, from competitive global rankings to demonstrated employee caring, is earned over time, through the talent, leadership and caring of many. As a corporate peer who has admired PSEG's leadership and as a longtime customer who has been grateful for its dedication and professionalism in the field, I'm honored to call PSEG's 13,000 dedicated workers my caring colleagues.\"\nPSEG has a more-than-100-year history of giving back to the communities where it operates â€“ led by active employee involvement. Short will help guide the PSEG Foundation, recently named one of the state's top three foundations by New Jersey Monthly Magazine. She also will oversee PSEG's employee programs dedicated to a more inclusive workforce and volunteerism in our communities. PSEG, a publicly traded company (NYSE: PEG), was named to Forbes' 2018 list of American's Best Employers for Diversity and has been consistently recognized for its commitment to military personnel and their families. PSEG has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 10th year in a row.\nWant to know what's new at PSEG?
