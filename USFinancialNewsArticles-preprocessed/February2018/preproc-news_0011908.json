    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results. All comparisons are against the prior-year period. As previously noted, the first quarter of 2017 had 6% more days and the fourth quarter of 2017 had 6% fewer days than their respective prior-year periods.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenue was $892 million, down 1%. At constant currency, revenue was down 2%. GAAP operating income was $104 million, up 53%. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.02, up 9%. Total segment profit increased 1% to a fourth-quarter record $106 million, and margin expanded 20 basis points to a fourth-quarter record 11.9%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 12% to a fourth-quarter record $1.68.\nFor the full year, revenue was $3.84 billion, up 5%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. GAAP operating income was a record $495 million, up 15%. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was a record $7.17, up 13%. Total segment profit increased 10% to a record $515 million as total segment margin expanded 50 basis points to a record 13.4%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year rose 14% to a record $7.92.\n\"Lennox International posted a record year of revenue, margin, and profit in 2017, and the company is well-positioned for another year of strong growth and margin expansion in 2018,\" said Chairman and CEO Todd Bluedorn. \"The company's performance was led by our Residential business, which set new highs for revenue, margin, and profit. Our Commercial business set new highs for revenue and profit, and we continued to see improvement in our Refrigeration segment with margin and profit up for the second consecutive year.\n\"In the fourth quarter, the reported results were impacted from having 6% fewer days in the quarter. Residential revenue was relatively flat at fourth-quarter record levels. Segment profit was down 7%, and margin declined 120 basis points to 16.0% on lower factory absorption than a year ago, the timing of other product costs, and unfavorable mix with replacement business down slightly and new construction up. In Commercial, revenue, margin, and profit established new fourth-quarter highs. Commercial revenue was up 1% at constant currency, and segment profit rose 12% as margin expanded 150 basis points to 17.4%. In Refrigeration, revenue declined 9% at constant currency, but segment profit rose 8% and margin expanded 140 basis points to 10.2% as the business hit its margin target for the year of 10.0%, up 50 basis points.\n\"Looking ahead, we are reiterating 2018 guidance for revenue growth of 3-7% and are raising EPS guidance by $1.10, incorporating the net benefits from U.S. tax legislation, to a new range of $9.75-$10.35 for the full year. After generating $227 million of free cash flow in 2017, below guidance of approximately $285 million, the company is raising 2018 free cash flow guidance from approximately $330 million to $395 million to align with working capital timing between the two years, as well as the cash benefit from U.S. tax legislation in 2018. We will continue to invest in the business to drive growth and profitability, grow the dividend with earnings over time, and repurchase stock. For 2018, we are increasing our stock repurchase plans from $300 million to $350 million.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue: Revenue for the fourth quarter was $892 million, down 1%.
