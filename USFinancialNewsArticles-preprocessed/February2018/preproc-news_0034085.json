    "text": "Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Highlights Q4 sales increase 32.5% with 10.0% organic growth Q4 EPS of $0.36, Adjusted EPS of $1.01 Average operating working capital performance at 15.9% of net sales Full year cash conversion of 108% (1) 1 Cash conversion is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less Capital expenditures divided by Adjusted net income.\nCLEVELAND, Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:LECO) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $24.2 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.36. Reported EPS includes special item after-tax charges of $43.3 million or $0.65 EPS. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted net income was $67.5 million, or adjusted EPS of $1.01, as compared with $53.4 million or adjusted EPS of $0.81 in the comparable 2016 period.\nFourth quarter 2017 sales increased 32.5% to $747.2 million from a 20.3% benefit from acquisitions, 6.8% higher volumes, a 3.2% increase in price and a 2.2% favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $75.5 million, or 10.1% of sales. This compares with operating income of $83.1 million, or 14.7% of sales, in the comparable 2016 period. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $92.8 million, or 12.4% of sales as compared to fourth quarter 2016 operating income of $83.1 million or 14.7% of sales. Acquisitions had an unfavorable 180 basis point impact to the 2017 adjusted operating income margin.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Act”) enacted in the fourth quarter resulted in a one-time net tax expense of $28.6 million, or $0.43 EPS, in the quarter. The expense primarily relates to taxes on the Company's unremitted foreign earnings and profits, partially offset by the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The fourth quarter 2017 tax rate was 67.2%, which was unfavorably impacted by the U.S. Tax Act. The fourth quarter 2017 tax rate excluding special items was 25.8% as compared to 31.7% in the comparable 2016 period. The lower current year effective tax rate is attributable to the geographical mix of earnings and the favorable effect of discrete tax items. The Company expects the effective tax rate for the full year 2018 to be in the low to mid-20% range.\n\"We generated solid organic growth across all business segments, key product areas, and geographies in the fourth quarter,” said Christopher L. Mapes, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Our team capped off a successful year with focused operational and commercial initiatives and an aggressive integration plan that will drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. These efforts resulted in double digit EPS growth, record working capital performance, strong cash flows and excellent return on invested capital.” Mapes continued, “We have strong momentum heading into 2018 and are positioned for accelerated growth and superior value creation from our ongoing strategic initiatives.\"\nTwelve Months 2017 Summary\nNet income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $247.5 million, or EPS of $3.71, as compared with net income of $198.4 million, or EPS of $2.91, in the comparable 2016 period. Current period reported EPS includes special item after-tax net charges of $5.2 million or EPS of $0.08. Adjusted net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $252.7 million, or adjusted EPS of $3.79, compared with adjusted net income of $224.5 million, or adjusted EPS of $3.29, in 2016.\nSales increased 15.4% to $2.6 billion in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from an 8.0% benefit from acquisitions, 4.2% higher volumes, a 2.4% increase in price and a 0.8% favorable impact foreign exchange.\nOperating income was $377.7 million, or 14.4% of sales, as compared with $288.3 million, or 12.7% of sales, in the comparable 2016 period. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $362.4 million or 13.8% of sales, as compared with $322.6 million, or 14.2% of sales in 2016. Acquisitions had an unfavorable 90 basis point impact to the 2017 adjusted operating income margin.\nWebcast Information\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 financial results will be webcast live today, February 14, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time.

Management believes that excluding these special items enables them to make better period-over-period comparisons and benchmark the Company's operational performance against other companies in its industry more meaningfully. Furthermore, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information that provides a more complete understanding of Company operating results and enables investors to analyze financial and business trends more thoroughly. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures and have limitations including, but not limited to, their usefulness as comparative measures as other companies may define their non-GAAP measures differently.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Company’s expectations and beliefs concerning the future contained in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
