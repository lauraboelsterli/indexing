    "text": "SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TP Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on addressing oncology drug resistance, announced the appointment of Lewis “Lew” Shuster to the Company’s Board of Directors.\n“The Board and I are extremely delighted to have Lew join the board as an independent director,” said Dr. Yishan (Peter) Li, co-founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of TP Therapeutics, Inc. “Lew brings extensive biotech strategic, financial and operation experience to TP Therapeutics.”\nMr. Shuster is presently the Chief Executive Officer of Shuster Capital, a strategic and operating advisor to life science company executives and investors, which he founded in 2002. Mr. Shuster has 30 years of experience in the roles of CEO, CFO and COO of life science companies including Kemia, Invitrogen, Pharmacopeia and Human Genome Sciences. He has served as a director of more than a dozen life science companies, including chairing audit committees of public companies. He presently serves as a Director of HTG Molecular Diagnostics, Principia Biopharma, Cleave Biosciences, and Active Motif. Mr. Shuster holds a M.B.A. from Stanford University and a B.A. from Swarthmore College.\n“I am pleased to join the TP Therapeutics team. In just a few years their productive drug discovery effort has attracted leading biotech venture capital investors and yielded promising new oncology drug candidates to treat specific sets of patient tumors resistant to current therapies,” said Lew Shuster.\nAbout TPX-0005 (Ropotrectinib)\nTPX-0005 (Ropotrectinib) is a potent and orally bioavailable small molecule kinase inhibitor for ALK, ROS1, and TRK family. The clinical benefits of targeting ALK, ROS1, or TRK fusion kinase have been demonstrated with crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib, already approved for the treatment of ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), crizotinib for ROS1+ NSCLC, and larotrectinib and entrectinib in clinical studies for TRK+ cancers. However, the successes of these therapies are overshadowed by the development of acquired resistance. The acquired solvent front mutations including ALK G1202R, ROS1 G2032R, TRKA G595R and TRKC G623R render a common clinical resistance to the current ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors. TPX-0005 (Ropotrectinib) is a potent kinase inhibitor against wildtype and mutated ALK, ROS1 and TRK family kinases, especially the clinically significant solvent front mutations, gatekeeper mutations, and emerging compound mutations after multiple line treatments. Ropotrectinib will provide new opportunities in the clinic to inhibit the abnormal signaling of ALK, ROS1, or TRK family in solid malignancies, and overcome multiple resistance mechanisms from the refractory patients. TPX-0005 (Ropotrectinib) is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, first-in-human study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring ALK, ROS1, or NTRK1-3 rearrangements (TRIDENT-1, NCT03093116 ). For additional information about TPX-0005 (Ropotrectinib) trial, please refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov . Interested patients and physicians can also contact the TP Therapeutics Oncology Clinical Trial Hotline at 1-858-276-0005 or email clinical@tptherapeutics.com .\nAbout TP Therapeutics, Inc.\nTP Therapeutics, Inc. (TP) is a clinical-stage structure-based drug design company founded in October 2013 by Dr. J. Jean Cui, the lead inventor of Pfizer’s oncology drug crizotinib and lorlatinib. TP Team is focusing on the design and development of novel chemical entities for established oncogene drivers with high incidence of secondary resistance mutations, newly identified disease-driven targets, and potential targets regulating tumor microenvironment and tumor immunity.
