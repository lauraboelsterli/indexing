    "text": "A massive deficit will be President Donald Trump 's legacy, financial strategists are warning as the U.S. budget is expected to rise to accommodate the government's spending plan.\n\"My view is that this fiscal expansion is probably the most foolhardy escapade in modern economic policy history,\" Albert Edwards, an ultra-bearish global strategist at Societe Generale, said in a client note Wednesday.\nWhile agreeing that he felt U.S. corporate taxes were anomalously high, Edwards criticized the timing of the fiscal stimulus as \"utterly ridiculous\" and warns it \"will only accelerate the collapse of U.S. financial markets as the Federal Reserve hikes rates even more quickly.\"\nWith the current growth picture in the U.S. — unemployment at a 17-year low and wages and company earnings steadily strengthening — a double-dose of fiscal stimulus is the last thing that is needed and threatens to seriously overheat the economy, numerous analysts and politicians are saying.\nThe Trump administration's proposed $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, $200 billion of which is to be provided by the federal government, comes on top of a recently-passed spending budget of $300 billion over the next two years. That stimulus is in addition to the Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December, which is estimated to deliver $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over next decade. And interest payments will add $420 billion to the national debt over that same time frame, pushing the deficit above $2 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. The current budget deficit is $440 billion.\nGetty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with state and local officials to unveil his administration's long-awaited infrastructure plan in the State Dining Room at the White House February 12, 2018 in Washington, DC. Together, this is slated to expand the deficit by more than 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of this year, according to some estimates. While likely to spur economic growth and activity in the immediate term, the spending and borrowing expansion could also foreshadow a significant uptick in inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve may therefore have to step on the gas just to counter all this fiscal stimulus and issuance of new debt, and as a result Treasury bond yields and rates could rise, risking a further fall for equities. Markets plummeted at the start of last week and entered correction mode on the back of spiked yields and stronger-than-expected U.S. wage and employment data . Companies experience higher borrowing costs when yields rise and investors grow more cautious of investing in their stock.\nInflation data posted Wednesday came out at 0.5 percent for January, up from a previous 0.4 percent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was higher on Thursday morning at around 2.962 percent.\nshow chapters ",
