    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 6:26 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Rugby-Scotland's McGuigan ruled out of France clash with injury Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nEDINBURGH, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Scotland wing Byron McGuigan has been ruled out of this Sunday’s Six Nations clash against France at Murrayfield with a hamstring injury, Scottish Rugby has said. \nMcGuigan, 28, sustained the injury in the second half of Saturday’s 34-7 loss to Wales in Cardiff on Saturday and has returned to his club, Sale Sharks, for rehabilitation. \nScotland also confirmed lock Richie Gray (calf) and centre Duncan Taylor (head) have not recovered sufficiently to join the squad ahead of the clash against the French. They could play later in the championship. \nScotland have been hit by injuries going into the Six Nations but were still expected to make a good start to their Six Nations campaign after showing strong form in their November internationals, including beating Australia 53-24.
