    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 6:45 AM / in 10 hours Quake-hit Taiwan city winds down rescue efforts, five still missing Fabian Hamacher , Natalie Thomas 3 Min Read \nHUALIEN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Rescue operations in Taiwan started to wind down on Friday after a devastating 6.4-magnitude earthquake rocked the tourist area of Hualien this week, taking a toll of 12 dead and five missing. \nMore than 270 people were injured when Tuesday’s quake hit the eastern coastal city just before midnight, toppling four buildings, ripping large fissures in roads and unleashing panic among the roughly 100,000 residents. \nMore than 200 aftershocks followed, hampering a round-the-clock rescue effort in which emergency personnel battled rain and cold to comb rubble in a search for survivors. \nEfforts on Friday narrowed to finding five Chinese nationals still missing after rescuers pulled two bodies, identified as Canadian citizens from Hong Kong, out of a 12-storey residential building that had been left tilting at a 45-degree angle. \nAuthorities said they would focus their search on the single building where the five missing were believed to be. \n“The military will continue to prioritize today rescuing the missing people in the Yun Men Tsui Ti residential building,” it said in a statement. \nThe building’s extreme displacement made the search tough, the government said in a statement, adding, “The space for our operations is small, so the progress of search and rescue can be slow.” Rescuers search for survivors inside a building in Hualien, Taiwan February 8, 2018 in this image obtained from social media. Fire Bureau of Taichung City via REUTERS \nPower was restored to all affected areas in Hualien, although 8,500 homes are still without water. \nThe military will work with local government officials to develop a plan to demolish a hotel, a residential building and other dangerous buildings, it said in its statement. \nThe government vowed to redouble efforts to revise building regulations, aiming to limit damage in any future episodes. Slideshow (10 Images) \nTaiwan revised its building act on Jan. 30 to strengthen investigations of the structures of existing buildings and inspection of completed projects, the interior ministry said on Friday. \nThe revision, expected to be discussed by a cabinet meeting at the end of February, would also seek third-party views in building assessments, it said. \nThe government added that it would hasten reconstruction of old buildings to make them earthquake-resistant and work to boost the safety of other structures in affected areas. \n“At every stage, the central government will fully assist local governments,” it added. \nGraphic: The earthquake in Taiwan's tourist area of Hualien - tmsnrt.rs/2BJCdQ2 Additional reporting by Tyrone Siu; Writing by Jess Macy Yu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Clarence Fernandez",
