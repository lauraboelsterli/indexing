    "text": "ALPHARETTA, Ga., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Halyard Health, Inc. (NYSE: HYH) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.\n\"2017 was a strong year and I'm proud of our team's execution and accomplishments. Momentum in our Medical Device business continued as we accelerated our growth, increased the number of product launches and delivered earnings ahead of plan,\" said Joe Woody, Halyard chief executive officer. \"With the divestiture of S&IP on track to close in early second quarter and our playbook for growth, we are well positioned to succeed in 2018. I'm confident about our outlook, and through strategic investments in product innovation, commercial excellence, and M&A we expect to be well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\"\n2017 Financial Highlights\nFourth quarter continuing operations, or Medical Device sales, were $166 million, an 8 percent increase from the prior year. For the year, sales were $612 million, an 8 percent increase from 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter was $33 million, compared to $10 million in the prior year. Additionally, Medical Device operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 17 percent to $39 million. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share totaled $0.69, compared to $0.21 a year ago. 2017 diluted earnings per share were $1.69, compared to $0.85 a year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.73, up 43 percent compared to the prior year. For the full year, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.35, up 18 percent from a year ago. For the year EBITDA was $183 million compared to $153 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year increased 7 percent to $226 million, compared to $211 million a year ago.\nOperational and Business Highlights\nAccelerated transformation into a pure-play Medical Device business through the announced sale of Surgical and Infection Prevention (S&IP) - the transaction remains on track to close in early second quarter. Continued to invest in the R&D team and capabilities with nine new Medical Device products launched, finishing the year ahead of plan. Focused on establishing an enhanced organizational structure for a pure-play Medical Device business, strengthening the leadership team, including recent appointment of John Tushar, as President - Global Franchises.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results From Continuing Operations\nMedical Device net sales totaled $166 million, an 8 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter last year. Performance was driven by solid demand across all product categories as volumes increased 9 percent, which was partially offset by 1 percent lower selling prices.\nOperating loss was $3 million compared to a loss of $30 million in 2016. Volume growth and lower expenses related to excluded items helped drive performance. On an adjusted basis, operating profit was $7 million compared to a loss of $11 million in 2016.\nAs a result of the previously announced divestiture, the S&IP segment operating results are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Treating S&IP as discontinued operations results in significant shared overhead costs previously allocated to the S&IP business that are now included in continuing operations. Included in fourth quarter continuing operations are costs previously allocated to S&IP of $30 million in 2017 and $33 million in 2016.\nAdjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter excludes $5 million of restructuring charges, $2 million for acquisition-related charges, $3 million for litigation matters and $5 million of intangible amortization expense, offset by $6 million for a change in internal policies, as the company begins the process of re-aligning its policies post-divestiture.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding divestiture-related charges, restructuring charges, acquisition-related charges, policy changes and litigation expenses was $64 million, compared to $51 million in the prior year.\nFull-Year 2017 Results From Continuing Operations\nMedical Device net sales totaled $612 million, an 8 percent increase compared to 2016. Organic sales volumes increased 5 percent and Corpak-related sales contributed an additional 3 percent of volume growth. Performance was driven by solid demand across all four product categories.\nOperating loss was $43 million, compared to a loss of $107 million in 2016. Performance was impacted by higher volume and lower expenses related to excluded items.\nShared overhead costs previously allocated to S&IP now included in continuing operations were $116 million in 2017 and $114 million in 2016.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nCash from operations less capital expenditures, or free cash flow, for the quarter was $52 million compared to $38 million a year ago. For the year, free cash flow was $101 million compared to $160 million in the prior year. The decrease in 2017 was due primarily to higher capital spending and a lower year-over-year working capital benefit. At year-end 2017, the company's cash balance was $220 million.\nDiscontinued Operations\nFourth quarter net sales from discontinued operations were $262 million, a 2 percent increase, compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Two percent volume growth was driven by continued strong demand for exam gloves and an increase in facial protection due to the cold and flu season. Volume growth was partially offset by 1 percent lower selling prices, concentrated in exam gloves. Adjusted net income for the quarter totaled $35 million, even compared to the prior year.\nFor the year, net sales of $1,013 million were 1 percent lower compared to 2016, on a constant currency basis. One percent volume growth was offset by 2 percent lower selling prices. Adjusted net income for 2017 was $122 million, compared to $128 million in the prior year.\n2018 Key Planning Assumptions\nThe company expects to provide its 2018 financial outlook following the close of the Owens & Minor S&IP transaction. The formal closing activities are expected to occur in early second quarter.\nThe company provided the following key planning assumptions for continuing operations:\nMedical Device sales are expected to increase 4 to 6 percent, on a constant currency basis. We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be even compared to the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate is anticipated to be between 25 and 27 percent, as the company anticipates the new U.S. tax regulations will have a positive impact on its adjusted effective tax rate. Net dis-synergies from the S&IP divestiture are expected to range between $15 to $20 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:\nAdjusted net income Adjusted diluted earnings per share Adjusted gross and operating profit Adjusted effective tax rate Adjusted EBITDA Free cash flow\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items, as applicable, for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:\nExpenses associated with the divestiture of the S&IP business and the corporate restructuring costs. Transition costs relating to the separation from Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which include costs to establish Halyard Health's capabilities as a stand-alone entity. These costs are related primarily to rebranding and other supply chain transition costs. Going forward, these costs are not expected to be material; therefore, they will no longer be excluded from adjusted earnings. Expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets associated with prior business acquisitions. The positive or negative effect of changes in currency exchange rates during the year. Expenses associated with certain litigation matters. Certain acquisition and integration charges related to the acquisition of CORPAK MedSystems, Inc. Going forward, these costs are not expected to be material; therefore, they will no longer be excluded from adjusted earnings. Prior periods impact of tax regulatory changes. Charges of gain associated with policy changes.\nThe company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use net sales on a constant currency basis, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted operating profit, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.\nAdditionally, the Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors will use certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's net sales on a constant currency basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, which will be determined by excluding certain items that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the attached financial tables.\nConference Call Webcast\nHalyard Health, Inc. will host a conference call today at 9 a.m. ET.
