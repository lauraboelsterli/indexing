    "text": "MUMBAI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - India’s Punjab National Bank said on Wednesday it had detected “fraudulent and unauthorised” transactions worth about $1.77 billion at one of its branches in Mumbai.\nThe bank said in a statement the transactions were “for the benefit of a few select account holders with their apparent connivance” and that “based on these transactions other banks appear to have advanced money to these customers abroad.”\nThe bank did not name the people involved but said it had reported the deals to law enforcement agencies and would decide whether it faces any liability arising out of the transactions later.\nPNB shares fell as much as 5.7 percent in early trading on Wednesday.
