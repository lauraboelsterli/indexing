    "text": "CHELMSFORD, Mass., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brooks Automation, Inc. (Nasdaq:BRKS), a leading worldwide provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple markets including semiconductor manufacturing and life sciences, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018, ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal First Quarter of 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights:\nRevenue was $189 million, 4% higher compared to 2017 Q4 and 18% higher compared to 2017 Q1; Life Sciences segment revenue was $47 million, 8% higher compared to 2017 Q4 and 42% higher compared to 2017 Q1; Semiconductor Solutions Group segment revenue was $142 million, 3% higher compared to 2017 Q4 and 12% higher compared to 2017 Q1; GAAP Net Income was $16 million with diluted EPS of $0.23; Non-GAAP Net Income was $23 million with diluted EPS of $0.32; and Cash flow from operations was $3 million.\nSummary of GAAP and Non-GAAP Earnings Quarter Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, Dollars in thousands, except per share data 2017 2017 2016 GAAP net income $ 16,486 $ 17,386 $ 13,871 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.23 $ 0.25 $ 0.20 Non-GAAP net income $ 22,503 $ 24,522 $ 17,301 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.32 $ 0.35 $ 0.25 A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most nearly comparable GAAP measures follows the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows included in this release.\nManagement Comments\n“The results in the first quarter of our 2018 fiscal year continue to demonstrate the momentum we have in two very strong markets,” commented Steve Schwartz, CEO of Brooks Automation. “Our Semiconductor Solutions Group delivered at the high end of our expectations in both revenue and gross margin, producing 19% margin at the segment operating income line. And the Life Sciences segment provided another quarter of exceptional year-over-year revenue growth of 42%, including 22% organic growth plus the benefits of our recent strategic acquisitions. Even amid the strong semiconductor business results, Life Sciences has now grown to be 25% of total revenue.”\nGAAP Summary\nRevenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 4% to $189 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in the Brooks Life Sciences segment and a 3% increase in the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment. Gross margin was 39.7%, down 120 basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating expenses of $54 million decreased 5%, or $3 million, from the previous quarter due to lower SG&A primarily driven by less variable compensation and M&A expenses. There were no restructuring costs in the first quarter, as compared to $0.6 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. Income tax expense totaled $3 million, which is $0.6 million higher than the fourth quarter and included $0.7 million of a tax benefit related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). GAAP net income in the quarter was $16 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.23.\nThe amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, impact of purchase price accounting adjustments, charges related to M&A and special charges are appropriately included in the GAAP summary of earnings discussed above. The impact on earnings of such non-GAAP adjustments is referenced in the unaudited table included within this press release.\nIn the following analysis of the non-GAAP results, Brooks adjusted the GAAP results for the impact of amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, purchase price accounting adjustments and charges related to M&A to provide investors better perspective on the results of operations, which the Company believes is more comparable to the similar analysis provided by its peers. Brooks also excludes special charges or gains, such as impairment losses, gains or losses from the sale of assets, as well as other gains and charges that are assessed to not be representative of the normal operations of the business. Brooks currently includes a valuation allowance reserve against U.S. deferred tax assets in its GAAP results. In assessing the appropriate tax rate for the non-GAAP results, the Company evaluated the adjustments discussed above and concluded it was appropriate to maintain the valuation allowance reserve in deriving the non-GAAP tax rate. Tax Reform may affect the need for the valuation allowance, which remains under review at this time.\nResults of Q1 Fiscal 2018 (Non-GAAP Discussion)\nNon-GAAP net income was $23 million in the first quarter, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $25 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and non-GAAP net income of $17 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported a 9% expansion of non-GAAP operating income on 4% revenue growth, compared to the fourth quarter. Higher non-operating expenses offset the progress in operating income. The introduction of interest expense on debt, increased foreign exchange losses, and a higher income tax rate drove a lower net income result compared to the fourth quarter.\nAs noted above, revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 was $189 million, up 4% compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. The Life Sciences segment revenue grew $3.5 million, or 8%, sequentially to $47 million including the impact of 4titude Ltd., acquired on October 5, 2017. The Life Sciences segment revenue increased 42% year-over-year in total and 22% on an organic basis. The Semiconductor Solutions segment revenue was higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter by $4 million, or 3%, at $142 million.\nAdjusted gross margin, which excludes amortization, purchase accounting impacts and special charges, was 40.8% in the first quarter, down 50 basis points from the prior quarter. The Semiconductor Solutions segment non-GAAP adjusted gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter, which was flat with last quarter’s results and 590 basis points higher than the first fiscal quarter of 2017. The Life Sciences segment non-GAAP adjusted gross margin was 36.5% in the first quarter, 170 basis points lower compared to the fourth quarter and 80 basis points higher than the first fiscal quarter of 2017. Sequentially, the Life Sciences segment reported 160 basis points higher gross margins in the core systems business, which was offset by lower margins in storage services driven by a high mix of genomic services. In summary, the total non-GAAP adjusted gross profit increased by $2 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by an $7 million revenue increase across the segments, stable gross margins in Semiconductor Solutions Group and lower gross margins in the Life Sciences segment.\nBookings for the Semiconductor Solutions segment in the first quarter totaled $166 million, compared to $142 million in the fourth quarter. The Life Sciences segment booked a total of $59 million of new contract value in the first quarter, compared to $35 million in the fourth quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating expense of $49 million was flat compared to the prior quarter. Variable compensation expenses declined $2.1 million while the Life Sciences segment saw other SG&A spending increase primarily due to the acquisition of 4titude and additional hiring.\nAdjusted income from operations in the first quarter was $28 million, increasing 9% compared to the fourth quarter and 52% compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2017. The primary driver of growth was the Semiconductor Solutions segment, which recorded $27 million in non-GAAP operating profit, which was 19.0% of revenue. This result in Semiconductor Solutions was $3 million higher operating income and 170 basis points improvement of operating margins, compared to the fourth quarter. The Life Sciences segment reported non-GAAP operating profit of $1.4 million, which was 2.9% of revenue. This Life Science result was $1.0 million lower compared to the fourth quarter.\nNon-Operating expenses included net interest expense of $2.0 million for the quarter driven by the establishment of a debt instrument on October 4, 2017. The Company also incurred $1.7 million of other non-operating expenses compared to an income of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of this expense was foreign exchange losses of $2.0 million in the first quarter compared to $0.6 million of losses in the fourth quarter. Joint venture earnings provided $2.2 million of income net of tax in the first quarter, which was $0.1 million higher than the fourth quarter.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 15%, compared to 13% in the fourth quarter. The tax provision in the first quarter was $4 million, which increased $0.6 million compared to the fourth quarter.\nCash flow from operations was $3 million in the first quarter bringing the total of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities to $232 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $104 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Impacting cash on the balance sheet was the Company’s acquisition of 4titude, Ltd. for $65 million net of cash acquired, which closed on October 5, 2017. This was more than offset by $198 million in proceeds from the Company’s term loan credit facility initiated on October 4, 2017.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Company additionally announced that the Board of Directors has reiterated a dividend of $0.10 per share payable on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 2, 2018. Future dividend declarations, as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends, are subject to the final determination of the Company's Board of Directors.\nGuidance for Fiscal Second Quarter 2018\nThe Company announced revenue and earnings guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $195 million to $205 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.41. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.32, reflecting the impact of amortization, purchase price accounting and anticipated restructuring charges.\nConference Call\nBrooks management will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
