    "text": "Financial results above previously announced estimates\nCALABASAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- On Assignment, Inc. (NYSE: ASGN), a leading global provider of diversified professional staffing solutions, today reported results for the quarter and full\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nRevenues were $679.1 million, up 9.4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016 (up 8.6 percent year-over-year excluding the revenue contribution from Stratacuity, which was acquired in August 2017). Net income of $67.3 million ($1.28 per diluted share), was up from $24.0 million ($0.45 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income included a one-time, non-cash benefit of $31.4 million ($0.59 per diluted share) from the reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Cash flows from operating activities were $58.3 million for the quarter and $196.4 million for the full year 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $82.9 million (12.2 percent of revenues), up from $70.7 million (11.4 percent of revenues) in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company paid down $35.5 million of debt during the quarter and the leverage ratio (a non-GAAP measure) at December 31, 2017 was 1.89 to 1, down from 2.08 to 1 at September 30, 2017. Through December 31, 2017, On Assignment had repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for $101.2 million, at an average per share price of $42.81 under its $150 million stock repurchase program. On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire ECS Federal, LLC (\"ECS\") for approximately $775.0 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close on April 2, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nPeter Dameris, Chief Executive Officer of On Assignment, Inc., said, \"We are pleased with our operating and financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. We continued to grow well above the stated growth rate for our industry reflecting the continued deepening of customer relationships, the increasing rate of adoption of our delivery model and the successful expansion of our statement of work business. Over the past year we generated $172.2 million in free cash flow, which we used, among other things, to repurchase our common stock, pay down debt and fund the acquisition of Stratacuity.\"\nDameris continued, \"We are well positioned going into 2018. Our previously announced acquisition of ECS will strengthen our position as one of the largest and fasting growing IT services firms in North America and increase our addressable end market to $279 billion by virtue of our entering the $129 billion Government Services space.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues were $679.1 million, up 9.4 percent year-over-year (8.6 percent excluding the $4.5 million revenue contribution from Stratacuity, which was acquired in August 2017). The combined net effects of \"Same Billable Days\" and \"Constant Currency\" basis, were not material. Our largest segment, Apex, accounted for 78.7 percent of total revenues and grew 12.3 percent year-over-year. Our Oxford Segment accounted for 21.3 percent of total revenues and was down 0.3 percent year-over-year.\nGross profit was $220.7 million, up $22.5 million or 11.3 percent year-over-year. Gross margin was 32.5 percent, up from 31.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $151.4 million (22.3 percent of revenues), compared with $142.6 million (23.0 percent of revenues) in the fourth quarter of 2016. SG&A expenses for the quarter included acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses of $0.9 million, compared with $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $8.4 million, compared with $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease is due to the accelerated amortization method for certain acquired intangibles, which have higher amortization rates at the beginning of their useful life.\nInterest expense was $6.0 million compared with $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was comprised of $5.1 million of interest on the credit facility and $0.9 million of amortization of deferred loan costs. The decrease in interest expense reflected a lower debt balance and a lower interest rate as a result of the amendments to our credit facility.\nAs a result of a one-time, non-cash income tax benefit of $31.4 million mainly relating to the reduction of net deferred income tax liabilities and accrual of the transitional tax on the deemed dividend of foreign earnings both as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), we reported an income tax benefit of $12.6 million for the quarter. Excluding the one-time benefit of $31.4 million, our income tax provision was approximately $18.8 million for the quarter, an effective tax rate of 34.3 percent. This rate included $2.5 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nNet income was $67.3 million ($1.28 per diluted share), compared with $24.0 million ($0.45 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $82.9 million, or 12.2 percent of revenues, up from $70.7 million (11.4 percent of revenues) in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash flows from operating activities were $58.3 million and free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $52.0 million. At December 31, 2017, our leverage ratio (a non-GAAP measure) was 1.89 to 1, down from 2.08 to 1 at September 30, 2017.\nFinancial Estimates for Q1 2018 for On Assignment\nOn Assignment is providing financial estimates for the first quarter of 2018. These estimates do not include acquisition, integration or strategic planning expenses (other than $10.0 million in estimated acquisition costs and expenses related to the pending acquisition of ECS) and assume no deterioration in the markets that On Assignment serves. These estimates also assume no significant change in foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations of estimated net income to the estimated non-GAAP measures are presented herein. These estimates do not include any operating results of ECS.\nRevenues of $672.0 million to $682.0 million Gross margin of 31.5 percent to 31.8 percent SG&A expense (excludes amortization of intangible assets) of $164.7 million to $166.9 million (includes $6.5 million in depreciation, $5.6 million in stock-based compensation expense and $10.0 million in acquisition expenses related to the pending acquisition of ECS) Amortization of intangible assets of $7.6 million Interest expense of $6.2 million (including amortization of deferred loan costs of $0.9 million) Effective tax rate of 26.5 percent Net income of $24.4 million to $26.6 million Earnings per diluted share of $0.46 to $0.50 Diluted shares outstanding of 52.8 million Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $69.0 million to $72.0 million Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) 1 of $39.0 million to $41.2 million Adjusted Net Income per diluted share 1 (a non-GAAP measure) of $0.74 to $0.78\n(1)\nDoes not include the “Cash Tax Savings on Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.” These savings total $4.6 million each quarter, or $0.09 per diluted share, and represent the economic value of the tax deduction that we receive from the amortization of goodwill and trademarks.\nConsistent with past practice, our financial estimates above are based on our estimate of “Billable Days” which are Business Days (calendar days for the period less weekends and holidays) adjusted for other factors, such as the day of the week a holiday occurs, additional time taken off around holidays, year-end client furloughs and inclement weather. For the first quarter, we estimate billable days of 62.8, which is 0.25 fewer days than the first quarter of 2017. Each \"Billable Day\" is approximately $10.8 million in revenues. On a same \"Billable Days\" basis, our implied year-over-year revenue growth rate for the first quarter ranges from 7.6 to 9.2 percent.\nThe above estimates also include the effects of the payroll tax reset, which occurs at the beginning of each year. These annual resets cause, among other things, lower gross and Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter of the year.\nOn Assignment to Acquire ECS Federal, LLC\nAs announced on January 31, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ECS for $775 million in cash. ECS is one of the largest privately-held government services contractors and delivers cyber security, cloud, DevOps, IT modernization and advanced science and engineering solutions to government enterprises. The transaction is subject to various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to close on April 2, 2018.\nOn Assignment is providing preliminary financial estimates for ECS, on a stand alone basis, for the full year 2018, as follows:\nRevenues of $620.0 million to $640.0 million Operating costs and expenses (includes costs of services and excludes amortization of intangible assets) of $567.3 million to $583.9 million (includes $14.1 million in depreciation and $3.3 million in stock-based compensation expense) Amortization of intangible assets of $42.0 million to $45.0 million (based on a preliminary estimate of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and their related service lives, which are subject to change during the open one-year measurement period) Interest expense of $33.6 million on new term B loan to fund the purchase of ECS (including amortization of deferred loan costs of $2.4 million) Effective tax rate of 26.5 percent Net loss of $19.0 million to $14.3 million Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $70.0 million to $73.5 million Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) 1 of $26.0 million to $27.7 million\n(1)\nDoes not include the “Cash Tax Savings on Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.” These savings are estimated to be approximately $9.0 million annually over 15 years and represent the economic value of the tax deduction that we receive from the amortization of goodwill and trademarks.\nThe above estimates assume no deterioration in current operating and market trends. Reconciliations of estimated net income to the estimated non-GAAP measures are presented herein. Operating results of ECS will be included in the 2018 consolidated operating results of On Assignment from the date of acquisition (currently expected to occur on April 2, 2018) through December 31, 2018.\nThe preliminary financial estimates for ECS include, among other things, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on the debt to fund the acquisition and the estimated provision (benefit) for income taxes as if the acquisition of ECS occurred at the beginning of 2018. These estimates do not include any transaction costs related to the pending acquisition. The estimated amortization of intangible assets is based on a preliminary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and their related service lives, both of which are subject to change within the one-year measurement period.\nConference Call\nOn Assignment will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. EST to review its financial results for the fourth quarter.

Such information is provided as additional information, not as an alternative to our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), and is intended to enhance an overall understanding of our current financial performance. These terms might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Below is a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures.\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets) and Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense and, as applicable, write-off of loan costs, acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses, and impairment charges) are used to determine a portion of the compensation for some of our executives and employees. Stock-based compensation expense is added to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA because it is a non-cash expense. Write-off of loan costs, acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses, and impairment charges are added, as applicable, to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA as they are not indicative of the performance of our core business on an ongoing basis.\nNon-GAAP net income (net income, less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, plus, as applicable, refinancing costs, acquisition, integration and strategic planning expenses, accretion of fair value discount on contingent consideration, impairment charges, and the tax effect of these items) provides a method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our core business on an ongoing basis. Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP net income plus amortization of intangible assets, less income taxes on amortization for financial reporting purposes not deductible for income tax purposes) provides a method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our core business on an ongoing basis, adjusted for some of the cash flows associated with amortization of intangible assets to more fully present the performance of our acquisitions.\nConstant currency information removes the effect of year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Constant currency information is calculated using the foreign currency exchange rates from the same period in the prior year.\nBillable Days are Business Days (calendar days for the period less weekends and holidays) adjusted for other factors, such as the day of the week a holiday occurs, additional time taken off around holidays, year-end client furloughs and inclement weather. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billable days, revenues on a Same Billable Days basis are calculated by taking the current period average revenue per billable day, multiplied by the number of billable days from the same period in the prior year.\nThe term Same Billable Days and Constant Currency basis means that the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been removed from Same Billable Days basis calculation.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures. Management believes this provides useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities. Our leverage ratio provides information about our compliance with loan covenants and is calculated in accordance with our credit agreement, as filed with the Commission (\"SEC\"), by dividing our total indebtedness by trailing 12 months Adjusted EBITDA.\nReasons for Presentation of Operating Metrics\nOperating metrics are intended to enhance the overall understanding of our business and our current financial performance. These operating metrics might not be calculated in the same manner as, and thus might not be comparable to, similarly titled metrics reported by other companies. The operating metrics presented on this release are calculated as follows: average number of staffing consultants are full time equivalent staffing consultant headcount in the quarter; average number of contract professionals and average number of customers are the number of contract professionals employed each week and the number of customers served each week, averaged for the quarter, respectively (average is weighted by total number of hours billed per week); top 10 customers as a percentage of revenue are the 10 largest clients defined by the revenue generated in the quarter, divided by total revenues in the quarter; gross profit per staffing consultant is gross profit for the quarter divided by the average number of staffing consultants; average bill rate is total assignment revenue client billings in the quarter divided by total hours billed in the quarter.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements made in this news release are “ ” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Forward looking statements include statements regarding the Company's anticipated financial and operating performance.\nAll statements in this release, other than those setting forth strictly historical information, are . Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results might differ materially. The Company makes no assurances that the estimates of revenues, gross margin, SG&A, amortization, effective tax rate, net income, diluted shares outstanding, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and related per share amounts (as applicable) set forth above will be achieved. Further, the Company makes no assurances or guarantees: i) that the announced transaction with ECS Federal, LLC will receive regulatory approval or occur; ii) that the assumptions made in determining the value of the transaction will be realized; iii) that the Company will be able to finance the potential transaction; or iv) that 2018 preliminary financial estimates for ECS will be realized. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include actual demand for our services, our ability to attract, train and retain qualified staffing consultants, our ability to remain competitive in obtaining and retaining clients, the availability of qualified contract professionals, management of our growth, continued performance and improvement of our enterprise-wide information systems, our ability to manage our litigation matters, the successful integration of our acquired subsidiaries, the successful implementation of our five-year strategic plan, and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC, including our for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.

These estimates assume no deterioration in current operating and market trends. Operating results of ECS will be included in the 2018 consolidated operating results of On Assignment from the date of acquisition (currently expected to occur on April 2, 2018) through December 31, 2018.\nThe preliminary financial estimates for ECS include, among other things, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on the debt to fund the acquisition and the estimated provision (benefit) for income taxes as if the acquisition of ECS occurred at the beginning of 2018. These estimates do not include any transaction costs related to the pending acquisition. The estimated amortization of intangible assets is based on a preliminary estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and their related service lives, both of which are subject to change within the one-year measurement period.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214006378/en/\nOn Assignment, Inc.\nEd Pierce\nChief Financial Officer\n(818) 878-7900\nSource: On Assignment, Inc.",
