Reported net loss from continuing operations of $272 million compared to fourth-quarter 2016 reported net loss from continuing operations of $3,333 million.

We enter 2018 leaner and better positioned for the future, and the year has already been marked by a pivotal event. Earlier this month, we began our Phase 3 clinical trials of CCH for the treatment of cellulite. We view this as a major milestone for a new and important potential growth driver for our Company.\"\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nTotal Revenues\n$\n768,640\n$\n1,241,513\n(38)\n%\n$\n3,468,858\n$\n4,010,274\n(14)\n%\nReported Loss from Continuing\nOperations\n$\n(271,581)\n$\n(3,333,325)\n(92)\n%\n$\n(1,232,711)\n$\n(3,223,772)\n(62)\n%\nReported Diluted Weighted Average\nShares\n223,322\n222,870\n—\n%\n223,198\n222,651\n—\n%\nReported Diluted Loss per Share\nfrom Continuing Operations\n$\n(1.22)\n$\n(14.96)\n(92)\n%\n$\n(5.52)\n$\n(14.48)\n(62)\n%\nAdjusted Income from Continuing\nOperations\n$\n173,863\n$\n395,791\n(56)\n%\n$\n860,361\n$\n1,054,382\n(18)\n%\nAdjusted Diluted Weighted Average\nShares 1\n224,577\n223,178\n1\n%\n223,978\n223,090\n—\n%\nAdjusted Diluted EPS from\nContinuing Operations\n$\n0.77\n$\n1.77\n(56)\n%\n$\n3.84\n$\n4.73\n(19)\n%\n(1)\nDiluted per share data is computed based on weighted average shares outstanding and, if there is income from continuing operations during the period, the dilutive impact of share equivalents outstanding during the period. In the case of Adjusted Diluted Weighted Average Shares, Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations is used in determining whether to include such dilutive impact.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nTotal revenues decreased by 38 percent to $769 million in fourth-quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decline was primarily due to the loss of marketing exclusivity in the first half of 2017 for the first-to-file U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals products ezetimibe tablets, the generic version of ZETIA ® , and quetiapine extended-release (ER) tablets, the generic version of SEROQUEL XR ® , both of which launched in fourth-quarter 2016. Also contributing to the decline in total revenues were previously announced U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals product discontinuances, pricing pressure from increased competition primarily impacting the U.S. Generics Base business, the divestitures of Litha and Somar, as well as the cessation of OPANA ® ER shipments to customers by September 1, 2017.\nGAAP net loss from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2017 was $272 million compared to GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $3,333 million during the same period in 2016. This decrease included the impact of lower asset impairment charges and intangible asset amortization in fourth-quarter 2017. GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations for fourth-quarter 2017 was $1.22, compared to GAAP diluted net loss per share from continuing operations of $14.96 in fourth-quarter 2016.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2017 was $174 million compared to $396 million in fourth-quarter 2016. This decrease resulted primarily from lower revenues of ezetimibe tablets, quetiapine ER tablets, Base business generic products and OPANA ® ER as well as an increase in interest expense, mainly due to the refinancing of the Company's secured debt in April 2017, which enhanced operational flexibility and extended the Company's maturity schedule. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2017 was $0.77 compared to $1.77 in fourth-quarter 2016.\nU.S. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS\nDuring fourth-quarter 2017, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment launched six products and submitted two regulatory filings. In 2017, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment launched 17 new generic products and the Company made 12 regulatory submissions. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 100 Abbreviated New Drug Applications pending with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nFourth-quarter 2017 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals results include:\nRevenues of $499 million, a 43 percent decrease compared to fourth-quarter 2016; this decline was primarily attributable to the loss of marketing exclusivity in the first half of 2017 for the first-to-file products ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets. Also contributing to the decline were previously announced product discontinuances and pricing pressure from increased competition primarily impacting the Base business. Sterile Injectables revenue increased 16 percent compared to fourth-quarter 2016; this increase was driven primarily by ADRENALIN ® . New Launches and Alternative Dosages revenue decreased 67 percent compared to fourth-quarter 2016; this decrease was driven primarily by the expiration of the marketing exclusivity periods for ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets. The U.S. Generics Base business revenues decreased 37 percent compared to fourth-quarter 2016; this decrease primarily resulted from the impact of 2016 and 2017 competitive events, previously announced product discontinuances and the continued impact of pricing due to consolidation among our trade accounts.\nU.S. BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS\nIn February 2018, Endo announced the initiation of two Phase 3 clinical trials of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (or \"CCH\") for the treatment of cellulite.\nFourth-quarter 2017 U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals results include:\nRevenues of $228 million, a 21 percent decrease compared to fourth-quarter 2016; this decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues of OPANA ® ER resulting from the cessation of product shipments by September 1, 2017 and generic competition adversely impacting the Company's Established Products portfolio. Specialty Products revenues increased 8 percent in fourth-quarter 2017 versus the same period in 2016, driven by strong performance from XIAFLEX ® and other products within our Specialty Products portfolio. Sales of XIAFLEX ® , our flagship Branded product, increased 10 percent compared to fourth-quarter 2016; this increase was primarily attributable to volume growth that was driven, in part, by a full year of direct-to-consumer initiatives intended to increase patient awareness of XIAFLEX ® as a possible treatment option for Dupuytren's Contracture and Peyronie's Disease.\nINTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS\nFourth-quarter 2017 International Pharmaceuticals revenues were $41 million, compared to $70 million in the same period in 2016. The decline is primarily attributable to the sale of the Company's South African Litha business to Acino Pharma AG, which closed on July 3, 2017, and the sale of the Company's Mexican Somar business to Advent International, which closed on October 25, 2017.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nFor the full twelve months ending December 31, 2018, at current exchange rates, Endo is providing guidance on revenue, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. The Company estimates:\nTotal revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion; Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to be between $2.15 and $2.55; and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.\nThe Company's 2018 non-GAAP financial guidance is based on the following assumptions:\nAdjusted gross margin of approximately 67.0% to 68.0%; Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues of approximately 25.5% to 26.5%; Adjusted interest expense of approximately $530 million to $540 million; Adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 11.0% to 12.0%; and Adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 226 million.\nBALANCE SHEET, LIQUIDITY AND OTHER UPDATES\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $987 million in unrestricted cash; debt of $8.3 billion; net debt of approximately $7.3 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6.\nFourth-quarter 2017 cash provided by operating activities was $132 million, compared to $84 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the comparable 2016 period. The 2016 period was impacted by higher payments related to U.S. mesh product liability claims.\nDuring fourth-quarter 2017, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of $130 million, $126 million of which related to in-process research and development and developed technology intangible assets in its U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment.\nIn addition, the Company recorded a total increase of approximately $200 million to its legal reserves relating to both LIDODERM ® antitrust matters and Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) product liability matters after determining that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The LIDODERM ® portion of the reserve increase includes an estimated loss for, among other matters, a settlement in principle of all remaining claims filed against the Company's subsidiary, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., in In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2521, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The TRT portion of the reserve increase includes an estimated loss for, among other matters, all testosterone-related product liability cases filed against the Company's subsidiaries in In Re Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation, MDL No. 2545, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and in other courts. In February 2018 the court in MDL No. 2545 entered a case management order reporting that the parties had entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding a potential global settlement and directing that all proceedings involving the Company's subsidiaries be temporarily stayed so that the parties may devote their efforts to finalizing a master settlement agreement.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nEndo will conduct a conference call with financial analysts to discuss this press release today at 7:30 a.m. ET.

2016 and to exclude decreases of excess inventory reserves recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily related to the 2016 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals Restructuring

Approximately $125 million was largely the result of market conditions impacting the recoverability of certain indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets in our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment. The remaining charges during the fourth quarter were related to plant, property and equipment impairments.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, we recorded total pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $95 million. Approximately $17 million was related to property, plant and equipment charges related to our previously announced restructuring initiatives and held-for-sale accounting for Somar. The remaining charges during the third quarter were largely the result of market conditions impacting the recoverability of certain indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets in our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segments.\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, we recorded total pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $725 million. We announced the 2017 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals Restructuring Initiative in July 2017, which includes the discontinuation of certain commercial products. As a result, we assessed the recoverability of the impacted products, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $58 million. We also recorded property, plant and equipment impairments related to this restructuring totaling $32 million. As a result of the decision to withdraw OPANA ® ER, we determined that the carrying amount of this intangible asset was no longer recoverable, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $21 million, representing the remaining carrying amount. As a result of the aforementioned actions related to OPANA ® ER and the continued erosion of its U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment's Established Products portfolio, we initiated an interim goodwill impairment analysis of our Branded reporting unit. We recorded a pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of $180 million for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the reporting unit's fair value. We entered into a definitive agreement to sell Somar on June 30, 2017, which resulted in Somar's assets and liabilities being classified as held for sale. The initiation of held-for-sale accounting, together with the agreed upon sale price, triggered an impairment review. Accordingly, we performed an impairment analysis using a market approach and determined that impairment charges were required. We recorded pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $26 million, $90 million and $10 million related to Somar's goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively. The remaining charges during the second quarter were largely the result of market conditions impacting the recoverability of certain indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets in our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals segments.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we recorded total pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $204 million. Pursuant to an existing agreement with Novartis AG, Endo's subsidiary, Paladin Labs Inc., licensed the Canadian rights to commercialize serelaxin, an investigational drug for the treatment of acute heart failure (AHF). On March 22, 2017, Novartis announced that a Phase III study of serelaxin in patients with AHF failed to meet its primary endpoints. As a result, Endo has concluded that its serelaxin in-process research and development intangible asset is fully impaired resulting in a $45 million non-cash impairment charge. As a result of the serelaxin intangible impairment, Endo assessed the recoverability of its Paladin goodwill balance and determined that the estimated fair value of the Paladin reporting unit was below its book value, resulting in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $83 million. The remaining charges were largely the result of certain market conditions impacting the recoverability of developed technology intangible assets in Endo's U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, in connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $2,343 million, $273 million, $33 million and $26 million for our U.S. Generics, Paladin, Somar and Litha reporting units, respectively. Additionally, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $830 million, including: (i) approximately $507 million and $285 million related our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals segments, respectively, resulting from certain market conditions, including price erosion and increased competition and (ii) $38 million related to our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment, resulting primarily from the termination of our BELBUCA™ product. As a result of unfavorable formulary changes and generic competition for sumatriptan, we experienced a downturn in the performance of our SUMAVEL ® DOSEPRO ® product, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $73 million during the third quarter of 2016. Also during the third quarter of 2016, we determined that we would not pursue commercialization of a product in certain international markets, resulting in a non-cash asset impairment charge of $16 million. As a result of the 2016 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals Restructuring Initiative, we recorded $100 million of non-cash impairment charges during the first quarter of 2016 resulting from the discontinuation of certain commercial products and the abandonment of certain IPR&D projects. The remaining charges during the first nine months of 2016 were largely the result of market and regulatory conditions impacting the recoverability certain indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets in our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment.\n(9)\nAdjustments for acquisition and integration items primarily relate to various acquisitions.

Adjusted income taxes include current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability.\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016, Endo recorded a discrete GAAP tax benefit of $636 million arising from outside basis differences generated as part of a legal entity restructuring. This benefit and the associated component of the 2016 U.S. federal return to provision adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2017 were excluded from our adjusted effective tax rate in accordance with the Company's non-GAAP accounting policy.\n(15)\nTo exclude the results of the businesses reported as discontinued operations, net of tax in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n(16)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) and Net (loss) income attributable to Endo International plc.\n(17)\nCalculated as Net (loss) income from continuing operations divided by the applicable weighted average share number.

These Non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted earnings per share amounts. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP adjusted net income from continuing operations and its components (unlike U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. However, the Company does not provide reconciliations of projected non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, nor does it provide comparable projected GAAP financial measures for such projected non-GAAP financial measures. The Company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that could be made for asset impairments, contingent consideration adjustments, legal settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, adjustments to inventory and other charges reflected in the reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which could be significant.\nSee Endo's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of Endo's non-GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Endo International plc\nEndo International plc (NASDAQ: ENDP) is a highly focused generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company delivering quality medicines to patients in need through excellence in development, manufacturing and commercialization.

Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Endo's performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Endo often does not know what the actual results will be until after the end of the applicable reporting period. Therefore, Endo will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Endo.\nAll forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Endo's current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Endo's judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Endo's businesses, including, among other things, the following: changing competitive, market and regulatory conditions; Endo's ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection for its intellectual property rights; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes, including regulatory decisions, product recalls, withdrawals and other unusual items; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms, including government pricing, tax and reimbursement policies; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction, and consumer and physician acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the results of any pending or future litigation, investigations or claims; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Endo's ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner. In addition, U.S. and international economic conditions, including higher unemployment, political instability, financial hardship, consumer confidence and debt levels, taxation, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, international relations, capital and credit availability, the status of financial markets and institutions, fluctuations or devaluations in the value of sovereign government debt, as well as the general impact of continued economic volatility, can materially affect Endo's results. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Endo expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required to do so by law.\nAdditional information concerning the above-referenced risk factors and other risk factors can be found in press releases issued by Endo, as well as Endo's public periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and with securities regulators in Canada, including the discussion under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Endo's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
