Many are feeling a growing pressure to differentiate themselves in the market,” Angela Pecoraro, CEO of Advicent, says. “The addition of John’s and Brian’s unique skill sets and technology leadership background, as well as an expanded product development team, demonstrates our commitment to a long-term platform modernization strategy and partner experience that will meet and exceed our customers’ needs in this competitive environment.”\nJohn Heinen named chief technology officer\nHeinen comes to Advicent with decades of software development and product management experience. Prior to Advicent, he held various leadership positions, including chief technology officer at GE Healthcare; chief technology officer and EVP at Informed Clinical Sciences Corporation; and most recently, SVP of preparedness solutions and SVP of product management at Intermedix.\nIn his role at Advicent, Heinen will leverage his accomplished leadership background to execute business and product strategies while also working with clients throughout the market to deliver technology solutions that yield results and meet regulatory requirements.\n“With the financial services industry rapidly increasing investments in technology, we must stay ahead of every new challenge and opportunity our partners face every day,” Heinen says. “We have the most trusted, robust, and comprehensive financial planning platform in the world, and I look forward to building upon that to serve the needs of our customers for years to come.”\nBrian Kutmas promoted to vice president of product development\nKutmas’ technical and leadership experience spans more than 15 years – primarily within the financial services industry. Prior to Advicent, Kutmas held roles including senior development manager at Fidelity National Information Services and vice president of business solutions at Associated Bank. He previously served as senior product director at Advicent, and in his new role as vice president of product development, he will now oversee the R&D and quality assurance teams along with the architecture and API strategy for the Advicent platform.\n“Advicent has a long-standing reputation as a pioneer in financial planning technology, and I intend to work with the organization to ensure we continue that legacy,” Kutmas says. “I look forward to leveraging my deep understanding of our technology platform to make an even larger impact with the Advicent team, our platform, and our partners in this expanded role.”\nInvestments throughout the organization\nWithin its product platform expansion and partner experience strategy, Advicent is investing in not only the leadership team but also the greater organization. The company is adding 20 new roles throughout the organization from product development to partner experience, including associate and senior software developers; quality assurance analysts; support specialists; and partner experience managers.\n“It is imperative that we continue to invest in our product and partner experience initiatives at every level of the company,” Pecoraro states. “At Advicent, we remained focused on attracting and retaining top talent throughout our team. The addition of these roles will help us continue to deliver industry-leading technology and provide a high-quality experience to our partners.”\nAbout Advicent\nAdvicent is the financial planning technology provider of choice for over 100,000 financial professionals within 4,000 clients worldwide, including three of the top five custodians, 15 of the top 25 broker-dealers, seven of the top 10 North American banks, and eight of the top 10 insurance firms.
