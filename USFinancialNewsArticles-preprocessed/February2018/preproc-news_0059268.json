    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CDTX), a biotechnology company developing novel anti-infectives including immunotherapies, today reported financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017, and provided an update on its corporate activities and product pipeline.\n“I am pleased to share Cidara’s progress during the fourth quarter of 2017 and subsequently. Our accomplishments included the completion of enrollment in our STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rezafungin in candidemia and invasive candidiasis, a successful financing and continued outreach to the medical and scientific communities,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara. “In the near term we are focused on the topline data read-out from the STRIVE study, which we expect by the end of the first quarter.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Subsequent Highlights\nCompleted enrollment in the STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rezafungin: In November 2017, the company announced the completion of patient enrollment in the STRIVE clinical trial, a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two regimens of once-weekly dosing of its lead antifungal candidate rezafungin acetate, formerly known as CD101 IV, compared to once-daily dosing of caspofungin in patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis. Rezafungin is a novel antifungal echinocandin and is the only once-weekly product candidate in development for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Cidara expects to announce topline data from the STRIVE study by the end of the first quarter.\nPresented data at the 8th Advances Against Aspergillosis (AAA) Conference and at the 2018 BMT Tandem Meetings: In January 2018, Cidara presented data highlighting the potential advantages of rezafungin for the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing bone marrow transplant or chemotherapy, at the 8th AAA Conference in Lisbon, Portugal, and at the 2018 BMT Tandem Meetings in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nAnnounced publication of insights into the future of echinocandin therapy for invasive fungal infections in Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy supplement: In January 2018, Cidara announced that a supplement to the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy was published, providing insight into the future of echinocandin therapy, including strategies for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections.\nSuccessfully completed private placement of common stock: In October 2017, Cidara announced the pricing of a private placement of 3,360,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $6.00 per share. The syndicate of investors in the private placement was comprised of both new and existing investors. The gross proceeds to Cidara from the private placement were approximately $20 million.\nPresented data at ID Week and Mycology infectious disease meetings highlighting the unique attributes of rezafungin: In October 2017, Cidara presented preclinical data in six presentations at ID Week 2017 in San Diego and at the 8 th Trends in Medical Mycology meeting in Belgrade. The data showcased the potential advantages of rezafungin, including: in vivo activity against emerging resistant organisms; high target attainment and exposure to treat less susceptible pathogens; superior tissue penetration compared to micafungin; and biofilm activity.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $75.3 million as of December 31, 2017, which includes net proceeds from the private placement completed in October 2017, compared with $64.2 million as of September 30, 2017 and $104.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of February 20, 2018, Cidara had 20,771,151 common shares outstanding.\nResearch and development expenses were $10.2 million and $42.8 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $11.3 million and $35.7 million for the same periods in 2016. The year over year increase was primarily attributable to the increase in clinical development activities for rezafungin.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.2 million and $12.9 million for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.0 million and $12.7 million for the same periods in 2016. The increase resulted primarily from personnel-related costs.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $13.4 million, compared to a net loss of $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the company’s net loss was $55.7 million and $48.2 million, respectively.\nAbout Cidara Therapeutics\nCidara is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing new anti-infectives that have the potential to transform the standard of care and save or improve patients’ lives. The company is currently advancing its novel echinocandin antifungal, rezafungin acetate, formerly called CD101 IV, through Phase 2 and developing its antibody-drug conjugates for the treatment of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. Rezafungin has improved pharmacokinetics compared to existing echinocandins and has the potential for expanded utility across patient settings. Rezafungin is the only once-weekly product candidate in development for the treatment and prevention of life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Cidara is developing its antibody-drug conjugates as part of its novel Cloudbreak™ platform, the first immunotherapy discovery platform designed specifically to create compounds that directly kill pathogens and also direct a patient’s immune cells to attack and eliminate bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens. Cidara is headquartered in San Diego, California.
