    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) (\"Qualcomm\") today shared with its stockholders an article published in the Competition Policy International by former senior antitrust enforcers and leading antitrust experts from China, Korea, the European Union, and the United States 1 (\"the experts\") on the significant antitrust risks posed by Broadcom's proposed takeover of Qualcomm. A copy of the article can be viewed here .\nThe takeaways from the article are:\nAny combination between Broadcom and Qualcomm faces significant antitrust risks due to their competitive positions in WiFi and RFFE products (among others), the potential complex and difficult divestiture process with regards to separating the businesses and finding an acceptable buyer, and the potential for anti-trust agencies demanding significant restrictions on Broadcom's post-merger licensing and distribution practices. There are countless examples of regulators imposing substantial conduct remedies and the real risk posed by these conduct remedies generally requires deal protection for the target and its shareholders – such as a \"hell-or-high-water clause\" – to ensure that \"a buyer cannot walk away from the deal at any point during or after a protracted regulatory review period, particularly given the likely disruption caused to targets (here, Qualcomm) during such a review period.\" Based on similar complex cross-border deals, the expected regulatory approval process is likely to take 18+ months and may require significant and material divestitures and/or conduct remedies. The proposed limitations on Qualcomm by Broadcom on how Qualcomm can operate its business during a potential regulatory review period likely violates antitrust \"gun-jumping\" rules, and could be subject to an investigation by the U.S. FTC.\nThe global experts who authored the article are as follows:\nSusan Creighton, Former Director, US Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Competition Miguel de la Mano, Former Deputy Chief Economist, DG Competition, EU Commission Professor Herbert Hovenkamp, James G. Dinan University Professor University of Pennsylvania Author of Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application Lisa Kimmel, Former Attorney Advisor to US Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez Professor Hwang Lee, Korean University School of Law, Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Policy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Member of the Research Counsel for the Justices of the Supreme Court of Korea, and former senior Korea Fair Trade Commission official Jim Rill, Former head of the US Department of Justice's Antitrust Division He Jing Senior Consultant, AnJie Law Firm (Beijing) and Advisor for Peking University School of IP and Tsinghua University School of Law Joshua Wright, Former Commissioner, US Federal Trade Commission Steve Weissman, Former Deputy Director, US Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Competition\nKey excerpts from the article include 2 :\nOverall, the experts concluded that:\n\"In short, there are material regulatory risks associated with any combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm. Given the parties' competitive positions in WiFi and RFFE products (among others), the complexity of complying with a divestiture demand because of the difficulty the parties will have separating these businesses and selling them to an acceptable buyer, and the real risk that agencies…may demand significant restrictions on Broadcom's post-merger licensing and distribution practices, the transaction presents significant antitrust risk.\"\nIn highlighting the areas shareholders should be aware of, the experts noted: \"Given [the merger agreement] terms, shareholders should be aware of the following:\n1) the real risk that foreign antitrust agencies will impose onerous remedies that either restrict the parties' ability to engage in certain conduct or require them to take specific actions;\n2) the prior actions of antitrust agencies in rejecting proposed divestiture buyers that do not have both the ability and incentive to compete with the combined entity on day 1 and to take the technologies to the next generation;\n3) that similar complex cross-border deals have taken 18+ months to gain regulatory approval, especially where—as here—approval is required by numerous jurisdictions (here, the United States, the European Union, China, India, Korea, and Taiwan); and\n4) the likelihood that Broadcom's proposed limitations on how Qualcomm can run its business from signing to close violate antitrust \"gun-jumping\" rules, which alone could be the subject of a separate investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and others.\"\nIn discussing the expected length of the regulatory review process, the experts stated: \"With respect to likely review timing, recent deals suggest that the regulatory approval process is likely to take 18+ months (see e.g., Qualcomm/NXP—15+ months and counting despite the lack of direct competition between the parties; Penn State Hershey/Pinnacle—abandoned by the parties in 2016 after a 28 month review period; Advocacy Health Care/NorthShore University Health System—abandoned in 2017 after a 30 month review period; Halliburton/Baker Hughes—abandoned in 2016 after a 19 month review period; DuPont/Dow Chemical and Abbott Laboratories/Alere—each taking 20 months to gain necessary approvals. Indeed, the recent proposed merger of the #1 and #3 global suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment was abandoned after an 18-month review period.\" In discussing conduct remedies and the deficiencies in Broadcom's proposal with respect to providing protection for shareholders, the experts stated: \"With respect to conduct remedies, there are countless examples showing that regulators can and do impose substantial conduct remedies, including those that could amount to an MAE [material adverse effect], and that may not be merger-specific…The real risk posed by these types of remedies generally requires deal protection for shareholders, including a \"hell-or-high-water clause\" (i.e., do whatever is necessary to get the deal done), or at least defining the MAE provision so as to exclude remedies that may be required by antitrust regulators. Such protections ensure that a buyer cannot walk away from the deal at any point during or after a protracted regulatory review period, particularly given the likely disruption caused to targets (here, Qualcomm) during such a review period.\" Finally, in discussing the potential divestiture process, the experts said: With respect to divestitures, antitrust agencies will require that any divestiture remedies fully replace the loss of Qualcomm's competitive pressure in the market, i.e., any remedy must make competition \"whole\" in the sense that it must put another competitor in a position to compete as effectively against Broadcom as Qualcomm does today (and likely into the future). And, of course, any divestiture transaction would itself have to be reviewed for antitrust and national security issues.\nBackgrounds on Authors\nSusan Creighton , is a Partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C.
