This information includes non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP recurring revenue gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP net income before provision for income taxes. CallidusCloud uses non-GAAP measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures in evaluating CallidusCloud’s operating performance. CallidusCloud believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional insight for investors to use in evaluation of ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with other companies in CallidusCloud’s industry, many of which present non-GAAP financial measures that may resemble our non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP gross profit, recurring revenue gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, and net income before provision for income taxes. We believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a useful comparison of our operating results to our peers.\nRestructuring and other expense: We have excluded the effect of restructuring and other expense from our non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income and net income before provision for income taxes. Restructuring and other expense consists of employee severance and facility exit costs. We feel it is useful to investors to understand the effects of these items on our financial results.\nPatent litigation and settlement costs: We have excluded patent litigation and settlement costs from our non-GAAP gross profit, recurring revenue gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, and net income before provision for income taxes. We believe patent litigation and settlement costs are not indicative of our ongoing business operations, and are inconsistent in amount and frequency; as such we exclude these costs during our evaluation of our business performance.\nNon-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of acquired intangibles which include developed technology, customer relationships, trade names, domain names, patents and licenses, and order backlog from our non-GAAP gross profit, recurring revenue gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, other income and expense, and net income before provision for income taxes. Amortization of acquired intangibles are significantly affected by timing, and as such, can be inconsistent in amount and nature.\nAcquisition-related costs: We have excluded the costs related to acquisitions from our non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income, net income and net income before provision for income taxes. These costs include legal and transactional costs associated with acquisition activities as well as expense related to earnouts that we would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. We believe the exclusion of acquisition-related costs provides a useful comparison of our operating results to our peers.\nCash taxes: Cash taxes are defined as GAAP current income tax expense excluding the related tax amount for non-cash and non-GAAP items.\nAdditionally, CallidusCloud believes the following supplemental non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors and others in assessing its operating performance. A calculation of the supplemental non-GAAP financial information is provided in the table titled “Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Information.”\nSaaS billings is calculated as SaaS revenue plus the sequential change in SaaS deferred revenue in a period. Normalized SaaS billings is calculated as SaaS revenue plus the sequential change in SaaS deferred revenue, reduced by the remaining deferred revenue acquired during the period, plus or minus the effect of multiple year SaaS billings in that period.\nWe believe that normalized SaaS billings provide valuable insight into the sales of our solutions and the performance of our business. We do not consider normalized SaaS billings as a substitute for revenue recognition or revenue measurement.\nNote on\nThe included in this press release, including for example statements regarding the proposed merger with SAP and estimates of future revenues, reflect management’s best judgment based on factors currently known and involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk that parties may be unable to consummate the proposed merger with SAP due to failure to satisfy conditions to the completion of the merger, including the receipt of stockholder approval or regulatory approval, which might not be obtained on the terms expected, on the anticipated schedule or at all, and other risks detailed in periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which may be obtained by contacting CallidusCloud’s Investor Relations department at 415-445-3232, or from the Investor Relations section of CallidusCloud’s website ( http://www.calliduscloud.com/about-us/investor-relations/ ).
