    "text": "Feb 20 (Reuters) - Australia’s fourth largest telecom operator Vocus Group Ltd said first half underlying net profit fell 25 percent as dwindling voice customers hurt its Australian consumer business.\nUnderlying profit was A$68.6 million ($54.27 million) for the six months to Dec. 31, the company said on Tuesday, missing an average estimate of A$69.5 million, according to two analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company slashed its underlying profit guidance for fiscal 2018 to A$125 million to A$135 million from its previous estimate of A$140 million to A$150 million.\nThe company did not declare an interim dividend compared with a payout of 6 Australian cents a year ago.
