    "text": "Significant Progress Advancing Vision 2022 Strategy\n2017 Revenue and Earnings In-Line with Expectations\nSets 2018 Guidance of Double-Digit YOY Revenue and Earnings Growth\nCRANBURY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Innophos Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:IPHS) today announced its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 financial results.\nFull-Year 2017 Strategic Highlights\nLaunched Vision 2022 strategic roadmap in April 2017 targeting $1.25 billion revenue and 20% Adjusted EBITDA margin by 2022 as a leading specialty ingredients solution provider to attractive Food, Health, and Nutrition (FHN) markets Significantly progressed strategic pillars of Operational Excellence, Commercial Excellence, and Strategic Growth. Completed Phase 1 Operational Excellence, which delivered a total of $16 million in savings, and on track to achieve $13 million of Phase 2 cost savings Successfully closed and integrated Novel Ingredients and NutraGenesis acquisitions, creating a nearly $0.5 billion FHN platform. On track to deliver targeted cost synergies Advanced strategic value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization initiative starting with planned Q4 maintenance stoppage. Further improvement actions planned for 2018, that are expected to begin delivering earnings improvement in late 2018 with the full benefit materializing in 2019\nFinancial Highlights\nDelivered Q4 and full year 2017 results in line with expectations Q4 sales were up 15% compared with prior year due to strength in the FHN segment (up 29%) attributable to the Novel and NutraGenesis acquisitions, while selling prices and base business volumes both stabilized Q4 GAAP Net Income and EPS were adversely impacted by $17 million of provisional non-recurring tax reform charges and $5 million of pre-tax purchase accounting and M&A related expenses. Without the tax reform charges Q4 GAAP diluted EPS would have been higher by $0.89 Q4 Adjusted EBITDA of $27 million was up 3% year-over-year despite a $4 million impact from the previously announced maintenance stoppage Working capital continued to be managed at historically low levels. Excluding last year’s sizable working capital improvement, cash flow was on par with 2016 Providing 2018 full-year guidance of 12% to 14% revenue growth, with more than double GAAP EPS and 10% to 14% Adjusted EPS growth\n“2017 was a year of great progress for Innophos as we implemented our Vision 2022 strategic roadmap to transform the growth profile of the company, increase our presence in attractive Food, Health and Nutrition end-markets, and develop innovative solutions that better serve our customers,” said Kim Ann Mink, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“We closed on two strategic acquisitions, strengthened the foundation of our organization with the addition of top-tier talent, delivered bottom-line benefits through our Operational Excellence initiatives, and advanced our efforts to be viewed as a partner-of-choice with our focus on Commercial Excellence,” said Mink. “Further, we finished the year with fourth-quarter and full-year results that were in line with our expectations.”\nMink continued, “The acquisitions of Novel Ingredients and NutraGenesis are important steps forward in strengthening our growth profile. The integrations of both companies are well underway, and we remain confident in our ability to improve EBITDA margins by delivering the $4 million of identified cost synergies from Novel as well as capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities.”\n“Last quarter we announced the pursuit of a strategic value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization initiative beginning in Q4 2017. This program, which will be phased throughout 2018, demonstrates our continued commitment to further strengthen the competitive position of our cash-generative core phosphates product portfolio. Following targeted 2018 capital investments, we expect to meaningfully improve earnings, free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) in future years, starting at the back end of 2018.”\n“The actions we have taken this past year, and those that are in our pipeline for 2018, position Innophos to continue advancing toward our Vision 2022 targets and deliver sustainable growth for shareholders. We remain steadfastly focused on capitalizing on inorganic growth opportunities in high-growth end-markets; executing on our value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization program; developing new and innovative science-backed solutions that leverage our recently acquired assets, deliver enhanced value to our customers and address growing FHN mega trends; as well as completing our Phase 2 Operational Excellence initiative.”\n“As a result, we expect to deliver mid-teens revenue and earnings per share growth in 2018 compared to 2017 -- a reflection that our strategic roadmap is fully in action and is positioning Innophos to maximize shareholder value,” concluded Mink.\nFourth Quarter Results\nVariance $ and Variance % in the following tables may not foot due to rounding\n$ Millions except EPS\nQuarter 4 2017 2016 Variance $ Variance % Sales 193 168 25 15% Net Income (11) 9 (21) (220)% Adj.

Net leverage was 2.3x at the end of Q4 Capex of $17 million was up $6 million versus the prior year quarter, due to the successful mechanical completion of the Geismar deep well project, initial payments toward 2018 strategic capital and the aforementioned maintenance stoppage\nFourth Quarter Segment Financials\nSales 2017 $ Millions 2016 $ Millions Variance $ Variance % FHN 116 90 26 29% IS 64 62 2 4% Other 13 16 (3) (16)% Total Innophos 193 168 25 15% Adj.

Other margins were 21%; the December 2016 tolling arrangement has resulted in the avoidance of margin volatility that was seen in prior years\nFull Year Results\nVariance $ and Variance % in the following tables may not foot due to rounding\n$ Millions except EPS\nYTD Quarter 4 2017 2016 Variance $ Variance % Sales 722 725 (3) (1)% Net Income 22 48 (26) (53)% Adj.

H2 2016 pruning actions resulted in enhanced product mix and 52 bps of improved adjusted EBITDA margin Other sales were down versus prior year, but benefitted at the adjusted EBITDA margin level from the new tolling arrangement\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects full year 2018 revenues to grow 12% to 14% due to the annualized contributions from Novel Ingredients and NutraGenesis, favorable growth in the nutrition end-markets served, and stabilization in the base business.\nDue primarily to recently enacted tax reform, Innophos is lowering its estimated effective tax rate for 2018 from the typical 32% to 33% range to 27% to 29% given the geographical mix in earnings. The Company is carefully reviewing all aspects of tax reform and how they may impact 2018 financials.\nFull year GAAP EPS is expected to more than double in 2018. Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA are expected to grow by 10% to 14% and 15% to 17%, respectively. This includes an improvement in 2018 full year EPS of approximately $0.16 per diluted share due to the lower effective tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to approximate 17% of sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be weighted 45% toward H1 and 55% toward H2 given the phasing of the benefits from the strategic value chain repositioning and manufacturing optimization program, as well as the integration of the acquisitions completed in 2017. The Company expects to only modestly increase the use of cash to make targeted 2018 capital investments to support the aforementioned program.\nThe Company’s proactive selling price increase program that was implemented in Q4 2017 is well underway and expected to sufficiently offset the impact of forecasted input cost increases in 2018.\nThe Company remains on track to realize $4 million of expected acquisition cost synergies in 2018, which will enhance the FHN adjusted EBITDA margin profile.\nDelivery of $10 million in Phase 2 Operational excellence savings is expected in 2018, compared with $3 million recorded in 2017.\nConference Call\nInnophos will host its fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call today February 21, 2018 at 9:00 am ET to discuss its earnings results.

Price / Volume\nThe Company calculates pure selling price dollar variances as the selling price for the current year to date period minus the selling price for the prior year to date period, and then multiplies the resulting selling price difference by the prior year to date period volume. The current quarter selling price dollar variance is derived from the current quarter year to date selling price dollar variance less the previous quarter year to date selling price dollar variance. The selling price dollar variance is then divided by the prior period sales dollars to calculate the percentage change.

The Company believes net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net debt as total long-term debt (including any current portion) less cash and cash equivalents.\nFree cash flow is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes free cash flow is helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided from operating activities plus cash used for capital expenditures.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as performance measures for purposes of presentation in this release.\nNet Working Capital is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes net working capital is helpful in analyzing the effects on the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net working capital as total current assets less cash less total current liabilities.\nOperating Working Capital is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes operating working capital is helpful in analyzing the effects on the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines operating working capital as net working capital less taxes less interest.\nInnophos is not able to provide a reconciliation of its 2022 expectation for Adjusted EBITDA margin to GAAP net income due to the number of variables in the projected EBITDA margin for 2022 and because we are currently unable to quantify accurately certain amounts that would be required to be included in GAAP net income or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\nOur current 2018 guidance assumes that GAAP EPS equals Adjusted EPS.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221005362/en/\nInvestors\nInnophos\nMark Feuerbach, 609-366-1204\ninvestor.relations@innophos.com\nor\nMedia\nSharon Merrill Associates\nRyan Flaim, 617-542-5300\niphs@investorrelations.com\nSource: Innophos Holdings, Inc.",
