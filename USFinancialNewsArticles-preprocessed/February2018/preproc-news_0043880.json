Stock Repurchase Program\nAs previously announced, Gulfport's board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100 million of the Company's outstanding common stock during 2018. Purchases under the repurchase program may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, and will be subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations and other factors. The repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. The Company intends to purchase shares under the repurchase program opportunistically while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund its 2018 capital development program. This repurchase program is authorized to extend through December 31, 2018 and may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued by the board of directors at any time.\nDerivatives\nGulfport has hedged a portion of its expected production to lock in prices and returns that provide certainty of cash flow to execute on its capital plans.

At year-end 2017, approximately 35% of Gulfport’s proved reserves were classified as proved developed reserves. Proved undeveloped reserves increased by 139% from December 31, 2016 to approximately 3,499.0 Bcfe as of December 31, 2017.

The prices utilized for Gulfport’s year-end 2017 reserve report were $51.34 per barrel of oil and $2.98 per MMBtu of natural gas, in each case as adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials. Utilizing these prices, the present value of Gulfport’s total proved reserves discounted at 10% (referred to as “PV-10”) was $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017. PV-10 is a non-GAAP measure because it excludes income tax effects. Management believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under GAAP. We have included a reconciliation of PV-10 of proved reserves to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nGULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION DECEMBER 31, 2017 PV-10 (Unaudited) SEC Case ($MM) Proved Developed Producing $ 1,699 Proved Developed Non-Producing 166 Proved Undeveloped 1,018 Total Proved Reserves $ 2,883 The following table reconciles the standardized measure of future net cash flows to the PV-10 value of Gulfport’s proved reserves:\nGULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION DECEMBER 31, 2017 PV-10 RECONCILITATION (Unaudited) SEC Case ($MM) Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (1) $ 2,644 Add: Present value of future income tax discounted at 10% 239 PV-10 value $ 2,883 ¹ The standardized measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, less future development, abandonment, production, and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV-10. Standardized measure differs from PV-10 because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes. Presentation\nAn updated presentation has been posted to the Company’s website.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included that address activities, events or developments that Gulfport expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy and measures to implement strategy, competitive strength, goals, expansion and growth of Gulfport's business and operations, plans, market conditions, references to future success, reference to intentions as to future matters and other such matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by Gulfport in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with Gulfport's expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, general economic, market, credit or business conditions that might affect the timing and amount of the repurchase program; the opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by Gulfport; Gulfport’s ability to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions of properties and businesses; competitive actions by other oil and gas companies; changes in laws or regulations; and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Gulfport. Information concerning these and other factors can be found in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurances that the actual results or developments anticipated by Gulfport will be realized, or even if realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or effects on Gulfport, its business or operations. Gulfport has no intention, and disclaims any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, accretion expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to EBITDA less non-cash derivative gain, acquisition expense and (income) loss from equity method investments. Cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to cash provided by operating activity before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to pre-tax net income less non-cash derivative gain, acquisition expense, (income) loss from equity method investments and tax (benefit) expense excluding adjustments. The Company has presented EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because it uses these measures as an integral part of its internal reporting to evaluate its performance and the performance of its senior management. These measures are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company's business and eliminate the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depletion, depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets. A limitation of these measures, however, is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company's business. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets and the impact of related impairments through other financial measures, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital. Therefore, the Company believes that these measures provide useful information to its investors regarding its performance and overall results of operations. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in the Company's various agreements.\nGeneral Reserve Information Notes:\nGulfport's estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc.
