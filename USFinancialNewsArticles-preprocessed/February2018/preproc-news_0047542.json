    "text": "(Updates to close)\nFeb 20 (Reuters) - Australian shares ended flat on Tuesday as losses in financials and materials were offset by gains in energy and information technology stocks.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index fell 0.700 points to 5,940.90 at the close of trade. The benchmark added 0.6 percent on Monday.\nBanks were the biggest drag on Tuesday, with the Australian financial index slipping 0.2 percent.\nWestpac Banking Corp, the country’s second-biggest bank by market value, fell 0.8 percent and accounted for most of the losses while National Australia Bank Ltd declined 0.5 percent.\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd fell 0.3 percent despite reporting lower impaired assets for the first quarter.\nMaterials stocks added to the losses, with miners BHP and Rio Tinto Ltd falling 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.\nAfter market hours, BHP, reported a 25 percent rise in underlying half-year profit , helped by robust commodity prices.\nSuper Retail Group Ltd plunged 14.5 percent to its lowest in more than three years.\nThe outdoor equipment retailer reported a 3 percent fall in first-half profit and announced a A$135 million ($106.88 mln) takeover of outdoor recreation brand Macpac.\nConversely, energy stocks gained, helped by overnight gains in oil prices.\nWoodside Petroleum Ltd, Australia’s biggest independent gas and oil producer, climbed 1.6 percent, while Origin Energy Ltd added 1 percent.\nInformation technology stocks also gained. Software developer Altium Ltd surged 26.7 percent to be the day’s top percentage gainer.\nIn New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.2 percent or 16.980 points to finish the session at 8,098.270.\nMaterials and health care stocks accounted for most of the losses, with Fletcher Building Ltd declining 1.4 percent and Ryman Healthcare Ltd dipping 1.6 percent.
