    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, Feb 22 (Reuters) - South African-based gold and platinum producer Sibanye-Stillwater reported an attributable loss for 2017 and in a bid to preserve cash turned off the flow of dividends that has made it a darling of investors.\nThe company’s operations, including the troubled Rustenburg assets it acquired from Anglo American Platinum, delivered solid results, with the loss stemming from impairments, provisions for occupational healthcare claims, and restructuring and transaction costs among other factors.\nSibanye-Stillwater reported an attributable loss of 4.437 billion rand ($333 million) for the year ended 31 December 2017, compared with attributable earnings of 3.473 billion rand ($237 million) for the year ended 31 December 2016.\n“In the near term, cash preservation is prudent and as a result no final dividend is being declared,” the Gold Fields spin-off, which has given over 4 billion rand back to shareholders since 2013, said.\nSibanye initially positioned itself as a dividend play with cash flowing from mature South African gold assets that did not require huge investment, but it has been expanding into platinum and beyond South Africa, diverting its dividend flow.\nIts dividend yield is now 2.882 percent, almost the same as the 2.84 percent for Johannesburg’s All-share index.\nThe healthcare provision has been put aside for an expected settlement in a class-action suit against six current and previous South African related to a fatal lung disease.\nThe suit is likely to be settled “within months” with 9 billion rand going to sufferers, the chair of an industry group said earlier this month.\nIt was launched almost six years ago on behalf of miners suffering from silicosis, a fatal lung disease contacted by inhaling silica dust in gold mines.
