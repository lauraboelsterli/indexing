His appointment to a three-year term is effective today.\nSobel, CIA, QIAL, CRMA, is recognized as a leading expert on governance, enterprise risk management, compliance, and internal control. He was selected for this position because of his extensive background along with his experience in corporate environments and professional service firms.\nSobel succeeds Robert B. Hirth Jr., who has served as COSO chairman since 2013. Hirth notably and most recently led the committee through an update of COSO's ERM Framework , one of the most widely recognized and applied risk management frameworks in the world. The update was released in September 2017. Sobel served on the Advisory Council for the ERM update.\nIn addition to leading audit functions at four large companies, Sobel has held leadership roles as Chairman of the Global Board for The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and as Chairman of an audit committee for a privately held company that grew from $25 million to more than $200 million in revenue.\nAt Georgia-Pacific, he is responsible for managing the internal audit function and providing on-going oversight and advice on risk management and compliance programs.\nSobel is a frequent speaker and prolific author on governance, ERM and internal audit topics. He wrote the new Managing Risks in Uncertain Times: Leveraging COSO'S New ERM Framework, as well as Auditor's Risk Management Guide: Integrating Auditing and ERM. He co-authored Internal Auditing: Assurance and Consulting Services, a comprehensive textbook designed to teach students about the fast-growing global profession of internal auditing.\n\"It is an honor and privilege to be selected as COSO's new chairman,\" Sobel said. \"I have been actively involved in the latest developments with the committee to help organizations across the globe improve their risk management, governance, and controls in our collective effort to deter corporate fraud.\"\nSobel was chosen from a group of more than a dozen applicants after a rigorous selection process.\n\"Paul is an exemplary leader with a strong vision,\" said COSO Lead Director and IIA President and CEO Richard F. Chambers, CIA, QIAL, CGAP, CCSA, CRMA. \"I, along with the Board, strongly believe that he is well-qualified to further COSO's important mission,\"\nSobel also is a longtime volunteer with The IIA.
