    "text": "OSLO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Norway’s central bank will in 2018 offer liquidity to banks at the end of each quarter, as well as at year-end, it said in a statement on Monday.\nThe so-called F-loans will have an interest rate equal to the key policy rate plus 15 basis points, the central bank added.\n“The aim of these market operations is to ensure the availability of NOK liquidity at a price close to the key policy rate, also over quarter-ends and year-end,” it said.
