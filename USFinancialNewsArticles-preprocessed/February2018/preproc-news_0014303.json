    "text": "NEWARK, N.Y., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IEC Electronics Corp. (NYSE American:IEC) today announced results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 29, 2017.\nIEC reported revenues of $21.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $21.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 7.2% as compared to 8.6% in the same quarter last year. Selling and administrative expenses increased to $2.8 million or 13.2% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $2.4 million or 11.6% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $1 million in the quarter due to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which, among other things, makes previous paid federal AMT now refundable regardless of whether there is future income tax liability before AMT credits. The Company reported a net loss for first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $0.5 million or a loss of $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.9 million, or a loss of $0.09 per share, in the first quarter of last year.\nJeffrey T. Schlarbaum, President and CEO of IEC Electronics commented, “Our fiscal 2018 first quarter revenue results were disappointing in terms of conversion of backlog. As we continue to build momentum on our path to growth, we entered the fiscal quarter with a high percentage of new programs that were scheduled to be manufactured. We encountered several challenges, both internally and externally, that inhibited the execution of the plan, including global supply chain challenges associated with component shortages as well as customer controlled delays associated with the overall on-boarding process. That being said, despite the lower than expected conversion rate in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, we are optimistic about the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we see our sales pipeline and backlog continue to grow.\n“Our transition to a growth company is exciting, yet challenging. The rate at which our Company is experiencing new programs and backlog growth is something that has not been experienced in many years and at times, might make our execution plans a bit unpredictable due to the complexity of the on-boarding process as well as the global electronic component supply situation. That being said, I am confident our Company will continue to execute and adapt to this new type of environment.”\nMr. Schlarbaum continued, “We also recently announced that we entered into a $1.5 million Equipment Line Term Loan line of credit with M&T bank that we believe, along with our solid balance sheet, provides us with a solid platform for the expansion of our business as we continue to gain marketplace recognition as a leading provider of electronic manufacturing solutions for life-saving and mission critical products. We remain focused on our go-to-market strategy and advancing on our path to growth throughout fiscal 2018.”\nConference Call:\nIEC will host a conference call, today, Wednesday, February 7, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its financial results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter.\nThe conference call may be accessed in the U.S. and Canada by dialing toll-free (877) 407-9210.
