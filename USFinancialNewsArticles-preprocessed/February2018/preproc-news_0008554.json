Ramaphosa has talked of a transition of power since he took over as leader of the ANC. \nIn a statement, Ramaphosa said he and Zuma hoped to conclude their discussions and report back to country “in coming days”, adding the process was an opportunity to conclude the matter without causing discord or division in the country.
