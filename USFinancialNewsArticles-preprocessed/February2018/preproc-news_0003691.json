(Photo: Business Wire)\nThe selection of Capasso, who was named interim President/CEO in May of 2017, follows a year-long national search that attracted more than 375 applicants. Ultimately, Commissioners rejected all of the applicants and voted 4 to 1 in favor of making Capasso the President/CEO of Broward Health, one of the nation’s largest public healthcare systems.\nCommissioner Nancy Gregoire, recently appointed to the Broward Health Board of Commissioners by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, made the motion that Capasso serve as President/CEO.\n“I understand there has been immense improvement at Broward Health even within the last 18 months, and I understand it’s still improving,” said Gregoire. “As long as I’m on this board, I hope we will continue to improve.”\nAt a special meeting and regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners held earlier today, the Board weighed input from community leaders, as well as from the medical and leadership teams of Broward Health, before making a final decision. All five Broward Health Commissioners participated in the special meeting and regular meeting of the Board.\nCapasso was appointed Broward Health’s interim President/CEO after serving on the North Broward Hospital District Board of Commissioners. Capasso previously served as CEO at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami. She has also held senior management positions at Cleveland Clinic Florida in Weston and as Chief Nursing Officer at Miami’s North Shore Medical Center, part of Tenet Healthcare. In addition to her executive positions, she has years of experience as a registered nurse working in critical care and emergency departments.\n“I am humbled and honored to accept,” said Capasso. “We have stabilized Broward Health and will continue to stabilize Broward Health for our patients and our community and for the 8,000 employees of Broward Health.”\nAbout Broward Health\nBroward Health, providing service for more than 75 years, is a nationally recognized system in South Florida that offers world-class healthcare to all.
