However, the Franco-Dutch airline group is not directly involved in the sale process and has not had access to Alitalia data, he told a news conference. British low-cost airline easyJet ( EZJ.L ) said last month that it was interested in parts of Alitalia, and that discussions were ongoing. Reporting by Tim HepherEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta",
