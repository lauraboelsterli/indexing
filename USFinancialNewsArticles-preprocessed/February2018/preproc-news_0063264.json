    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE: APTS) (\"we\", \"our\", the \"Company\" or \"Preferred Apartment Communities\") today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, all per share results are reported based on the basic weighted average shares of Common Stock and Class A Units of the Company's operating partnership (\"Class A Units\") outstanding. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\n\"2017 was another year of strong performance for the Company, as evidenced by our exceptional growth in FFO per share. Beginning in 2018, we will begin providing our primary guidance for future periods on FFO per share as defined by NAREIT and will discontinue reporting or providing guidance on Core FFO\" said John A. Williams, Preferred Apartment Communities' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nFinancial Highlights\nOur operating results are presented below.\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n% change\n2017\n2016\n% change\nRevenues\n$\n81,652,168\n$\n58,991,853\n38.4\n%\n$\n294,004,615\n$\n200,118,915\n46.9\n%\nPer share data:\nNet income (loss) (1)\n$\n(0.60)\n$\n(0.66)\n—\n$\n(1.13)\n$\n(2.11)\n—\nFFO (2)\n$\n0.31\n$\n0.24\n29.2\n%\n$\n1.32\n$\n0.90\n46.7\n%\nCore FFO (2)\n$\n0.36\n$\n0.32\n12.5\n%\n$\n1.47\n$\n1.31\n12.2\n%\nDividends (3)\n$\n0.25\n$\n0.22\n13.6\n%\n$\n0.94\n$\n0.8175\n15.0\n%\n(1) Per weighted average share of Common Stock outstanding for the periods indicated.\n(2) FFO and Core FFO are presented per weighted average share of Common Stock and Class A Unit in our Operating Partnership outstanding for the periods indicated. See Reconciliations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO (each as defined below) to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders. Beginning in 2018, we will report our financial results primarily based on net income/loss and FFO as defined by NAREIT. We will not provide financial results or guidance based on Core FFO in future periods.\n(3) Per share of Common Stock and Class A Unit outstanding.\nFunds from operations (\"FFO\") for the three months and for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflect acquisition-related costs, which were expensed in full when incurred. Beginning January 1, 2017, the majority of these types of costs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the acquired assets. Core Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"Core FFO\") excludes acquisition costs and certain other costs not representative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"AFFO\") removes significant non-cash revenues and expenses from our Core FFO results.\nFor the year 2017, our Core FFO payout ratio to our Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 66.7% and our AFFO payout ratio to Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 83.6%. For the fourth quarter 2017, our Core FFO payout ratio to our Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 71.1% and our AFFO payout ratio to Common Stockholders and Unitholders was approximately 81.9%. (A) For the year 2017, our Core FFO payout ratio (before the deduction of preferred dividends) to our preferred stockholders was approximately 57.0% and our AFFO payout ratio (before the deduction of preferred dividends) to our preferred stockholders was approximately 62.4%. For the fourth quarter 2017, our Core FFO payout ratio (before the deduction of preferred dividends) to our preferred stockholders was approximately 56.1% and our AFFO payout ratio (before the deduction of preferred dividends) to our preferred stockholders was approximately 59.5%. (A) We issued approximately 3.0 million shares of Common Stock during the fourth quarter 2017 and approximately 12.1 million shares of Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the market value of our common stock was $20.25. A hypothetical investment in our Common Stock in our initial public offering on April 5, 2011, assuming the reinvestment of all dividends and no transaction costs, would have resulted in an average annual return of approximately 31.2% through December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, our total assets were approximately $3.3 billion compared to approximately $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $0.8 billion, or approximately 34.3%. This growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of 22 real estate properties (less the sale of 3 properties) and an increase of approximately $53.9 million of the funded amount of our real estate loan investment portfolio since December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the average age of our multifamily communities was approximately 6.3 years, which we believe is among the youngest in the multifamily REIT industry. At December 31, 2017, our leverage, as measured by the ratio of our debt to the undepreciated book value of our total assets, was approximately 54.9%. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $86.3 million, an increase of approximately $24.6 million, or 39.9%, compared to approximately $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $15.8 million, an increase of approximately $8.0 million, or 103.0%, compared to approximately $7.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, our physical occupancy for established multifamily communities was 95.9%. Hurricane Harvey caused property damage at our Stone Creek multifamily community located in Port Arthur, Texas which required us to write off real estate assets with a net book value\nof approximately $6.9 million. Property damage and lost rental income for this asset are covered under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and, residually, under various provisions of our master policy. Therefore, we simultaneously recorded an insurance\nreceivable of the same amount, resulting in no loss being recorded in the Income Statement from the write-off. At December 31, 2017, we had received approximately $4.7 million of insurance proceeds and expect to receive the remainder during the first quarter 2018. Remediation and restoration is progressing very well, and we anticipate full completion by May of 2018. Together with Hurricane Irma, we sustained other smaller property damages, lost revenues and higher miscellaneous operating expenses at certain of our other multifamily communities and grocery-anchored shopping centers in Texas and Florida. For the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017, rental revenues decreased $273,000 and $387,000, respectively due to lost rents. We expect to record a full recovery of these lost revenues upon settlement with our insurance carrier and receipt of funds in 2018. In addition to lost rents, our Income Statement reflects other related costs such as insurance deductibles, smaller property damages that did not exceed our property insurance deductibles, and other storm remediation expenses from the two storms. These costs combined totaled $408,000 and $511,000 for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(A) We calculate the Core FFO and AFFO payout ratios to Common Stockholders and preferred stockholders as the ratio of Common Stock dividends and distributions to preferred stockholders to Core FFO or AFFO, respectively. We calculate the Core FFO and AFFO payout ratios to preferred stockholders as the ratio of Preferred Stock dividends to the sum of Preferred Stock dividends and Core FFO or AFFO, respectively. Since our operations resulted in a net loss from continuing operations for the periods presented, a payout ratio based on net loss is not calculable. See Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\nAcquisitions of Properties\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, we acquired the following properties:\nProperty\nLocation (MSA)\nUnits\nLeasable\nsquare feet\nMultifamily communities:\nOverlook at Crosstown Walk\nTampa, FL\n180\nn/a\nColony at Centerpointe\nRichmond, VA\n255\nn/a\nStudent housing properties: (1)\nStadium Village\nAtlanta, GA\n198\nn/a\nUrsa\nWaco, TX\n250\nn/a\nGrocery-anchored shopping centers:\nCrossroads Market\nNaples, FL\nn/a\n126,895\nRoswell Wieuca Shopping Center\nAtlanta, GA\nn/a\n74,370\nOffice buildings:\nWestridge at La Cantera\nSan Antonio, TX\nn/a\n258,000\n(1) The Company acquired and owns an approximate 99% equity interest in a joint venture which owns both Stadium Village and Ursa.\nReal Estate Assets\nOwned as of\nDecember 31,\n2017\nPotential additions\nfrom real estate\nloan investment\nportfolio (1)\nPotential total\nMultifamily communities:\nProperties\n30\n15\n45\nUnits\n9,521\n4,656\n14,177\nGrocery-anchored shopping centers:\nProperties\n39\n—\n(2)\n39\nGross leasable area (square feet)\n4,055,461\n—\n4,055,461\nStudent housing properties:\nProperties\n4\n6\n10\nUnits\n891\n1,457\n2,348\nBeds\n2,950\n4,145\n7,095\nOffice buildings:\nProperties\n4\n—\n4\nRentable square feet\n1,352,000\n—\n1,352,000\n(1) We evaluate each project individually and we make no assurance that we will acquire any of the underlying properties from our real estate loan investment portfolio.\n(2) Effective as of September 29, 2017, we negotiated the cancellation of the purchase option on our real estate investment loan supporting the Dawsonville grocery-anchored shopping center in exchange for a fee of $250,000.\nSubsequent to Quarter End\nOn January 9, 2018, we acquired a 265-unit multifamily community located in Jacksonville, Florida.\nOn January 16, 2018, we closed on a real estate loan investment of up to $3.5 million in support of a mixed-use project in North Augusta, South Carolina.\nOn January 29, 2018, we acquired an adaptive reuse office property comprised of 186,779 square feet of gross leasable area in four buildings located in Atlanta, Georgia.\nOn February 13, 2018, we closed on a real estate loan investment of up to $137.5 million in support of a 551-unit multifamily community in San Jose, California.\nMultifamily Established Communities Financial Data\nThe following chart presents same store operating results for the Company's established communities. Effective with the fourth quarter 2017, we define our population of established communities as those that have been stabilized for at least three consecutive months and that have been owned for at least 15 full months as of the end of the first quarter of each year, enabling comparisons of the current year quarterly and annual reporting periods to the prior year comparative periods. The Company excludes the operating results of properties for which construction of adjacent phases has commenced and properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses, or are being marketed for sale as of the end of the reporting period. For the periods presented, same store operating results consist of the operating results of the following multifamily established communities:\nStoneridge Farms at Hunt Club\nLake Cameron\nAvenues at Cypress\nVineyards\nAster at Lely\nAvenues at Northpointe\nMcNeil Ranch\nVenue at Lakewood Ranch\nStone Rise\nCiti Lakes\nLenox Portfolio\nSame store net operating income is a non-GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to net income (loss), with a reconciliation following below.\nEstablished Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income\nThree months ended:\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n$ change\n% change\nRevenues:\nRental revenues\n$\n12,148,959\n$\n11,717,625\n$\n431,334\n3.7\n%\nOther property revenues\n1,283,463\n1,261,312\n22,151\n1.8\n%\nTotal revenues\n13,432,422\n12,978,937\n453,485\n3.5\n%\nOperating expenses:\nProperty operating and maintenance\n1,678,366\n1,635,614\n42,752\n2.6\n%\nPayroll\n1,121,795\n1,063,143\n58,652\n5.5\n%\nProperty management fees\n541,774\n529,252\n12,522\n2.4\n%\nReal estate taxes\n1,838,601\n1,870,629\n(32,028)\n(1.7)\n%\nOther\n560,977\n558,314\n2,663\n0.5\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n5,741,513\n5,656,952\n84,561\n1.5\n%\nSame store net operating income\n$\n7,690,909\n$\n7,321,985\n$\n368,924\n5.0\n%\nReconciliation of Established Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income (NOI) to Net Income (Loss)\nThree months ended:\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nSame store net operating income\n$\n7,690,909\n$\n7,321,985\nAdd:\nNon-same-store property revenues\n53,401,077\n33,822,511\nLess:\nNon-same-store property operating expenses\n18,709,158\n12,717,326\nProperty net operating income\n42,382,828\n28,427,170\nAdd:\nInterest revenue on notes receivable\n9,586,308\n7,856,232\nInterest revenue on related party notes receivable\n5,232,361\n4,334,173\nLess:\nEquity stock compensation\n862,617\n656,336\nDepreciation and amortization\n34,589,849\n23,158,734\nInterest expense\n19,383,026\n13,595,639\nAcquisition costs\n—\n1,661,679\nManagement fees\n5,701,879\n4,153,297\nInsurance, professional fees and other\n2,133,742\n1,501,995\nContingent asset management and general and administrative expense fees\n(727,756)\n(127,322)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(4,741,860)\n$\n(3,982,783)\nEstablished Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income\nYear ended:\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n$ change\n% change\nRevenues:\nRental revenues\n$\n47,582,973\n$\n46,794,009\n$\n788,964\n1.7\n%\nOther property revenues\n5,165,554\n5,152,932\n12,622\n0.2\n%\nTotal revenues\n52,748,527\n51,946,941\n801,586\n1.5\n%\nOperating expenses:\nProperty operating and maintenance\n7,122,037\n6,989,096\n132,941\n1.9\n%\nPayroll\n4,543,955\n4,393,991\n149,964\n3.4\n%\nProperty management fees\n2,122,317\n2,087,421\n34,896\n1.7\n%\nReal estate taxes\n7,508,945\n7,784,122\n(275,177)\n(3.5)\n%\nOther\n2,243,982\n2,166,966\n77,016\n3.6\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n23,541,236\n23,421,596\n119,640\n0.5\n%\nSame store net operating income\n$\n29,207,291\n$\n28,525,345\n$\n681,946\n2.4\n%\nReconciliation of Established Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income (NOI) to Net Income (Loss)\nYear ended:\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nSame store net operating income\n$\n29,207,291\n$\n28,525,345\nAdd:\nNon-same-store property revenues\n184,354,229\n104,686,382\nLess:\nNon-same-store property operating expenses\n67,789,947\n40,520,336\nProperty net operating income\n145,771,573\n92,691,391\nAdd:\nInterest revenue on notes receivable\n35,697,982\n28,840,857\nInterest revenue on related party notes receivable\n21,203,877\n14,644,736\nLess:\nEquity stock compensation\n3,470,284\n2,524,042\nDepreciation and amortization\n116,776,809\n78,139,798\nInterest expense\n67,468,042\n44,284,144\nAcquisition costs\n14,002\n8,547,543\nManagement fees\n20,226,396\n13,637,458\nInsurance, professional fees and other\n4,527,504\n4,744,486\nGain on sale of real estate\n37,635,014\n4,271,506\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n(888,428)\n—\nContingent asset management and general and administrative expense fees\n(1,729,620)\n(1,585,567)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n28,666,601\n$\n(9,843,414)\nReal estate taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased versus the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to successful valuation appeal efforts.\nCapital Markets Activities\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, we issued and sold an aggregate of 108,948 Units from our offering of up to 1,500,000 Units, with each Unit consisting of one share of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock and one Warrant to purchase up to 20 shares of Common Stock (the \"$1.5 Billion Series A Unit Offering\"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $98.1 million after commissions and other fees. In addition, during the fourth quarter 2017, we issued approximately 2.8 million shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants issued under our Series A Preferred Stock offerings, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $41.1 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,879 shares of Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock (\"mShares\"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $2.8 million after dealer manager fees.\nEffective as of the close of market on November 30, 2017 our Common Stock was added to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (RMZ).\nOur outstanding shares of Common Stock totaled approximately 38.6 million shares at December 31, 2017. The closing price of our Common Stock was $20.25 on December 29, 2017 versus $14.91 on December 31, 2016. Our total equity book value increased 44.8% to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017 from $885.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nDividends\nQuarterly Dividends on Common Stock and Class A OP Units\nOn October 23, 2017, we declared a quarterly dividend on our Common Stock of $0.25 per share for the fourth quarter 2017. This represents a 13.6% increase in our common stock dividend from our fourth quarter 2016 common stock dividend of $0.22 per share, and an annualized dividend growth rate of 15.5% since June 30, 2011, the first quarter end following our initial public offering in April 2011. The fourth quarter dividend was paid on January 16, 2018 to all stockholders of record on December 15, 2017. In conjunction with the Common Stock dividend, the Company's operating partnership declared a distribution on its Class A Units of $0.25 per unit for the fourth quarter 2017, which was paid on January 16, 2018 to all Class A Unit holders of record as of December 15, 2017.\nMonthly Dividends on Preferred Stock\nWe declared and paid monthly dividends of $5.00 per share on our Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, which totaled approximately $17.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and represent a 6% annual yield. We declared and paid dividends totaling approximately $195,000 on our Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, or mShares, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The mShares have an escalating dividend rate from 5.75% in year one of issuance to 7.50% in year eight and thereafter.\nConference Call and Supplemental Data\nWe will hold our quarterly conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.

A replay of the call will be archived on under the Investors/Audio Archive section.\n2018 Guidance:\nNet income (loss) per share - We are actively adding properties and real estate loan investments to our real estate portfolio and the specific timing of the closing of acquisitions is difficult to predict. Acquisition activity by its nature can cause material variation in our reported depreciation and amortization expense and interest income. Since net income (loss) per share is calculated net of depreciation and amortization expense, our net income (loss) results can fluctuate, possibly significantly, depending upon the timing of the closing of acquisitions. For this reason, we are unable to reasonably forecast this measure or provide a reconciliation of our projected FFO per share to this measure.\nFFO per share - We currently project FFO to be in the range of $1.43 - $1.47 per share for the full year 2018.\nRevenue - We currently project total revenues to be in the range of $400 million - $440 million for the full year 2018.\nCommon Stock dividends - We currently expect to increase our Common Stock dividend by an aggregate of at least 10% during 2018 as compared to 2017.\nCore FFO, AFFO and FFO are all calculated after deductions for all preferred stock dividends. Reconciliations of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders to Core FFO, AFFO and FFO for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 appear in the attached report, as well as on our website using the following link:\nhttp://investors.pacapts.com/download/4Q17_Earnings_and_Supplemental_Data.pdf\nForward-Looking Statements\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Estimates of future earnings, guidance, goals and performance are, by definition, and certain other statements in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Financial Data Report may constitute, \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, achievements or transactions to be materially different from the results, guidance, goals, performance, achievements or transactions expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

The weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are the same for basic and diluted for any period for which we recorded a net loss available to common stockholders.\nSee Notes to Reconciliation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders.\nNotes to Reconciliations of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders\nRental and other property revenues and property operating expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 include activity for the 10 multifamily communities, three student housing projects, one office building and eight grocery-anchored shopping centers acquired during 2017 only from their respective dates of acquisition. In addition, the fourth quarter 2017 period includes a full quarter of activity for the six multifamily communities, 17 grocery-anchored shopping centers, one student housing property and three office buildings acquired during 2016. Rental and other property revenues and expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 include activity for the 2016 acquisitions only from their respective dates of acquisition during 2016. Non-controlling interests in our Operating Partnership consisted of a total of 884,735 Class A Units as of December 31, 2017. Included in this total are 419,228 Class A Units which were granted as partial consideration to the seller in conjunction with the seller's contribution to us on February 29, 2016 of the Wade Green grocery-anchored shopping center. The remaining Class A units were awarded primarily to our key executive officers. The Class A Units are apportioned a percentage of our financial results as non-controlling interests. The weighted average ownership percentage of these holders of Class A Units was calculated to be 2.35% and 3.40% for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and 2.76% and 3.30% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We incurred loan closing costs for the acquisition of the Village at Baldwin Park multifamily community during the first quarter 2016, which were funded by our $35 million acquisition term loan facility, or 2016 Term Loan, on our $11 million term note, which we used to finance the acquisition of our Anderson Central grocery-anchored shopping center, and on our $200 million acquisition revolving credit facility, or Acquisition Facility, which is used to finance acquisitions of multifamily communities and student housing communities. The 2016 Term Loan was repaid in full on August 5, 2016, while the $11 million term note and Acquisition\nFacility remain outstanding. The costs to establish these instruments were deferred and amortized over the lives of the instruments. The amortization expense of these deferred costs is an additive adjustment in the calculation of Core FFO. As of January 1, 2016, we pay loan coordination fees to Preferred Apartment Advisors, LLC, our Manager, related to obtaining mortgage financing for acquired properties. Loan coordination fees were introduced to reflect the administrative effort involved in arranging debt financing for acquired properties. The portion of the loan coordination fees paid up until July 1, 2017 attributable to the financing were amortized over the lives of the respective mortgage loans, and this non-cash amortization expense is an addition to FFO in the calculation of Core FFO. Beginning effective July 1, 2017, the loan coordination fee was lowered from 1.6% to 0.6% of the amount of any mortgage indebtedness on newly-acquired properties or refinancing. All of the loan coordination fees paid to our Manager subsequent to July 1, 2017 are amortized over the life of the debt. At December 31, 2017, aggregate unamortized loan coordination fees were approximately $12.1 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining loan life of approximately 10.6 years. We sustained weather-related operating losses at certain of our properties during the third and fourth quarters of 2017; these costs are added back to FFO in our calculation of Core FFO. Included in these adjustments are lost rental revenues that totaled $386,531 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $272,835 for the fourth quarter. Any insurance reimbursement for lost rent cannot be reflected in our statements of operations until the funds are received from the insurance carrier. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, this adjustment consists of charges related to the refinancing of our Aldridge at Town Village, Summit Crossing and Retreat at Greystone multifamily communities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment also includes a loan prepayment penalty and other charges related to the refinancing of our Stone Creek and 525 Avalon multifamily communities. We incur loan closing costs on our existing mortgage loans, which are secured on a property-by-property basis by each of our acquired real estate assets, and also for occasional amendments to our $150 million syndicated revolving line of credit with Key Bank National Association, or our Revolving Line of Credit. These loan closing costs are also amortized over the lives of the respective loans and the Revolving Line of Credit, and this non-cash amortization expense is an addition to Core FFO in the calculation of AFFO. Neither we nor the Operating Partnership have any recourse liability in connection with any of the mortgage loans, nor do we have any cross-collateralization arrangements with respect to the assets securing the mortgage loans, other than security interests in 49% of the equity interests of the subsidiaries owning such assets, granted in connection with our Revolving Line of Credit, which provides for full recourse liability. At December 31, 2017, aggregate unamortized loan costs were approximately $19.2 million, which will be amortized over a weighted average remaining loan life of approximately 8.0 years. We receive loan origination fees in conjunction with the origination of certain real estate loan investments. These fees are then recognized as revenue over the lives of the applicable loans as adjustments of yield using the effective interest method. The total fees received after the payment of loan origination fees to our Manager are additive adjustments in the calculation of AFFO. Correspondingly, the amortized non-cash income is a deduction in the calculation of AFFO. Over the lives of certain loans, we accrue additional interest amounts that become due to us at the time of repayment of the loan or refinancing of the property, or when the property is sold. This non-cash interest income is subtracted from Core FFO in our calculation of AFFO. This adjustment reflects the receipt during the periods presented of additional interest income (described in note 8 above) which was earned and accrued prior to those periods presented on various real estate loans. This adjustment removes the non-cash amortization of costs incurred to induce tenants to lease space in our office buildings and grocery-anchored shopping centers. This adjustment reflects straight-line rent adjustments and the reversal of the non-cash amortization of below-market and above-market lease intangibles, which were recognized in conjunction with our acquisitions and which are amortized over the estimated average remaining lease terms from the acquisition date for multifamily communities and over the remaining lease terms for grocery-anchored shopping center assets and office buildings. At December 31, 2017, the balance of unamortized below-market lease intangibles was approximately $38.9 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average remaining lease period of approximately 9.7 years. This adjustment removes the non-cash amortization of deferred revenue recorded by us in conjunction with Company-owned lessee-funded tenant improvements in our office buildings. We deduct from Core FFO normally recurring capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain our assets' revenue streams in the calculation of AFFO. This adjustment also deducts from Core FFO capitalized amounts for third party costs during the period to originate or renew leases in our grocery-anchored shopping centers and office buildings. No adjustment is made in the calculation of AFFO for nonrecurring capital expenditures. We incurred legal costs pertaining to the extension of our management agreement with our Manager. The three-year evergreen extension was effective as of June 3, 2016. On May 25, 2017, we closed on the sale of our Enclave at Vista Ridge multifamily community to an unrelated third party. At such date, our Manager collected a cumulative total of approximately $390,000 of contingent fees. The sales transaction, and the fact that our capital contributions for the Enclave at Vista Ridge property achieved an annual rate of return which exceeded 7%, triggered the fees to become immediately due and payable to the Manager at the closing of the sale transaction. The recognition of these fees are added to FFO in the calculation of Core FFO as they are not likely to occur on a regular basis.\nSee Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures.\nPreferred Apartment

We calculate average stabilized physical occupancy for quarterly periods as the average number of occupied units on the 20th day of each of the trailing three months from the reporting period end date and that have been owned for at least 15 full months as of the end of the first quarter of each year. We exclude the operating results of properties for which construction of adjacent phases has commenced, properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses, or are being marketed for sale as of the end of the reporting period. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, our average stabilized physical occupancy was 95.3%. We calculate average stabilized physical occupancy for quarterly periods as the average number of occupied units on the 20th day of each of the trailing three months from the reporting period end date. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, our average economic occupancy was 95.3%. We define average economic occupancy as market rent reduced by vacancy losses, expressed as a percentage. All of our multifamily properties are included in these calculations except for properties which are not yet stabilized (which we define as properties having first achieved 93% physical occupancy for three full months in a quarter), properties which are owned for less than the entire reporting period and properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses or are adding additional phases (Stone Creek, Village at Baldwin Park, 525 Avalon Park and CityPark View). We also exclude properties which are currently being marketed for sale, of which there were none at December 31, 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe regularly incur capital expenditures related to our owned multifamily communities and student housing properties. Capital expenditures may be nonrecurring and discretionary, as part of a strategic plan intended to increase a property's value and corresponding revenue-generating ability, or may be normally recurring and necessary to maintain the income streams and present value of a property. Certain capital expenditures may be budgeted and reserved for upon acquiring a property as initial expenditures necessary to bring a property up to our standards or to add features or amenities that we believe make the property a compelling value to prospective residents in its individual market. These budgeted nonrecurring capital expenditures in connection with an acquisition are funded from the capital source(s) for the acquisition and are not dependent upon subsequent property operating cash flows for funding. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, our capital expenditures for multifamily communities and student housing properties consisted of:\nCapital Expenditures\nRecurring\nNon-recurring\nTotal\nAmount\nPer Unit\nAmount\nPer Unit\nAmount\nPer Unit\nAppliances\n$\n107,009\n$\n15.74\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n107,009\n$\n15.74\nCarpets\n399,481\n58.75\n—\n—\n399,481\n58.75\nWood / vinyl flooring\n89,823\n13.21\n—\n—\n89,823\n13.21\nFire safety\n—\n—\n10,155\n1.49\n10,155\n1.49\nHVAC\n52,318\n7.69\n—\n—\n52,318\n7.69\nComputers, equipment, misc.\n12,944\n1.90\n88,639\n13.04\n101,583\n14.94\nExterior painting\n—\n—\n19,550\n2.88\n19,550\n2.88\nLeasing office and other common amenities\n837\n0.12\n409,632\n60.25\n410,469\n60.37\nMajor structural projects\n—\n—\n2,012,090\n295.92\n2,012,090\n295.92\nCabinets and counter top upgrades\n—\n—\n483,151\n71.06\n483,151\n71.06\nLandscaping and fencing\n—\n—\n191,055\n28.10\n191,055\n28.10\nParking lot\n—\n—\n63,843\n9.39\n63,843\n9.39\nCommon area items\n—\n—\n115,123\n16.93\n115,123\n16.93\nTotals\n$\n662,412\n$\n97.41\n$\n3,393,238\n$\n499.06\n$\n4,055,650\n$\n596.47\nGrocery-Anchored Shopping Center Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2017, our grocery-anchored shopping center portfolio consisted of the following properties:\nProperty name\nLocation\nYear built\nGLA (1)\nPercent\nleased\nGrocery anchor\ntenant\nCastleberry-Southard\nAtlanta, GA\n2006\n80,018\n100.0\n%\nPublix\nCherokee Plaza\nAtlanta, GA\n1958\n102,864\n100.0\n%\nKroger\nLakeland Plaza\nAtlanta, GA\n1990\n301,711\n95.3\n%\nSprouts\nPowder Springs\nAtlanta, GA\n1999\n77,853\n95.1\n%\nPublix\nRockbridge Village\nAtlanta, GA\n2005\n102,432\n95.5\n%\nKroger\nRoswell Wieuca Shopping Center\nAtlanta, GA\n2007\n74,370\n100.0\n%\nThe Fresh Market\nRoyal Lakes Marketplace\nAtlanta, GA\n2008\n119,493\n84.4\n%\nKroger\nSandy Plains Exchange\nAtlanta, GA\n1997\n72,784\n93.2\n%\nPublix\nSummit Point\nAtlanta, GA\n2004\n111,970\n82.7\n%\nPublix\nThompson Bridge Commons\nAtlanta, GA\n2001\n92,587\n96.1\n%\nKroger\nWade Green Village\nAtlanta, GA\n1993\n74,978\n93.2\n%\nPublix\nWoodmont Village\nAtlanta, GA\n2002\n85,639\n98.4\n%\nKroger\nWoodstock Crossing\nAtlanta, GA\n1994\n66,122\n92.6\n%\nKroger\nEast Gate Shopping Center\nAugusta, GA\n1995\n75,716\n89.5\n%\nPublix\nFury's Ferry\nAugusta, GA\n1996\n70,458\n98.6\n%\nPublix\nParkway Centre\nColumbus, GA\n1999\n53,088\n97.4\n%\nPublix\nSpring Hill Plaza\nNashville, TN\n2005\n61,570\n100.0\n%\nPublix\nParkway Town Centre\nNashville, TN\n2005\n65,587\n100.0\n%\nPublix\nThe Market at Salem Cove\nNashville, TN\n2010\n62,356\n97.8\n%\nPublix\nThe Market at Victory Village\nNashville, TN\n2007\n71,300\n98.5\n%\nPublix\nThe Overlook at Hamilton Place\nChattanooga, TN\n1992\n213,095\n100.0\n%\nThe Fresh Market\nShoppes of Parkland\nMiami-Ft.

Second-generation capital expenditures exclude those expenditures made in our office building portfolio (i) to lease space to \"first generation\" tenants (i.e. leasing capital for existing vacancies and known move-outs at the time of acquisition), (ii) to bring recently acquired properties up to our Class A ownership standards (and which amounts were underwritten into the total investment at the time of acquisition) and (iii) for property re-developments and repositionings.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe disclose FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI, each of which meet the definition of \"non-GAAP financial measure\" set forth in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. As a result we are required to include in this filing a statement of why the Company believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. None of FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further FFO, Core FFO, AFFO and NOI should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO are not considered measures of liquidity and are not alternatives to measures calculated under GAAP.\nFunds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"FFO\")\nFFO is one of the most commonly utilized Non-GAAP measures currently in practice. In its 2002 \"White Paper on Funds From Operations,\" which was most recently revised in 2012, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, standardized the definition of how Net income/loss should be adjusted to arrive at FFO, in the interests of uniformity and comparability. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO as a meaningful supplemental gauge of our operating results, and as is most often presented by other REIT industry participants.\nThe NAREIT definition of FFO (and the one reported by the Company) is:\nNet income/loss:\nexcluding impairment charges on and gains/losses from sales of depreciable property; plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and deferred leasing costs; and after adjustments for the Company's proportionate share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nNot all companies necessarily utilize the standardized NAREIT definition of FFO, so caution should be taken in comparing the Company's reported FFO results to those of other companies. The Company's FFO results are comparable to the FFO results of other companies that follow the NAREIT definition of FFO and report these figures on that basis. FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders.\nCore Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"Core FFO\")\nCore FFO makes certain adjustments to FFO, which are either not likely to occur on a regular basis or are otherwise not representative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. For example, the Company incurs substantial costs related to property acquisitions, which, prior to 2017, were required to be recognized as expenses when they were incurred. The Company added back any such acquisition and pursuit costs, including costs incurred in connection with obtaining short term debt financing for acquisitions, subsequent refinancing of these assets, and beginning January 1, 2016, amortization of loan coordination fees to FFO in its calculation of Core FFO since such costs are not representative of our operating results. The Company also adds back any costs incurred related to the extension of our management agreement in June 2016 with our Manager, contingent fees paid to our Manager at the time of a property's sale, realized losses on debt extinguishment or refinancing, weather-related property operating losses and any non-cash dividends in this calculation. Core FFO figures reported by us may not be comparable to those Core FFO figures reported by other companies.\nWe utilize Core FFO as a measure of the operating performance of our portfolio of real estate assets. We believe Core FFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and may be useful in comparing our operating performance with other real estate companies that are not as involved in ongoing acquisition activities, though caution should be taken in comparing Core FFO results as other companies may calculate Core FFO differently. Core FFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders and Unitholders (\"AFFO\")\nAFFO makes further adjustments to Core FFO results in order to arrive at a more refined measure of operating and financial performance. There is no industry standard definition of AFFO and practice is divergent across the industry. The Company calculates AFFO as:\nCore FFO, plus:\nnon-cash equity compensation to directors and executives; amortization of loan closing costs, excluding costs incurred in connection with obtaining short term financing related to acquisitions; depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets; net loan fees received; accrued interest income received; non-cash dividends on Series M Preferred Stock; and amortization of lease inducements;\nLess:\nnon-cash loan interest income; cash paid for loan closing costs; amortization of acquired real estate intangible liabilities; amortization of straight line rent adjustments and deferred revenues; and normally-recurring capital expenditures and capitalized retail direct leasing costs.\nAFFO figures reported by us may not be comparable to those AFFO figures reported by other companies. We utilize AFFO as another measure of the operating performance of our portfolio of real estate assets. We believe AFFO is useful to investors as a supplemental gauge of our operating performance and may be useful in comparing our operating performance with other real estate companies. AFFO is a non-GAAP measure that is reconciled to its most comparable GAAP measure, net income/loss available to common stockholders. FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO are not considered measures of liquidity and are not alternatives to measures calculated under GAAP.\nMultifamily Established Communities' Same Store Net Operating Income (NOI)\nWe use same store net operating income as an operational metric for our established communities, enabling comparisons of those properties' operating results between the current reporting period and the prior year comparative period. We define our population of established communities as those that are stabilized and that have been owned for at least 15 full months, as of the end of the first quarter of each year, and exclude the operating results of properties for which construction of adjacent phases has commenced, and properties which are undergoing significant capital projects, have sustained significant casualty losses, or are being marketed for sale as of the end of the reporting period. We define net operating income as rental and other property revenues, less total property and maintenance expenses, property management fees, real estate taxes, general and administrative expenses, and property insurance. We believe that net operating income is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs because it provides measures of core operations, rather than factoring in depreciation and amortization, financing costs, acquisition costs, and other corporate expenses. Net operating income is a widely utilized measure of comparative operating performance in the REIT industry, but is not a substitute for the most comparable GAAP-compliant measure, net income/loss.\nAbout Preferred Apartment Communities, Inc.\nPreferred Apartment Communities, Inc.
