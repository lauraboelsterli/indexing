    "text": "CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (NYSE:FDP) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 29, 2017. For the full year, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $2.39, compared with earnings per diluted share of $4.33 for 2016. Comparable earnings per diluted share for the full year 2017 were $2.44, compared with comparable earnings per diluted share of $4.74 for the full year 2016. The Company reported a loss per share of $0.13 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 were a loss of $0.08, compared with comparable earnings per diluted share of $0.26 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We were pleased with the momentum in diversifying our business in 2017,” said Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout the year, we continued to execute our strategic initiatives to leverage our infrastructure and keep pace with the rapidly evolving consumer needs. We expanded our diverse product suite, led by our fresh-cut category that grew by 18 percent. We extended our presence in global markets by increasing our sourcing capabilities and distribution channels around the world. Our diversification strategy is working, and the investments we have made across our business are in progress. We expect this momentum to continue as we seek opportunities, such as our pending acquisition of Mann Packing, that will further strengthen our company, drive profitability, and increase shareholder value over the long-term.”\nNet sales for the year were $4,085.9 million, compared with $4,011.5 million in 2016. The increase in net sales for the full year was driven by higher sales in the Company's other fresh produce business segment. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $953.7 million, compared with $954.6 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease in net sales for the fourth quarter was due to lower sales in the Company's banana and prepared food business segments, partially offset by higher sales in the Company's other fresh produce business segment.\nGross profit for the year was $331.6 million, compared with gross profit of $461.4 million in 2016. The decrease in gross profit for the full year was primarily attributable to lower selling prices in the Company's banana and prepared food business segments and higher fruit and distribution costs in the Company's other fresh produce business segment, partially offset by lower ocean freight costs. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $51.0 million, compared with $56.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit for the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to higher fruit costs in the Company's other fresh produce business segment and lower selling prices in the Company's prepared food business segment, partially offset by lower ocean freight costs.\nOperating income for the year was $152.7 million, compared with an operating income of $244.2 million in 2016. Comparable operating income was $155.1 million in 2017, compared with $265.5 million in 2016. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $2.6 million, compared with operating income of $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable operating income for the fourth quarter was $5.2 million, compared with comparable operating income of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in operating income for the full year and fourth quarter was primarily attributable to lower gross profit.\nNet income attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. for the year was $120.8 million, compared with net income of $225.1 million in 2016. Comparable net income was $123.2 million, compared with comparable net income of $246.4 million in 2016. Net income attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. for the fourth quarter was a net loss of $6.3 million, compared with net income of $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable net loss was $3.7 million, compared with comparable net income of $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The change in net income for the full year and fourth quarter reflects lower gross profit and higher provision for income taxes.\nFresh Del Monte Produce Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (U.S. dollars in millions, except share and per share data) - (Unaudited) Quarter ended Year ended Income Statement: December 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nNet sales $ 953.7 $ 954.6 $ 4,085.9 $ 4,011.5 Cost of products sold 902.6 898.1 3,753.6 3,550.1 Other charges (1) 0.1 — 0.7 — Gross profit 51.0 56.5 331.6 461.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses 42.2 46.8 173.2 187.4 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, net (2) 4.2 5.1 3.0 — Asset impairment and other charges, net (1) 2.0 1.7 2.7 29.8 Operating income 2.6 2.9 152.7 244.2 Interest expense, net 1.9 1.3 5.6 3.4 Other expense, net 1.4 4.7 3.0 3.4 Income (loss) before income taxes (0.7 ) (3.1 ) 144.1 237.4 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 6.0 (13.6 ) 24.9 11.8 Net income (loss) $ (6.7 ) $ 10.5 $ 119.2 $ 225.6 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.4 ) (1.5 ) (1.6 ) 0.5 Net income (loss) attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. $ (6.3 ) $ 12.0 $ 120.8 $ 225.1 Net income (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. - Basic $ (0.13 ) $ 0.23 $ 2.40 4.37 Net income (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. - Diluted $ (0.13 ) $ 0.23 $ 2.39 $ 4.33 Dividends declared per ordinary share 0.15 0.15 $ 0.60 $ 0.55 Weighted average number of ordinary shares: Basic 49,224,216 51,740,318 50,247,881 51,507,755 Diluted 49,224,216 52,118,577 50,588,708 51,962,195 Selected Income Statement Data: Depreciation and amortization $ 19.8 $ 21.1 $ 80.3 $ 79.0 Non-GAAP Measures: Reported net income (loss) - Diluted $ (0.13 ) $ 0.23 $ 2.39 $ 4.33 Asset impairment and other charges, net (1) 0.04 0.03 0.07 0.57 Other (gain) loss on asset disposals, net (2) 0.01 — (0.02 ) (0.16 ) Comparable net income (loss) per share - Diluted (3) $ (0.08 ) $ 0.26 $ 2.44 $ 4.74 (1) For 2017, asset impairment and other charges, net for the quarter ended December 29, 2017 included charges related to: (1) the write-off of an investment venture in Africa, (2) impairment of the prepared trademark in the United Kingdom, (3) insurance recoveries for previously announced natural disasters in South America, net of additional charges, and (4) expenses related to the Kunia Well Site reserve.

Some of the information presented in this press release reflects adjustments to GAAP measures such as amounts related to restructuring, asset impairment charges, loss (gain) on sales of assets and certain other special items, if any. Management believes these adjustments provide a more comparable analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business. These adjustments result in non-GAAP financial measures and are referred to in this press release as comparable operating income, comparable net income and comparable net income per share. Because all companies do not use identical calculations, our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nComparable operating income (loss) and comparable net income (loss) provide us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business. We use comparable operating income (loss) and comparable net income (loss) to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because management believes they provide more comparable measures of our continuing business as they adjust for special items that are not reflective of the normal earnings of our business. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business because these measures:\n1. Are used by investors to measure a company's comparable operating performance;\n2. Are financial measurements that are used by lenders and other parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and\n3. Are used by our management for various purposes, including as measures of performance of our operating entities and as a basis of strategic planning and forecasting.\nConference Call and Web Cast Data\nFresh Del Monte will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and to review the Company’s progress and outlook.
