    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 1:57 PM / Updated 14 minutes ago British chemicals firm Croda ends merger talks with Ashland - source Ben Martin 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - British specialty chemicals maker Croda International Plc ( CRDA.L ) has ended talks with U.S. peer Ashland Global Holdings Inc ( ASH.N ) about a possible merger, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. \nThe unsuccessful deal talks show that Ashland is viewed among its rivals as a potential target for consolidation in the sector, following the initial public offering (IPO) of its automotive lubricants unit Valvoline Inc ( VVV.N ) in 2016. \nCroda, which has a market value of 5.6 billion pounds, ended talks with Ashland last month, the source said. \nDetails of the terminated discussions were not available. \nAshland, which has a market value of $4.5 billion (Â£3.2 billion), is active in more than 100 countries providing chemicals products to various industries including automotive, energy and construction. \nAshland did not respond to a request for comment.
