Mr. Zimmet is the founder of Zimmet Healthcare Services Group, LLC, a leading reimbursement-compliance & market intelligence consultancy serving the post-acute care industry.\nIn his new role at Greystone, Mr. Zimmet will provide specialized advisory services to Greystone clients, while also creating new lending and development opportunities for ZHSG’s diverse client base. Mr. Zimmet will hold dual roles, as he will remain CEO of Zimmet Healthcare and its related ancillary companies.\n“When considering a provider’s entire portfolio, assessing the full spectrum of financial risks and opportunities is critical, especially as investors enter new markets,” said Mr. Zimmet. “Healthcare is a local business; complex regulatory/reimbursement changes and rapidly evolving market dynamics threaten provider viability and exacerbate the financing burden. Our goal is to create efficiencies in both operations and debt service, while helping operators unlock the full potential of their investments. I am thrilled to combine the resources of my firm with the Greystone team at such an integral juncture in healthcare. This relationship will resonate throughout the industry as providers position themselves for regulatory and market reform.”\nIn 2017, Greystone originated over $1 billion in healthcare loans, primarily utilizing the FHA and Bridge lending platforms.

The firm’s related companies offer outsourced management and technology solutions to improve quality and efficiency.\nMr. Zimmet is an active member of multiple state and national industry associations, and serves on the Board of Directors of several healthcare provider and ancillary support companies. He holds an Accounting degree from Syracuse University and an MBA in Healthcare Administration from the Zicklin School of Business / Mount Sinai School of Medicine.\n“Combining Marc’s and his team’s broad strategic expertise in healthcare revenue cycle and market strategy with Greystone’s industry-leading lending services will create an unmatched offering for healthcare providers, and we are truly thrilled to have him on board,” said Mordecai Rosenberg, head of Greystone’s FHA lending group. “As Greystone continues to invest in providing the best resources, analytics and offerings to clients, we want to be known as an irreplaceable partner – the only partner to consider for success.”\nAbout Greystone\nGreystone is a real estate lending, investment and advisory company which consistently ranks as a top commercial lender.
