    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:BMCH) (“BMC” or the “Company”), one of the leading providers of diversified building products and services in the U.S. residential construction market, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures” section of this press release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights, Compared to the Prior Year Period\nNet sales of $840.9 million, an increase of 12.5% Net income of $17.6 million, an increase of $7.2 million, including $3.6 million of benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“2017 Tax Act”) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $47.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million Diluted earnings per share of $0.26, an increase of $0.10 per share Adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) of $0.23, an increase of $0.02 per share Cash provided by operating activities of $45.8 million, an increase of $2.7 million\nFull Year 2017 Highlights, Compared to Full Year 2016\nNet sales of $3.4 billion, an increase of 8.8% Net income of $57.4 million, an increase of $26.5 million, including a prior year pre-tax impairment charge of $11.9 million and a prior year pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $200.0 million, an increase of $6.1 million Diluted earnings per share of $0.85, an increase of $0.39 per share Adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) of $1.02, an increase of $0.08 per share Nearing completion of merger integration efforts, resulting in total annual run rate cost savings of approximately $48 million ReadyFrame® sales of $171 million\nCommenting on the Company’s performance, David Keltner, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of BMC, stated, “I’m very pleased with how the team closed out 2017. We saw an acceleration in the fourth quarter of year-over-year growth in our key, value-added product categories, including Structural Components and Millwork, Doors & Windows. In addition, as we near the completion of our integration efforts, we successfully achieved approximately $48 million in full year run rate cost savings from synergies.”\nKeltner continued, “As we enter 2018, the team is energized and eager to pursue and accelerate our growth strategies. Specifically, we intend to build upon our solid foundation of value-added products and services, while enhancing our operational excellence and high-performing culture to drive continuous improvement throughout the organization. We also expect to pursue our strategic expansion plans through additional bolt-on acquisitions.”\nJim Major, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for BMC, added, “This is a very exciting time to be at BMC. We believe positive fundamentals support our view that residential construction will continue to improve in 2018. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this environment with an advantageous leverage ratio and the expectation that operating cash flow will continue to improve year-over-year, which we intend to reinvest in our growth strategies and productivity initiatives. One such investment, the acquisition of Shone Lumber, was announced this morning. With a significant local presence in the new construction and professional remodeling space primarily in Delaware and Southeast Pennsylvania, Shone Lumber will add key capabilities and a diversified mix of customers and products to our Mid Atlantic division.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Summary of Financial Results\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated solid operating results.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (in thousands, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net sales Reported net sales (GAAP) $ 840,881 $ 747,574 $ 3,365,968 $ 3,093,743 Net income and EPS Net income (GAAP) 17,642 10,418 57,425 30,880 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) 0.26 0.16 0.85 0.46 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) 15,334 14,270 68,989 62,579 Adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) 0.23 0.21 1.02 0.94 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 47,566 44,450 200,003 193,890 Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) 5.7 % 5.9 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Net cash provided by operating activities 45,754 43,067 93,934 106,888 Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Compared to Prior Year Period\nNet sales increased 12.5% to $840.9 million. The Company estimates that net sales increased 6.3% from lumber and lumber sheet goods commodity price inflation, 4.0% from increased volumes and 2.2% from recent acquisitions. Gross profit increased 8.5% to $196.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of sales (“gross margin”) was 23.3%, compared to 24.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects an approximately 110 basis point decline in gross margin within the lumber and lumber sheet goods product category, as compared to the prior year, and a higher percentage of total net sales from the lumber and lumber sheet goods product category, which realizes lower than Company average gross margins. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $0.3 million of merger-related synergies within cost of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $14.1 million to $154.7 million, primarily related to $3.9 million of costs related to acquired companies, $2.7 million related to an increase in the provision for workers’ compensation claims and $6.1 million related to medical costs and changes in the quarterly timing of other benefits. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales declined 40 basis points to 18.4%, compared to 18.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Depreciation expense, including the portion reported within cost of sales, increased to $13.2 million, compared to $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment. Amortization expense was $4.1 million, compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease related to intangible assets that became fully amortized. Interest expense was $6.1 million in both periods. Other income, net was $3.3 million, compared to $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which consisted primarily of income related to the final settlement of insurance claims made by the Company for a fire at one of the Company’s facilities during 2015. Net income increased $7.2 million to $17.6 million, including a $3.6 million benefit from the 2017 Tax Act. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) increased to $15.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted net income of $14.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $47.6 million, an increase of $3.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) declined 20 basis points to 5.7%. Cash provided by operating activities of $45.8 million, an increase of $2.7 million, primarily due to higher net income.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results Compared to Full Year 2016\nNet sales increased 8.8% to $3.4 billion. The Company estimates that net sales increased 4.2% from lumber and sheet goods commodity price inflation, 2.8% from increased volumes and 1.8% from recent acquisitions. Gross profit increased 7.2% to $795.5 million. Gross margin was 23.6%, as compared to 24.0% for full year 2016. Gross margin for full year 2017 reflects an approximately 90 basis point decline in gross margin within the lumber and lumber sheet goods product category, as compared to the prior year, and a higher percentage of total net sales from the lumber and lumber sheet goods product category. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $7.4 million of merger-related synergies within cost of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.7 million to $619.5 million, primarily related to $16.5 million of increased shipping and handling costs to serve higher sales volumes, $12.5 million of incremental expenses from acquired operations, an increase in the provision for workers’ compensation claims of $5.6 million and an increase in health care costs of $5.5 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales declined to 18.4%, as compared to 18.5% in 2016. Depreciation expense, including the portion reported within cost of sales, increased to $53.2 million, as compared to $48.0 million in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment. Amortization expense was $16.0 million, as compared to $20.7 million in 2016. The decrease in amortization expense for full year 2017 related to intangible assets that became fully amortized. Interest expense decreased to $25.0 million, compared to $30.1 million in 2016. The decrease primarily resulted from the successful refinancing of the Company’s long-term notes in September 2016. Net income increased $26.5 million to $57.4 million. 2016 results included a pre-tax impairment charge of $11.9 million and a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $12.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $200.0 million, an increase of $6.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) declined 40 basis points to 5.9%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTotal liquidity as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $320.0 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of $11.8 million and $308.2 million of borrowing availability under the Company’s asset-backed revolver. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 totaled $12.0 million and $63.3 million, respectively. These expenditures were primarily used to fund purchases of vehicles and equipment to support increased sales volume and replace aged assets, and facility and technology investments to support our operations. In addition, the Company acquired approximately $2.5 million of assets during the full year 2017 under capital lease arrangements, consisting primarily of material handling equipment.\nCEO Search\nOn January 10, 2018, the Company announced that President and CEO, Peter C. Alexander left the Company under mutual agreement with the Board of Directors. David L. Keltner assumed the role of Interim President and CEO while the Board conducts a formal search for a permanent replacement. The Board of Directors has engaged a leading executive search firm and has formed a committee to oversee the process to find the individual with the right experience, vision and track record to accelerate the Company’s strategy.\nConference Call Information\nBMC will host a conference call on Tuesday February 27, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time and will simultaneously broadcast it live over the Internet.

BMC STOCK HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\n(unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share are intended as supplemental measures of the Company’s performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, Merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, impairment of assets, acquisition costs, loss on debt extinguishment, inventory step-up charges and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Adjusted net income is defined as net income plus Merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, impairment of assets, acquisition costs, loss on debt extinguishment, inventory step-up charges and other items, and after tax effecting those items, less the one-time benefit of the 2017 Tax Act. Adjusted net income per diluted share is defined as Adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average shares\nCompany management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and the board of directors. The Company believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share provides additional tools for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other distribution and retail companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Company management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share in isolation or as alternatives to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. Some of these limitations are: (i) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay taxes; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (v) although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and (vi) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing non-cash stock-based compensation. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per diluted share in conjunction with GAAP results. Readers should review the reconciliations of net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nBMC STOCK HOLDINGS, INC.
