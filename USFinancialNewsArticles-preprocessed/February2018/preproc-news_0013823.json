    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 11:12 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Preserving skiing's origins in China's remote west Natalie Thomas , Jason Lee 4 Min Read \nKHOM, China (Reuters) - On the western edge of China, Sulita straps on his skis and heads out into a winter morning. The temperature is -30 degrees Celsius (-22 Fahrenheit). \nFor much of the year, skiing is the only way to get around Khom, a village of wooden cabins heated by earthen stoves, five hours’ drive from the nearest major town in the northern Altay region of Xinjiang. \nThe design of skis such as the ones used by Sulita, who like many people in this region uses just one name, have barely changed for centuries. The bottom of the skis are covered with horse-hide and shoes are tied on with leather rope. \nThe direction of the horse fur allows the skis to slide forward, while preventing them from slipping backward when travelling uphill. \n\"I've been up the highest mountains with these,\" Sulita said. \"When I was young, we used the horse-hide skis a lot, for hunting or if we lost a cow or sheep.\" (Click reut.rs/2EKCjWn for a picture package on traditional skiing in western China.) \nXinjiang is a volatile region where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in violence between Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people, and ethnic majority Han Chinese, which Beijing blames on Islamist militants. Most of the violence has been in the far south of the region, rather than its far north. \nCave paintings discovered in Altay - today home to a mixture of ethnic Tuvans and Kazakhs - show rows of figures standing on what look like skis, with herds of animals running below them. \nArchaeologists have dated the paintings as 10,000 to 30,000 years old, according to Chinese ski historian Shan Zhaojian. \nThat would date them as much older than archaeological findings of skiing in Russia, cited by the International Ski Federation, the sport’s governing body, as coming from 6,300 to 5,000 BC. \n“It’s the earliest in the world that’s for sure,” said Shan. “I’ve got a total of 10 pieces of evidence that can prove this.” \nChina is keen to cash in on this historical connection.

REUTERS/Jason Lee \nThe country is set to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing and wants 300 million Chinese involved in winter sports before then. \nWith Shan’s help, the Xinjiang autonomous region government has organised races using traditional skis and recognises skiing as a cultural heritage. \nStill, the practice is slowly dying out. \nForty minutes outside Altay city, the regional capital, Slanbek still makes skis, but today they are just for show.

At the General’s Mountain resort, Mongolian folk-metal and Adele blast out over loudspeakers as children as young as five zip down the slopes. \nIts abundant snow and mountains make this region one of the best places for skiing in the country, and instructors hope some of the children training here might become Olympians. \nWhether the use of horse-hide skis survives will depend on the younger generation in the remote villages around Khom. \nAs the sun peeks over the mountains into valleys around Khom, Namujel, 13, races his horse-hide skis against his neighbour and friend Mieergenku, 12, who is using modern skis. \nThere’s no competition, Mieergenku zooms past, the clear winner. \nBut for Namujel it doesn’t matter. \n“We can’t just give up on the horse-hair skis, we have to pass them on to the next generation”, he said.
