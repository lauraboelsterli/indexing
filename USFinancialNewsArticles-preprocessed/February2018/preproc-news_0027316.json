The French federation said on Monday that some players had been interviewed by Scottish authorities. Slideshow (2 Images) Police Scotland said on Monday that ”following an initial report of sexual assault in Edinburgh city centre during the early hours of Monday 12 February, police conducted various lines of inquiry, including speaking to a number of potential witnesses. “These inquiries have established that no crime has been committed.” France lost their first two games, 15-13 at home to Ireland, and 32-26 to Scotland in Murrayfield last Saturday.
