    "text": "MOSCOW, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Monday it planned to reorganise its export operations to create an integrated international distribution unit responsible for all of its export deliveries, trading and marketing.\nGazprom said in a statement the reorganisation would take place in two stages over two years.\nIt said the first stage would involve merging and streamlining the assets and activities of Gazprom Germany, which handles a large proportion of the groupâ€™s exports. The second stage would see Gazprom Germany operationally merged with Gazprom Export, it said. (Reporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n ",
