    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 9:33 AM / in 6 hours Asia gold price dip perks up demand ahead of festive, wedding seasons Nithin ThomasPrasad , Rajendra Jadhav 3 Min Read \nBENGALURU/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Physical gold demand in Asia picked up towards the end of the week, as a pullback in prices spurred purchases ahead of the Lunar New Year in China and the wedding season in India. \nSpot gold has declined about 1 percent so far this week and was headed for a second straight weekly drop due to a recovery in the dollar. \n“Retail buyers are comfortable with the current price range,” said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai. \nLocal gold prices have declined more than 2 percent since rising to 30,720 rupees per 10 gram last week, the highest since Nov. 9, 2016. \nDealers were charging a premium of up to $1.5 an ounce on Friday over official domestic prices, down from $2 last week. The domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax. \n“Demand is not great but the market is still in premium due to limited supplies. Imports were lower last month,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank. \nIndia’s gold imports in January dropped 37 percent from a year earlier to their lowest in 17 months as buyers postponed purchases in expectation of a cut in the import tax. \nGold demand in India is likely to remain below its 10-year average for a third year in 2018 as higher taxes and new transparency rules on purchases may cap last year’s rebound in buying, the World Gold Council said on Tuesday.

That’s why the market is getting squeezed a bit and premiums are a little higher now,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore. \n“Dealers generally try to get in more inventory during this period to at least get through the one tight week during the Chinese New Year.” \nPremiums for the precious metal in Singapore were slightly higher this week at between 80 cents and $1 an ounce, compared with 60-80 cents last week. \n“There’s no shortage of gold or anything, but it’s because of the festival season and the production schedule,” said Lan. \nIn Japan, gold was sold at par after being on discount for the past few weeks, according to a Tokyo-based trader.
