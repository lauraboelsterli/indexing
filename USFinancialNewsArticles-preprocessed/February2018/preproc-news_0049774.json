Executed an amendment to Mammoth subsidiary Cobra Acquisitions LLC's contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, to aid in the restoration of the electric utility infrastructure in Puerto Rico, increasing the total contract value to approximately $445 million, up from $200 million originally. 2018 capital expenditures expected to be approximately $125.0 million for expanding infrastructure operations, upgrading and expanding sand facilities, expanding the rental fleet into the mid-continent and adding selective equipment.\nArty Straehla, Mammoth's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"The expansion that Mammoth undertook in 2017 has built a base in three core areas - infrastructure, pressure pumping and sand - that will serve as a platform on which to grow going forward. With the core businesses now in place, we intend to strategically build upon these business segments throughout 2018 and we expect to begin generating significant free cash flows that will be used to bolster our balance sheet, while providing flexibility to expand into the areas where we see the best opportunities.\"\nPressure Pumping Services\nMammoth's pressure pumping segment contributed revenues (inclusive of intersegment revenues) of $111.9 million on 1,375 stages for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a 46% increase from $76.7 million on 1,617 stages for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and a 247% increase from $32.3 million on 764 stages for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Effective October 19, 2017, Cobra entered into an emergency master services agreement with PREPA for repairs to PREPA’s electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. The initial PREPA contract has a one-year term and provided for up to $200.0 million of revenue. The initial PREPA contract was fully applied to services performed by Cobra as of January 3, 2018. On January 28, 2018, Cobra and PREPA amended the initial PREPA contract to increase the total contract amount by an additional $245.4 million of revenue up to a total of $445.4 million in revenue.\nNatural Sand Proppant Production\nMammoth's natural sand proppant segment contributed revenues (inclusive of intersegment revenues) of $43.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a 34% increase from $32.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and a 285% increase from $11.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Tons of sand sold increased 147% from 683,768 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 1,690,032 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company completed the acquisitions of Taylor Frac and the Chieftain Sand assets (renamed Piranha Proppant) during the second quarter of 2017 with sand sales from the Piranha Proppant facility commencing in June 2017. The expansion of the Taylor Frac facility is underway with the expectation of increasing capacity to 1.75 Mmtpa (up from 0.7 Mmtpa) by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Once the Taylor Frac expansion is completed, Mammoth's processing capacity will grow to approximately 4 Mmtpa. The Company intends to upgrade certain equipment at its Piranha facility, which is expected to further increase its total sand processing capacity to 4.4 Mmtpa by mid-year 2018.\nContract Land and Directional Drilling Services\nMammoth's contract land and directional drilling segment contributed revenues (inclusive of intersegment revenues) of $13.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $11.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Five horizontal rigs on average operated during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 compared to four during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The average drilling day rate was $15,964, $14,800 and $13,590, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nThe drilling segment contributed revenues (inclusive of intersegment revenues) of $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 58% from $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Five horizontal rigs on average operated during the year ended December 31, 2017, at an average day rate of $14,800 compared to four rigs at an average day rate of $12,900 during the year ended December 31, 2016. During 2018, Mammoth anticipates five to six rigs will operate on average throughout the year.\nOther Services\nMammoth's other services, including coil tubing, pressure control, flowback, cementing, equipment rentals and remote accommodations, contributed revenues (inclusive of intersegment revenues) of $15.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $17.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $10.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues for other services (inclusive of intersegment revenues) were $51.7 million and $41.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The increase is primarily due to revenues derived from Stingray Cementing and Stingray Energy Services, which were acquired in June 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased to $27.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $6.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The sequential increase is primarily attributable to increased bad debt expense and increased compensation and benefits. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 5% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 9% for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nSG&A expenses increased to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefits, bad debt expense, and professional service charges. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 8% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net debt of approximately $94.3 million reflecting $99.9 million in borrowings outstanding under our $170.0 million revolving credit facility and $5.6 million of cash on hand.

On October 12, 2016, the Partnership was converted into a Delaware limited liability company named Mammoth Energy Partners LLC (\"Mammoth LLC\"), and then each member of Mammoth LLC contributed all of its membership interests in Mammoth LLC to the Company. Prior to the conversion and the contribution, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership. Following the conversion and the contribution, Mammoth LLC (as the converted successor to the Partnership) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nIn October 2016, Mammoth completed its initial public offering (the \"IPO\") and its common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “TUSK.” Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this release to Mammoth or the Company, when used in a historical context for periods prior to October 12, 2016 refer to the Partnership and its subsidiaries. References in this release to Mammoth or the Company, when used for periods beginning on or after October 12, 2016 refer to Mammoth and its subsidiaries.\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer comprise the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker function (\"CODM\"). Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the CODM manages the segments, evaluates the segment financial statements, and makes key operating and resource utilization decisions. Segment evaluation is determined on a quantitative basis based on a function of operating income (loss) as well as a qualitative basis, such as nature of the product and service offerings and types of customers.\nBased on the CODM's assessment, effective December 31, 2017, the Company identified four reportable segments: pressure pumping services; infrastructure services; natural sand proppant services; and contract land and directional drilling services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company identified five reportable segments consisting of pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services. The Company changed its reportable segment presentation in 2017, as it no longer considers well services activities, which included Redback Energy Services, Redback Coil Tubing and Mammoth Energy Partners, and its other energy services activities, which included Sand Tiger, to be significant to the understanding of the Company's results. The Company now presents the results of its well service and other energy service activities as \"Other.\" Additionally, during 2017, the Company added a new reportable segment for its infrastructure service activities. The financial results by segment below for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect this change in reportable segments.\nPrior to 2017, information used by the CODM in measuring segment profits or losses did not include intersegment revenues and costs as they were deemed immaterial for decision-making purposes. In 2017, the Company's CODM changed the way segment profits and losses are measured to include intersegment revenues and expenses. The financial results by segment below for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect this change in measurement method.\nOn June 5, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of (1) Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries Taylor Frac, LLC, Taylor Real Estate Investments, LLC and South River Road, LLC (collectively, \"Sturgeon\"); (2) Stingray Energy Services, LLC and (3) Stingray Cementing, LLC (together with Stingray Energy Services, the “Stingray Acquisition”) in exchange for the issuance by Mammoth of an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock.\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company and Sturgeon were under common control and it is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to account for this common control acquisition in a manner similar to the pooling of interest method of accounting. Therefore, the Company's historical financial information has been recast to combine Sturgeon with the Company as if the acquisition had been completed at commencement of Sturgeon's operations on September 13, 2014.\nConference Call Information\nMammoth will host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. CST to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial and operational results.

Mammoth defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition related costs, one-time compensation charges associated with the IPO, equity based compensation, interest expense, bargain purchase gain, other (income) expense, net (which is comprised of the (gain) or loss on disposal of long-lived assets) and provision (benefit) for income taxes. The Company excludes the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the energy service industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Mammoth's operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Mammoth's computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a widely followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure its ability to meet debt service requirements.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) on a consolidated basis and for each of the Company's segments.\nConsolidated\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 65,915 $ (57,706 ) $ (801 ) $ 58,964 $ (92,453 ) Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 27,770 17,832 27,224 92,124 72,315 Impairment of long-lived assets 4,146 — — 4,146 1,871 Acquisition related costs 51 — 264 2,506 — One-time IPO compensation charges — 1,201 — — 1,201 Equity based compensation 1,093 520 1,028 3,741 501 Interest expense 1,381 763 1,420 4,310 4,096 Bargain purchase gain — — — (4,012 ) — Other (income) expense, net (28 ) 214 319 677 (158 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 10,155 51,146 (1,413 ) 2,832 53,885 Adjusted EBITDA $ 110,483 $ 13,970 $ 28,041 $ 165,288 $ 41,258 Pressure Pumping Services\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 6,338 $ 248 $ 3,744 $ 11,451 $ (4,568 ) Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 13,590 9,049 13,039 45,413 37,013 Impairment of long-lived assets — — — — 139 Acquisition related costs — — 1 1 — One-time IPO compensation charges — 102 — — 102 Equity based compensation 438 176 428 1,641 176 Interest expense 599 96 592 1,622 599 Other expense, net 2 2 120 129 27 Adjusted EBITDA $ 20,967 $ 9,673 $ 17,924 $ 60,257 $ 33,488 Infrastructure Services\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 47,873 $ — $ 1,366 $ 48,537 $ — Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 1,805 — 1,039 3,185 — Acquisition related costs 8 — 48 98 — Equity based compensation 316 — 29 345 — Interest expense 168 — 68 241 — Other expense, net (4 ) — 10 6 — Provision for income taxes 29,290 — — 29,290 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 79,456 $ — $ 2,560 $ 81,702 $ — Natural Sand Proppant Services\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 5,263 $ (751 ) $ 1,565 $ 9,474 $ (4,709 ) Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 2,791 1,749 3,034 9,394 6,483 Impairment of long-lived assets 324 — — 324 — Acquisition related costs 42 — 167 2,163 — One-time IPO compensation charges — 33 — — 33 Equity based compensation 184 57 272 708 57 Interest expense 107 114 87 679 434 Bargain purchase gain — — — (4,012 ) — Other (income) expense, net (40 ) 14 98 211 96 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (36 ) — 24 (4 ) 4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,635 $ 1,216 $ 5,247 $ 18,937 $ 2,398 Contract Land and Directional Drilling Services\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss: (in thousands) Net loss $ (8,910 ) $ (6,287 ) $ (5,017 ) $ (27,244 ) $ (30,358 ) Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 4,657 5,268 5,036 19,635 21,512 Impairment of long-lived assets 3,822 — — 3,822 347 Acquisition related costs — — (16 ) 8 — One-time IPO compensation charges — 964 — — 964 Equity based compensation 77 110 138 507 110 Interest expense 467 556 570 1,695 2,829 Other (income) expense, net (6 ) 68 38 256 248 Adjusted EBITDA $ 107 $ 679 $ 749 $ (1,321 ) $ (4,348 ) Other\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss): (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 15,386 $ (50,916 ) $ (2,459 ) $ 16,780 $ (52,820 ) Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 4,927 1,766 5,076 14,497 7,307 Impairment of long-lived assets — — — — 1,385 Acquisition related costs 2 — 65 237 — One-time IPO compensation charges — 102 — — 102 Equity based compensation 77 176 162 539 157 Interest expense 40 (3 ) 103 73 234 Other expense (income), net 20 130 53 75 (529 ) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (19,099 ) 51,145 (1,437 ) (26,454 ) 53,881 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,353 $ 2,400 $ 1,563 $ 5,747 $ 9,717\nSource:Mammoth Energy Services, Inc.",
