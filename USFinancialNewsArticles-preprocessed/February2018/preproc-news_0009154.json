    "text": "South Korea says North stole cryptocurrency worth billions of won last year Published 11 Hours Ago Updated 10 Hours Ago Reuters \nSouth Korea said on Monday that North Korea last year stole cryptocurrency from the South worth billions of won and that it was still trying to hack into its exchanges. \n\"North Korea sent emails that could hack into cryptocurrency exchanges and their customers' private information and stole (cryptocurrency) worth billions of won,\" said Kim Byung-kee, a member of South Korea's parliamentary intelligence committee. \nTo put \"billions\" in perspective, 1 billion won equals $917,400. \nKim did not disclose which exchanges were hacked. \nHe added that the country's spy agency assumed that North Korea was continuously trying to hack into exchanges to steal cryptocurrency and that it was trying its best to prevent further hacking. \nâ€”CNBC contributed to this report",
