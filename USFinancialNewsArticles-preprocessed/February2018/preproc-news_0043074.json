    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Italy’s Sofia Goggia was leading the Olympic women’s downhill with a time of one minute, 39.22 seconds after the first 20 skiers had completed the run at the Jeongseon Alpine centre on Wednesday.\nNorwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel was in silver medal position in 1:39.31 with American Lindsey Vonn, the 2010 champion, third in 1.39.69.\nThe remainder of the 39-strong field are outsiders but a shock result cannot be ruled out as Ester Ledecka showed by winning the Pyeongchang super-G in bib 26 at the weekend.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
