The Company’s reported results include $68.9 million of non-cash, one-time, tax benefits related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\"), partially offset by $37.6 million of one-time lease termination and other non-recurring costs associated with the recently announced restructuring of the Company's SmartStyle ® salon portfolio, and $3.5 million of other discrete costs. Excluding these tax benefits, restructuring charges, discrete items, and the loss from discontinued operations, the Company reported second quarter 2018 as adjusted net income of $2.9 million, or $0.06 earnings per diluted share versus net income of $1.7 million, or $0.04 earnings per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nTotal revenue in the quarter of $308.5 million decreased $6.7 million, or 2.1%, year-over-year driven primarily by the closure, or re-franchising of 448 salons. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $18.2 million was $1.0 million, or 6.0% favorable year-over-year.\nOn a full year basis, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $50.1 million, or $1.07 per diluted share as compared to net income from continuing operations of $6.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, EBITDA of $42.1 million increased $2.2 million, or 5.5% versus the same period last year.\nHugh Sawyer, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Restructuring the non-performing elements of our company-owned salon portfolio in order to focus on the performing core, and the growth of our franchise business, has been a key element of our strategy.” Mr. Sawyer continued, “The second quarter represents an important milestone where we substantially completed the restructuring phase of our strategic transformation and operational turnaround. Moreover, we are pleased to report initial signs of progress in both our quarterly and year-over-year adjusted EBITDA results.”\nSale of Company’s Mall-based Salons and U.K. Business\nIn October 2017, after a comprehensive process, the Company reached the strategic conclusion to sell, and subsequently franchise, substantially all of its mall-based salon business in North America, representing 858 salons, and substantially all of its International segment, representing approximately 250 salons in the U.K. This transaction clarified the Company's strategy by focusing its company-owned salon portfolio in North America on the value segment. At the same time, this outcome was consistent with the Company's previously stated strategic imperative to accelerate the growth of its franchise portfolio.\nDue to this transaction, the Company has classified the results of its mall-based business and its International segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Included within discontinued operations are the impairment charges, results of operations, and professional fees associated with the transaction, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017. The operations of the mall-based business and International segment, which were previously recorded in the North American Value, North American Premium and International reporting segments, have been eliminated from ongoing operations of the Company. The new Company-owned segment is comprised of its SmartStyle ® , Supercuts ® and Signature Style ® concepts.\nRestructuring of Company-Owned SmartStyle ® Portfolio\nIn December 2017, the Company committed to close 597 non-performing Company-owned SmartStyle ® salons in January 2018. The 597 non-performing salons generated negative cash flow of approximately $15 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. The action delivers on the Company's commitment to restructure its salon portfolio to improve shareholder value and position the Company for long-term growth. The Company anticipates this action will allow the Company to reallocate capital and human resources to strategically grow its remaining SmartStyle ® salons with creative new offerings.\nAs part of the agreement, the Company recorded a net $24.0 million charge to rent expense in the second quarter driven primarily by $27.3 million of one-time lease termination and other related closure costs, partially offset by a $3.3 million reversal of deferred rent for the impacted salons. The Company also committed to return the salons to its pre-occupancy condition, or “modified white boxes”, and recorded $7.5 million in depreciation expense. Additionally, as part of the closures, the Company recorded inventory and fixed asset impairments of $0.6 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nSecond Quarter Segment Results\nCompany-Owned Salons\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Decrease)\nIncrease\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Decrease)\nIncrease\n(Dollars in millions) (1) 2017 2016(2) 2017 2016(2) Total Revenue $ 280.0 $ 296.2 (5.5)% $ 568.7 $ 595.6 (4.5)% Same-Store Sales Comps (0.7 )% (2.5 )% 180 bps (0.2 )% (1.1 )% 90 bps Year-over-Year Ticket change 2.5 % 3.0 % Year-over-Year Traffic change (3.2 )% (3.2 )% Gross Profit, as Adjusted(3) 117.7 116.3 1.2 %\n242.1 239.5 1.1 %\nas a percent of revenue 42.0 % 39.2 % 280 bps 42.6 % 40.2 % 240 bps EBITDA, as Adjusted 26.5 26.9 (1.2)% 59.8 59.9 (0.2)% as a percent of revenue 9.5 % 9.1 % 40 bps 10.5 % 10.1 % 40 bps\n(1) Variances calculated on amounts shown in millions may result in rounding differences. (2) Amounts for fiscal year 2017 have been revised for discontinued operations due to the October sale of the mall-based business and the International segment. (3) Gross profit, as Adjusted, excludes depreciation and amortization. Second quarter revenue for the Company-owned salon segment decreased 5.5% versus the prior year to $280.0 million. The year-over-year decline in revenue was driven by the closure of unprofitable salons, the refranchising of salons, and a decrease in same-store sales of 0.7% partially offset by increase in average ticket and a favorable foreign currency impact in the Company’s Canadian business.\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA of $26.5 million declined $0.3 million, or 1.2% versus the same period last year driven primarily by same-store sales declines and investments in a strategic digital marketing campaign, partially offset by the closing of unprofitable salons, benefits from the Company's strategic initiative plan, and a one-time benefit related to the discontinuance of a limited loyalty program test.\nFranchise Operations\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions) (1) 2017 2016(2) 2017 2016(2) Total Revenue $ 28.6 $ 19.0 50.2% $ 49.6 $ 38.4 29.2% EBITDA, as Adjusted 9.8 8.2 19.5% 19.6 16.7 17.2% as a percent of revenue 34.3 % 43.1 % (880) bps 39.4 % 43.5 % (410) bps\n(1) Variances calculated on amounts shown in millions may result in rounding differences. (2) Amounts for fiscal year 2017 have been revised for discontinued operations due to the October sale of the mall-based business and the International segment. Second quarter Franchise revenue was $28.6 million, a $9.5 million, or 50.2%, increase compared to the prior year quarter. Royalties and fees were $13.5 million, a $2.1 million, or 18.2% increase versus the same period last year. Royalties increased 9.9% driven primarily by positive same-store revenue and increased franchise salon counts. Initial franchise fees increased $1.2 million as the Company opened, or converted, a net 108 franchised locations in the quarter as compared to 41 in the prior year quarter. Franchise adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 million improved $1.6 million, or 19.5% year-over-year.\nOther Company Updates\nConsolidated Year-Over-Year General & Administrative (\"G&A\") Comparability\nThe Company announced during the first fiscal quarter a realignment of its field leadership team by brand. An outcome of this reorganization is that the costs associated with senior district leaders have been moved out of cost of goods sold and site operating expense, where the expense has historically been recorded, and into G&A. The Company notes that this change does not impact the overall consolidated results but does result in an $8.9 million decrease in cost of goods sold and site expense, and a corresponding $8.9 million increase to G&A this quarter, when compared to the comparable period last year. On a year-to-date basis, this reclassification of expenses decreased cost of goods sold and site expense, and had a corresponding increase to G&A, of $15.1 million versus the same period last year.\nTransformational Strategy Update\nThe Company continued to make progress implementing its transformational strategy and operational turnaround initiatives focused on improving the performance of company-owned salons, while at the same time accelerating the growth of its franchise portfolio. During the quarter, the Company:\nClosed on a transaction to sell, and subsequently franchise, substantially all of its mall-based salon business in North America and substantially all of its International segment. This transaction moved approximately 1,100 salons from the company-owned segment to the franchise segment. Committed to closing 597 non-performing, cash flow negative Company-owned SmartStyle ® salons in January 2018. Executed a number of operational initiatives, building on its previously discussed 120-day plan, to help stabilize performance and establish a platform for longer-term revenue and earnings growth in Company-owned salons. The Company estimates the initiatives delivered benefit in a range of $7.0 million to $9.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Initiated a review of non-core, non-essential, G&A costs associated with the Company’s field and corporate restructuring efforts. Announced its industry-exclusive agreement with LSMx, a Buxton local store marketing application. Buxton is a leading customer analytics provider for over 4,000 retailers. The Company currently intends to use LSMx, and its advanced customer data insights, to drive hyper-local, targeted marketing for its corporate and franchise salons. Entered into an industry-exclusive, multi-year sponsorship with Major League Baseball (\"MLB\") for the Supercuts ® brand. The Supercuts ® sponsorship will be implemented throughout MLB’s core marketing platforms including broadcast, digital, mobile and social. Greatly reduced the complexity of the service offerings in its SmartSyle ® portfolio with the introduction of “Everyday Simple Pricing” while also introducing a new “Express Haircut” service targeted toward male guests who shop at Walmart ® .\nTax Update\nAs a result of the recently enacted Tax Reform, the Company recognized a one-time, non-cash, tax benefit of $68.9 million in the quarter related to impacts on its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The reduction in U.S. Federal corporate income tax rates, and a change in the net operating loss rules, were the primary drivers of this benefit.\nNon-GAAP reconciliations:\nFor GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please refer to attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\".

Presentation of the non-GAAP measures allows investors to review our core ongoing operating performance from the same perspective as management and the Board of Directors. These non-GAAP financial measures provide investors an enhanced understanding of our operations, facilitate investors’ analyses and comparisons of our current and past results of operations and provide insight into the prospects of our future performance. We also believe the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information research analysts frequently use to analyze financial performance.\nThe method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from methods used by other companies. These non-GAAP results should not be regarded as a substitute for corresponding U.S. GAAP measures but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of operating performance in evaluating our business. Non-GAAP measures do have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be viewed in conjunction with both our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliation of the selected U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, which are located in the Investor Information section of the corporate website at www.regiscorp.com .\nNon-GAAP reconciling items for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThe following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within U.S. GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as “items impacting comparability” based on how management views our business, makes financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluates the Company’s ongoing performance. The following items have been excluded from our non-GAAP results:\nSmartStyle restructuring costs. Severance expense for former executive officers. Professional fees. Executive transition costs. Gain on life insurance proceeds. Goodwill derecognition. Impact of tax reform.

The impacts of the income tax provision adjustments associated with the above items, impact of tax reform and the SmartStyle restructuring costs included within depreciation and amortization are already included in the U.S. GAAP reported net income (loss) to EBITDA reconciliation, therefore there is no adjustment needed for the reconciliation from EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Company- owned Franchise Corporate Consolidated Consolidated reported net income (loss), as reported (U.S. GAAP) $ (20,211 ) $ 9,703 $ 43,228 $ 32,720 Interest expense, as reported — — 2,169 2,169 Income taxes, as reported — — (76,462 ) (76,462 ) Depreciation and amortization, as reported 22,054 91 2,806 24,951 EBITDA (as defined above) $ 1,843 $ 9,794 $ (28,259 ) $ (16,622 ) SmartStyle restructuring costs, net 24,686 — 15 24,701 Severance — — 2,295 2,295 Professional fees — — 806 806 Executive transition costs — — 146 146 Goodwill derecognition — — 271 271 Discontinued operations, net of tax — — 6,601 6,601 Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measure $ 26,529 $ 9,794 $ (18,125 ) $ 18,198 Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Company- owned Franchise Corporate Consolidated Consolidated reported net income (loss), as reported (U.S. GAAP) $ 16,658 $ 8,105 $\n(26,982\n)\n$\n(2,219\n)\nInterest expense, as reported — — 2,153 2,153 Income taxes, as reported — — 719 719 Depreciation and amortization, as reported 10,203 89 2,354 12,646 EBITDA (as defined above) $ 26,861 $ 8,194 $\n(21,756\n)\n$\n13,299\nProfessional fees — — 673 673 Discontinued operations, net of tax — — 3,201 3,201 Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measure $ 26,861 $ 8,194 $\n(17,882\n)\n$\n17,173\nSix Months Ended December 31, 2017 Company- owned Franchise Corporate Consolidated Consolidated reported net income (loss), as reported (U.S. GAAP) $ 3,139 $ 19,399 $ (12,793 ) $ 9,745 Interest expense, as reported — — 4,307 4,307 Income taxes, as reported — — (71,630 ) (71,630 ) Depreciation and amortization, as reported 31,948 183 5,075 37,206 EBITDA (as defined above) $ 35,087 $ 19,582 $ (75,041 ) $ (20,372 ) SmartStyle restructuring costs, net 24,686 — 15 24,701 Severance — — 2,828 2,828 Professional fees — — 1,636 1,636 Executive transition costs — — 418 418 Gain on life insurance proceeds — — (7,986 ) (7,986 ) Goodwill derecognition — — 542 542 Discontinued operations, net of tax — — 40,368 40,368 Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measure $ 59,773 $ 19,582 $ (37,220 ) $ 42,135 Six Months Ended December 31, 2016 Company- owned Franchise Corporate Consolidated Consolidated reported net income (loss), as reported (U.S. GAAP) $ 40,124 $ 16,535 $ (55,597 ) $ 1,062 Interest expense, as reported — — 4,316 4,316 Income taxes, as reported — — 3,459 3,459 Depreciation and amortization, as reported 19,798 179 4,778 24,755 EBITDA (as defined above) $ 59,922 $ 16,714 $ (43,044 ) $ 33,592 Professional fees — — 673 673 Discontinued operations, net of tax — — 5,660 5,660 Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measure $ 59,922 $ 16,714 $ (36,711 ) $ 39,925 REGIS CORPORATION\nReconciliation by reportable segment of reported U.S. GAAP gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization) to adjusted gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization), a non-GAAP financial measure\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nGross profit\nThe Company defines gross profit as service and product revenues less cost of service and cost of product, excluding depreciation and amortization.
