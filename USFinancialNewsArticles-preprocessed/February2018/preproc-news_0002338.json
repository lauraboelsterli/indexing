    "text": "ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Belden Inc. (NYSE: BDC), a global leader in high quality, end-to-end signal transmission solutions for mission-critical applications, today reported fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017 results for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nOn a GAAP basis, revenues for the quarter totaled $604.9 million, declining 1.2% from $612.4 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $30.5 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 8.7%, compared to $33.4 million in the year-ago period. Net income was impacted by a one-time charge of $28.4 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Net income as a percentage of revenues was 5.0%, decreasing 40 basis points from 5.4% in the prior-year period. EPS totaled $0.51 compared to $0.58 in the fourth quarter 2016. The one-time charge as a result of the TCJA enactment had an EPS impact of $0.67.\nThe $604.9 million of quarterly revenue represents a decrease of $3.3 million, or 0.6%, compared to adjusted revenue of $608.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.2%, decreasing 190 basis points compared to 20.1% in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS was $1.62, increasing 14.1% compared to $1.42 in the fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted results are non-GAAP measures, and a non-GAAP reconciliation table is provided as an appendix to this release.\nJohn Stroup, President, CEO, and Chairman of Belden Inc., said, “Most of our businesses performed in line with our expectations, with the exception of an isolated situation in our Broadcast Solutions segment. We had expected to recognize revenue on $36 million of product that was shipped in 2017, but we were unable to do so as a result of technical U.S. GAAP revenue recognition requirements identified by our team during the year-end closing process. As a result, these 2017 shipments will now be recognized as revenue in 2018 and will be additive to the revenue that we otherwise would have anticipated.”\nFull Year 2017\nOn a GAAP basis, revenue for the year totaled $2.389 billion, up 1.4% compared to $2.357 billion in the full year 2016. Net income was $93.2 million, a decrease of $34.8 million compared to $128.0 million in 2016. Net income was impacted by a $32.2 million after-tax loss on debt extinguishment related to our debt refinancing and repayment during the year. In addition, net income was impacted by a one-time charge of $28.4 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. Net income as a percentage of revenue was 3.9% for the full year compared to 5.4% in 2016. EPS was $1.37 compared to $2.65 in 2016.\nThe $2.389 billion of annual revenue represents an increase of $30.8 million, or 1.3%, over the adjusted revenues of $2.358 billion in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.2%, declining 10 basis points compared to 18.3% in 2016. Adjusted net income was $265.0 million, increasing $25.0 million, or 10.4%, compared to $240.0 million in 2016. Adjusted EPS increased 1.5% to $5.35, compared to $5.27 in 2016.\nMr. Stroup remarked, “2017 was highlighted by significant improvements to our balance sheet and disciplined capital deployment. We are pleased with the acquisition of Thinklogical and increased investment in organic initiatives, which we expect to drive meaningful growth in future periods.”\nOutlook\n“I am optimistic about our opportunities to drive meaningful organic and inorganic growth, as we continue to pursue a number of attractive acquisition opportunities that complement our strategic plans. We also expect our proven Lean enterprise system to continue to drive substantial margin expansion,” said Mr. Stroup.\nThe Company expects first quarter 2018 revenue to be $575 - $595 million. For the full year ending December 31, 2018, the Company expects revenue to be $2.528 - $2.578 billion compared to the previously guided range of $2.492 - $2.542 billion. This $36.0 million increase reflects the delayed revenue recognition described above.\nThe Company expects first quarter 2018 GAAP EPS to be $0.37 - $0.47. For the full year ending December 31, 2018, the Company now expects GAAP EPS to be $3.96 - $4.21, compared to the previously guided range of $4.33 - $4.58.\nThe Company expects first quarter 2018 adjusted EPS to be $1.05 - $1.15. For the full year ending December 31, 2018, the Company continues to expect adjusted EPS of $5.95 - $6.20. This guidance includes an increase in EPS related to the delayed revenue recognition and an offsetting impact of a higher effective tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA.\nEarnings Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call today at 8:30 am ET to discuss results of the quarter. The listen-only audio of the conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet at http://investor.belden.com . The dial-in number for participants in the U.S. is 800-281-7973; the dial-in number for participants outside the U.S. is 323-794-2093.

We adjust for the items listed above in all periods presented, unless the impact is clearly immaterial to our financial statements. When we calculate the tax effect of the adjustments, we include all current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the adjusted measure of pre-tax profitability. We utilize the adjusted results to review our ongoing operations without the effect of these adjustments and for comparison to budgeted operating results. We believe the adjusted results are useful to investors because they help them compare our results to previous periods and provide important insights into underlying trends in the business and how management oversees our business operations on a day-to-day basis. As an example, we adjust for the purchase accounting effect of recording deferred revenue at fair value in order to reflect the revenues that would have otherwise been recorded by acquired businesses had they remained as independent entities. We believe this presentation is useful in evaluating the underlying performance of acquired companies. Similarly, we adjust for other acquisition-related expenses, such as amortization of intangibles and other impacts of fair value adjustments because they generally are not related to the acquired business' core business performance. As an additional example, we exclude the costs of restructuring programs, which can occur from time to time for our current businesses and/or recently acquired businesses. We exclude the costs in calculating adjusted results to allow us and investors to evaluate the performance of the business based upon its expected ongoing operating structure. We believe the adjusted measures, accompanied by the disclosure of the costs of these programs, provides valuable insight. Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one financial measure to monitor and evaluate performance and liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only in conjunction with financial measures reported according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(In thousands) GAAP net cash provided by operating activities $ 151,685 $ 167,365 $ 255,300 $ 314,794 Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets (29,807 ) (17,807 ) (63,222 ) (53,582 ) Non-GAAP free cash flow $ 121,878 $ 149,558 $ 192,078 $ 261,212 BELDEN INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\n2018 EARNINGS GUIDANCE\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended\nApril 1, 2018\nAdjusted income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders $5.95 - $6.20 $1.05 - $1.15 Amortization of intangible assets $(1.49) $(0.39) Severance, restructuring, and acquisition integration costs $(0.50) $(0.29) GAAP income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders $3.96 - $4.21 $0.37 - $0.47 Our guidance for income per diluted share attributable to Belden common stockholders is based upon information currently available regarding events and conditions that will impact our future operating results.
