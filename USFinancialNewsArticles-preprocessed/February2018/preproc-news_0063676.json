    "text": "By Mahita Gajanan 4:00 AM EST \nIHOP is celebrating National Pancake Day by bringing back an annual deal that is sure to fill you up on pancakes. \nThe breakfast chain will offer each customer a free short stack of buttermilk pancakes at IHOP restaurants across the country on Tuesday, Feb. 27 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. (select locations will run the deal until 10 p.m.). \nCustomers aren’t required to pay for their pancakes, but IHOP does ask that guests leave a donation of any size to go toward charities like Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and Shriners Hospitals for Children. IHOP aims to raise $5 million to honor its 60th anniversary of serving up fresh flapjacks. \n“At IHOP, we think doing good is delicious. Every stack of pancakes we serve on our signature day counts toward helping our charity partners improve the health and lives of millions of children and families across the country,” IHOP president Darren Rebelez said in a statement. \nThe free pancake deal for National Pancake Day 2018 will extend to IHOP locations in Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam and Mexico.
