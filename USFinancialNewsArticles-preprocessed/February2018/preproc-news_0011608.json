    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 2:17 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago At least five killed, 60 missing after quake rocks Taiwan tourist area Fabian Hamacher , Tyrone Siu 4 Min Read \nHUALIEN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Rescuers combed through the rubble of collapsed buildings on Wednesday, as they searched for about 60 people missing after a strong earthquake killed at least five near the popular Taiwanese tourist city of Hualien overnight. \nThe magnitude 6.4 quake, which hit near the coastal city just before midnight (1600 GMT) on Tuesday, also injured 243 people and collapsed four buildings, officials said. \nHualien Mayor Fu Kun-chi said the number of people missing was now close to 60, although an exact figure was not provided. As many as 150 were initially feared missing. \nMany of the missing were believed to be still trapped inside buildings, some of which were tilting precariously, after the quake hit about 22 km (14 miles) northeast of Hualien on Taiwan’s east coast. \nAt the city’s Marshal Hotel, rescuers trying to free two trapped Taiwanese pulled out one alive, but the other person was declared dead, the government said. \nAmong the injured were mainland Chinese, Czech, Japanese, Singaporean and South Korean nationals. \n(For a graphic on Taiwan earthquake click tmsnrt.rs/2BJCdQ2 ) \nAftershocks with a magnitude of at least 5.0 could rock the island in the next two weeks, the government said. Smaller tremors rattled nervous residents throughout the day. \nResidents waited and watched anxiously as emergency workers dressed in fluorescent orange and red suits and wearing helmets searched for residents trapped in apartment blocks. \nHualien is home to about 100,000 people. Its streets were buckled by the force of the quake, with around 40,000 homes left without water and around 1,900 without power. Water supply had returned to nearly 5,000 homes by noon (0400 GMT), while power was restored to around 1,700 households.

REUTERS/Stringer DAMAGE, PANIC \nEmergency workers surrounded a badly damaged 12-storey residential building, a major focus of the rescue effort. Windows had collapsed and the building, which is around 17 years old, was wedged into the ground at a roughly 40-degree angle. \nRescuers worked their way around and through the building while residents looked on from behind cordoned-off roads. Others spoke of the panic when the earthquake struck. \n“We were still open when it happened,” said Lin Ching-wen, who operates a restaurant near a damaged military hospital.

A car sat submerged in rubble as rescue workers combed through the ruins of a nearby building. \nPresident Tsai Ing-wen went to the scene of the quake early on Wednesday to help direct rescue operations. \n“The president has asked the cabinet and related ministries to immediately launch the ‘disaster mechanism’ and to work at the fastest rate on disaster relief work,”Tsai’s office said in a statement. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and major Apple supplier, said initial assessments indicated no impact from the earthquake. \nTaiwan, a self-ruled island that China considers part of its territory, lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck nearby on Sunday. \nMore than 100 people were killed in a quake in southern Taiwan in 2016, and some Taiwanese remain scarred by a 7.6 magnitude quake that was felt across the island and killed more than 2,000 people in 1999.
