The three units will focus on TDC’s networks, the Danish market and the Norwegian business and will eventually be managed independently. A consortium of Australia’s Macquarie and three Danish pension funds, PFA, ATP and PKA, confirmed its 50.25 Danish crowns ($8.24) per share takeover offer and set an April 4 deadline for TDC shareholders to accept. ($1 = 6.1020 Danish crowns) (Reporting by Teis Jensen, editing by Louise Heavens)",
