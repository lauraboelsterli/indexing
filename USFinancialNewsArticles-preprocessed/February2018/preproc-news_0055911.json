    "text": "Tomas Plekanec, Jeff Petry and Phillip Danault each scored a goal as the Montreal Canadiens snapped a six-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory over the New York Rangers on Thursday night in Montreal.\nThe Canadiens had gone 0-4-2 during their recent skid but this game proved different. Goalie Antti Niemi made 31 saves and improved to 3-6-1 after also playing with Florida and Pittsburgh this season.\nNew York, meanwhile, now has dropped five consecutive games and is actively looking to make moves before the upcoming trading deadline Monday.\nMontreal dominated offensively in this game, coming up with several scoring chances and outshooting New York, 42-31. The Canadiens scored a goal in each period and had 32 of their shots in the first two.\nPetry now has scored six times in the past 12 games and has 10 goals overall this season, a career high. He’s also compiled a career-best 29 points.\nMontreal, meanwhile, spoiled the NHL debut of New York goalie Alexandar Georgiev. He had gone 8-0-1 in his last nine games with Hartford in the AHL.\nThe Canadiens kept him very busy, and Georgiev made 38 saves for the Rangers. The rookie kept them close but New York just couldn’t do enough on offense.\nBut Montreal could and it started with Plekanec’s goal 6:59 into the game. Plekanec (who also had an assist) beat Georgiev from the doorstep after a pass from Paul Byron.\nThe Canadiens made it 2-0 when Petry easily tapped in a Charles Hudon pass at the end of a three-on-one rush.\nGeorgiev had no chance on the goal 3:50 into the second period.\nMontreal kept the pressure on, especially in the second period where it posted 19 shots and got the goal that gave it a two-goal lead. The Canadiens had five power plays in the first two periods but could not score an extra-man goal.\nThe Rangers finally got on the board thanks to a Kevin Hayes power-play goal with three minutes left in the game before Danault sealed the win with a late empty-netter.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
