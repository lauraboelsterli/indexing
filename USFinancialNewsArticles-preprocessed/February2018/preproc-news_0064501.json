    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 3:50 PM / in 26 minutes CANADA STOCKS-Toronto index steady; technology sector gains temper declines Reuters Staff 2 Min Read Feb 28 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was steady on Wednesday as gains in technology shares were offset by a drop in Valeant Pharmaceuticals after it gave a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast. * At 10:21 a.m. ET (15:21 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was off 13.19 points, or 0.08 percent, at 15,657.96. * Valeant was the biggest drag on the index, down 10.9 percent at C$21.16 after the drugmaker gave a disappointing outlook for 2018 with several of its major drugs facing more competition from generics. * Resource companies gave up early gains with the energy group off 0.2 percent, including Suncor Energy , which fell 0.2 percent to C$43.53. * The technology sector was up 0.6 percent, helping to temper declines. Among advancing shares, CGI Group rose 0.7 percent to C$75.44, while Shopify Inc rose 1.6 percent to C$178.9. * The TSX posted five new 52-week highs and five new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were nine new 52-week highs and 11 new lows. * Aurora Cannabis was among the most actively traded stocks by volume, gaining 5.1 percent to $10.39. Volume on the TSX index was 33.53 million shares. Reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa Editing by Susan Thomas",
