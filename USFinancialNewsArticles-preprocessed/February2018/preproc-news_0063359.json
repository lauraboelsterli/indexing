    "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Vietnam has launched a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to challenge U.S. restrictions on imports of pangasius seafood from Vietnam, a WTO filing showed on Tuesday.\nThe complaint said pangasius fish was economically significant for Vietnam and was a healthy and affordable source of protein for U.S. consumers, but that the United States was unfairly restricting it without a sufficient scientific basis.\nUnder WTO rules, Vietnam could ask for adjudication of the dispute if the United States does not settle it within 60 days.\nReporting by Tom MilesEditing by Gareth Jones\n ",
