Global grain and oilseed demand has grown by 2.7 percent per year over the past five years, the highest five-year growth period since the early 1980s.\nMajor U.S. crop prices are currently similar to year-ago levels, leading us to expect minimal shifts in crop area in 2018. The development of the South American corn and soybean crops, particularly the second corn crop in Brazil, will be a driver of crop prices in the coming months and may influence U.S. planting decisions.\nNutrient prices remain affordable, which we expect will lead to robust applications in the North American spring season.\nWe anticipate that growers will continue to optimize crop input expenditures, similar to recent years. Record U.S. corn yields in the past two years provides evidence that growers continue to focus on increasing productivity by utilizing crop inputs and solutions.\nPotash\nGlobal Demand (millions of tonnes KCl)\nMarket\n2016\n2017E\n2018F\nChina\n14.1\n15.1\n15.5-16.0\nIndia\n3.8\n4.5\n4.5-5.0\nOther Asia\n9.0\n9.6\n9.5-10.0\nLatin America\n11.7\n12.2\n12.0-12.5\nNorth America\n9.7\n10.2\n9.5-10.0\nOther\n12.0\n12.4\n12.5-13.0\nWorld total shipments\n60.3\n64.0\n64.0-66.0 *\n*Forecast world total shipments range is narrower than the sum of individual market ranges\nGlobal potash shipments set a new record of approximately 64 million tonnes in 2017 with significant growth achieved in all major markets. Downstream inventories ended 2017 at levels flat to lower than a year ago, meaning global shipments increased in response to rising consumption. We expect that demand will continue to be robust in 2018 and that annual global potash shipments will be between 64 and 66 million tonnes.\nNorth American spring application rates are expected to remain normal supported by good affordability, and we anticipate shipments similar to the historical average but slightly below 2017.\nBrazilian potash imports set a new record of 9.2 million tonnes in 2017 and inland inventories ended the year at historically low levels, indicating robust consumption and supportive of strong import demand in 2018.\nChinese and Indian potash demand was strong in 2017 and inventories ended the year flat to lower than 2016 levels. We expect continued demand growth in China and India in 2018 but at a slower pace than 2017 levels. Potash demand remains reasonably strong in other Asian countries amid stable and profitable prices for a wide range of key crops.\nMost global potash producers have heavily committed sales volumes for the first quarter of 2018, leaving available supplies relatively tight. Greenfield potash capacity is anticipated to continue to ramp up in 2018, but we expect a portion of the new capacity will be offset by the closure of mines reaching end of life and product mix changes by some producers.\nNitrogen\nNitrogen prices have started 2018 firmer, with current benchmark nitrogen prices up between 15 to 40 percent from fourth quarter 2017 lows, depending on the product.\nGlobal energy prices are expected to increase marginal production costs in 2018, as crude oil prices have increased approximately 20 percent year-over-year, supporting both formula-based gas contracts in Europe and LNG prices. Chinese production rates have been cut back by ongoing regulatory pressure, natural gas availability, significantly higher natural gas prices and continued strength in coal prices.\nIndian urea inventories are very low, which should support import demand in the coming months, however import demand is expected to remain volatile as the country balances subsidy policy with changing market dynamics.\nNet North American offshore imports of urea were down by 50 percent or 1.0 million tonnes from July through December 2017. The decrease in imports exceeded the increase in domestic production for the same period. As a result, North American offshore import requirements for first-half 2018 may approach similar levels as the first half of the prior year.\nPhosphate\nHigher input costs have lent support to phosphate prices but continue to weigh on margins. Sulfur prices have recently risen and remain approximately 50 percent above 2017 lows, while traded ammonia prices are up 50 to 70 percent from 2017 lows.\nProduction curtailments have reduced export availability from both the U.S. and China, which has provided some support to phosphate fertilizer prices.\nFINANCIAL OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE\n2018 Annual Guidance Ranges\nAnnual\nLow\nHigh\nEarnings per share\n$2.10\n$2.60\nConsolidated EBITDA (billions)\n$3.2\n$3.7\nRetail EBITDA (billions)\n$1.2\n$1.3\nPotash EBITDA (billions)\n$1.1\n$1.3\nNitrogen EBITDA (billions)\n$0.9\n$1.1\nPotash sales tonnes (millions)\n11.8\n12.4\nNitrogen sales tonnes (millions) (a)\n10.0\n10.4\nEffective tax rate on continuing operations\n24%\n25%\nSustaining capital expenditures (billions)\n$1.0\n$1.1\n2018 Annual Assumptions & Sensitivities\nFX rate CAD to USD\n$1.26\nNYMEX natural gas ($US/MMBtu)\n$3.00\n$20/tonne change in realized Potash selling prices ($/share) (b)\n$0.24\n$20/tonne change in realized Ammonia selling prices ($/share) (b)\n$0.07\n$20/tonne change in realized Urea selling prices ($/share) (b)\n$0.09\n(a) Excludes ESN ® , Rainbow and Europe sales.\n(b) Sensitivities are calculated pre-synergies.\nPurchase Price Allocation (PPA) impact – Our 2018 earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of incremental depreciation and amortization of approximately $150 million to $300 million resulting from the fair valuing of Agrium's assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2018 in accordance with purchase accounting.\nHarmonization of Accounting Policies – Harmonization of Agrium accounting policies to the accounting policies of PotashCorp is expected to reduce Retail EBITDA by approximately $35 million due to the reclassification of items previously considered as other finance costs and is included in our annual Retail EBITDA guidance.\nSynergies - In 2018, we expect to realize cash synergies of $175 million to $225 million and run rate synergies of $250 million by the end of 2018. We expect costs to achieve these ongoing synergies of $50 to $70 million in 2018, which are excluded from our earnings per share and EBITDA guidance.\nEPS - Based on the factors set out under the heading \"Market Outlook\" and the assumptions above, our full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance is $2.10 to $2.60. In addition to the PPA impact and costs of achieving synergies noted above, our guidance excludes share-based compensation expense (recovery). Equity earnings relating to investments now classified in discontinued operations are included in our earnings per share guidance.\nAGRIUM RESULTS\nAgrium fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations totaled $27 million, down from the $69 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-year earnings from continuing operations were $502 million compared to $584 million earned in 2016. Results for the quarter and full year were supported by record Retail business unit performance and higher potash sales volumes and margins, but were more than offset by lower nitrogen sales volumes and margins related to plant outages in the second half of 2017.\nAGRIUM ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND GUIDANCE RELEVANT EARNINGS RECONCILIATION\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet earnings\nNet earnings\nfrom continuing\nfrom continuing\noperations\noperations\nimpact\nExpense\nimpact\n(millions of U.S. dollars, except per share amounts)\nExpense\n(post-tax)\nPer share (a)\n(Income)\n(post-tax)\nPer share (a)\n27\n0.19\n502\n3.60\nAdjustments:\nShare-based payments\n29\n22\n0.16\n69\n49\n0.36\nForeign exchange loss net of\nnon-qualifying derivatives\n3\n2\n0.02\n14\n10\n0.08\nMerger and related costs\n52\n39\n0.28\n94\n67\n0.50\nImpact of Egyptian pound devaluation\non investee earnings\n-\n-\n-\n(16)\n(11)\n(0.08)\nU.S. Tax Reform adjustment\n9\n9\n0.07\n9\n9\n0.07\nAdjusted net earnings (b)\n99\n0.72\n626\n4.53\nEnvironmental remediation liability\nexpense\n11\n8\n0.06\n11\n8\n0.06\nGain on sale of assets\n-\n-\n-\n(7)\n(5)\n(0.04)\nGuidance relevant earnings (b)\n107\n0.78\n629\n4.55\n(a)\nPer share information attributable to equity holders of Agrium.\n(b)\nEffective tax rates of 25 percent for the quarter and 29 percent for the year were used for the adjusted net\nearnings, guidance relevant earnings, and per share calculations.

Higher sales for all our crop input products and services were driven by organic growth, recent acquisitions and a 22 percent increase in proprietary product sales.\nNorth American EBITDA increased by 17 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, with higher nutrient and crop protection product demand in both the U.S. and Canada. International Retail operations achieved a record fourth quarter, with EBITDA up 40 percent year over year, supported by another record quarter for our Australian operations.\nSelling expenses – Total Retail selling expenses increased by 9 percent this quarter compared to the same period in 2016 as a result of acquisitions made in 2017. Selling expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 25 percent this quarter compared to 26 percent in the same period of 2016.\nRetail sales and gross profit by product line\n(millions of U.S. dollars, except\nThree months ended December 31\nwhere noted)\nSales\nGross profit\nGross profit (%)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nCrop nutrients\n890\n779\n111\n168\n147\n21\n19\n19\nCrop protection products\n712\n620\n92\n327\n296\n31\n46\n48\nSeed\n107\n101\n6\n51\n43\n8\n48\n43\nMerchandise\n187\n167\n20\n28\n27\n1\n15\n16\nServices and other\n193\n161\n32\n121\n110\n11\n63\n68\nCrop nutrients - Sales were 14 percent higher this quarter compared to the same period last year, due primarily to higher volumes, particularly with record ammonia applications in Canada and higher sales volumes in all other regions. Gross profit was 14 percent higher this quarter due to increased sales volumes, while gross profit margin per tonne remained relatively flat.\nCrop protection – Fourth-quarter sales increased by 15 percent compared to the same period last year, due to increased sales in both North America and International operations. The U.S. experienced strong demand for herbicides and fall weed burn-down products this quarter. Proprietary product sales in the quarter increased by 25 percent compared to 2016's fourth quarter, with the largest increase in market penetration occurring in Australia. Gross profit for the quarter was up 10 percent over the same period last year, due to higher sales volumes across all regions and proprietary products. However, gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 2 percentage points this quarter due to product mix considerations and a higher percentage of sales to wholesale customers.\nSeed – Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 19 percent compared to the same period last year, due to purchases in the U.S. that were delayed from the third quarter of 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 48 percent from 43 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, due to a return to a higher sales mix to retail customers relative to wholesalers.\nMerchandise – Sales increased 12 percent and gross profit was up 4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year relative to the same period last year. The increase in sales was due to higher sales in Australia related to animal health management and higher fuel prices in our Canadian operations.\nServices and other – Sales increased by 20 percent and gross profit by 10 percent this quarter compared to the same period last year, due to higher livestock export shipments and wool commissions in Australia. It was also supported by higher sales in North America related to strong demand for fall nutrient and crop protection application services. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined this quarter due to lower Australian cattle prices.\nAgrium Wholesale\nThree months ended December 31\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n2017\n2016 5\nChange\nSales\n534\n594\n(60)\nSales tonnes (000's)\n1,879\n2,161\n(282)\nCost of product sold\n(447)\n(459)\n12\nGross profit\n87\n135\n(48)\nEBIT\n76\n151\n(75)\nEBITDA\n134\n208\n(74)\nExpenses\n(11)\n16\n(27)\nEBITDA – Wholesale gross profit and EBITDA this quarter were lower than the same period last year, as stronger results from our potash segment were more than offset by lower results for our nitrogen and phosphate segments. Downtime in our nitrogen and phosphate facilities impacted sales volumes and resulted in higher cost of product sold per tonne. Higher phosphate rock and sulfur input costs and unfavorable changes in the Canadian dollar exchange rate also increased the cost of product sold.\nAgrium Potash\nThree months ended December 31\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales\n137\n105\n32\nCost of product sold\n(97)\n(84)\n(13)\nGross profit\n40\n21\n19\nEBIT\n33\n13\n20\nEBITDA\n64\n39\n25\nGross Profit – Potash gross profit was 90 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, due to a combination of higher prices and sales volumes, which more than offset an increase in the cost of product sold per tonne.\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales tonnes (000's)\nNorth America\n329\n286\n43\nInternational\n291\n304\n(13)\nSelling price ($/tonne)\nNorth America\n269\n211\n58\nInternational\n168\n148\n20\nTotal\n221\n179\n42\nCost of product sold ($/tonne)\n(157)\n(143)\n(14)\nMargin ($/tonne)\n64\n36\n28\nVolumes – Agrium sold 5 percent higher volumes of potash in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Increased volumes sold domestically more than offset lower international sales, which were impacted by a reduction in Agrium's Canpotex 6 allocation relative to the same period last year.\nPrice – Global benchmark potash prices were higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, and this was reflected in Agrium's realized selling prices, which were 27 percent higher domestically and 14 percent higher on international sales.\nCosts – Cost of product sold per tonne was 10 percent higher in this year's quarter versus the prior year's fourth quarter, due to unfavorable changes in the Canadian dollar exchange rate impacting production costs; higher freight costs; and a higher proportion of domestic sales than the comparable period (that include freight and distribution in the cost of product sold). Agrium's cash cost of product manufactured 7 this quarter was $72 per tonne, a $10 per tonne increase over the same period last year.\nAgrium Nitrogen\nThree months ended December 31\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales\n220\n285\n(65)\nCost of product sold\n(186)\n(200)\n14\nGross profit\n34\n85\n(51)\nEBIT\n26\n76\n(50)\nEBITDA\n46\n99\n(53)\nGross Profit - Total nitrogen gross profit was significantly reduced this quarter compared to the same period last year, due to planned and unplanned maintenance outages in the second half of 2017 that reduced product availability in the fourth quarter and resulted in higher cost per tonne. Gross profit was also impacted by slightly lower realized pricing relative to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales tonnes (000's)\nAmmonia\n261\n334\n(73)\nUrea\n300\n439\n(139)\nOther\n191\n181\n10\nSelling price ($/tonne)\nAmmonia\n342\n371\n(29)\nUrea\n287\n274\n13\nOther\n234\n222\n12\nTotal\n293\n298\n(5)\nCost of product sold ($/tonne)\n(248)\n(209)\n(39)\nMargin ($/tonne)\n45\n89\n(44)\nVolumes - Total nitrogen sales volumes for the fourth quarter were 21 percent lower than the same period in 2016 due to lower production volumes.\nPrice - Agrium's fourth-quarter average realized price decreased compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, with price increases in urea and nitrogen solutions more than offset by lower ammonia pricing, a result of the timing of forward sales activity, and lower nitrate prices driven by lower Tampa ammonia-based contracts.\nCosts – Total cost of product sold was 7 percent lower than the same period last year, due to lower sales volumes this quarter. However, on a cost of product sold per tonne basis, costs increased by 19 percent, primarily due to fixed costs being spread over lower sales volumes.\nNatural Gas Prices\nThree months ended December 31\n(U.S. dollars per MMBtu)\n2017\n2016\nChange\nOverall gas cost excluding realized\nderivative impact\n1.77\n2.52\n(0.75)\nRealized derivative impact\n0.70\n0.07\n0.63\nOverall gas cost\n2.47\n2.59\n(0.12)\nAverage NYMEX\n2.91\n2.99\n(0.08)\nAverage AECO\n1.54\n2.12\n(0.58)\nAgrium Phosphate\nThree months ended December 31\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n2017\n2016 6\nChange\nSales\n47\n81\n(34)\nCost of product sold\n(49)\n(72)\n23\nGross profit\n(2)\n9\n(11)\nEBIT\n(1)\n8\n(9)\nEBITDA\n4\n13\n(9)\nGross Profit - Total phosphate gross profit was a loss of $2 million compared to a profit of $9 million in the same period last year. The lower earnings were driven primarily by higher rock and sulfur costs as well as an extended maintenance shutdown at our Redwater facility, which increased cost of product sold per tonne.\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales tonnes (000's)\n107\n191\n(84)\nSelling price ($/tonne)\n436\n420\n16\nCost of product sold ($/tonne)\n(448)\n(379)\n(69)\nMargin ($/tonne)\n(12)\n41\n(53)\nVolumes - Total phosphate volumes for the quarter were 44 percent lower than the same period last year due to lower production volumes.\nPrice – The average realized selling price for phosphate was 4 percent higher than the same period last year, due to market strength in our primary selling region in Western Canada.\nCosts – Total cost of product sold was 32 percent lower than the comparable prior period, due to the lower sales volumes this quarter as a result of the extended maintenance shutdown. On a per-tonne basis, cost of product sold was 18 percent higher, due to higher input costs, including rock and sulfur, and fixed costs being spread over lower sales volumes.\nAgrium Wholesale Other\nThree months ended December 31\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales\n130\n123\n7\nCost of product sold\n(115)\n(103)\n(12)\nGross profit\n15\n20\n(5)\nEBIT\n18\n54\n(36)\nEBITDA\n20\n57\n(37)\nGross Profit - Total Wholesale Other gross profit was 25 percent lower in 2017's fourth quarter compared to the same period last year, due to lower ammonium sulfate availability from our Redwater facility.\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales tonnes (000's)\nAmmonium sulfate\n61\n99\n(38)\nESN ® and other\n339\n327\n12\nSelling price ($/tonne)\nAmmonium sulfate\n261\n240\n21\nCost of product sold ($/tonne)\n(173)\n(130)\n(43)\nMargin ($/tonne)\n88\n110\n(22)\nVolumes – Fourth-quarter ESN ® volumes were 16 percent lower than the comparable period in 2016 due to lower product availability related to an outage at our Carseland nitrogen facility. Ammonium sulfate sales volumes were 38 percent lower due to reduced production volumes.\nPrice – Stronger ESN ® market conditions had a favorable impact on selling prices, while ammonium sulfate also saw higher prices due to higher nitrogen benchmark prices and strong demand in Western Canada.\nCosts – Cost of product sold per tonne for ammonium sulfate was 33 percent higher during the quarter than the same period last year due to fixed costs being spread over lower sales volumes as a result of the above-noted outages and higher raw material prices.\nAgrium Other\nEBITDA - EBITDA for our Other non-operating business unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a net expense of $122 million, compared to a net expense of $115 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The variance was primarily due to:\nAn increase of $38 million in merger and related costs.\nAn increase of $13 million in our environmental remediation provision, primarily as a result of a change in our estimated future cash outflows for our Idaho phosphate mining and processing sites.\nThis was partially offset by:\nA $15 million impairment loss recorded on an international investment in 2016.\nAn increase of $11 million in our gross profit recovery as a result of lower intersegment inventories held by Retail at the end of the fourth quarter.\nTax - On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") was signed into law. Included in Agrium's fourth-quarter earnings is a one-time net tax expense of $9 million related to the Act. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 remained the same with prior year (2017 and 2016: 25 percent).\nPOTASHCORP RESULTS\nPotashCorp reported a net loss of $76 million for the quarter, however, this included non-cash impairment charges in phosphate of $276 million and net tax recovery adjustments of $118 million.

In North America, shipments were 21 percent below 2016's levels, while offshore shipments decreased by 10 percent. The majority of Canpotex's volumes for the quarter were sold to China (28 percent) and Other Asian markets outside of China and India (28 percent), while Latin America and India accounted for 25 percent and 11 percent, respectively.\nPrice – Our average realized potash price of $182 per tonne surpassed the $157 per tonne realized in the same period last year, as strong customer engagement in all key markets continued to support prices.\nCosts – Inventory-related shutdowns reduced production volumes and resulted in manufactured cost of goods sold for the quarter of $96 per tonne. This amount was down from $101 per tonne in the same period last year, primarily due to an unfavorable adjustment to asset retirement obligations recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPotashCorp Nitrogen\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\nNet sales\n$\n316\n$\n289\n27\nCost of goods sold\n(257)\n(239)\n(18)\nMargin on inter-segment sales\n11\n5\n6\nGross margin\n70\n55\n15\nGross margin – Nitrogen gross margin of $70 million for the quarter surpassed the $55 million generated in 2016's fourth quarter as stronger prices more than offset higher per-tonne costs. Our U.S. and Trinidad operations each accounted for 50 percent of the quarter's nitrogen gross margin. For the full-year, gross margin of $256 million was down from $361 million in 2016, predominantly due to lower prices and higher costs.\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales volumes (tonnes 000's)\nAmmonia\n505\n477\n28\nUrea\n283\n304\n(21)\nSolutions and Other\n795\n855\n(60)\nAverage realized price ($/tonne)\nAmmonia\n270\n213\n57\nUrea\n288\n245\n43\nSolutions and Other\n138\n142\n(4)\nAverage\n207\n182\n25\nCost of goods sold ($/tonne)\n(167)\n(151)\n(16)\nGross margin ($/tonne)\n40\n31\n9\nVolumes - Total sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes for the quarter were down 3 percent compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower availability of product related to a turnaround at our Augusta facility.\nPrice - Our average realized price of $207 per tonne during the quarter was up from $182 per tonne in the same period last year, primarily due to global pricing support from lower Chinese urea exports and ammonia production curtailments in key exporting regions.\nCosts - Cost of goods sold for the quarter averaged $167 per tonne, up from $151 per tonne in 2016's fourth quarter primarily as a result of higher natural gas costs in Trinidad.\nPotashCorp Phosphate\nThree months ended December 31\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n302\n$\n290\n12\nCost of goods sold\n(597)\n(297)\n(300)\nCost on inter-segment sales\n(11)\n(5)\n(6)\nGross margin\n(306)\n(12)\n(294)\nGross margin – Negative phosphate gross margin of $306 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 was below the negative $12 million realized during the same period last year, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges of $276 million. For the full year, negative gross margin of $366 million – including non-cash impairment charges of $305 million – trailed the $32 million earned in 2016 when prices for nearly all our phosphate products were higher.\nThree months ended December 31\n2017\n2016\nChange\nSales volumes (tonnes 000's)\nFertilizer\n534\n472\n62\nFeed and Industrial\n239\n243\n(4)\nAverage realized price ($/tonne)\nFertilizer\n342\n328\n14\nFeed and Industrial\n483\n551\n(68)\nAverage\n385\n404\n(19)\nCost of goods sold ($/tonne)\n(782)\n(420)\n(362)\nGross margin ($/tonne)\n(397)\n(16)\n(381)\nVolumes – Fourth-quarter sales volumes of 0.8 million tonnes surpassed last year's comparable total of 0.7 million tonnes, mainly due to higher availability of our fertilizer products.\nPrice - Our average realized phosphate price for the fourth quarter was $385 per tonne, down from $404 per tonne in the same period last year, as higher prices for fertilizer products were more than offset by lower realizations for our feed and industrial products.\nCosts – Cost of goods sold was $782 per tonne for the fourth quarter, significantly higher than $420 per tonne in 2016's fourth quarter, predominantly due to impairment charges at our White Springs and feed plant facilities.\nPotashCorp Finance\nInvestments – Earnings from investments in Arab Potash Company (APC) in Jordan, Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL) in Israel and Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) in Chile – now classified as discontinued operations 9 - were $44 million for the fourth quarter, exceeding the $33 million generated in the same period last year. Our earnings for the year from these investments totaled $173 million and surpassed the $124 million realized in 2016. Classified as continuing operations are dividends from Sinofert Holdings Limited (Sinofert) in China and a $10 million non-cash impairment charge related to this investment in 2016. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of our investment in ICL, which generated net proceeds of $685 million.\nTax – Our income tax recovery of $153 million in the fourth quarter was larger than the $10 million recovery in 2016's fourth quarter, primarily due to the discrete $187 million non-cash deferred tax recovery resulting from a federal income tax rate decrease pursuant to U.S. tax reform legislation. This was partially offset by a non-cash discrete deferred tax expense of $68 million pertaining to a Saskatchewan income tax rate increase.\nTransaction Costs - During the quarter, we incurred merger-related costs of $51 million, higher than the $10 million sustained in the same period last year.\nNotes\n1. All amounts are stated in U.S. dollars.\n2. All references to per-share amounts pertain to diluted net income per share.\n3. EBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs, income tax (recovery) expense, and depreciation and amortization. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to Selected Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Reconciliation.\n4. EBIT is calculated as net earnings (loss) from continuing operations before finance costs and income tax (recovery) expense.\n5. Certain amounts have been restated as a result of discontinued operations.\n6. Canpotex Limited (\"Canpotex\"), the offshore marketing company for Nutrien and one other Saskatchewan potash producer.\n7. This is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to Selected Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Reconciliation.\n8. Generally, a non-IFRS financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, cash flows or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted earnings is not a measure of financial performance (nor does it have a standardized meaning) under IFRS. In evaluating this measure, investors should consider that the methodology applied in calculating such a measure may differ among companies and analysts. The company uses both IFRS and this non-IFRS measure to assess operational performance. Management believes this non-IFRS measure provides useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate PotashCorp's financial performance using the same measures as management. Management believes that, as a result, the investor is afforded greater transparency in assessing the financial performance of the company. This non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted earnings is calculated as net (loss) income before share-based compensation net of tax, certain non-cash income tax changes, certain impairment charges net of tax and Transaction costs net of tax. PotashCorp uses adjusted earnings to assess operational performance. Management believes adjusted earnings to be an important measure as it excludes the effects of non-operating items and share-based compensation, supporting a focus on the performance of the company's day-to-day operations, excluding share-based compensation. As compared to net (loss) income from continuing operations according to IFRS, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of charges associated with share-based compensation, income tax rate changes, impairments or Transaction costs. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that this measurement is useful as a valuation measurement.\n9. PotashCorp's discontinued operations includes the following investments held for sale: Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (\"SQM\"), Arab Potash Company (\"APC\") and Israel Chemicals Ltd.

and twelve months ended December 31, 2017\n(millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)\n(Unaudited)\n1. Corporate Management\nCorporate information\nAgrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") is incorporated under the laws of Canada. Our Corporate head office is located at 13131 Lake Fraser Drive S.E., Calgary, Canada. We conduct our operations globally from our Wholesale head office in Calgary and our Retail head office in Loveland, Colorado, United States.\nAgrium completed a merger with Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., on January 1, 2018 (\"the Merger\"). After that date, shares of Agrium no longer trade publicly. The merged companies began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange as Nutrien Ltd. (\"Nutrien\"), under the symbol NTR on January 2, 2018. Further information about the Merger is available in Nutrien's press release of January 2, 2018, and other documents at www.sedar.com .\nIn these financial statements, \"we\", \"us\", \"our\" and \"Agrium\" mean Agrium Inc., its subsidiaries and its joint arrangements.\nWe categorize our operating segments within the Retail and Wholesale business units as follows:\nRetail: Distributes crop nutrients, crop protection products, seed and merchandise and provides financial and other services directly to growers through a network of farm centers in two geographical segments: North America including the United States and Canada International including Australia and South America Wholesale: Produces, markets and distributes crop nutrients and industrial products as follows: Nitrogen: Manufacturing in Alberta and Texas Potash: Mining and processing in Saskatchewan Phosphate: Production facilities in Alberta and prior to the Conda Phosphate operations disposition as described below, mining facilities in Idaho Wholesale Other: Producing blended crop nutrients and Environmentally Smart Nitrogen ® (ESN) polymer-coated nitrogen crop nutrients, and operating joint ventures and associates\nAdditional information on our operating segments is included in note 2.\nSeasonality in our business results from increased demand for our products during planting seasons. Sales are generally higher in spring and fall.\nDiscontinued operations and assets held for sale\nOn January 12, 2018, we completed the agreements with third parties to dispose of our Conda phosphate operations (\"CPO\") and North Bend nitrogen assets (\"North Bend\"). The sale of CPO and North Bend are the subject of a consent order proposed to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as remedies to resolve issues in superphosphoric acid and nitric acid related to the Merger. On December 27, 2017, the FTC published related documents, including a proposed consent order, which were open for public comment until January 29, 2018, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed consent order final.\nThese assets were previously classified as held for sale, as FTC approval and completion of the sales of CPO and North Bend assets is considered highly probable. Additionally, as CPO comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes, its operating results and the impact of re-measurement to the selling price are included in discontinued operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and in the comparative quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. Discontinued operations exclude elimination of intercompany transactions.\n2.

SELECTED NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS\nCertain financial measures in our Press Release are not prescribed by IFRS. We consider these financial measures discussed herein to provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring our financial performance and financial condition.\nIFRS requires that we provide and include subtotals and other financial measures in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such measures become IFRS measures by virtue of being included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other measures that are not specifically defined under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers are non-IFRS measures. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nThe following table outlines our non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions and why management uses each measure.\nNon-IFRS financial measure\nDefinition\nWhy we use the measure and why it is useful to investors\nEBITDA\nNet earnings (loss) before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations\nEBITDA is frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes when multiplied by a factor to estimate the enterprise value of a company. EBITDA is also used in determining annual incentive compensation for certain management employees and in calculating certain of our debt covenants.\nAdjusted and guidance EPS\nNet earnings (loss) adjusted for certain income (expenses) that are considered to be non-operational in nature.\nThese measures provide meaningful comparison to our guidance by eliminating share-based payments expense (recovery), gains (losses) on foreign exchange and related gains (losses) on non-qualifying derivative hedges and significant non-operating, non-recurring items. Our guidance is forward-looking information. We present guidance relevant earnings (loss) per share to provide an update to this previously disclosed forward-looking information.\nCash cost of production manufactured (COPM)\nAll fixed and variable costs are accumulated in cash COPM excluding depreciation and amortization expense and direct freight.\nEnables investors to better understand the performance of our manufactured operations compared to other crop nutrient producers.\nWhen cash COPM costs are divided by the production tonnes for the period, the result is actual cash COPM per tonne, which is compared to the standard cash COPM per tonne – a calculation of fixed and variable costs for a standard or typical period of production. The standard cash COPM per tonne is multiplied by the production tonnes for the period, and the resulting dollar amount is transferred to inventory. Any remaining costs are recorded directly to cost of product sold as production volume or cost efficiency variances.\nDirect freight is a transportation cost to move the product from an Agrium location to the point of sale.\nThere is no directly comparable IFRS measure for cash COPM.\nConsolidated and business unit EBITDA\nThree months ended December 31,\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\nRetail\nWholesale\nOther\nConsolidated\n2017\nNet earnings\n18\nFinance costs related to long-term debt\n55\nOther finance costs\n30\nIncome taxes\n10\nNet loss from discontinued operations\n9\nEBIT\n174\n76\n(128)\n122\nDepreciation and amortization\n74\n58\n6\n138\nEBITDA\n248\n134\n(122)\n260\n2016\nNet earnings\n67\nFinance costs related to long-term debt\n51\nOther finance costs\n21\nIncome taxes\n23\nNet loss from discontinued operations\n2\nEBIT\n134\n151\n(121)\n164\nDepreciation and amortization\n68\n57\n6\n131\nEBITDA\n202\n208\n(115)\n295\nPotash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nFor the three and twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nPotash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income\n(in millions of US dollars except as otherwise noted)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016 (1)\n2017\n2016 (1)\nSales (Note 2)\n$\n1,081\n$\n1,058\n$\n4,547\n$\n4,456\nFreight, transportation and distribution\n(116)\n(130)\n(537)\n(535)\nCost of goods sold (Note 2)\n(1,043)\n(765)\n(3,335)\n(3,091)\nGross Margin\n(78)\n163\n675\n830\nSelling and administrative expenses\n(60)\n(45)\n(214)\n(212)\nProvincial mining and other taxes\n(26)\n(36)\n(151)\n(124)\nTransaction costs (Note 3)\n(51)\n(10)\n(84)\n(18)\nOther expenses (Note 4)\n-\n(14)\n(17)\n(17)\nOperating (Loss) Income\n(215)\n58\n209\n459\nFinance costs\n(58)\n(55)\n(238)\n(216)\n(Loss) Income Before Income Taxes\n(273)\n3\n(29)\n243\nIncome tax recovery (expense) (Note 5)\n153\n10\n183\n(44)\nNet (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations\n(120)\n13\n154\n199\nNet Income from Discontinued Operations (Note 6)\n44\n33\n173\n124\nNet (Loss) Income\n$\n(76)\n$\n46\n$\n327\n$\n323\nNet (Loss) Income per Share fr om Continuing Operations\nBasic\n$\n(0.14)\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.24\nDiluted\n$\n(0.14)\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.24\nNet (Loss) Income per Share from Continuing and Discontinued Operations\nBasic\n$\n(0.09)\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.39\nDiluted\n$\n(0.09)\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.38\nDividends Declared per Share\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.70\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding\nBasic\n840,203,000\n839,721,000\n840,079,000\n838,928,000\nDiluted\n840,606,000\n840,142,000\n840,316,000\n839,459,000\n(1) Certain amounts have been reclassified as a result of discontinued operations described in Note 6.\n(See Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements)\nPotash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income\n(in millions of US dollars)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n(Net of related income taxes)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet (Loss) Income\n$\n(76)\n$\n46\n$\n327\n$\n323\nOther comprehensive (loss) income\nItems that will not be reclassified to net income:\nNet actuarial gain on defined benefit plans (1)\n46\n119\n46\n16\nItems that have been or may be subsequently reclassified to\nnet income:\nAvailable-for-sale investments (2)\nNet fair value (loss) gain during the period\n(98)\n54\n30\n(34)\nCash flow hedges\nNet fair value (loss) gain during the period (3)\n(9)\n9\n(17)\n7\nReclassification to income of net loss (4)\n6\n11\n34\n50\nOther\n1\n-\n3\n2\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\n(54)\n193\n96\n41\nComprehensive (Loss) Income\n$\n(130)\n$\n239\n$\n423\n$\n364\n(1) Net of income taxes of $(20) (2016 - $(76)) for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $(20) (2016 – $(16)) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(2) Available-for-sale investments are comprised of shares in Israel Chemicals Ltd.

Significant Accounting Policies\nWith its subsidiaries, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (\"PCS\") — together known as \"PotashCorp\" or \"the company\" except to the extent the context otherwise requires — forms a crop nutrient and related industrial and feed products company. The company's accounting policies are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS\"). The accounting policies and methods of computation used in preparing these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in the preparation of the company's 2016 annual consolidated financial statements, with the exception of investments held for sale and discontinued operations included in Note 6 of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which were not previously disclosed.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PCS and its subsidiaries; however, they do not include all disclosures normally provided in annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the company's 2016 annual consolidated financial statements. The company's 2017 annual consolidated financial statements will include additional information under IFRS in its Annual Report in February 2018.\nIn management's opinion, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to present fairly such information.\n2. Segment Information\nThe company has three reportable operating segments: potash, nitrogen and phosphate. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1.

Transaction Relating to the Merger of Equals with Agrium Inc. (\"Agrium\") and Acquisition of Agrichem\nOn January 1, 2018, after receiving all required regulatory approvals, the company and Agrium combined their businesses in a merger of equals by becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of a new parent company named Nutrien Ltd. (\"Nutrien\"). On January 2, 2018, the merged entity began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol NTR, and the shares of PotashCorp and Agrium were delisted.\nShareholders of PotashCorp received 0.400 common shares of Nutrien for each PotashCorp share held and shareholders of Agrium received 2.230 common shares of Nutrien for each Agrium share held. The exchange ratios represent the respective closing share prices of each company's common shares at market close on the NYSE on August 29, 2016, the last trading day prior to when the companies announced that they were in preliminary discussions regarding a merger of equals, which is consistent with the approximate 10-day and 60-day volume weighted average prices through that date.\nPotashCorp is the acquirer for accounting purposes, and as a result, the financial statements and related notes of Nutrien in 2018 and beyond will reflect the operations of Nutrien. Figures for 2017 and prior will reflect the operations of PotashCorp. The purchase consideration is approximately $16 billion. Valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not yet complete due to the recent closing date of the Merger.\nKey dates of the Merger:\nSeptember 11, 2016 - The company entered into an agreement with Agrium to combine their businesses under the Canada Business Corporation Act. November 3, 2016 - The plan of arrangement was approved by the shareholders of both companies. November 7, 2016 - The Ontario Superior Court of Justice issued a final order approving the plan of arrangement. October 18, 2017 - Conditional approval was received from the Competition Commission of India, requiring PotashCorp to divest minority shareholdings in Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (\"SQM\"), Arab Potash Company (\"APC\") and ICL within a period of 18 months from November 2017, the issuance of the order. November 6, 2017 - Agrium signed definitive asset sales agreements to divest its Conda phosphate and North Bend nitric acid operations intended to address United States regulatory concerns. November 7, 2017 - Approval was received from China's Ministry of Commerce, conditioned on the divestiture of PotashCorp's minority shareholdings in SQM and APC within 18 months, and ICL within 9 months, from the closing of the Merger. December 27, 2017 - Clearance was received from the United States' Federal Trade Commission conditional on certain divestitures by Agrium.\nThe sale of PotashCorp's interest in ICL closed on January 24, 2018. Agrium completed the dispositions of certain operations on January 12, 2018, as a condition of approval of the Merger from the United States' Federal Trade Commission.\nThe companies had previously received unconditional regulatory clearance from Canada, Brazil and Russia.\nFor additional information with respect to the plan of arrangement, please refer to the Joint Management Information Circular of PotashCorp and Agrium dated October 3, 2016, a copy of which has been filed on SEDAR under PotashCorp's profile at www.sedar.com .\nOn January 29, 2018, Nutrien announced the planned acquisition of Agrichem, a leading Brazilian specialty plant nutrition and plant health product company. The acquisition will be made in two tranches, with 80 percent of the business expected to be acquired by the end of March 2018. The remaining 20 percent of the business is expected to be acquired in 2019, with the price being based on 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization levels. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary conditions precedent.\n4.

When combined with an income tax recovery, this created a positive actual effective tax rate. Compared to the same period last year, earnings were significantly lower in the United States and only slightly offset by increased earnings in Trinidad.\nThe actual effective tax rate on ordinary earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased compared to the same period last year due to different weightings between jurisdictions, most notably substantially lower earnings in the United States partially offset by higher earnings in Canada and Trinidad.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, a deferred tax recovery of $187 was recorded as a result of a federal income tax rate decrease pursuant to US tax reform legislation.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, a deferred tax expense of $68 was recorded to reflect Saskatchewan government legislation that reversed a provincial income tax rate decrease legislated earlier in the year. A $68 deferred tax recovery had been recorded in the second quarter of 2017 to reflect that rate decrease.\nIn 2016, a current tax recovery of $16 ($3 in the fourth quarter of 2016) was recorded to adjust accruals after tax authority examinations.\n6. Investments Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nThe company classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction within one year rather than through continuing use. Assets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell, with the exception of financial assets (including investments classified as available-for-sale) and therefore measured in accordance with Note 19 of the company's 2016 annual consolidated financial statements. For equity-accounted investments, the equity accounting ceases the date the investments were classified as held for sale. The company considers a discontinued operation to be a component of the company's business that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations or is a part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.\nThe company's investments in SQM at December 1, 2017, and ICL and APC at December 31, 2017 were classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations, due to regulatory requirements to dispose of these investments, as discussed in Note 3. Share of earnings, dividend income and associated income taxes pertaining to these investments were reclassified from operating (loss) income to net income from discontinued operations. The company is actively seeking buyers for its investments in SQM and APC and expects to complete the sales in 2018. On January 24, 2018, the company completed the sale of its equity interests in ICL through a private secondary offering for net proceeds of $685, resulting in a loss on disposal of $19, net of income taxes of $NIL.\nAssets Held for Sale\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nAs at\n2017\n2016\nAssets\nEquity-accounted investees (1)\n$\n1,146\n$\n-\nAvailable-for-sale investment (2)\n708\n-\nCurrent income tax assets\n4\n-\nAssets held for sale\n$\n1,858\n$\n-\nLiabilities\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n$\n36\n$\n-\n(1) SQM and APC.\n(2) ICL.\nNet Income from Discontinued Operations\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nShare of earnings of equity-accounted investees\n$\n36\n$\n19\n$\n151\n$\n92\nDividend income\n7\n9\n24\n31\nIncome tax recovery (expense)\n1\n5\n(2)\n1\nNet income from discontinued operations\n$\n44\n$\n33\n$\n173\n$\n124\nNet Income per Share from Discontinued Operations\nBasic\n$ 0.05\n$ 0.03\n$ 0.21\n$ 0.15\nDiluted\n$ 0.05\n$ 0.03\n$ 0.21\n$ 0.14\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nDividends from discontinued operations (1)\n$\n43\n$\n78\n$\n176\n$\n195\n(1) Dividends from discontinued operations continue to be classified as cash provided by operating activities.\n7.

Share-Based Compensation\nDuring the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the company issued stock options and performance share units (\"PSUs\") to eligible employees under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"). Information on stock options and PSUs is summarized below:\nLTIP\nExpense (Recovery) for all Employee Share-Based Compensation\nPlans\nUnits\nOutstanding as\nat December 31,\n2017\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nUnits Granted\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nin 2017\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nStock options\n1,482,829\n4,469,182\n$\n1\n$\n(10)\n$\n7\n$\n(2)\nShare-settled PSUs\n555,918\n935,570\n-\n-\n4\n3\nCash-settled PSUs\n883,546\n1,556,980\n4\n2\n12\n9\n$\n5\n$\n(8)\n$\n23\n$\n10\nWeighted average grant date fair value per unit for stock options and share-settled PSUs granted during 2017 was $4.36 and $19.93, respectively.\nStock Options\nUnder the LTIP, stock options generally vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to continuous employment or retirement, and have a maximum term of 10 years. The weighted average fair value of stock options granted was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:\nExercise price per option\n$\n18.71\nExpected annual dividend per share\n$\n0.40\nExpected volatility\n29%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.67%\nExpected life of options\n5.7 years\nPerformance Share Units\nPSUs granted under the LTIP in 2017 vest based on the achievement of performance metrics, over three years, comprising 1) the relative ranking of the company's total shareholder return compared with a specified peer group using a Monte Carlo simulation and 2) the outcome of the company's cash flow return on investment compared with its weighted average cost of capital. Compensation cost is measured based on 1) the grant date fair value of the units, adjusted for the company's best estimate of the outcome of non-market vesting conditions (1) at the end of each period for share-settled PSUs and 2) period-end fair value of the awards for cash-settled PSUs. PSUs granted under the LTIP settle in shares for grantees who are subject to the company's share ownership guidelines and in cash for all other grantees.\n(1) The company's cash flow return on investment compared with its weighted average cost of capital is a non-market vesting condition as performance is not tied to the company's share price or relative share price.\n9. Comparative Figures\nIn 2016 and 2017, prior period amounts classified as share of earnings of equity-accounted investees, dividend income and income tax recovery (expense) relating to discontinued operations, as described in Note 6, were reclassified from operating income to net income from discontinued operations on the statement of (loss) income. The remaining immaterial amounts associated with continuing operations for share of earnings of equity-accounted investees, dividend income and impairment of available-for-sale investment were aggregated in other expenses in Note 4. Transactions costs that were previously included in other expenses were reported as a separate line item in the statement of (loss) income given their significance in Note 7. Impairment for available-for-sale investment of $10 in 2016 was combined with other long-term liabilities and miscellaneous in Note 7 as the amount was not considered significant.\nPotash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.\nSelected Financial Data\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nPotash Sales (tonnes -

Generally, a non-IFRS financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, cash flows or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, cash flow prior to working capital changes and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance (nor do they have standardized meanings) under IFRS. In evaluating these measures, investors should consider that the methodology applied in calculating such measures may differ among companies and analysts.\nThe company uses both IFRS and certain non-IFRS measures to assess operational performance and as a component of employee remuneration. Management believes these non-IFRS measures provide useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate PotashCorp's financial performance using the same measures as management. Management believes that, as a result, the investor is afforded greater transparency in assessing the financial performance of the company. These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, nor superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nA. EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of \"EBITDA\" and \"adjusted EBITDA\" to net (loss) income from continuing operations and \"adjusted EBITDA margin\" to net (loss) income from continuing operations as a percentage of sales, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet (loss) income from continuing operations\n$\n(120)\n$\n13\n$\n154\n$\n199\nFinance costs\n58\n55\n238\n216\nIncome tax (recovery) expense\n(153)\n(10)\n(183)\n44\nDepreciation and amortization\n172\n177\n692\n695\nEBITDA\n$\n(43)\n$\n235\n$\n901\n$\n1,154\nShare of Canpotex's Prince Rupert project exit costs\n-\n-\n-\n33\nTermination benefit costs\n-\n-\n-\n32\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\n276\n20\n305\n47\nImpairment of available-for-sale investment\n-\n-\n-\n10\nTransaction costs\n51\n10\n84\n18\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n284\n$\n265\n$\n1,290\n$\n1,294\nEBITDA is calculated as net (loss) income from continuing operations before finance costs, income tax (recovery) expense, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net (loss) income from continuing operations before finance costs, income tax (recovery) expense, depreciation and amortization, exit costs, termination benefit costs, certain impairment charges and Transaction costs. PotashCorp uses EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure of its operational performance. Management believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. As compared to net (loss) income from continuing operations according to IFRS, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company's business, the charges associated with impairments, exit costs, termination costs, or Transaction costs. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company's ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations or as a valuation measurement.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nSales\n$\n1,081\n$\n1,058\n$\n4,547\n$\n4,456\nFreight, transportation and distribution\n(116)\n(130)\n(537)\n(535)\nNet sales\n$\n965\n$\n928\n$\n4,010\n$\n3,921\nNet (loss) income from continuing operations\nas a percentage of sales\n-11%\n1%\n3%\n4%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n29%\n29%\n32%\n33%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales (sales less freight, transportation and distribution). Management believes comparing adjusted EBITDA to net sales earned (net of costs to deliver product) is an important indicator of efficiency. In addition to the limitations given above in using adjusted EBITDA as compared to net (loss) income from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to net (loss) income from continuing operations as a percentage of sales is also limited in that freight, transportation and distribution costs are incurred and valued independently of sales; adjusted EBITDA also includes earnings from equity investees from continuing operations whose sales are not included in consolidated sales. Management evaluates these items individually on the consolidated statements of (loss) income.\nB. CASH FLOW\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of \"cash flow prior to working capital changes\" and \"free cash flow\" to cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nCash flow prior to working capital changes\n$\n218\n$\n292\n$\n1,153\n$\n1,200\nChanges in non-cash operating working capital\nReceivables\n135\n35\n47\n114\nInventories\n(24)\n(41)\n(10)\n(21)\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n(10)\n8\n(13)\n17\nPayables and accrued charges\n62\n59\n48\n(50)\nChanges in non-cash operating working capital\n163\n61\n72\n60\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n381\n$\n353\n$\n1,225\n$\n1,260\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\n(220)\n(245)\n(651)\n(893)\nOther assets and intangible assets\n-\n8\n(1)\n(2)\nDividends from discontinued operations\n(43)\n(78)\n(176)\n(195)\nChanges in non-cash operating working capital\n(163)\n(61)\n(72)\n(60)\nFree cash flow\n$\n(45)\n$\n(23)\n$\n325\n$\n110\nManagement uses cash flow prior to working capital changes as a supplemental financial measure in its evaluation of liquidity. Management believes that adjusting principally for the swings in non-cash working capital items due to seasonality or other timing issues assists management in making long-term liquidity assessments. The company also believes that this measurement is useful as a measure of liquidity or as a valuation measurement.\nThe company uses free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in its evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that adjusting principally for the swings in non-cash operating working capital items due to seasonality or other timing issues, additions to property, plant and equipment, changes to other assets and dividends from discontinued operations assists management in the long-term assessment of liquidity and financial strength. Management also believes that this measurement is useful as an indicator of its ability to service its debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Readers should be aware that free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nC.
