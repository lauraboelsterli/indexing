    "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We finished 2017 the way we started it: We generated double digit organic growth across our markets in the fourth quarter. 2017 was a terrific year by any measure, and we delivered the fastest rates of organic adjusted net revenue growth, margin enhancement and adjusted earnings per share growth in our history,” said Jeff Sloan, Chief Executive Officer. “We also furthered our strategic objectives to expand our presence in faster growth markets with our agreement today to create a new joint venture with HSBC in Mexico.\n“The combination of our technology-enabled distribution with the continuing expansion of our faster growth geographic markets positions us well to continue our exceptional track record of market leading growth,” Sloan continued. “Finally, we are pleased to raise our growth targets in light of the progress we have made in evolving our business mix over the last several years.\"\nFull-Year 2017 Summary\nGAAP revenues were $3.98 billion, compared to $3.37 billion in 2016; diluted earnings per share were $3.01 compared to $1.37 in the prior year; and operating margin was 14.1% compared to 10.6% in 2016. Adjusted net revenue grew 24% to $3.52 billion, compared to $2.84 billion in 2016. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26% to $4.01, compared to $3.19 in 2016. Adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 29.9%.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Summary\nGAAP revenues were $1,054.3 million, compared to $950.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016; diluted earnings per share were $1.51 compared to $0.16 in the prior year; and operating margin was 14.2% compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net revenue grew 15% to $939.0 million, compared to $819.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.07, compared to $0.87 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 30.3%.\nASC 606\nGlobal Payments will adopt Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), effective January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606, GAAP revenues will now be reported net of fees paid to payment networks rather than on a gross basis with these amounts being reflected as a cost of service as they have been historically. In addition, GAAP revenues associated with our gaming cash advance products will now be reported net of associated commissions paid to casinos. These changes in presentation reduce revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and have no effect on operating income or earnings per share.\nIn addition to reporting GAAP results on this basis going forward, we will also report an adjusted net revenue plus network fees metric, which we believe better reflects how we manage our business and is largely consistent with our historical non-GAAP adjusted net revenue reporting convention, except with respect to the netting of gaming cash advance commissions. The netting of casino commissions reduces 2017 reported amounts by approximately $68 million and is expected to impact 2018 by an estimated $73 million. In addition, we will report adjusted operating margin based on the adjusted net revenue plus network fees metric, which again is largely consistent with our historical reporting convention.\n2018 Outlook\n“We could not be more pleased with our strong financial performance for 2017, and we remain excited about the momentum we have entering 2018,” stated Cameron Bready, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “As a result of this performance, for 2018 the company expects adjusted net revenue plus network fees to range from $3.88 billion to $3.97 billion, reflecting growth of 12% to 15% over comparable 2017 results and adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.95 to $5.15, reflecting growth of 23% to 28% over 2017. Annual adjusted operating margin for 2018 is expected to expand by up to 110 basis points over comparable 2017 adjusted operating margin of 30.4%.”\nCapital Allocation\nGlobal Payments’ Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.01 per share payable March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 16, 2018. The board also approved an increase to the company’s existing share repurchase program authorization, raising the total available authorization to $600 million.\nConference Call\nGlobal Payments’ management will host a conference call today, February 15, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss financial results and business highlights.

In addition, income taxes on adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect the removal of a $158.7 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and other income tax benefits of $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, income taxes on adjustments reflect the removal of a $10.9 million tax benefit associated with our decision at that time to indefinitely reinvest earnings in Canada. 4 Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to Global Payments by the diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding.

As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") effective January 1, 2018, no adjustment associated with Global Payment’s European wholesale business is necessary as GAAP revenues will be presented net of these payments. The 2018 Outlook adjustment is $0.16 billion lower as a result of this change. See footnote 2. Amounts also include adjustments to eliminate the effect of acquisition accounting fair value adjustments for software deferred revenue associated with the ACTIVE Network transaction. 2 Global Payments will adopt ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. The new standard changes the presentation of certain amounts that we pay to third parties and currently present as an operating expense. Effective January 1, 2018, networks fees are recognized as a reduction of revenue. This change in presentation of fees paid to third parties reduces our reported revenues and operating expenses under GAAP by the same amount and has no effect on operating income. This adjustment is necessary to present adjusted net revenue plus network fees for 2018 on a comparable basis to 2017 as network fees are reflected in GAAP revenues for 2017. ASC 606 also changes the presentation of revenue for our gaming cash advance solutions such that certain amounts we currently present as operating expenses will be recognized as a reduction of revenue. This adjustment to 2017 is necessary to reflect the amounts on a comparable basis as this change in presentation is reflected in the outlook for GAAP revenues for 2018. 3 The application of ASC 606 also changes the amount and timing of revenue and expenses to be recognized under certain of our customer arrangements, the effect of which is reflected in the outlook for GAAP diluted EPS for 2018. 4 Adjustments to 2017 GAAP diluted EPS include the ACTIVE Network revenue adjustment described above, acquisition related amortization expense of $2.19, share-based compensation expense of $0.25 and net other items of $0.68, including acquisition-related costs of $0.61. Adjustments to 2017 GAAP diluted EPS also includes the effect of these adjustments on noncontrolling interests and income taxes, as applicable. In addition, these adjustments reflect the removal of income tax benefit of $1.02 representing the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. NM - Not Meaningful NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGlobal Payments supplements revenues, income and EPS information determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing these measures, and other measures, with certain adjustments (such measures being non-GAAP financial measures) in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue and adjusted net revenue plus network fees more closely reflect the economic benefits to the company's core business and, in the case of adjusted net revenue, allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation. Adjusted net revenue, adjusted net revenue plus network fees, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses.\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation and certain other items specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6, 7, 8 and 9. Beginning in 2018, adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue plus network fees. The tax rate used in determining the net income impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180215005342/en/\nGlobal Payments Inc.\nInvestor contact:\nIsabel Janci, 770-829-8478\ninvestor.relations@globalpay.com\nor\nMedia contact:\nAmy Corn, 770-829-8755\nmedia.relations@globalpay.com\nSource: Global Payments Inc.",
