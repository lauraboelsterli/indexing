However, their participation in training heightens their chances of featuring on the second weekend of championship action. \nNorth had been sent by Wales back to his club Northampton last week to get some game time. In his first appearance in a month following a knee injury, he made an impressive showing, scoring a try in Fridayâ€™s 36-10 win over Harlequins in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. \nWilliams, who plies his trade for Saracens, has not played much since suffering an abdominal injury last year. \nWales began their Six Nations campaign with a 34-7 home triumph over Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday, despite a myriad of injuries. \nThey will take on an England team who easily beat Italy in Rome as they seek to win a third successive championship.
