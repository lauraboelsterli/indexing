    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ: HEAR), a leading gaming headset and audio accessory company, is providing selected preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nBased on preliminary unaudited information, Turtle Beach expects to report fourth quarter 2017 sales of approximately $79.5 million compared to $82.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For 2017, sales are expected to be approximately $149 million compared to $174 million in 2016. A significant portion of the revenue decline was driven by expected channel inventory reductions in 2017 and under-ordering by several retailers in December.\n\"Retail sales of Turtle Beach headsets were strong in the fourth quarter,\" said Juergen Stark, CEO, Turtle Beach, \"but overly cautious ordering by several large U.S. retailers, some of which were sporadically out-of-stock, resulted in sales slightly below our guidance. We estimate this under-ordering reduced our fourth quarter sales by $6-$7 million. However, due to continued healthy consumer demand early in the first quarter, these retailers have largely restocked in January, resulting in January sales growth that more than closes the 2017 guidance gap.\n\"Underlying our sales results was another strong quarter of market share expansion. Despite a highly competitive marketplace, recent NPD North American data show Turtle Beach grew its leading revenue share to 42.2% for 2017 versus 41.9% for 2016. The NPD data also show that in the fourth quarter, our North American console headset revenue market share increased 150 basis points from 43.5% to 45.0%. We also experienced robust share growth in most of our major European markets, particularly in the U.K., where our year-over-year revenue share grew from 46.9% to 51.8%.\n\"Despite the fourth quarter retail ordering dynamics, we expect our adjusted EBITDA and EPS for 2017 to be within our previous guidance ranges. This was driven by strong fourth quarter gross margins, which we expect to increase from 36.7% in 2016 to over 37% in 2017, and the continued prudent management of our expenses.\"\nNet income in the fourth quarter of 2017 is expected to increase approximately 16% to $0.29 per diluted share compared to $0.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The prior guidance range was $0.25 to $0.29. Net loss in 2017 is expected to be approximately $0.07 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.79 per diluted share in 2016, or a loss of $0.33 per diluted share excluding $1.46 per diluted share in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, HyperSound restructuring reserves and other restructuring charges. The prior guidance range for 2017 was a net loss of $0.06 to $0.10 per diluted share.\nThe Company expects adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase to approximately $17.2 million (prior guidance range was $16.7-$18.7 million) compared to $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 is expected to nearly triple to approximately $11.5 million (prior guidance range was $11-$13 million) compared to $4.0 million in 2016. The significantly improved adjusted EBITDA creates opportunities for the Company to further improve it's balance sheet, which it is currently exploring.\nImportant Note on 2017 Preliminary Estimates:\nThe financial information included herein for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are preliminary, unaudited estimates and may change materially, including as a result of the finalization of financial statements for the Company's fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, review of inventory levels that could require additional reserves, completion of the Company's audit by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and other factors and adjustments related to the Company's financial reporting process. The preceding estimates are based on the Company's internal estimates and information available as of the date hereof. There can be no assurance that our final results for the year will not differ from these estimates and that such changes will not be material; accordingly, these statements should not be viewed or relied upon as a substitute for complete audited financial statements to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or as a measure of our actual performance. The Company's final audited results for fourth quarter and full year 2017 are expected to be released in mid-March 2018. The Company will provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measure in such release.\nAbout Turtle Beach Corporation\nTurtle Beach ( www.turtlebeach.com ) has been revolutionizing console multiplayer gaming since the very beginning with its wide selection of industry leading, award-winning gaming headsets.
