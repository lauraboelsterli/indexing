These quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily driven by a rise in LIBOR.\nOn a fair value basis, the percentage of the Company’s debt investments bearing interest at a floating rate was 96.4%. 6\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average net debt/EBITDA of the companies in the Company’s investment portfolio was 5.3x versus 5.3x as of September 30, 2017.

The $0.4 million decrease in expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in incentive fees.

The SCF’s return to the Company was measured at amortized cost over the trailing four quarters.\n4 Total debt outstanding excluding netting of debt issuance costs of $3.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017.\n5 Computed based on the (a) annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income producing investments, divided by (b) the total performing debt and other income producing investments (excluding investments on non-accrual) at amortized cost.\n6 The fixed versus floating composition has been calculated as a percentage of performing debt investments, including income producing stock investments.\n7 For a particular portfolio company, EBITDA typically represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. The net debt to EBITDA represents the ratio of a portfolio company’s total debt (net of cash) and excluding debt subordinated to the Company’s investment in a portfolio company, to a portfolio company’s EBITDA. The interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of a portfolio company’s EBITDA as a multiple of a portfolio company’s interest expense. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of the Company’s debt investments, including the Company’s exposure to underlying debt investments in the SCF and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of the Company’s performing debt investments, including the Company’s exposure to underlying debt investments in the SCF and excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. Median EBITDA is based on the Company’s debt investments, including the Company’s exposure to underlying debt investments in the SCF and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. As of December 31, 2017, investments where EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 11.3% of total debt investments, including the Company’s investment in the SCF, at fair value. Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the respective reported end date. Portfolio company statistics have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount.\n8 Interest income excludes accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts of $0.2 million. Prepayment related income includes prepayment premiums and accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts.\n9 The average debt to equity leverage ratio has been calculated using the average daily borrowings during the quarter divided by average net assets, adjusted for equity contributions. The ending and average debt to equity leverage ratios exclude unfunded commitments.\nGoldman Sachs BDC, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Assets Investments, at fair value Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments (cost of $1,053,226 and $1,055,203, respectively) $ 1,050,179 $ 1,004,793 Non-controlled affiliated investments (cost of $109,528 and $89,715, respectively) 95,468 84,103 Controlled affiliated investments (cost of $114,911 and $77,592, respectively) 112,666 78,394 Investments in affiliated money market fund (cost of $11,539 and $1, respectively) 11,539 1 Cash 11,606 4,565 Interest and dividends receivable from non-controlled/affiliated investments and non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 8,302 7,841 Dividend receivable from controlled affiliated investments 2,400 1,925 Other income receivable from controlled affiliated investments 1,308 2,212 Deferred financing costs 4,847 6,018 Deferred offering costs 275 605 Other assets 2 76 Total assets $ 1,298,592 $ 1,190,533 Liabilities Debt (net of debt issuance costs of $3,724 and $4,598, respectively) $ 542,526 $ 498,152 Interest and other debt expenses payable 1,688 1,569 Management fees payable 4,647 4,406 Incentive fees payable 3,180 1,474 Distribution payable 18,059 16,349 Accrued offering costs 289 518 Directors’ fees payable — 8 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,373 2,920 Total liabilities $ 572,762 $ 525,396 Net Assets Preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (1,000,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding) $ — $ — Common stock, par value $0.001 per share (200,000,000 shares authorized, 40,130,665 and 36,331,662 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively) 40 36 Paid-in capital in excess of par 799,936 719,847 Accumulated net realized gain (loss) (85,451 ) (23,729 ) Accumulated undistributed net investment income 32,078 25,624 Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (19,352 ) (55,220 ) Allocated income tax expense (1,421 ) (1,421 ) TOTAL NET ASSETS $ 725,830 $ 665,137 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND NET ASSETS $ 1,298,592 $ 1,190,533 Net asset value per share $ 18.09 $ 18.31 Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\nInvestment Income:\nFrom non-controlled/non-affiliated investments:\nInterest income $ 113,402 $ 109,568 $ 109,700 Dividend income — 2,107 2,476 Other income 3,273 2,058 1,584 Total investment income from non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 116,675 113,733 113,760 From non-controlled affiliated investments: Payment-in-kind 7,198 1,503 — Interest income 1,861 1,026 — Dividend income 27 46 3 Other income 25 13 — Total investment income from non-controlled affiliated investments 9,111 2,588 3 From controlled affiliated investments: Payment-in-kind 37 — — Dividend income 9,650 6,575 3,992 Other income 1,308 2,212 681 Total investment income from controlled affiliated investments 10,995 8,787 4,673 Total investment income $ 136,781 $ 125,108 $ 118,436 Expenses: Interest and other debt expenses $ 19,607 $ 14,299 $ 10,705 Management fees 17,828 17,012 15,436 Incentive fees 12,775 10,422 11,786 Professional fees 2,194 2,563 2,752 Administration, custodian and transfer agent fees 824 865 974 Directors’ fees 716 1,012 623 Other expenses 1,292 1,671 1,062 Total expenses $ 55,236 $ 47,844 $ 43,338 NET INVESTMENT INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES $ 81,545 $ 77,264 $ 75,098 Excise tax expense $ 1,552 $ 1,037 $ 518 NET INVESTMENT INCOME (LOSS) AFTER TAXES $ 79,993 $ 76,227 $ 74,580 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment transactions: Net realized gain (loss) from: Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments $ (63,821 ) $ (21,994 ) $ (67 ) Non-controlled affiliated investments (2,492 ) — — Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) from: Non controlled/non-affiliated investments 47,363 (21,154 ) (24,458 ) Non-controlled affiliated investments (8,448 ) 5,501 (2,530 ) Controlled affiliated investments (3,047 ) 2,072 (897 ) Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) $ (30,445 ) $ (35,575 ) $ (27,952 ) NET INCREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS $ 49,548 $ 40,652 $ 46,628 Net investment income (loss) per share (basic and diluted) $ 2.07 $ 2.10 $ 2.14 Earnings per share (basic and diluted) $ 1.28 $ 1.12 $ 1.34 Weighted average shares outstanding 38,633,652 36,317,131 34,782,967 ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS BDC, INC.\nGoldman Sachs BDC, Inc. is a specialty finance company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
