    "text": "GREELEY, Colo., JBS USA Lux S.A. (formerly known as JBS USA, LLC) today announced that it has commenced a private offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2028 (the “Notes”). JBS USA Lux S.A. (“JBS USA”) and JBS USA Finance, Inc. (“JBS USA Finance”) will be co-issuers of the Notes. Each of JBS USA’s U.S. restricted subsidiaries that guarantee JBS USA’s term loans will guarantee the Notes.\nJBS USA intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes, together with cash on hand, to redeem all of the outstanding 8.250% senior notes due 2020 issued by JBS USA and JBS USA Finance (the “2020 Notes”). JBS USA intends to issue a notice of redemption to redeem all of the outstanding 2020 Notes, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes, which redemption will be conditional upon the successful completion of the offering of the Notes.\nThis press release does not constitute a notice of redemption for purposes of the redemption provisions of the indenture governing the 2020 Notes.\nThis press release is neither an offer to purchase or sell nor a solicitation of an offer to sell or buy the 2020 Notes or the Notes. There shall not be any sale of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. persons absent registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered only to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nImportant Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our perspectives and expectations, are forward looking statements. The words “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan” and similar expressions, when related to JBS USA and its subsidiaries, indicate forward-looking statements.
