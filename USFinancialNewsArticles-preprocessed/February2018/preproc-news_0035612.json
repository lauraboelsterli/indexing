    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday expressed anger over a visit by Prime to Arunachal Pradesh, which China also claims, and said India should stop any action that might complicate the dispute.\nChina claims the region in the eastern Himalayas as “South Tibet”, and it has denounced Indian leaders’ visits there as attempts to bolster India’s claims.\n“China’s position on the China-India boundary question is consistent and clear-cut,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency.\n“The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh and is firmly opposed to the Indian leader’s visit to the disputed area,” Geng said.\n“We will lodge stern representations with the Indian side,” he said.\nModi is visiting as part of a tour of the northeastern states.\nA man walks inside a conference room used for meetings between military commanders of China and India, at the Indian side of the Indo-China border at Bumla, in Arunachal Pradesh, November 11, 2009. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo “I am delighted to visit Arunachal Pradesh and be among the wonderful people of this state,” Modi said in a Twitter post.\nChina and India have improved ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over their long festering border dispute, which triggered a brief war in 1962.\nA signboard is seen from the Indian side of the Indo-China border at Bumla, in Arunachal Pradesh, November 11, 2009. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo Chinese and Indian troops faced off on another disputed part of the border last year.\nChinese spokesman Geng said China and India had reached an important consensus on properly managing disputes, and the two sides were working to resolve their contested border through negotiation and consultation.\n“The Chinese side urges the Indian side to honour its commitment and abide by the relevant consensus, and refrain from taking any action that may complicate the boundary question,” Geng said.\nModi is expected to visit China in June for a summit of the Chinese and Russian-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation security bloc.\nHe inaugurated a convention centre in Itanagar, the capital of Arunachal Pradesh, and said the state authorities had prepared an excellent roadmap for development until 2027.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Sanjeev Miglani in NEW DELHI; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
