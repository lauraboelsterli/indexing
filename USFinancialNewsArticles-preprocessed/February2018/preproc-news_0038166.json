    "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Popular, Inc.

The acquired auto loan portfolio has credit characteristics that are similar to Banco Popular’s existing self-originated portfolio. Banco Popular will also acquire certain other assets and assume certain liabilities of Reliable.\nThe purchase price for the all-cash transaction is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting an aggregate discount of 4.5% on the assets to be acquired.

Subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, Popular anticipates the transaction to close during the second quarter of 2018 and be accretive to earnings.\nOn or after closing, Reliable employees will become employees of Banco Popular. Reliable will continue operating independently as a division of Banco Popular for a period of time after closing to provide continuity of service to Reliable customers while allowing Popular to assess best practices before integrating Reliable’s operations with Popular Auto’s.\n“Even in this period of significant uncertainty, Popular continues to believe and invest in the future of Puerto Rico. We are proud to welcome Reliable’s team to Popular, a seasoned team that strongly complements our own.

Our customers can be certain that we will continue working with the same drive and dedication as we have done in the past,” said José Arbona, President and CEO of Reliable.\nPopular, Inc. is filing an investor presentation, which provides supplemental information regarding the transaction. The investor presentation is available at Popular, Inc’s website ( www.popular.com ).\nAbout Popular, Inc.\nFounded in 1893, Popular, Inc. is the leading banking institution by both assets and deposits in Puerto Rico and ranks among the top 50 U.S. banks by assets.
