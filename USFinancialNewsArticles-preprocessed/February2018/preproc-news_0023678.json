Teva’s comments came after Novartis’s Sandoz division said it has won U.S. approval for a larger dosage of its Glatopa drug for MS patients, its copy of Copaxone. “We remain committed to providing Teva’s Copaxone 40 mg to patients and continuing to support our patients,” Teva said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
