    "text": "— Reports Earnings of $1.96 per Diluted Share for the Fourth Quarter —\n— Includes $1.01 per Share Net Benefit Related to Tax Reform —\nSANTA ANA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First American Financial Corporation (NYSE: FAF), a leading global provider of title insurance, settlement services and risk solutions for real estate transactions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\nCurrent Quarter Highlights\nTotal revenue of $1.5 billion, down 2 percent compared with last year Closed title orders down 19 percent, driven by a 41 percent decline in refinance orders Average revenue per order up 23 percent, driven by the shift in the mix to higher-premium purchase and commercial transactions Title Insurance and Services segment pretax margin of 12.2 percent Commercial revenues of $196.2 million, up 6 percent compared with last year Specialty Insurance segment pretax margin of 9.2 percent Property and casualty loss rate of 108.1 percent impacted by California wildfires Debt-to-capital ratio of 17.4 percent as of Dec. 31, 2017 Net tax benefit of $114.1 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, related to tax reform\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nTotal revenue of $5.8 billion, up 4 percent compared with last year Title Insurance and Services segment pretax margin of 12.1 percent Closed acquisitions totaling $91 million Completed termination of pension plan, resulting in annualized savings of $22 million Raised common stock dividend 12 percent to an annual rate of $1.52 per share Cash flow from operations of $632.1 million, up 29 percent from last year Return on equity of 13.0 percent\nSelected Financial Information\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended Full Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total revenue $ 1,481.3 $ 1,504.3 $ 5,772.4 $ 5,575.8 Income before taxes 159.3 81.5 445.3 477.6 Net income $ 221.1 $ 81.0 $ 423.0 $ 343.0 Net income per diluted share 1.96 0.73 3.76 3.09 Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.5 billion, a decline of 2 percent relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in the current quarter was $221.1 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared with net income of $81.0 million, or 73 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThis quarter’s effective tax rate of negative 38.5 percent includes a net benefit of $114.1 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, primarily due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities as a result of recent tax reform legislation.\nTotal revenue for the full year of 2017 was $5.8 billion, an increase of 4 percent relative to the prior year. Net income was $423.0 million, or $3.76 per diluted share, compared with net income of $343.0 million, or $3.09 per diluted share, in 2016.\n“The company had strong results in 2017, achieving earnings per share of $3.76 and a return on equity of 13 percent,” said Dennis J. Gilmore, chief executive officer at First American Financial Corporation. “Total revenue grew 4 percent, primarily driven by strength in our purchase and commercial businesses, which offset the sharp drop in refinance transactions. We continued to manage the company at a high level of efficiency, enabling us to deliver a pretax margin of 12.1 percent in our title segment.\n“In 2018, we will maintain our efforts to develop innovative solutions for our customers and acquire companies that strengthen our core business. In addition, we believe the company will continue to benefit from the ongoing improvement in housing and the general economy. We will remain focused on operating efficiently and strategically deploying our capital in ways that create shareholder value.”\nTitle Insurance and Services\n($ in millions, except average revenue per order)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Total revenues $ 1,356.0 $ 1,384.0 Income before taxes $ 165.6 $ 150.1 Pretax margin 12.2 % 10.8 % Direct open orders 231,500 265,800 Direct closed orders 204,200 252,700 U.S. Commercial Total revenues $ 196.2 $ 185.5 Open orders 30,300 30,000 Closed orders 20,600 21,100 Average revenue per order $ 9,500 $ 8,800 Total revenues for the Title Insurance and Services segment during the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, down 2 percent compared with the same quarter of 2016. Direct premiums and escrow fees were down 1 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by a 19 percent decline in the number of direct title orders closed that was largely offset by a 23 percent increase in the average revenue per direct title order. The growth in the average revenue per direct title order to $2,411 was primarily attributable to the shift in the order mix to higher-premium residential purchase and commercial transactions. Agent premiums, which are recorded on approximately a one-quarter lag relative to direct premiums, were down 5 percent in the current quarter as compared with last year.\nInformation and other revenues were $187.5 million this quarter, down 1 percent compared with the same quarter of last year. Higher revenues from recent acquisitions were offset by lower revenues from the company’s centralized lender business, largely due to the decline in refinance activity.\nInvestment income was $38.3 million in the fourth quarter, up $8.9 million, or 30 percent, primarily due to the increase in short-term interest rates that drove higher interest income in the company’s investment portfolio and cash balances. Net realized investment losses totaled $2.7 million in the current quarter, compared with losses of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPersonnel costs were $414.2 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $9.8 million, or 2 percent, compared with the same quarter of 2016. This decline was primarily driven by lower temporary labor, overtime and incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by personnel costs associated with recent acquisitions.\nOther operating expenses were $208.6 million in the fourth quarter, up $3.3 million, or 2 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to an $8.5 million write off of uncollectible balances this quarter, partially offset by lower production-related costs as a result of the decline in order volume.\nThe provision for policy losses and other claims was $45.3 million in the fourth quarter, or 4.0 percent of title premiums and escrow fees, compared with a 5.5 percent loss provision rate in the fourth quarter of 2016. The current quarter rate reflects an ultimate loss rate of 4.0 percent for the current policy year and no change in the loss reserve estimates for prior policy years.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $30.1 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $3.5 million, or 13 percent, compared with the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense associated with both internally developed and purchased software.\nPretax income for the Title Insurance and Services segment was $165.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $150.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Pretax margin was 12.2 percent in the current quarter, compared with 10.8 percent last year.\nSpecialty Insurance\n($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Total revenues $ 121.1 $ 118.6 Income before taxes $ 11.1 $ 21.3 Pretax margin 9.2 % 18.0 % Total revenues for the Specialty Insurance segment were $121.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 2 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The results from the home warranty business benefited from both lower claim severity and frequency. The decline in severity was primarily driven by operational improvements in claims management processes. The company’s property and casualty business experienced high claim losses in the quarter due to two separate California wildfires, with losses exceeding our $5 million reinsurance retention limit for each event. As a result, the overall loss ratio for the segment increased to 63.5 percent this quarter, compared with 54.6 percent last year. The segment’s pretax margin in the current quarter was 9.2 percent, compared with 18.0 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.\nTeleconference/Webcast\nFirst American’s fourth-quarter and year-end 2017 results will be discussed in more detail on Thursday, Feb. 8, 2018, at 11 a.m. EST, via teleconference.
