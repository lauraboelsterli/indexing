    "text": "13 COMMENTS T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS -0.31% put down its boxing gloves for the Super Bowl.\nIn a break from the fierce wireless advertising wars, the mobile-phone company aired a commercial promoting racial and gender equality—a common theme during the ad breaks of Sunday night’s broadcast.\nThe spot pans across close-ups of babies from diverse backgrounds as actress Kerry Washington offers them motivational life advice.\n“Some people may see your differences and be threatened by them,” Ms. Washington intones. “But you are unstoppable. You’ll love who you want. You’ll demand fair and equal pay. You will not allow where you come from to dictate where you’re going.”\nThe softer-themed ad is a big departure from the company’s typical marketing, which has long involved aggressively going after its competitors such as Sprint. T-Mobile has typically relied on funny commercials featuring celebrities like Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg and Kim Kardashian to stand out on Super Bowl Sunday.\nThe third-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, T-Mobile said it wanted to say something of substance during the big game this year, when likely a hundred million people are watching.\n“Brands have an important role in changing culture,” said Nick Drake, executive vice president of marketing at T-Mobile. The company created the ad to “spark more conversation” about equality in hopes that it can help “drive permanent change on the subject matter,” he added.\nT-Mobile isn’t the only brand hitting the diversity theme during the football championship. Other advertises striking a similar note include Coca-Cola and Toyota Motor Corp.\nStill, airing such a message can sometimes land companies in hot water nowadays. Ad executives say that the divisiveness that exists in the country following the 2016 presidential election has made it difficult to gauge how consumers will react to such pitches, particularly during the Super Bowl when ads are scrutinized more closely by a vast audience.\nLast year, several advertisers experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to strike the right chord. A spot for auto maker Audi , which featured a father watching his daughter compete in a cart race and promoted gender pay equity, received plenty of backlash on social media.\nT-Mobile acknowledges its ad could be risky.\n“There is always going to be some risk with these things, but we think this subject matter is something everybody can agree on,” said Mr. Drake.\nMore on Super Bowl Ads\nNo fumbles! Super Bowl offers brands rare exposure to the masses in age of splintered audience Can you remember what these famous Super Bowl ads were promoting? Take the quiz! Companies are playing it safe for this year’s Super Bowl, afraid to spark social-media outrage T-Mobile seems to have at least considered going in another, perhaps funnier, direction. The company had reportedly reached out to Anthony Scaramucci about doing a Super Bowl spot involving the former White House communications director, but T-Mobile didn’t follow through on the deal, according to TMZ .\nMr. Drake said the company “had a lot of different ideas,” but wouldn’t comment specifically on the idea involving Mr. Scaramucci.\nT-Mobile, of course, wasn’t the only wireless company to leverage the reach of the Super Bowl. Verizon ran an ad thanking first responders . Sprint, meanwhile, went for the competitive jab, with robots mocking a co-worker for being a Verizon customer instead of a Sprint subscriber.\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com",
