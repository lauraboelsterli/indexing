    "text": "Viktor Arvidsson scored his third goal in two nights and the visiting Nashville Predators squeaked past the Detroit Red Wings 3-2 on Tuesday at Little Caesars Arena.\nArvidsson notched two goals in a 5-2 home victory over the Ottawa Senators on Monday. Scott Hartnell and Kyle Turris had the other goals against the Red Wings in the second meeting between the clubs in four nights.\nRoman Josi and Ryan Ellis supplied two assists apiece, and Juuse Saros made 34 saves for the Predators.\nThe Red Wings won at Nashville 3-1 on Saturday behind goaltender Petr Mrazek, who stopped 30 shots. Mrazek was dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers for draft picks on Monday.\nAndreas Athanasiou had a goal and an assist for the Red Wings on Tuesday. Tomas Tatar scored the other goal, and Jimmy Howard made 26 saves.\nThere were no power-play goals. Nashville had just one opportunity, while Detroit was awarded three. Nashville had a 25-20 advantage in hits and an 18-17 edge in blocked shots.\nHartnell’s ninth goal off assists from Josi and Ellis just 4:18 into the game put Nashville on top. The Predators scored again a little over five minutes later when Turris gathered in a rebound of a Josi shot from the point. He steered the puck toward the goalpost and then behind the prone Howard.\nAthanasiou tallied midway through the second period on a breakaway after a lead pass from Dylan Larkin. Howard had stopped a Nashville breakaway attempt moments earlier.\nArvidsson got behind the Detroit defense after a pass from P.K. Subban and beat Howard on the stick side 4:50 into the third period to make it 3-1. Detroit pulled within one goal three minutes later when Tatar poked the puck past Saros during a scramble in front of the net.\nDetroit had a power play during the last 28 seconds but couldn’t get off a clean shot.\nThe Predators will seek their third straight victory on Thursday when they host the San Jose Sharks. The Red Wings, who have lost three of their past four, remain home to face the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
