Its last win over a top-ranked team came all the way back on Jan. 26, 1985, against Georgetown.\nThe Red Storm were riding an 11-game overall losing streak before defeating No. 4 Duke on Sunday.\nJalen Brunson led Villanova with 28 points while Collin Gillespie added a career-high 12. Omari Spellman had 11 points and 12 rebounds for the Wildcats, and Mikal Bridges and Donte DiVincenzo also scored 11 points apiece.\nThe Wildcats dropped to 22-2 overall, 9-2 in the conference.\nVillanova played without forward Eric Paschall, who sustained a concussion on Sunday in a win over Seton Hall. Freshman Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree got the start while freshman Jermaine Samuels also played after missing the previous 10 games with a broken bone in his hand.\nVillanova was also without guard Phil Booth due to a fractured bone in his right hand, so coach Jay Wright was forced to play as many as three freshmen on the court at one time for long stretches.\nThe Red Storm started strong in the second half and surged ahead 47-41.\nPonds drained a 3-pointer from the baseline for a 50-43 lead with 12:47 left. St. John’s kept the pressure on and Simon eventually hit a short jumper for a 57-50 advantage with 7:30 remaining.\nVillanova missed 10 of its first 11 3-point attempts in the second half, which helped the Red Storm move to that seven-point lead.\nSt. John’s led 65-58 with 3:46 left, and Brunson then missed a short jumper. Ponds tossed in a runner in the lane for a 67-58 advantage.\nBrunson scored five straight points as he knocked down 1 of 2 free throws and followed with a jumper and a driving layup to get the Wildcats within 67-63 with 1:28 remaining. After a turnover, Brunson converted a conventional three-point play, cutting the deficit to 67-66.\nClark responded for St. John’s with a three-point play and a 70-66 lead with 1:15 left.\nVillanova kept chipping away, and Gillespie drained a 3-pointer from the wing to cut the gap to 74-73 with 23.2 seconds left.\nWith the Wildcats down 75-73, Spellman hoisted a 3-pointer but missed off the back rim.\nClark followed with a pair of free throws to seal an unlikely win.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
