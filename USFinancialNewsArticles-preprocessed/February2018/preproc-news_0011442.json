    "text": "CARACAS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s central bank on Monday said its new DICOM exchange rate would be at 30,987.5 bolivars per euro in its first auction.\nDICOM is now the country’s only official exchange rate, though on the black market a dollar fetches 228,000 bolivars.\nLast week, the central bank removed the stronger DIPRO exchange rate of 10 bolivars per dollar.
