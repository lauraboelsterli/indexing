The LRA was ejected from the area in 2005.\nFilda Akumu, 35, whose family was massacred by LRA rebels, battled with trauma after escaping rebel captivity.\n“When I witnessed my father and my two brothers being hacked to death, I never thought I would heal again - until now,” said Akumu, who also volunteers at the project.\nThousands of former abductees - like Akumu - suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and suicidal thoughts, making it hard to rebuild their lives, experts say.\nThe presence of dogs can provide comfort to people with mental health problems and distract them from upsetting thoughts, research shows.\nOkello gets many of his dogs from The Big Fix, northern Uganda’s only veterinary hospital.\n“I mainly use stray dogs because they face tough conditions,” Okello said.\n“When these dogs bond with our patients, they form a companionship that heals both parties.”\nReporting by John Okot.
