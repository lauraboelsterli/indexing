    "text": "EditorsNote: update 2: changes Parker’s point total in third graf\nBradley Beal scored 21 points and the Washington Wizards held off a furious fourth-quarter comeback attempt in a 107-104 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Tuesday night at the Bradley Center.\nOtto Porter hit three 3-pointers and added 17 for the Wizards, who shot 47 percent from the floor.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee with 23 points. Jabari Parker finished with 19 off the bench while Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe added 17 apiece.\nFrom the opening tip, Milwaukee look destined to lose its second straight game -- in humiliating fashion.\nThe Bucks missed their first six shots while Washington raced out to a 14-0 lead and after hitting six of 10 3-pointers in the opening half, led 64-50 at the break.\nThe lone bright spot for the Bucks were Parker -- who scored 14 points in 11 minutes of work in the half -- and Antetokounmpo who also had 14 in the half and added six assists, five rebounds, two steals and a pair of blocks.\nMilwaukee stormed back into the game with a strong third quarter. The Bucks outscored Washington 31-20 and thanks to Jason Terry’s 3-pointer and a block by Antetokounmpo, Washington led by just three.\nAn Antetokounmpo lay-in made it a one-point game with 9:47 to play.\nWashington recovered and stretched its lead back to three on a step-back jumper from Beal with 7:07 remaining. The Bucks got back within a point on a tip-in from Antetokounmpo but missed a chance to take their first lead of the night when Bledsoe missed a 3-point try from the corner and Middleton’s jumper from the top of the key fell short with 5:44 left.\nKelly Oubre Jr. converted a three-point play to put the Wizards up six with 4:53 left only for the Bucks to answer again, this time with a 3-pointer from Tony Snell and a two-footer from John Henson, making it a 99-98 game with 3:37 left.\nThe Bucks would get no closer than that, though. Beal beat the shot clock with a 3-pointer to put the Wizards up five, and after Middleton’s three-point play with 50 seconds left, Antetokounmpo missed a 13-footer that could have tied the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
