    "text": "LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - British bookmaker William Hill will pay 6.2 million pounds ($8.7 million) as a penalty for breaching anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations, the Gambling Commission said on Tuesday.\nFailure in the company’s checks resulted in 10 customers depositing large sums linked to criminal offences, resulting in gains for William Hill of around 1.2 million pounds, it said.\n“This was a systemic failing at William Hill which went on for nearly two years and today’s penalty package – which could exceed 6.2 million pounds - reflects the seriousness of the breaches,” the commission said.\n$1 = 0.7157 pounds Reporting by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
