    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) (\"AT&T\") announced today the expiration of its five separate offers to purchase for cash (the \"Cash Offers\"), any and all of the outstanding notes listed in the table below which have a special mandatory redemption provision (collectively, the \"Old Notes\"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated February 15, 2018 (the \"Offer to Purchase\" and, together with the accompanying notice of guaranteed delivery and electronic transmission of certification of eligibility to participate, the \"Cash Offer Documents\").\nThe Cash Offers expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 22, 2018 (the \"Cash Offer Expiration Date\"). The \"Cash Offer Settlement Date\" will be promptly following the Cash Offer Expiration Date and is expected to be February 27, 2018. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the table below provides the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date and the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes that AT&T expects to accept on the Cash Offer Settlement Date in connection with the Cash Offers.\nTitle of Series of Old Notes to be Purchased\nPrincipal Amount\nOutstanding\n(mm)\nISIN No.\nPrincipal Amount\nTendered(1)(2)\nPrincipal Amount\nAT&T Expects to\nAccept(2)\nFloating Rate Global Notes due 2023\n€1,250\nXS1629866606\n€11,650,000\n€11,650,000\n1.050% Global Notes due 2023\n€750\nXS1629865897\n€5,200,000\n€5,200,000\n1.800% Global Notes due 2026\n€1,750\nXS1629866192\n€500,000\n€500,000\n2.350% Global Notes due 2029\n€1,500\nXS1629866275\n€400,000\n€400,000\n3.550% Global Notes due 2037\n£1,000\nXS1634248865\n£825,000\n£0\n(1) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Cash Offer Expiration Date, based on information provided by the tender agent to AT&T.\n(2) The principal amounts tendered and expected to be accepted as reflected in the table above, do not include the aggregate principal amounts of Old Notes that may be validly tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Offers.\nBased on the amount of Old Notes tendered in the Cash Offers and in accordance with the terms of the Cash Offers, AT&T expects to accept, on the Cash Offer Settlement Date, all of the Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, other than the 3.550% Global Notes due 2037. The 3.550% Global Notes due 2037 will not be accepted because the minimum condition in the offer by AT&T to exchange the 3.550% Global Notes due 2037 pursuant to the Offering Memorandum, dated February 15, 2018, was not satisfied. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Cash Offer Documents, Cash Offer Eligible Holders (as defined below) who (i) validly tendered and who did not validly withdraw Old Notes at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date or (ii) delivered a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required documents at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date and who tender their Old Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 26, 2018 pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, and whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase by AT&T, will receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). Cash Offer Eligible Holders are required to electronically transmit the certification of eligibility to participate in the Cash Offers and are required to tender in the applicable minimum denominations in order to receive the applicable Total Consideration.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, on the Cash Offer Settlement Date, AT&T expects to pay an aggregate total consideration of (i) €11,766,500 for the Floating Rate Global Notes due 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €14,331.11; (ii) €5,252,000 for the 1.050% Global Notes due 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €26,327.66; (iii) €505,000 for the 1.800% Global Notes due 2026, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €4,339.73 and (iv) €404,000 for the 2.350% Global Notes due 2029, plus accrued and unpaid interest of €4,532.60, in each case for the respective series of Old Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Offers. The actual aggregate total consideration that will be paid on the Cash Offer Settlement Date is subject to change based on deliveries under the guaranteed delivery procedures and final validation of tenders. Interest will cease to accrue on the Cash Offer Settlement Date for all Old Notes accepted, including those tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedures. No further interest will be paid to the Cash Offer Eligible Holders who tender such Old Notes, including if a record date for an interest payment on such Old Notes has passed before the Cash Offer Settlement Date.\nOnly holders who were not (i) \"qualified institutional buyers\" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and who were not (ii) non-U.S. persons (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) located outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, other than \"retail investors\" in the European Economic Area (for these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (x) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, \"MiFID II\"); or (y) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2003/71/EC, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (z) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive), or non-\"accredited investors\", as such term is defined in National Instrument 45-106 – Prospectus Exemptions and section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), located or resident in a province of Canada, were authorized to participate in the Cash Offers (\"Cash Offer Eligible Holders\").\nOnly Cash Offer Eligible Holders who delivered an electronic submission of certification, certifying that they are a Cash Offer Eligible Holder, were authorized to participate in the Cash Offers.\nThis press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein.
