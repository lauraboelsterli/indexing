(Nasdaq:KMDA) (KMDA.TA), a plasma-derived protein therapeutics company focused on orphan indications, today announced financial results for the three and 12-months ended December 31, 2017.\n“Kamada’s financial performance for full-year 2017 was strong, highlighted by the achievement of revenue growth of 33 percent,” said Amir London, Kamada’s Chief Executive Officer. “Importantly, our total revenue of $102.8 million, which exceeded our previously provided guidance of $100 million in 2017 represented the highest annual revenue for Kamada since the company was founded. Driven primarily by increased sales of GLASSIA, full-year 2017 revenues from the Proprietary Products segment were $79.5 million, a substantial 42 percent increase year-over-year, and higher than our initial forecast of $76 to $78 million. Kamada also generated positive operating and net income for the full-year 2017, and gross profit grew 50 percent year-over-year. Additionally, during 2017, we also generated $3.9 million in cash flow from operating activities.”\n“Looking ahead, Kamada is well-positioned to grow our top-line revenues through the continued growth of GLASSIA sales and the U.S. launch of KEDRAB, our anti-rabies IgG product, which recently received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and initial sales are expected in early 2018. As such, we expect total revenues in 2018 to be in the range of $116 million to $120 million, which would represent a 13 to 17 percent growth rate versus total reported revenue for 2017. Beyond our commercial progress, we also have a valuable clinical pipeline with important milestones expected throughout 2018. Our clinical programs include inhaled AAT for the treatment of AAT Deficiency, and IV-AAT targeting multiple orphan indications. Additionally, we have a strong balance sheet with $43 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, which provides us with the financial resources needed to further grow our business.”\nFinancial Highlights for the 12-Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues were $102.8 million, a 33% increase from the $77.5 million recorded in 2016.

This three-year agreement will extend through 2020, and is expected to generate revenues for Kamada of approximately $13 million. Announced a collaboration with the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) to conduct a proof-of-concept clinical trial assessing the safety and preliminary efficacy of Kamada’s Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) as preemptive therapy for patients at high-risk for the development of steroid-refractory acute GvHD (SR-aGvHD). The study will be initiated in the first quarter of 2018 and conducted in five US centers. This is an investigator-initiated study, co-funded by Mount Sinai and Kamada, and is sponsored by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Under the terms of the agreement, Kamada received exclusive rights to develop and commercialize AAT for the preemption of GvHD using the MAGIC biomarkers. Announced interim results from the Company’s Phase 2 trial of intravenous AAT (IV AAT) for the prevention of lung transplant rejection. Kamada’s IV AAT demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in 10 patients during the first six months of treatment, consistent with previously observed results in other indications. The next interim report is expected in 2H 2018 following completion of one year of treatment, and top-line results are anticipated in 2H 2019. Appointed three new directors to the Board of Directors: Dr. Itzhak Krinsky, Ph.D., Mr. Shmuel (Milky) Rubinstein, and Mr. Asaf Frumerman.\n2018 Revenue Guidance\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Kamada continues to expect that total revenues will be in the range of $116 to $120 million.\nConference Call\nKamada management will host an investment community conference call on Wednesday, February 7 at 8:30am Eastern Time, to discuss these results and answer questions.

The Company uses its proprietary platform technology and know-how for the extraction and purification of proteins from human plasma to produce Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) in a highly-purified, liquid form, as well as other plasma-derived Immune globulins. AAT is a protein derived from human plasma with known and newly-discovered therapeutic roles given its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective and antimicrobial properties. The Company’s flagship product is GLASSIA®, the first liquid, ready-to-use, intravenous plasma-derived AAT product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Kamada markets GLASSIA® in the U.S. through a strategic partnership with Baxalta (now part of Shire plc) and in other counties through local distributors. In addition to GLASSIA®, Kamada has a product line of six other pharmaceutical products administered by injection or infusion, that are marketed through distributors in more than 15 countries, including Israel, Russia, Brazil, India and other countries in Latin America and Asia. Kamada has late-stage products in development, including an inhaled formulation of AAT for the treatment of AAT deficiency and, in addition, its intravenous AAT is in development for other indications, such as type-1 diabetes, GvHD and prevention of lung transplant rejection. Kamada's rabies immune globulin (Human) product received FDA approval for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis against rabies infection in August 2017. Kamada also leverages its expertise and presence in the plasma-derived protein therapeutics market by distributing more than 10 complementary products in Israel that are manufactured by third parties.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
