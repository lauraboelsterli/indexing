    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CA, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (NASDAQ:OCSL) (“Oaktree Specialty Lending” or the “Company”), a specialty finance company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFirst Fiscal Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal investment income of $33.9 million, or $0.24 per share; Net investment income of $13.3 million, or $0.09 per share;\nNet asset value per share as of December 31, 2017 of $5.81; Originated $183.0 million of new investment commitments and received $196.4 million in connection with nine full repayments and exits of investments; and Entered into a new secured revolving credit facility, increasing its total capacity to $600 million from $525 million and extending the reinvestment period and maturity date to November 29, 2020 and November 29, 2021, respectively.\nManagement Commentary\n“Since we began managing Oaktree Specialty Lending in mid-October, we have been focused on repositioning the portfolio and optimizing our capital structure,” said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Oaktree Specialty Lending. “We have made considerable progress, including identifying core investments that we intend to hold and developing a monetization strategy for investments that are non-core and we intend to exit. We also closed a new credit facility which expands our borrowing capacity and has attractive pricing and terms. While it is still early in the process, we believe we are on track to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over time.”\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $1.4 billion and was comprised of investments in 122 companies. These included loans to 75 companies, eight public bond issuances, the investment in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (“SLF JV I”) and equity investments in 66 companies, including in SLF JV I and 18 private equity funds. 28 of these equity investments were in companies in which Oaktree Specialty Lending also had a debt investment.\nAt fair value, 91.9% of the Company's portfolio as of December 31, 2017 consisted of debt investments, including 56.8% of first lien loans, 19.1% of second lien loans and 16.0% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I.\nAs of December 31, 2017, SLF JV I had $284.5 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 34 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $2.8 million for Oaktree Specialty Lending during the first quarter.\nThe weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of December 31, 2017, including the return on our mezzanine note investments in SLF JV I, was 9.0%.\nAs of December 31, 2017, $1.1 billion of the Company's debt investments, or 82.4% of the total debt portfolio, at fair value, had floating interest rates.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $183.0 million of investment commitments, including investments in 13 new and one existing portfolio company, and funded $200.2 million of investments across new and existing portfolio companies.\nDuring the quarter, the Company received $196.4 million from the full repayments and exits of nine investments, and $88.4 million from other paydowns and sales of investments.\nResults of Operations\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $33.9 million, including $29.9 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments. Payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest income, net of PIK collected in cash, represented 2.3% of total investment income for the quarter.\nNet expenses for the quarter were $20.6 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in net expenses was due primarily to a $3.2 million decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the SBA debentures during the three months ended September 30, 2017. Excluding interest expense, net expenses were $11.0 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, due primarily to a decrease in management fees, board of director fees and administrator, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in professional fees.\nNet unrealized depreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $43.5 million, which was primarily due to write-downs on three portfolio companies. Net realized loss for the quarter was $0.3 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $45.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, total principal value of debt outstanding of $629.7 million, and $395.0 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facility, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 4.79% as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total leverage ratio was 0.77x debt-to-equity.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company entered into a new secured syndicated revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase its total capacity under the facility to $600 million from $525 million and extend the reinvestment period and maturity date to November 29, 2020 and November 29, 2021, respectively, as compared to its prior credit facility. In addition, during the quarter, the Company repaid all outstanding borrowings ($29.5 million) under the credit facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\nDividend Declaration\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nDividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of dividend distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company’s stockholders.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were eight investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or original issue discount (\"OID\") income that, in the aggregate, represented 14.5% of the debt portfolio at cost and 3.2% at fair value.\n($ in thousands) Non-Accrual - Debt Investments As of December 31, 2017 As of September 30, 2017 Non-Accrual Investments at Fair Value $ 41,458 $ 67,015 Non-Accrual Investments/Total Investments at Fair Value 3.2% 4.7%\nOaktree Specialty Lending Corporation Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities (in thousands, except per share amounts) December 31, 2017\n(unaudited) September 30,\n2017 ASSETS Investments at fair value: Control investments (cost December 31, 2017: $438,415;
