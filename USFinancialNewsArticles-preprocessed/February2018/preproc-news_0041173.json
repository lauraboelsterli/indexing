    "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amber Road, Inc. (NYSE: AMBR), a leading provider of global trade management (GTM) solutions, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJim Preuninger, Chief Executive Officer of Amber Road, stated, “I am particularly pleased that for 2017 we generated positive adjusted EBITDA and positive cash flow from operations, exclusive of the retention payment for ecVision. Increasingly complex global trade regulations, ever-changing free trade agreements, and continual shifts in global logistics and supply chains are driving demand for our solutions. During 2017, we were successful in adding many great customers across all of the industry verticals and geographies we serve, as well as expanding across our existing customer base. Our customer retention was again very high, and we saw many lighthouse customers go-live each quarter. We believe we have set a path towards generating stronger revenue growth, while delivering sustainable profit and cash flow.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $20.6 million, an increase compared to $19.2 million for the comparable period of 2016.

Cash provided by operating activities was $2.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Cash used in operating activities was $(0.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash used in operating activities of $(0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nA reconciliation of GAAP operating loss and net loss to Non-GAAP adjusted operating loss and net loss, and of GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on information available as of February 15, 2018, Amber Road is issuing guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018. Refer to the reconciliation of GAAP guidance to non-GAAP guidance tables at the end of this release for details on non-GAAP adjustments.\nThe guidance provided below reflects the impact of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606), which Amber Road is adopting for its fiscal year 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. As required by the new standard, Amber Road will report its financial results under both ASC 606 and the previous standard (ASC 605) for the 2018 transition year. In order to provide additional transparency, in addition to the guidance under ASC 606, Amber Road is providing guidance for revenue and non-GAAP operating loss under ASC 605 for the first quarter and full year 2018, and an estimate of the changes to its guidance resulting from the transition from ASC 605 to ASC 606. Amber Road believes that providing this additional disclosure will help investors and analysts better understand the impact that the adoption of ASC 606 has on the Company’s guidance and reported results.\nThe reduction in 2018 revenue under ASC 606 relative to ASC 605 is principally due to the loss of services revenue from professional services billings delivered as of December 31, 2017 for on-premise installations of our software. Under ASC 605, revenue from these billings were deferred and amortized ratably over the subscription term of the related contract. Under ASC 606, billings for professional services related to on-premise software installations will be recognized as revenue as services are performed. As the professional services were delivered previous to December 31, 2017, the amount included in deferred revenue as of that date will not be recognized in 2018 and beyond.\nThis impact to revenue is anticipated to be greatest in the first quarter of 2018, and to decrease throughout the year. The actual impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on revenue will depend on the number of, if any, on-premise professional service engagements.\nExpenses under ASC 606 relative to ASC 605 will be reduced as the result of amortizing capitalized customer acquisition costs over an estimate of customer life, whereas, under ASC 605, the initial customer contract term was used for the amortization period.\nGiven our adoption of ASC 606, we anticipate first quarter and full-year 2018 results to be in the following ranges:\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance (in millions, except per share info) :\nUnder ASC 606 Under ASC 605 Impact of Adoption\nof ASC 606\nLow High Low High Low\nHigh\nRevenue $ 19.6 $ 20.2 $ 20.3 $ 20.9 $ (0.7 ) $ (0.7 ) Year-over-year growth 9 % 12 % Non-GAAP adjusted loss from operations $ (2.3 ) $ (1.7 ) $ (1.9 ) $ (1.3 ) $ (0.4 ) $ (0.4 ) Non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.10 ) $ (0.08 ) Assumed weighted average shares outstanding 29.0 29.0\nFull Year 2018 Guidance (in millions, except per share info) :\nUnder ASC 606 Under ASC 605 Impact of Adoption\nof ASC 606 Low High Low High Low\nHigh\nRevenue $ 84.0 $ 87.0 $ 86.0 $ 89.0 $ (2.0 ) $ (2.0 ) Year-over-year growth 9 % 13 % Non-GAAP adjusted loss from operations $ (6.6 ) $ (3.6 ) $ (5.1 ) $ (2.1 ) $ (1.5 ) $ (1.5 ) Non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.29 ) $ (0.19 ) Assumed weighted average shares outstanding 30.0 30.0 Endnotes:\n(1) For 2017, non-GAAP adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss excludes stock-based compensation and change in fair value of contingent consideration liability. For 2016, non-GAAP adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss excludes stock-based compensation, change in fair value of contingent consideration liability, purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, acquisition compensation costs and acquisition related costs.\nConference Call Information\nAmber Road will host a conference call on Thursday, February 15, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter financial results and its business outlook.

We provide rich data analytics to uncover areas for optimization and deliver a platform that is responsive and flexible to adapt to the ever-changing nature of global trade.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, Amber Road has provided non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP guidance within this press release including non-GAAP adjusted operating and net loss and adjusted EBITDA, financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Provided below is a reconciliation of GAAP operating and net loss to non-GAAP adjusted operating and net loss, and net loss to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA consists of net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense (income) and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA plus stock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liability, purchase accounting adjustment to deferred revenue, acquisition compensation costs and acquisition related costs. Amber Road has included these non-GAAP measures in this press release because it assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it removes from operating results the impact of the Company’s capital structure. Amber Road believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to an investor in evaluating its operating performance because they are often used by the financial community to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets, and to present a meaningful measure of performance exclusive of its capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nAmber Road’s use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of its results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and these non-GAAP measures do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; these non-GAAP measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; these non-GAAP measures do not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available; and other companies, including companies in Amber Road’s industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider these non-GAAP measures together with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss and other GAAP results. A reconciliation of GAAP operating and net loss to non-GAAP adjusted operating and net loss, and adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our current expectations and beliefs, and therefore, contain risks and uncertainties about future events or our future financial performance, including, but not limited to, achieving revenue from bookings, closing business from the sales pipeline, new customer deployments and maintaining these relationships, the ability to reduce operating losses and use of cash, and attaining profitability. In some cases, you can identify by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative. These statements are only predictions and may be inaccurate. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider various factors, including the risks outlined in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, without limitation, our annual, periodic and current SEC reports. These factors may cause our actual results to any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the are reasonable, our future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements may differ from our expectations. Other than as required by law, we do not undertake to update any of the after the date of this press release, even though our situation may change in the future.\nAMBER ROAD, INC.
