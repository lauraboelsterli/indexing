    "text": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co on Friday reported quarterly revenue that marginally beat Wall Street estimates, helped by a rise in demand for its Pepperidge Farm Snacks.\nNet earnings attributable to the company rose to $285 million, or 95 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Jan. 28, from $101 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe reported quarter benefited from a $124 million gain related to the overhaul of the U.S. tax code.\nNet sales rose to $2.18 billion from $2.17 billion, beating analystsâ€™ average estimate of $2.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOrganic sales, which excludes acquisitions and foreign exchange impacts, fell 2 percent.
