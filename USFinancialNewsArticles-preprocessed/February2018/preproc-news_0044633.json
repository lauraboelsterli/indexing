    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Barington Capital Group, L.P. (\"Barington\"), which represents a group of shareholders of Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLMN) (\"Bloomin'\" or the \"Company\"), announced today that it has sent a letter and a detailed presentation to the Chairman and CEO of Bloomin' recommending that the Company implement a variety of measures to improve long-term value.\nBarington is concerned by the Company's sustained period of underperformance relative to its peers and the market as a whole under its current management team. Barington believes that this underperformance is attributable to a number of factors, including poor operating execution, weak same store sales, declining unit counts, substantial asset impairment charges, ineffective advertising, and excessive corporate expenses.\nIt is Barington's belief that Bloomin' can address its challenges by taking the following steps: (a) spin off its smaller brands (Bonefish Grill, Carrabba's and Fleming's) into a new company, leaving Outback to operate independently, in order to improve strategic focus and operating execution at each brand; (b) enhance the guest experience to increase revenues and improve customer loyalty; (c) reduce excessive expenses including advertising and corporate overhead; and (d) improve the Company's corporate governance and the composition of its board of directors.\nBarington is convinced that the Company's intrinsic value per share is well above its current market price and believes that if Bloomin' effectively executes its recommendations, the value of the Company's stock could increase to approximately $41 per share.\nBarington's letter and presentation to the Company are available at: www.barington.com/bloomin.html\nAbout Barington Capital Group, L.P.\nBarington Capital Group, L.P. is a fundamental, value-oriented activist investment firm that was established by James A. Mitarotonda in January 2000.

Barington has significant experience investing in consumer-focused companies, with prior investments in companies such as Darden Restaurants, Lone Star Steakhouse, The Children's Place, Dillard's, The Jones Group, Warnaco, Nautica, The Pep Boys and Steven Madden.\nPLEASE SEE http://www.barington.com/bloomin.html FOR IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES CONCERNING BARINGTON'S LETTER AND PRESENTATION.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/barington-capital-group-calls-for-changes-at-bloomin-brands-to-improve-long-term-value-300601708.html\nSOURCE Barington Capital Group, L.P.",
