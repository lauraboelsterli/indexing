    "text": "YARDLEY, Pa., Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Optinose (NASDAQ:OPTN), a pharmaceutical company focused on patients treated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists, today announced that CEO Peter Miller has been chosen as the 2017 Frank Baldino Bioscience CEO of the Year by Life Sciences Pennsylvania. Additionally, Optinose has been honored as a finalist for Emerging Company of the Year. The winner will be announced at the Annual Dinner on March 14 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia.\n“I am humbled and honored to be recognized as the Frank Baldino Bioscience CEO of the Year, and I could not be more proud to lead this team of incredibly talented individuals at Optinose and of our significant achievements as a team in 2017,” said Peter Miller, CEO of Optinose. “Additionally, I am extremely pleased that Life Sciences Pennsylvania has chosen to recognize Optinose as a finalist for emerging company of the year.”\n“Our company is built on two foundational values: one mission–meaning we win or lose as a team–and friendship,” Miller continued. “As a result, Ramy Mahmoud, our President and someone I consider my business partner, and I have been able to create a company of exceptional people who are united by a focus on improving patient lives.”\nFor the Baldino award and the emerging company of the year award nomination, Life Sciences Pennsylvania recognized a number of accomplishments of the Optinose team. In 2017, Optinose achieved first-pass FDA approval of XHANCE™, its lead product, and a key element of the Company’s business plan and regulatory strategy. Additionally, the Optinose team has completed three fundraisings during the last 10 months for a total of $237.5 million in net proceeds, including a successful IPO that raised $138 million in gross proceeds.\nThe Frank Baldino Bioscience CEO of the Year Award recognizes a CEO who has demonstrated visionary leadership and active participation to advance the industry. Frank Baldino, Jr., founder and CEO of Cephalon, Inc., was a pillar of the Life Sciences community in the Greater Philadelphia region and of the biotechnology industry as a whole. In honor of Dr. Baldino's legacy, the award recipient will have a record of proven, exceptional achievement as well as a commitment to the biosciences for the benefit of patients. The recipient must be from a company with fewer than 250 employees and exhibit these leadership qualities. The honoree is selected by the Life Sciences PA Board of Directors.\nThe Life Sciences Pennsylvania Emerging Company of the Year Award recognizes a company or organization of 100 employees or less with significant operations in Pennsylvania that has experienced significant growth and/or achievement in 2017, while contributing positively to its community and the overall life sciences business climate of the Commonwealth.\nAbout Optinose\nOptinose is a global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on serving the needs of patients cared for by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists.
