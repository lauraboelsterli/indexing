    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., Feb. 13,\nKey Financial Metrics\nTotal revenues were $177.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $796.6 million for the full year Net income was $55.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter and $147.9 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share, for the full year Adjusted net income (1) was $57.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter and $169.6 million, or $2.15 per diluted common share, for the full year Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $184.6 million for the fourth quarter and $801.6 million for the full year Cash ROE (1) was 15.0% in 2017; net cash interest margin (1) was 8.6%\nHighlights\nPlaced seven wide-bodies on long-term leases in 2017 Acquired 40 aircraft during the fourth quarter for $920 million, and a record 68 aircraft for the full year Committed to acquire fourteen additional narrow-body aircraft in 2018 for more than $540 million Sold eight aircraft during the fourth quarter and 37 aircraft for the full year; full year sales included three wide-bodies, four freighters, and our last six classic aircraft Declared our 47th consecutive quarterly dividend\n(1) Refer to the selected financial information accompanying this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP numbers.\nAircastle Limited (the \"Company\" or \"Aircastle\") (NYSE: AYR) reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $55.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, and adjusted net income of $57.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted common share. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $147.9 million, or $1.87 per diluted common share, and adjusted net income was $169.6 million, or $2.15 per diluted common share. The fourth quarter results included total revenues of $177.4 million versus $204.7 million in the prior year. For the full year 2017, total revenues were $796.6 million, an increase of 3.1%, versus $773.0 million in 2016.\nCommenting on the results, Mike Inglese, Aircastle's CEO, stated, \"With $148 million of full year net income, Aircastle had a great 2017 and a strong fourth quarter. Throughout the year we worked diligently to extend and transition the leases on seven wide-bodies while selling another three. As a result of these efforts, we have taken care of essentially all of our 2018 lease placement activity. We also opportunistically sold four freighters and our last six classics. Aircastle's aircraft portfolio is in great shape and is well balanced.\"\nMr. Inglese concluded, \"As competitive investment market conditions are expected to persist into 2018, we believe that Aircastle will once again benefit from our outstanding team, a strong balance sheet and a nuanced investment approach that prioritizes flexibility and disciplined growth, in order to maximize risk-adjusted returns and increase sustainable earnings and operating cash flow over time. By continuing to execute our strategy, we are positioned to continue to grow profitably and create long-term shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Results\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal revenues\n$\n177,402\n$\n204,653\n$\n796,620\n$\n772,958\nLease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues\n$\n179,284\n$\n191,714\n$\n747,018\n$\n742,410\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n184,553\n$\n220,493\n$\n801,584\n$\n767,953\nNet income\n$\n55,120\n$\n67,724\n$\n147,874\n$\n151,453\nPer common share - Diluted\n$\n0.70\n$\n0.86\n$\n1.87\n$\n1.92\nAdjusted net income (1)\n$\n57,040\n$\n70,525\n$\n169,566\n$\n168,527\nPer common share - Diluted\n$\n0.72\n$\n0.90\n$\n2.15\n$\n2.14\n(1) Refer to the selected financial information accompanying this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP numbers.\nFull Year Results\nTotal revenues in 2017 were $796.6 million, an increase of $23.7 million, while lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues were $747.0 million, an increase of $4.6 million. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by $22.5 million of higher maintenance revenues and higher lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues associated with net fleet growth.\nNet income for the full year was $147.9 million, down $3.6 million year-over-year, while adjusted net income was $169.6 million, an increase of $1.0 million. Higher total revenues of $23.7 million, higher gains from the sale of flight equipment of $16.0 million, and lower interest expense of $14.4 million offset higher aircraft impairment charges of $51.8 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year was $801.6 million, up $33.6 million versus 2016, reflecting a $22.5 million increase in maintenance revenue and higher gains from the sale of flight equipment of $16.0 million, partially offset by higher SG&A, excluding share based compensation, of $6.5 million, mostly driven by higher personnel costs and headcount.\nFourth Quarter Results\nTotal revenues were $177.4 million, a decrease of $27.3 million, or 13.3%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to a $12.4 million decline in lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues, and a $12.6 million decrease in maintenance revenues.\nLease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues were $179.3 million versus $191.7 million the prior year. The 6.5% decrease was driven by lease transition and extension activity, mostly associated with seven wide-body and one freighter aircraft, which represented a combined 10.8% of total fleet net book value at year end.\nNet income was $55.1 million, a decrease of $12.6 million, while adjusted net income declined by $13.5 million to $57.0 million. Lower total revenues of $27.3 million and a $5.0 million reduction in gains from the sale of flight equipment were partially offset by an $11.3 million decrease in interest expense and lower depreciation of $6.1 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $184.6 million, down 16.3%, or $35.9 million. This was primarily driven by lower maintenance revenues of $12.6 million, lower total lease rental and finance and sales-type lease revenues of $12.4 million, and a $5.0 million decline in gains from aircraft sales in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAviation Assets\nDuring the fourth quarter, we acquired 40 aircraft for $920 million. For the year ended 2017, we acquired 68 aircraft for $1.6 billion. At the end of 2017, Aircastle's owned fleet of 224 aircraft had a weighted average age of 9.1 years and a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.0 years.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold eight aircraft, including one freighter and our last five classic aircraft, for total sales proceeds of $68.6 million and a gain on sale of $19.2 million.\nDuring the year ended 2017, we sold a total of 37 aircraft and other flight equipment for proceeds of $833.6 million and a gain on sale of $55.2 million. The average age of the 37 aircraft sold was 13.8 years with an average remaining lease term of 4.2 years.\nOur fleet utilization for the fourth quarter was 99.5% and 99.3% for the full year 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Aircastle owned 224 aircraft having a net book value of $6.7 billion. We also manage twelve aircraft with a net book value of $641 million on behalf of our joint ventures with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and IBJ Leasing of Japan.\nOwned Aircraft\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2017 (1)\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2016 (1)\nNet Book Value of Flight Equipment ($ mils.)\n$\n6,734\n$\n6,508\nNet Book Value of Unencumbered Flight Equipment ($ mils.)\n$\n5,346\n$\n4,614\nNumber of Aircraft\n224\n193\nNumber of Unencumbered Aircraft\n195\n156\nWeighted Average Fleet Age (years) (2)\n9.1\n7.9\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term (years) (2)\n5.0\n5.1\nWeighted Average Fleet Utilization for the year ended (3)\n99.3\n%\n98.9\n%\nPortfolio Yield for the year ended (2)(4)\n12.2\n%\n12.4\n%\nNet Cash Interest Margin (5)\n8.6\n%\n8.7\n%\nManaged Aircraft on behalf of Joint Ventures\nNet Book Value of Flight Equipment ($ mils.)\n$\n641\n$\n689\nNumber of Aircraft\n12\n13\n(1)\nCalculated using net book value of flight equipment held for lease and net investment in finance leases at period end.\n(2)\nWeighted by net book value.\n(3)\nAircraft on-lease days as a percent of total days in period weighted by net book value.\n(4)\nLease rental revenue and interest income and cash collections on finance and sales-type leases for the period as a percent of the average net book value of flight equipment held for lease and our investment in finance and sales-type leases for the period; quarterly information is annualized.\n(5)\nRefer to the selected financial information accompanying this press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP numbers. The calculation of Net Cash Interest Margin has been revised in this presentation to include collections from finance and sales-type leases minus interest on borrowings.\nFinancing Activity\nIn 2017, we secured $500 million of new financing. During the first quarter of 2017, we issued $500 million in unsecured Senior Notes due 2024 bearing a coupon of 4.125%.

We use EBITDA to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe this non-U.S. GAAP measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance.\nThis measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance. It provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed.\nEBITDA provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Accordingly, this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely the cost structure, or expenses, of the organization. EBITDA is one of the metrics used by senior management and the Board of Directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (as defined above) further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating covenant ratios and compliance as that term is defined in the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants.\nAircastle Limited and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted Net Income Reconciliation\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n55,120\n$\n67,724\n$\n147,874\n$\n151,453\nLoan termination fee (1)\n—\n908\n2,058\n4,960\n(Gain) loss on mark-to-market of interest rate derivative contracts (2)\n(592)\n(3,663)\n2,481\n(3,522)\nWrite-off of deferred financing fees (1)\n—\n3,451\n4,005\n2,880\nNon-cash share-based payment expense (3)\n2,512\n2,105\n13,148\n7,901\nSecuritization No. 1 hedge loss amortization charges (1)\n—\n—\n—\n4,855\nAdjusted net income\n$\n57,040\n$\n70,525\n$\n169,566\n$\n168,527\n(1) Included in Interest, net.\n(2) Included in Other income (expense).\n(3) Included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nManagement believes that ANI, when viewed in conjunction with the Company's results under U.S. GAAP and the above reconciliation, provides useful information about operating and period-over-period performance and additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting, changes related to refinancing activity and non-cash share-based payment expense.\nAircastle Limited and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nCash Return on Equity Calculation\n(Doll ars in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nPeriod\nCFFO\nFinance\nLease\nCollections\nGain on\nSale of\nFlight\nEquipment\nDeprec.\nDistributions\nin excess\n(less than)\nEquity\nEarnings\nCash\nEarnings\nAverage\nShareholders\nEquity\nTrailing\nTwelve\nMonth\nCash\nROE\n2011\n$\n359,377\n$\n—\n$\n39,092\n$\n242,103\n$\n—\n$\n156,366\n$\n1,370,513\n11.4\n%\n2012\n$\n427,277\n$\n3,852\n$\n5,747\n$\n269,920\n$\n—\n$\n166,956\n$\n1,425,658\n11.7\n%\n2013\n$\n424,037\n$\n9,508\n$\n37,220\n$\n284,924\n$\n—\n$\n185,841\n$\n1,513,156\n12.3\n%\n2014\n$\n458,786\n$\n10,312\n$\n23,146\n$\n299,365\n$\n667\n$\n193,546\n$\n1,661,228\n11.7\n%\n2015\n$\n526,285\n$\n9,559\n$\n58,017\n$\n318,783\n$\n(530)\n$\n274,548\n$\n1,759,871\n15.6\n%\n2016\n$\n468,092\n$\n19,413\n$\n39,126\n$\n305,216\n$\n(1,782)\n$\n219,633\n$\n1,789,256\n12.3\n%\n2017\n$\n490,871\n$\n32,184\n$\n55,167\n$\n298,664\n$\n(1,011)\n$\n278,547\n$\n1,861,005\n15.0\n%\nNote: LTM Average Shareholders' Equity is the average of the most recent five quarters period end Shareholders' Equity.
