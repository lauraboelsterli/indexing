    "text": "Feb 1 (Reuters) - Allergan Plc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the drugmakerâ€™s antibiotic Avycaz to treat two types of pneumonia caused by drug-resistant bacteria.\nThe decision comes after a successful late-stage study testing the drug on adults with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP).\nHABP and VABP are serious bacterial infections that occur in hospitalized patients who are associated with critically ill and vulnerable populations.\nAvycaz was first approved in 2015 to treat adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections in combination with metronidazole.\nLast year, the drug was also approved to treat complicated urinary tract infections including kidney infections.
