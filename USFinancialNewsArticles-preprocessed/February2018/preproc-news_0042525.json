You will see that reverberate through the economy.”\nFollowing many forecast increases by corporations in recent weeks, analysts on average now expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share in 2018 by 18.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nCisco surged 4.8 percent following upbeat results and a strong forecast, as the network gear maker’s years-long efforts to transform into a software-focused company began to pay off.\nWall Street investors were not alone in their optimism. Bullish sentiment among individual investors hit its highest level since mid-January in the American Association of Individual Investors’ weekly survey.\nAt 3:14 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.99 percent at 25,139.51 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 1.00 percent to 2,725.57.\nThe Nasdaq Composite added 1.42 percent to 7,244.94.\nEnergy was the only major S&P 500 sector index to fall, pulled down 0.48 percent by weaker oil prices.\nU.S. Treasury yields slipped as investors took a breather from selling bonds and readjusted positions to prepare for more inflation-related volatility, a scenario that could take yields even higher.\nFears of inflation and higher interest rates had sent the S&P 500 sharply lower at the start of February. In the past five sessions, the S&P 500 has gained 5.6 percent, and it remains down 5 percent from a Jan 26 record high.\n“We’re stabilized for the moment. The real question was how the market reacted to the CPI and PPI numbers and it seems to have taken higher inflation in stride,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” rose to 19.57 points, but was well below the 50 point-mark it touched last week.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.96-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.99-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nAdditional reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Nick Zieminski\n ",
