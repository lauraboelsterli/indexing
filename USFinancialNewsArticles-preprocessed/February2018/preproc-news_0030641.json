    "text": "Continues Strategic Asset Repositioning\nHUNT VALLEY, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI) (the “Company” or “Omega”) today announced its results of operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017. The Company reported for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 net income of $65.2 million or $0.31 per common share. The Company also reported Funds From Operations (“FFO”) for the quarter of $159.2 million or $0.77 per common share, Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO” or “Adjusted FFO”) of $163.7 million or $0.79 per common share, and Funds Available For Distribution (“FAD”) of $149.0 million.\nFFO for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $3.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $0.9 million in provisions for uncollectible accounts, $0.5 million of one-time revenue and $0.2 million in impairments on direct financing leases (Adjusted FFO excludes those four items). FFO, AFFO and FAD are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding these non-GAAP measures, see the “Funds From Operations” schedule.\nGAAP NET INCOME\nFor the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $65.2 million, or $0.31 per common share, on operating revenues of $221.2 million. This compares to net income of $129.9 million, or $0.63 per common share, on operating revenues of $234.5 million, for the same period in 2016.\nFor the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $104.9 million, or $0.51 per common share, on operating revenues of $908.4 million. This compares to net income of $383.4 million, or $1.90 per common share, on operating revenues of $900.8 million, for the same period in 2016.\nThe decrease in annual net income compared to the prior year was primarily due to $198.2 million in impairments on direct financing leases related to the Orianna Health Systems (“Orianna” and f/k/a ARK) portfolio, $40.6 million of reduced revenue resulting from placing Orianna and Daybreak on a cash basis in 2017, and incremental increases of $40.3 million in impairments on real estate assets, $24.7 million in interest expense, $20.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $19.9 million in interest refinancing costs, $4.7 million in provisions for uncollectible accounts and $1.8 million in general and administrative expenses. This decrease in net income was partially offset by $48.2 million of increased revenue associated with new investments completed in 2016 and 2017, $3.7 million in increased gains on the sale of assets, a contractual settlement of $10.4 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017 and a decrease of $9.6 million in acquisition costs.\nCEO COMMENTS\nTaylor Pickett, Omega’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “Healthcare delivery continues to rapidly evolve. In anticipation of the changing environment, we made significant progress in our strategic asset repositioning efforts during the fourth quarter.

The six Texas SNFs with approximately 575 beds were leased to a new operator of the Company with an initial annual cash yield of 9.25% and 2.5% annual escalators. On the same date, the Company also transferred one facility (120 beds) from an existing operator and added it to the new lessee’s master lease.\n$31 Million Capital Renovation Projects – In addition to the new investments outlined above, in Q4 2017, the Company invested $31.1 million under its capital renovation and construction-in-progress programs.\nASSETS IMPAIRMENTS AND DISPOSITIONS\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold 34 facilities for approximately $189.0 million in net cash proceeds recognizing a gain of approximately $46.4 million. The Company also received $0.1 million for final payment on one facility mortgage. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $0.9 million of provision for uncollectible accounts, related to the write-off of straight-line receivables, resulting from 2018 expected sales.\nIn addition, during the fourth quarter, the Company recorded approximately $63.5 million of impairments on real estate properties to reduce the net book value of 32 facilities to their estimated fair value or expected selling price. The fourth quarter impairments included a charge of $13.2 million related to a facility destroyed in a fire. The Company expects to receive insurance proceeds in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had 22 facilities, totaling $86.7 million, classified as assets held for sale. The Company expects to sell these facilities over the next few quarters. As part of its ongoing strategic asset repositioning program, the Company is also evaluating an additional $300+ million of potential disposition opportunities within its portfolio.\nDIVIDENDS\nOn January 16, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a common stock dividend of $0.66 per share, increasing the quarterly common dividend by $0.01 per share over the previous quarter. The common dividends are to be paid February 15, 2018 to common stockholders of record on January 31, 2018.\nMr. Pickett commented, “As a result of our strategic repositioning activities, 2018 will not be a growth year, and therefore, we do not expect to increase the dividend during 2018. However, I want to be very clear that we are confident in the payout percentage coverage and sustainability of our current quarterly dividend.”\n2018 ADJUSTED FFO GUIDANCE\nThe Company currently expects its 2018 Adjusted FFO to be between $2.96 and $3.06 per diluted share.\nBob Stephenson, Omega’s CFO commented, “Our 2018 guidance reflects the revenue reduction related to our fourth quarter asset sales, assets held for sale and approximately $300 million of potential asset dispositions.” Mr. Stephenson continued, “We fully expect to redeploy most of the capital from the sales by year end; however, the timing is very unpredictable.” Mr. Stephenson concluded, “Timing related to the redeployment of capital from asset sales and the timing related to the final outcome of the Orianna facilities may significantly impact our guidance and we have therefore expanded our guidance range versus previous years.”\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Omega’s guidance regarding Adjusted FFO to projected GAAP earnings.\n2018 Annual Adjusted FFO\nGuidance Range\n(per diluted common share) Full Year Net Income $1.43 - $1.53 Depreciation 1.45 Gain on assets sold - Real estate impairment - FFO $2.88 - $2.98 Adjustments: Acquisition/transaction costs - Interest – refinancing costs - Stock-based compensation expense 0.08 Adjusted FFO $2.96 - $3.06 Note: All per share numbers rounded to 2 decimals.\nThe Company's Adjusted FFO guidance for 2018 reflects the impact of approximately $100 million of planned capital renovation projects, the sale of $87 million of assets held for sale, approximately $300 million of potential divestitures and the redeployment of capital from asset sales. It assumes the Company will not be recording revenue related to its Orianna portfolio for the majority of 2018. It also excludes the impact of gains and losses from the sale of assets, certain revenue and expense items, interest refinancing expense, capital transactions, acquisition costs, and additional provisions for uncollectible accounts, if any. The Company may, from time to time, update its publicly announced Adjusted FFO guidance, but it is not obligated to do so.\nThe Company's guidance is based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the Company’s control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company's expectations may change. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the timing and completion of acquisitions, divestitures, capital and financing transactions, and variations in stock-based compensation expense may cause actual results to vary materially from our current expectations. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its projected results.\nTAX TREATMENT FOR 2017 DIVIDENDS\nOn February 15, 2017, May 15, 2017, August 15, 2017 and November 15, 2017, the Company paid dividends to its common stockholders in the per share amounts of $0.62, $0.63, $0.64 and $0.65, for stockholders of record on January 31, 2017, May 1, 2017, August 1, 2017 and October 31, 2017, respectively. The Company has determined that 36.70% of the common dividends paid in 2017 should be treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, 61.85% treated as an ordinary dividend, with the balance of 1.45% treated as capital gains.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will be conducting a conference call on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 10 a.m. Eastern to review the Company’s 2017 fourth quarter results and current developments.

For purposes of the Securities ’s Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the company, or include amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented. As used in this press release, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company calculates and reports FFO in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), and consequently, FFO is defined as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization and impairments on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The Company believes that FFO, Adjusted FFO and FAD are important supplemental measures of its operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. The term FFO was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue. FFO described herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO of other real estate investment trusts, or REITs, that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from the Company.\nAdjusted FFO is calculated as FFO excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and certain revenue and expense items identified above. FAD is calculated as Adjusted FFO less non-cash interest expense and non-cash revenue, such as straight-line rent. The Company believes these measures provide an enhanced measure of the operating performance of the Company’s core portfolio as a REIT. The Company’s computation of Adjusted FFO and FAD are not comparable to the NAREIT definition of FFO or to similar measures reported by other REITs, but the Company believes that they are appropriate measures for this Company.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP measures among the criteria to measure the operating performance of its business. The Company also uses Adjusted FFO among the performance metrics for performance-based compensation of officers. The Company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization, impairments on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. The Company offers these measures to assist the users of its financial statements in analyzing its operating performance and not as measures of liquidity or cash flow. These non-GAAP measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as measures of liquidity, alternatives to net income or indicators of any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors in the Company’s securities should not rely on these non-GAAP measures as substitutes for any GAAP measure, including net income.\nThe following tables present selected portfolio information, including operator and geographic concentrations, and revenue maturities for the period ended December 31, 2017:\nAs of December 31, 2017 As of December 31, 2017 Balance Sheet Data Total # of\nProperties\nTotal\nInvestment\n($000’s)\n% of\nInvestment\n# of\nOperating\nProperties (1)\n# of\nOperating\nBeds\nReal Estate Investments 869 $ 7,655,960 88 % 881 88,007 Direct Financing Leases 41 364,965 4 % 41 4,264 Mortgage Notes Receivable 51 671,232 8 % 51 5,366 961 $ 8,692,157 100 % 973 97,637 Assets held for sale 22 86,699 Total Investments 983 $ 8,778,856 Investment Data Total #\nof Properties\nTotal\nInvestment\n($000’s)\n% of\nInvestment\n# of\nOperating\nProperties (1)\n# of\nOperating\nBeds\nInvestment\nper Bed\n($000’s)\nSkilled Nursing Facilities/Transitional Care 828\n$\n7,210,049\n83\n%\n844\n89,646\n$\n80\nSenior Housing (2) 133 1,482,108 17 % 129 7,991 $ 185 961 $ 8,692,157 100 % 973 97,637 $ 89 Assets held for sale 22 86,699 Total Investments 983 $ 8,778,856 (1) Total # of Operating Properties excludes facilities which are non-operating, closed and/or not currently providing patient services.
