    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 2:50 PM / in 35 minutes CORRECTED-Express Scripts would look at Medicare pharmacy drug plan deals Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Corrects to fourth quarter from first quarter in second paragraph) NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co would take a look at any Medicare pharmacy drug plans up that go up for sale including those of Aetna Inc or CVS Health Corp as its rivals seek antitrust approvals on their $69 billion deal, Express Chief Executive Officer Tim Wentworth said on Wednesday. Wentworth, the morning after the company reported higher fourth-quarter profit, was speaking to Wall Street analysts about its interest in expanding managing the pharmacy benefits provided under the Medicare program for older or disabled people. “If a meaningful book of business is coming to the market, we would take a look,” Wentworth said. Wall Street analysts have speculated CVS and Aetna will need to sell some plans to please antitrust regulators. Neither company was immediately available for comment.
