    "text": "Income Before Taxes on Income up 24.5 percent Net Sales Increase 5.6 percent 21 st Consecutive Quarter with Sales Increase\nSEMINOLE, Fla., Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Superior Uniform Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGC), today announced its fourth quarter and year-end operating results for 2017.\nThe Company announced that for the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales increased 5.6 percent to $266.8 million, compared to 2016 net sales of $252.6 million. Income before taxes on income increased 24.5 percent to $24.8 million compared to $19.9 million in 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15.0 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to $14.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for 2017 was reduced by approximately $4.0 million, or approximately $0.26 per diluted share, as a result of increases in our fourth quarter tax provision associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.25 in 2017 as compared to $0.98 in 2016.\nNet sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 12.0 percent to $72.4 million, compared to 2016 fourth quarter net sales of $64.7 million. This represents our 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales increases. Income before taxes on income increased 16.5 percent to $6.8 million compared to $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.4 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, reported for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. As noted above, fourth quarter 2017 net income was reduced by $4.0 million, or approximately $0.26 per diluted share, associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nMichael Benstock, chief executive officer, commented, “We are pleased to report we had a strong finish to fiscal 2017, with the fourth quarter marking our 21st consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year revenue. Our net sales growth for the year was highlighted by over 15 percent organic growth in our Promotional Products segment and The Office Gurus, our Remote Staffing Segment, had record growth as well with net sales to outside customers increasing over 33.7 percent in fiscal 2017. Our Uniform segment was mixed, primarily as a result of the loss of a significant customer as we have discussed throughout 2017.\n“Overall, we achieved very strong growth in operating income with earnings before taxes increasing 24.5 percent in 2017 with a tremendous boost from our sourcing strategies and the further streamlining of our operations. Note that 2017 results include a gain on the disposal of our former call center building in El Salvador of $1.0 million. Exclusive of this gain and exclusive of acquisition expenses in both 2017 and 2016, our operating margins improved to 9.3 percent as compared to 8.6 percent in 2016. Additionally, in the latter part of 2017, we kicked off strategic initiatives to integrate Superior ID and HPI, leveraging the strengths of each group to create a stronger, more efficient organization.\n“In addition to the strong organic growth in 2017, our Promotional Products segment completed two acquisitions in the latter part of 2017 and continues to further strengthen our platform for future growth in this market segment. We are well positioned to complete additional strategic acquisitions in this area and are working through a significant pipeline of potential acquisition candidates.\n“While the Tax Cuts and jobs Act passage in the fourth quarter resulted in a significant increase in our tax provision in 2017, the reduced tax rates will benefit our earnings in the future. Our balance sheet remains strong and leaves us well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead.”\nCONFERENCE CALL\nSuperior Uniform Group will hold a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s results.
