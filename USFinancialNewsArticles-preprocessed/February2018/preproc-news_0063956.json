    "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (NYSE: FUN), a leader in amusement parks, waters parks and immersive entertainment, today announced the declaration of a regular quarterly cash distribution of $0.89 per limited partner (LP) unit. This quarterly distribution rate is consistent with the Company's annualized distribution rate of $3.56 per LP unit announced in November of last year.\nThe distribution, which is payable March 19, 2018 to unitholders of record as of March 9, 2018, represents the Company's 32 nd consecutive year of paying a cash distribution to its unitholders.\nCedar Fair recently reported record revenues, including record attendance and average in-park guest per capita spending, for 2017 and provided a positive outlook for 2018. Commenting on these recent results, Richard Zimmerman, Cedar Fair's president and chief executive officer, said, \"Our record fourth-quarter results and strong early-season sales trends give us great confidence in the strength of our business model and the consumer demand for our offerings. And, even more importantly, the investments we are making in new attractions and accommodations are going to continue to strengthen our model and drive growth well into the future.\"\n\"Cedar Fair has a long history of investing in our business and delivering returns to our investors,\" continued Zimmerman. \"We firmly believe we are well positioned to produce record results again in 2018 and maintain our average 4% Adjusted EBITDA growth trajectory well into the future, similar to the growth we have achieved over the past six years. In doing so, we remain committed to a steady 4% increase in our annual distribution rate going forward, making FUN an attractive investment for many years to come.\"\nAbout Cedar Fair\nCedar Fair Entertainment Company (NYSE: FUN), one of the largest regional amusement-resort operators in the world, is a publicly traded partnership headquartered in Sandusky, Ohio. Focused on its mission to become \"THE place to be for FUN,\" the Company owns and operates 11 amusement parks, including its flagship park, Cedar Point, along with two outdoor water parks, one indoor water park and four hotels.
