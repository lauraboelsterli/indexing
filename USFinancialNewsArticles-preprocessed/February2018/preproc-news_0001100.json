The increase was partially offset by lower revenues from products losing patent exclusivity, and the continuing decline in ACZONE ® and NAMENDA XR ® . For the full year 2017, Allergan reported total net revenues of $15.94 billion, a 9.4 percent increase versus the prior year, driven by continued strong growth across key therapeutic areas and key products, and the addition of Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting ® .\n\"2017 was a pivotal year for Allergan and we delivered solid results. We powered strong revenue growth of our top products and in each of our regions. We acquired, integrated and grew two new businesses and continued to advance our R&D pipeline. Allergan also continued to execute our capital deployment plan by completing a $15 billion share repurchase program, instituting a dividend and paying down debt in 2017,\" said Brent Saunders, Chairman and CEO of Allergan. \"I believe that Allergan has a strong future and I am especially proud of our Allergan colleagues who continue to be Bold for Life by delivering treatments that make a difference for patients around the world.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Performance\nGAAP operating loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2017 was $90.5 million, including the impact of amortization, in-process research and development (R&D) impairments and charges associated with the December 2017 restructuring program announced on January 3, 2018 (herein referred to as the \"December 2017 restructuring program\"). Non-GAAP adjusted operating income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.17 billion, an increase of 16.4 percent versus the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to approximately $2.05 billion.\nFull-Year 2017 Performance\nGAAP operating loss from continuing operations for the full year 2017 was $5.92 billion, compared with $1.83 billion in 2016 primarily due to impairment charges recognized in the third quarter of 2017 of $3.2 billion related to RESTASIS ® and $646.0 million related to ACZONE ® . Non-GAAP adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the full year 2017 was $7.65 billion, an increase of 5.6 percent versus prior year. GAAP Cash flow from operations for the full year of 2017 increased to approximately $5.87 billion, compared to $1.45 billion in 2016, which was negatively impacted by cash taxes paid in connection with the gain recognized on the businesses sold to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd (\"Teva\").\nOperating Expenses\nTotal GAAP Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense was $1.27 billion for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $1.28 billion in the prior year quarter. Included within GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were charges related to the December 2017 restructuring program of $80.0 million. Total non-GAAP SG&A expense increased to $1.13 billion for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $1.07 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to costs associated with the addition of the Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting ® businesses. GAAP R&D investment for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $408.2 million, compared to $913.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the fourth quarter 2017 was $405.7 million, a decrease of 4.7 percent over the prior year quarter, due to reprioritization of on R&D programs and tight expense management.\nAsset Sales & Impairments, Net and In-Process R&D Impairments\nThe Company recorded impairment charges of $238.5 million and $456.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company excludes asset sales and impairments, net and in-process research and development impairments from its Non-GAAP performance net income attributable to shareholders as well as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income.\nAmortization, Other Income (Expense) Net, Tax and Capitalization\nAmortization expense from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2017 was $1.92 billion, compared to $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company's GAAP continuing operations tax rate benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, was primarily attributable to discrete income tax benefits recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). The Company's non-GAAP adjusted continuing operations tax rate was 11.4 percent in the fourth quarter 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Allergan had cash and marketable securities of $6.45 billion and outstanding indebtedness of $30.1 billion.\nProvisional Estimates of the Impact of U.S. Tax Reform\nAllergan recorded a net provisional benefit of approximately $2.8 billion related to the TCJA. This amount includes a $730 million provisional expense representing the U.S. tax payable on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries offset by a $3.5 billion net reduction of U.S. deferred tax liabilities due to the lower enacted U.S. tax rate and the change in assertion regarding permanently reinvested earnings as a result of the transition to a territorial tax system. These provisional estimates are based on the Company's initial analysis and current interpretation of the legislation. Given the complexity of the TCJA, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, these estimates may be adjusted during 2018.\nDiscontinued Operations and Continuing Operations\nAs a result of the divestiture of the Company's generics business and the divestiture of the Company's Anda Distribution business in 2016, the financial results of those businesses have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements up through the date of the divestitures.\nIncluded within (loss) from discontinued operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was a charge to settle certain Teva related matters, net of tax of $387.4 million.\nIncluded in segment revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 are product sales that were sold by the Anda Distribution business once the Anda Distribution business had sold the product to a third-party customer. These sales are included in segment results and are excluded from total continuing operations revenues through a reduction to Corporate revenues. Cost of sales for these products in discontinued operations is equal to our average third-party cost of sales for third-party branded products distributed by Anda Distribution.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Business Segment Results\nU.S. Specialized Therapeutics\nSegment Information\n(Unaudited; $ in millions)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nEye Care\n$\n671.7\n$\n660.1\nTotal Medical Aesthetics\n712.9\n440.3\nFacial Aesthetics\n380.0\n333.0\nPlastic Surgery\n69.0\n57.3\nRegenerative Medicine\n128.9\n-\nBody Contouring\n94.4\n-\nSkin Care\n40.6\n50.0\nMedical Dermatology\n85.5\n114.3\nNeuroscience & Urology\n395.4\n342.5\nOther Revenues\n16.3\n13.7\nNet revenues\n$\n1,881.8\n$\n1,570.9\nOperating expenses:\nCost of sales (1)\n146.0\n75.9\nSelling and marketing\n328.8\n292.2\nGeneral and administrative\n58.8\n47.8\nSegment contribution\n$\n1,348.2\n$\n1,155.0\nSegment margin\n71.6\n%\n73.5\n%\nSegment gross margin (2)\n92.2\n%\n95.2\n%\n(1) Excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles including product rights as well as indirect cost of sales not attributable to segment results.\n(2) Defined as net revenues less segment related cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues.\nU.S. Specialized Therapeutics net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.9 billion, an increase of 19.8 percent versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the addition of the Regenerative Medicine and CoolSculpting ® businesses, as well as growth in BOTOX ® and JUVÉDERM ® Collection, offset by decreased revenues in Medical Dermatology.\nEye Care\nRESTASIS ® net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $400.3 million, an increase of 1.8 percent versus the prior year quarter.

Key development highlights included:\nU.S. and International Branded Product Approvals\nAllergan received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of VRAYLAR™ (cariprazine) for the maintenance treatment of adults with schizophrenia. VRAYLAR™ is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Allergan received FDA approval for AVYCAZ ® (ceftazidime and avibactam) for the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP). This marks the third approved indication for AVYCAZ ® , in addition to complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections. Allergan's CoolSculpting ® treatment received clearance from the FDA for the improved appearance of lax tissue in conjunction with submental fat, or double chin, treatments. CoolSculpting ® is also FDA-cleared in the U.S. for the treatment of visible fat bulges in the submental area, thigh, abdomen and flank, along with bra fat, back fat, underneath the buttocks and upper arm. Allergan received an Imported Drugs License (IDL) from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) to market Ozurdex® (dexamethasone intravitreal implant 0.7 mg) for the treatment of adult patients with macular edema following either Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). Allergan received approval from the FDA for BOTOX ® Cosmetic for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe forehead lines associated with frontalis muscle activity in adults. This marks the third approved indication for BOTOX ® Cosmetic, in addition to crow's feet and glabellar lines.\nRegulatory Milestones & Clinical Updates\nAllergan announced that the FDA has accepted a New Drug Application (NDA) for Seysara™ (sarecycline) for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. Allergan announced that VISTABEL ® (botulinum toxin type A) received a Positive Opinion from the Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM) for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe forehead lines in adults when the severity of the facial lines has an important psychological impact. This is an important step toward VISTABEL ® securing national licenses in the 28 countries of the European Union as well as Norway and Iceland.

We believe that Non-GAAP performance net income per share enhances the comparability of our results between periods and provides additional information and transparency to investors on adjustments and other items that are not indicative of the Company's current and future operating performance. These are the financial measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day to day operating decisions. We define non-GAAP adjustments to the reported GAAP measures as GAAP results adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (iii) acquisition, divestiture, integration and licensing charges, (iv) accretion and fair market value adjustments on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. Non-GAAP performance net income per share is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reported GAAP continuing operations loss per share. The Company has consistently excluded amortization of all intangible assets, including the product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue. The Company's total accumulated amortization, including impairments of currently marketed products, related to our intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $25.8 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively, and is expected to continue to be a material non-GAAP adjustment.
