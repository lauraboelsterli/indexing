    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - LafargeHolcim ( LHN.S ) has bought Kendall Group, an aggregates and ready mix concrete maker in southern Britain, in the first acquisition by the Swiss companyâ€™s Chief Executive Jan Jenisch since he took charge last September.\nLafargeHolcim did not disclose how much it was paying for Kendall, a Portsmouth-based family business, which had sales of around 33 million Swiss francs ($35.26 million) in 2017.\nThe region where Kendall is active is expected to benefit from above national average growth, especially in the housing segment, LafargeHolcim said on Friday.\nReporting by John Revill\n ",
