    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Pacific Coast Banking School (PCBS), the largest national graduate school of banking in the country, announced Gretchen Claflin as its new CEO. She is the first woman CEO of any banking school across the country. Claflin has served as COO of PCBS since 2013 and as president since 2016. The board of directors voted unanimously to name Claflin CEO effective April 6, 2018.\n\"I am honored to be named the next CEO of Pacific Coast Banking School,\" Claflin said. \"I am committed to our legacy of excellence and continuous improvement. Our students are the best and brightest in the industry and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to continue working alongside them and our game-changing experts and teachers.\"\nClaflin began her career working as a CPA for Ernst and Young. As an auditor, she gained experience working with banks, particularly in the special credits area. \"Gretchen's familiarity with the operations of the school, her demonstrated leadership capabilities, her grasp of current technologies, and her financial background made her the preferred candidate,\" Chairman David Bobbitt said. \"Her innovation and energy will drive new initiatives that will benefit not only PCBS students and alumni, but also future generations of leaders in the banking and financial services industry.\"\nClaflin will replace Dave Enger, who became president and CEO of PCBS in 2001.
