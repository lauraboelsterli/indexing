The first table below reconciles the Company’s “net income to common stockholders” for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to “Core Earnings” for the same period. Core Earnings represents “net income to common stockholders” (which is the nearest comparable GAAP measure), adjusted for the items shown in the table below. The second table below reconciles the Company’s total interest and other income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (which is the nearest comparable GAAP measure) to the total interest income and average asset yield, including TBA dollar roll income, and shows the annualized amounts as a percentage of the Company’s average earning assets and also reconciles the Company’s total interest expense (which is the nearest comparable GAAP measure) to the effective total interest expense and effective cost of funds and shows the annualized amounts as a percentage of the Company’s average borrowings.\nThe Company’s management believes that:\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide investors with greater transparency to the information that the Company uses in its financial and operational decision-making process; the inclusion of paydown expense on Agency MBS is more indicative of the current earnings potential of the Company’s investment portfolio, as it reflects the actual principal paydowns which occurred during the period. Paydown expense on Agency MBS is not dependent on future assumptions on prepayments or the cumulative effect from prior periods of any current changes to those assumptions, as is the case with the GAAP measure, “Premium amortization on Agency MBS”; the adjustment for an impairment charge on Non-Agency MBS is more reflective of current Core Earnings, as this charge represents future loss expectations; the adjustment for depreciation expense on residential rental properties, as this is a non-cash item and is added back by other companies to derive funds from operations; and the presentation of these measures, when analyzed in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP operating results, allows investors to more effectively evaluate the Company’s performance to that of its peers, particularly those that have discontinued hedge accounting and those that have used similar portfolio and derivative strategies.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for the Company’s operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCore Earnings\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Amount Per Share (in thousands) (unaudited) Net income to common stockholders $ 13,926 $ 0.14 Adjustments to derive core earnings: Unrealized loss on Agency MBS held as trading investments 7,279 0.07 Gain on derivatives - interest rate swaps, net (12,267 ) (0.13 ) Loss on derivatives-TBA Agency MBS, net 2,146 0.02 Amortization of other comprehensive income on de-designated swaps (1) (291 ) — Periodic net settlement on interest rate Swaps after de-designation (2) (1,150 ) (0.01 ) Dollar roll income on TBA Agency MBS (3) 2,616 0.03 Premium amortization on Agency MBS 7,968 0.08 Paydown expense (4) (6,377 ) (0.06 ) Depreciation expense on residential rental properties (5) 117 — Core earnings $ 13,967 $ 0.14 Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 98,074\n(1) This amount represents the amortization of the balance remaining in “accumulated other comprehensive income” as a result of the Company’s discontinuation of hedge accounting in August 2014 and is recorded in its statements of operations as a portion of interest expense in accordance with GAAP. (2) Periodic net settlements on interest rate swaps after de-designation include all subsequent net payments made on interest rate swaps which were de-designated as hedges in August 2014 and are recorded in “Gain on interest rate swaps, net.” (3) Dollar roll income on TBA Agency MBS is the income resulting from the price discount typically obtained by extending the settlement of TBA Agency MBS to a later date. This is a component of the “Gain (loss) on derivatives, net” that is included in the Company’s statements of operations. (4) Paydown expense on Agency MBS represents the proportional expense of Agency MBS purchase premiums relative to the Agency MBS principal payments and prepayments which occurred during the quarter. (5) Depreciation expense is added back in the core earnings calculation, as it is a non-cash item, and it is similarly added back in other companies’ calculation of core earnings or funds from operations.\nEffective Net Interest Rate Spread\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Amount\nAnnualized Percentage\n(in thousands) (unaudited) Average Asset Yield, Including TBA Dollar Roll Income: Total interest income $ 40,035 2.83 % Income-rental properties 413 0.03 Dollar roll income on TBA Agency MBS (1) 2,616 0.19 Premium amortization on Agency MBS 7,968 0.56 Paydown expense on Agency MBS (2) (6,377 ) (0.45 ) Total interest and other income and average asset yield, including TBA dollar roll income $ 44,655 3.16 % Effective Cost of Funds: Total interest expense $ 23,650 1.86 % Periodic net settlement on interest rate Swaps after de-designation (3) 1,150 0.09 Amortization of other comprehensive income on de-designated Swaps (4) (291 ) (0.03 ) Effective total interest expense and effective cost of funds $ 24,509 0.02 % Effective net interest rate spread 1.24 % Average earning assets $ 5,657,184 Average borrowings $ 5,098,816",
