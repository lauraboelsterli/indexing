    "text": "ESTERO, Fla., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: HTZ) (\"Hertz Global\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nWorldwide revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter Net income in the fourth quarter was $616 million, including a one-time benefit of $679 million related to U.S. tax reform Adjusted Corporate EBITDA increased to $21 million from $12 million in the prior-year quarter The Company's U.S. operational improvement initiatives drove year-over-year progress in the second half of the year compared with the first half of 2017 as reflected in increased revenue expansion, improved fleet utilization and reduced vehicle depreciation expense.\n\"The Company's top priority in 2017 was to design and launch an operational improvement plan that would drive sustainable, profitable revenue growth,\" said Kathryn V. Marinello, president and chief executive officer of Hertz. \"In the first half of the year, we right-sized our fleet and began upgrading vehicle quality, redesigned operating processes, including our Ultimate Choice offering, and deployed smart systems for revenue management. In the second half, our performance reflected positive momentum against these initiatives.\n\"In 2018, we expect to see continued progress from our U.S. improvement programs. However, we also will have elevated investments throughout the year as we implement several, major technology conversions. By 2019, we should begin to evolve toward a more competitive earnings profile.\"\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, total revenues were $2.1 billion, a 4% increase versus the fourth quarter 2016. Loss before income taxes for the fourth quarter 2017 was $179 million versus a loss of $466 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2017 net income was $616 million, or $7.42 per diluted share, which included a one-time benefit of $679 million related to U.S. tax reform, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $438 million during the fourth quarter 2016, or $5.28 per diluted share. The Company reported adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 of $64 million, or $0.77 adjusted diluted loss per share, compared with adjusted net loss of $59 million, or $0.71 adjusted diluted loss per share, for the same period last year. Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 was $21 million, compared to $12 million in the same period last year.\nFor the full-year 2017, Hertz Global reported net income of $327 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, including the one-time benefit related to U.S. tax reform, compared with net loss from continuing operations of $474 million, or $5.65 per diluted share, for 2016.

Transaction days increased by 3% year-over-year as a result of increased rentals to commercial customers, including corporate, insurance replacement and ride-hailing drivers. Pricing, as measured by Total Revenue Per Day (Total RPD), decreased 1% in the quarter. Excluding ancillary revenue and the growth in ride-hailing rentals, pricing increased 3% over the 2016 fourth quarter.\nThe 3% increase in transaction days combined with 1% reduction in U.S. fleet capacity resulted in a 250-basis point increase in utilization in the quarter. Revenue per unit, an important measure of asset efficiency, increased 2% over the prior year.\nThe revenue improvement along with a 6% decrease in monthly depreciation per unit supported a year-over-year increase in Adjusted Corporate EBITDA in the fourth quarter, despite higher expenses associated with the Company's operating turnaround initiatives and increased vehicle interest expense due to rising interest rates.\nINTERNATIONAL RENTAL CAR (\"INTERNATIONAL RAC\") SUMMARY\nInternational RAC (1)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercent\n($ in millions, except where noted)\n2017\n2016\nInc/(Dec)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n487\n$\n441\n10\n%\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net\n$\n105\n$\n89\n18\n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n(4)\n$\n(181)\n(98)\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)\n$\n4\n$\n15\n(73)\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax margin\n1\n%\n3\n%\n(260)\nbps\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA\n$\n11\n$\n23\n(52)\n%\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA margin\n2\n%\n5\n%\n(300)\nbps\nAverage vehicles\n163,100\n163,100\n—\n%\nTransaction days (in thousands)\n10,935\n10,880\n1\n%\nTotal RPD (in whole dollars)\n$\n40.42\n$\n39.15\n3\n%\nTotal RPU (in whole dollars)\n$\n903\n$\n871\n4\n%\nNet depreciation per unit per month (in whole dollars)\n$\n194\n$\n178\n9\n%\nThe Company's International RAC segment revenues increased 10% from the fourth quarter 2016, or 4% excluding currency adjustments, driven by a 3% increase in Total RPD and a 1% increase in transaction days. Excluding the sale of the Company's Brazil rental car and leasing operations to Localiza in August 2017, transaction days increased 6%.\nThe 1% increase in transaction days combined with flat fleet capacity resulted in a 40-basis point increase in utilization in the quarter. Revenue per unit, an important measure of asset efficiency, increased 4% over the prior year.\nFourth quarter 2017 Adjusted Corporate EBITDA for International RAC decreased compared with a year ago in part due to the divestiture of the Brazil fleet, declining residual values on diesel vehicles in Europe and elevated fleet-related expenses.\nALL OTHER OPERATIONS\nAll Other Operations (1)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercent\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2016\nInc/(Dec)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n167\n$\n151\n11\n%\nDepreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net\n$\n123\n$\n117\n5\n%\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n16\n$\n16\n—\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss)\n$\n21\n$\n19\n11\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax margin\n13\n%\n13\n%\n—\nbps\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA\n$\n20\n$\n18\n11\n%\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA margin\n12\n%\n12\n%\n10\nbps\nAverage vehicles - Donlen\n197,800\n197,000\n—\n%\nAll Other Operations is primarily comprised of the Company's Donlen leasing operations.\n(1)\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted pre-tax margin, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA margin, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP measures. Average vehicles, transaction days, Total RPD, Total RPU and net depreciation per unit per month are key metrics. See the accompanying Supplemental Schedules and Definitions for the reconciliations and definitions for each of these non-GAAP measures and key metrics and the reason the Company's management believes that this information is useful to investors.\nSTRATEGIC INVESTMENTS – 2018 expenses will continue to be elevated as the Company remains committed to its U.S. operating turnaround initiatives. The elevated expense level will be targeted toward new marketing campaigns, ongoing field process improvements, an upgraded model-year 2018 fleet and the deployment of several redesigned technology platforms. The benefits from its U.S. turnaround program are expected to accelerate in 2019.\nBALANCE SHEET – The Company had more than $1.6 billion of corporate liquidity at December 31, 2017. It has no material corporate debt maturities due until October 2020. In January 2018, it executed a $1 billion five-year term ABS transaction for U.S. rental car with proceeds used to refinance its 2018 vehicle debt maturities.\nTAX REFORM – The enactment of U.S. tax reform resulted in the Company recording an estimated net benefit of $679 million, resulting from the remeasured valuation of its net deferred tax liabilities. It does not anticipate a liability from the one-time charge on accumulated foreign earnings. Due to the lower corporate tax rate in 2018, the Company's effective tax rate now is estimated to be between 23% and 26% on results in future years.\nRESULTS OF THE HERTZ CORPORATION\nThe GAAP and Non-GAAP profitability metrics for Hertz Global's operating subsidiary, The Hertz Corporation (\"Hertz\"), are materially the same as those for Hertz Global.\nEARNINGS WEBCAST INFORMATION\nHertz Global's fourth quarter 2017 live webcast discussion will be held on February 28, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.

(for periods on or prior to June 30, 2016, \"Old Hertz Holdings\" and for periods after June 30, 2016, \"Herc Holdings\") completed the previously announced separation of its existing vehicle rental and equipment rental businesses into two independent, publicly traded companies (the \"Spin-Off\"). The separation was structured as a reverse spin-off under which the vehicle rental business was contributed to the Company, the stock of which was then distributed as a dividend to stockholders of Old Hertz Holdings. While the Company was the legal spinnee in the separation, the Company is the accounting successor to the pre-spin-off business. As a result, the former equipment rental business and certain former parent entities of Old Hertz Holdings are presented as discontinued operations in the Company's financial information. Unless noted otherwise, information presented in the following tables and supplemental schedules pertain to Hertz Global's continuing operations.\nSELECTED UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT

Donlen leasing operations, and Corporate.\n(a) Based on December 31, 2016 foreign exchange rates.\n(b) Calculated as transaction days divided by available car days.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES AND KEY METRICS - DEFINITIONS AND USE\nHertz Global is the top-level holding company and The Hertz Corporation is Hertz Global's primary operating company (together, the \"Company\"). The term \"GAAP\" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nDefinitions of non-GAAP measures and key metrics are set forth below. Also set forth below is a summary of the reasons why management of the Company believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in the earnings release provide useful information regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations and additional purposes for which management of the Company utilizes the non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nAdjusted Pre-Tax Income (Loss) and Adjusted Pre-tax Margin\nAdjusted pre-tax income (loss) is calculated as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes plus non-cash acquisition accounting charges, debt-related charges relating to the amortization and write-off of debt financing costs and debt discounts, goodwill, intangible and tangible asset impairments and write-downs, information technology and finance transformation costs and certain other miscellaneous, non-recurring, or non-cash items. Adjusted pre-tax income (loss) is important to management because it allows management to assess operational performance of the Company's business, exclusive of the items mentioned above. It also allows management to assess the performance of the entire business on the same basis as the segment measure of profitability. Management believes it is important to investors for the same reasons it is important to management and because it allows them to assess the operational performance of the Company on the same basis that management uses internally. When evaluating the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider adjusted pre-tax income (loss) in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of the Company's financial performance, such as net income (loss) from continuing operations or income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes. Adjusted pre-tax margin is adjusted pre-tax income (loss) divided by total revenues.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\nAdjusted net income (loss) is calculated as adjusted pre-tax income (loss) less a provision for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory rate of 37%. The combined statutory rate is management's estimate of the Company's long-term tax rate. Adjusted net income (loss) is important to management and investors because it represents the Company's operational performance exclusive of the effects of purchase accounting, debt-related charges, and certain other miscellaneous, non-recurring, or non-cash items that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of the Company's competitors.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\")\nAdjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted diluted EPS is important to management and investors because it represents a measure of the Company's operational performance exclusive of the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, debt-related charges, and certain other miscellaneous, non-recurring, or non-cash items that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of the Company's competitors.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, including the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents related to vehicles, net revenue earning vehicle and capital asset expenditures and the net impact of vehicle financing activities. Adjusted free cash flow is important to management and investors as it provides useful information about the amount of cash available for acquisitions and the reduction of non-vehicle debt. When evaluating the Company's liquidity, investors should not consider Adjusted free cash flow in isolation of, or as a substitute for, a measure of the Company's liquidity as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net cash provided by operating activities.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"Gross EBITDA\"), Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin\nGross EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation (which includes lease charges on revenue earning vehicles) and amortization. Corporate EBITDA, as presented herein, represents Gross EBITDA as adjusted for vehicle debt interest, vehicle depreciation and vehicle debt-related charges. Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, as presented herein, represents Corporate EBITDA as adjusted for certain other miscellaneous, non-recurring, or non-cash items, as described in more detail in the accompanying schedules.\nManagement uses Gross EBITDA, Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA as operating performance metrics for internal monitoring and planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company's annual operating budget and monthly operating reviews, as well as to facilitate analysis of investment decisions, profitability and performance trends. Further, Gross EBITDA enables management and investors to isolate the effects on profitability of operating metrics such as revenue, direct vehicle and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, which enables management and investors to evaluate the Company's business segments that are financed differently and have different depreciation characteristics and compare the Company's performance against companies with different capital structures and depreciation policies. We also present Adjusted Corporate EBITDA as a supplemental measure because such information is utilized in the determination of certain executive compensation.\nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin is calculated as the ratio of Adjusted Corporate EBITDA to total revenues and is used by the Compensation Committee to determine certain executive compensation, primarily in the form of PSUs.\nGross EBITDA, Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA Margin are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. When evaluating the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider Gross EBITDA, Corporate EBITDA and Adjusted Corporate EBITDA in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of the Company's financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss) from continuing operations or income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nFleet Growth\nU.S. and International Rental Car segments fleet growth is defined as revenue earning vehicles expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals, plus vehicle depreciation and net vehicle financing which includes borrowings, repayments and the change in restricted cash associated with vehicles. Fleet growth is important as it allows the Company to assess the cash flow required to support its investment in revenue earning vehicles.\nNet Non-Vehicle Debt\nNet non-vehicle debt is calculated as non-vehicle debt as reported on the Company's balance sheet, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs associated with non-vehicle debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Non-vehicle debt consists of the Company's Senior Term Loan, Senior RCF, Senior Notes, Senior Second Priority Secured Notes, Promissory Notes and certain other non-vehicle indebtedness of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Net non-vehicle debt is important to management and investors as it helps measure the Company's corporate leverage. Net non-vehicle debt also assists in the evaluation of the Company's ability to service its non-vehicle debt without reference to the expense associated with the vehicle debt, which is collateralized by assets not available to lenders under the non-vehicle debt facilities.\nNet Vehicle Debt\nNet vehicle debt is calculated as vehicle debt as reported on the Company's balance sheet, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs associated with vehicle debt, less restricted cash associated with vehicles. Restricted cash associated with vehicle debt is restricted for the purchase of revenue earning vehicles and other specified uses under the Company's vehicle debt facilities and its vehicle rental like-kind exchange program. Net vehicle debt is important to management, investors and ratings agencies as it helps measure the Company's leverage with respect to its vehicle assets.\nTotal Net Debt\nTotal net debt is calculated as total debt, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issue costs, less total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash associated with vehicle debt. Unamortized debt issue costs are required to be reported as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt obligation under GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects that these costs have on debt will more accurately reflect the Company's net debt position. Total net debt is important to management, investors and ratings agencies as it helps measure the Company's gross leverage.\nKEY METRICS\nAvailable Car Days\nAvailable car days is calculated as average vehicles multiplied by the number of days in a period.\nAverage Vehicles\nAverage Vehicles, also known as \"fleet capacity\", is determined using a simple average of the number of vehicles in our fleet whether owned or leased by the Company at the beginning and end of a given period. Among other things, average vehicles is used to calculate Vehicle Utilization which represents the portion of the Company's vehicles that are being utilized to generate revenue.\nNet Depreciation Per Unit Per Month\nNet depreciation per unit per month represents the amount of average depreciation expense and lease charges, net per vehicle per month and is calculated as depreciation of revenue earning vehicles and lease charges, net, with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, divided by the average vehicles in each period and then dividing by the number of months in the period reported. Management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends. This metric is important to management and investors as it is reflective of how the Company is managing the costs of its vehicles and facilitates in comparison with other participants in the vehicle rental industry.\nTotal Rental Revenue\nTotal rental revenue is calculated as total revenue less ancillary retail vehicle sales revenue, with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends.\nTotal Revenue Per Transaction Day (\"Total RPD,\" also referred to as \"pricing\")\nTotal RPD is calculated as total rental revenue divided by the total number of transaction days. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents a measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the vehicle rental business and encompasses the elements in vehicle rental pricing that management has the ability to control.\nTotal Revenue Per Unit Per Month (\"Total RPU\")\nTotal RPU is calculated as total rental revenue divided by the average vehicles in each period and then dividing by the number of months in the period reported. This metric is important to management and investors as it provides a measure of revenue productivity relative to fleet capacity.\nTransaction Da ys (also referred to as \"volume\")\nTransaction days, also known as volume, represent the total number of 24-hour periods, with any partial period counted as one transaction day, that vehicles were on rent (the period between when a rental contract is opened and closed) in a given period. Thus, it is possible for a vehicle to attain more than one transaction day in a 24-hour period. This metric is important to management and investors as it represents the number of revenue generating days.\nVehicle Utilization\nVehicle utilization is calculated by dividing total transaction days by available car days. This metric is important to management and investors as it is the measurement of the proportion of our vehicles that are being used to generate revenues relative to fleet capacity.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hertz-global-holdings-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-and-full-year-financial-results-300605323.html\nSOURCE Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.",
