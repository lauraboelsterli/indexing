    "text": "ERIE, Pa., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Erie Downtown Development Corporation has named John Persinger as its CEO. The EDDC is comprised of business and community leaders and was formed in 2017 to bring the Erie Refocused Plan's emphasis on downtown real estate development to life.\n\"The EDDC initiated a search for a CEO in summer 2017. We vetted several candidates from across the country and ultimately found that the skills and talents needed for this role are exemplified in John,\" said EDDC Board of Directors president and Erie Insurance president & CEO Tim NeCastro. \"I'm confident that he and the team he builds will be an asset to the EDDC and the future of our city.\"\nPersinger previously worked at MacDonald, Illig, Jones & Britton Law Firm where he focused on business and commercial transactions, including contracts, sale and purchase agreements, and licensing agreements. He also provided legal assistance and guidance on local government and municipal law matters, and counsel to local, national, and international clients on a variety of corporate governance and regulatory matters, such as labor and employment, anti-corruption, and export issues.\nPrior to obtaining his juris doctorate, Persinger served in a number of positions including at the U.S. Department of State as attaché to the U.S. Ambassador to Australia. In that role he advised the ambassador on embassy and consulate issues around American and Australian domestic and foreign affairs. He also served as White House executive assistant to the deputy counsel, where he assisted in the nomination and confirmation processes of U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito.\nPersinger holds a bachelor's degree in History from Harvard University and earned his Juris Doctorate from the University of Notre Dame.\n\"My family has had a long history in Erie and I am looking forward to being part of changing the narrative in the city that has meant so much to me,\" says Persinger. \"Erie is at a critical crossroads, I believe in the EDDC's mission to fuel economic growth through real estate development and I am eager to begin.\"\nThe appointment is effective March 12, 2018.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/persinger-named-ceo-of-erie-downtown-development-corporation-300605322.html\nSOURCE Erie Downtown Development Corporation; Erie Insurance",
