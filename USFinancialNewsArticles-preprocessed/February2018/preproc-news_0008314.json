    "text": "MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Spain’s Banco Sabadell said on Friday its fourth-quarter net profit more than doubled from a year earlier due to one-off sales, though lending income remained under pressure because of ultra-low interest rates.\nNet profit came in at 147.7 million euros ($184.5 million), slightly below analysts’ forecasts of 150 million euros in a Reuters poll.\nSabadell booked profits of 50 million euros related to the sale of HI Partners.\nIts full-year net profit of 801.5 million euros was in line with its revised net profit target of 800 million euros but below forecasts of 804 millions.\nLike its domestic competitors, the bank is struggling to lift earnings from loans as interest rates hover at historic lows and increasing competition erodes margins.\nSabadell, Spain’s fifth largest bank, said its net interest income, or profit from loans minus funding costs, fell 2.35 percent in the fourth quarter to 924.6 million euros, below forecasts of 932 million euros, and was 1.7 percent lower than the previous quarter.\nSabadell was one of the two banks to move registered headquarters out of the northeastern region of Catalonia to seek legal certainty as the region’s leaders pressed ahead with a secession campaign in October.
