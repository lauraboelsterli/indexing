    "text": "Las Vegas, NV , Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nCLS Holdings USA, Inc. (OTCQB: CLSH) “CLS,” a development stage diversified cannabis company operating as Cannabis Life Science, today announced it has made its second payment of $1.8 million to Alternative Solutions, Ltd dba Oasis Cannabis in connection with its planned acquisition of the companies.\nThe Oasis Cannabis (“Oasis”) retail dispensary and conversion and extraction facility generated $750,000 in gross revenues in December, their strongest combined results to-date. The CityTrees wholesale product line has more than doubled its number of product SKUs offered to retail dispensary customers, and now covers a variety of concentrates, vape pens, and capsules, including high CBD versions. The City Trees product line is now being sold in over 20 dispensaries in the Las Vegas and Reno markets.\nThe Company anticipates that it will close on the purchase of the balance of the equity interests in the Oasis Cannabis companies within 90 days, subject to regulatory approvals.\nOasis Cannabis is a fully integrated cannabis operation in Nevada. Las Vegas-based Oasis Cannabis’ ( http://oasiscannabis.com ) operations include a grow, extraction, conversion and processing facility, and a retail dispensary. CLS has now executed a definitive agreement to acquire the Oasis Cannabis companies. A non-refundable cash deposit has been paid by CLS. The closing of the transaction, which is subject to the satisfaction of conditions, is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.\nAbout Oasis Cannabis ( http://oasiscannabis.com )\nOasis Cannabis has operated a cannabis dispensary in the Las Vegas market since dispensaries first opened in Nevada in 2015 and has been recognized as one of the top marijuana retailers in the state. Its location within walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown Las Vegas in combination with its delivery service to residents allows it to efficiently serve both locals and tourists in the Las Vegas area. The company recently commenced wholesale offerings of cannabis in Nevada with the launch of its City Trees brand of cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products in August 2017. An expansion of its cultivation and production facility is currently underway and is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2018.\nDisclaimer\nCLS Holdings USA has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oasis Cannabis, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. See CLS Holdings USA’s filings with the SEC for additional details.\nAbout CLS Holdings USA\nCLS Holdings USA, Inc. (OTCQB: CLSH) plans to become a diversified cannabis company and is shifting its corporate strategy to becoming a fully licensed integrated cannabis producer and retailer in Nevada and other western states. Its strategy and business model will be similar to Canopy Growth (WEED.TO), Aurora Cannabis and GB Sciences.\nCLS stands for \"Cannabis Life Sciences,\" in recognition of the Company's patent pending proprietary method of extracting various cannabinoids from the marijuana plant and converting them into products with a higher level of quality and consistency. The Company's business model includes licensing operations, processing operations, processing facilities, sale of products, brand creation and consulting services.\nTwitter: @CLSHusa\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
