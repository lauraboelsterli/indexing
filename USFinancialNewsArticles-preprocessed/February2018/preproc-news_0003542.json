    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) today reported fourth quarter net earnings of $271 million or 36 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. This compares with net earnings from continuing operations of $62 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1.6 billion for the same period last year.\nExcluding a net after-tax benefit of $37 million from special items, the company reported net earnings of $234 million or 31 cents per diluted share. This compares with net earnings from continuing operations before special items of $106 million for the same period last year and $259 million for third quarter 2017.\nFor the full year 2017, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $582 million, or 77 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $7.2 billion. This compares with net earnings from continuing operations of $415 million on net sales of $6.4 billion for the same period last year.\nFull year 2017 includes net after-tax charges of $290 million from special items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings from continuing operations before special items of $872 million, or $1.15 per diluted share. This compares with net earnings from continuing operations before special items of $534 million for the full year 2016.\n\"2017 was a year of strong financial and operational performance for Weyerhaeuser. We increased Adjusted EBITDA by over 30 percent to $2.1 billion, generated over $1 billion of EBITDA from Wood Products, achieved all targets for operational excellence, merger cost synergies and overhead cost reduction, and raised our dividend,\" said Doyle R. Simons, president and chief executive officer. \"We also further simplified and optimized our portfolio by divesting our Uruguay operations, exiting the Twin Creeks joint venture and selling 100,000 acres of Southern timberland for collective proceeds of over $700 million. Going forward, we expect continued growth in the U.S. housing market and we remain relentlessly focused on improving performance through operational excellence, fully capitalizing on strengthening market conditions, and driving value for shareholders through disciplined capital allocation.\"\nWEYERHAEUSER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n2017\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(millions, except per share data)\nQ3\nQ4\nQ4\nFull Year\nNet sales\n$\n1,872\n$\n1,823\n$\n1,596\n$\n7,196\n$\n6,365\nEarnings from continuing operations\n$\n130\n$\n271\n$\n62\n$\n582\n$\n415\nNet earnings attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders\n$\n130\n$\n271\n$\n551\n$\n582\n$\n1,005\nEarnings per diluted share from continuing operations\n$\n0.17\n$\n0.36\n$\n0.08\n$\n0.77\n$\n0.55\nNet earnings per diluted share\n$\n0.17\n$\n0.36\n$\n0.73\n$\n0.77\n$\n1.39\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted (1)\n757\n758\n753\n757\n722\nNet earnings from continuing operations attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders before special items (2)\n$\n259\n$\n234\n$\n106\n$\n872\n$\n534\nNet earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to Weyerhaeuser common shareholders before special items\n$\n0.34\n$\n0.31\n$\n0.14\n$\n1.15\n$\n0.75\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)\n$\n569\n$\n551\n$\n400\n$\n2,080\n$\n1,583\n(1) During 2016, Weyerhaeuser issued approximately 279 million common shares in connection with the Plum Creek merger, issued 23 million common shares to effect the conversion of its mandatory convertible preference shares, and repurchased approximately 68 million common shares under the company's repurchase authorization program put in place in connection with the Plum Creek merger transaction.\n(2) Fourth quarter 2017 after-tax special items include a $99 million gain on the sale of Southern timberlands, charges of $52 million for tax adjustments including enactment of tax legislation, $31 million for product remediation, $26 million for environmental remediation insurance recoveries, $12 million for Plum Creek merger-related costs, and a $7 million net benefit from an adjustment to accrued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber. Full year 2017 includes $290 million of after-tax special charges, primarily for product remediation and impairment of Uruguay operations. Full year 2016 includes after-tax special charges of $141 million, primarily for Plum Creek merger-related costs. Full year 2016 results also include a $612 million gain on the sale of the company's Cellulose Fiber businesses which is presented as discontinued operations.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the company. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income from continuing operations, adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis in real estate sold, unallocated pension service costs and special items. Adjusted EBITDA excludes results from joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from and is not intended to represent an alternative to our GAAP results. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP earnings is included with this release.\nWeyerhaeuser merged with Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (Plum Creek) on February 19, 2016. The financial statements presented within this release do not include Plum Creek financial results for any period prior to the February 19, 2016 merger date.\nDuring 2016, Weyerhaeuser sold its Cellulose Fibers businesses.

In the South, fee harvest increased due to seasonally higher volumes and favorable weather, and average sales realizations were comparable to the prior quarter.\nFourth quarter includes a $99 million gain on the previously announced sale of 100,000 acres of Southern timberlands.\nThe company redeemed its ownership interest in the Twin Creeks Timber, LLC joint venture in October 2017. Fourth quarter results include no earnings contribution from operation of the joint venture.\n1Q 2018 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser expects first quarter earnings before special items and Adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the West, the company anticipates improved average log sales realizations, partially offset by modestly lower fee harvest volumes. In the South, the company expects seasonally lower fee harvest volumes, comparable realizations, and higher trucking costs.\nREAL ESTATE, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (millions)\n3Q 2017\n4Q 2017\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n82\n$\n100\n$\n18\nContribution to pre-tax earnings\n$\n47\n$\n50\n$\n3\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n74\n$\n87\n$\n13\n4Q 2017 Performance - Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA increased compared with the third quarter due to seasonally higher Real Estate sales.\n1Q 2018 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser anticipates significantly lower earnings and Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower Real Estate sales and royalties from Energy & Natural Resources operations.\nWOOD PRODUCTS\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (millions)\n3Q 2017\n4Q 2017\nChange\nNet sales\n$\n1,299\n$\n1,228\n$\n(71)\nContribution to pre-tax earnings\n$\n40\n$\n180\n$\n140\nPre-tax charge for special items\n$\n201\n$\n41\n$\n(160)\nContribution to pre-tax earnings before special items\n$\n241\n$\n221\n$\n(20)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n278\n$\n258\n$\n(20)\n4Q 2017 Performance - Average sales realizations for all products increased compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes declined due to seasonality and weather-related transportation disruptions. Canadian and Western log costs increased, and raw material costs for oriented strand board and engineered wood products were also higher.\nFourth quarter net pre-tax special charges of $41 million include $50 million for product remediation and a $9 million net benefit primarily from an adjustment to the periods covered and rates associated with the softwood lumber countervailing and antidumping duties.\n1Q 2018 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser anticipates first quarter earnings before special items and Adjusted EBITDA from the Wood Products segment will be comparable to the fourth quarter. The company expects higher sales volumes, improved operating rates, and slightly higher lumber sales realizations, offset by lower average sales realizations for oriented strand board.\nABOUT WEYERHAEUSER\nWeyerhaeuser Company , one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands , began operations in 1900.
