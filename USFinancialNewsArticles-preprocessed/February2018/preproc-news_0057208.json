    "text": "0 COMMENTS Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP 2.47% is in advanced talks to buy Microsemi Corp. MSCC 0.39% , according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be the latest in a wave of deals sweeping the semiconductor industry.\nThe chip makers are nearing a deal that would value Microsemi roughly in the mid-$60s a share, according to one of the people—not much above the company’s current stock price, which ran up on reports of a possible sale.\nA deal could be struck this week, though there is no guarantee there will be one and the two sides still have significant issues to agree on, this person said.\nShould there be a deal, it would be significant: Microsemi currently has a market valuation of more than $7.5 billion. \nOn Monday, the company’s shares closed at $64.24, up 3.1%. The deal would be priced at about $10 a share above where Microsemi traded before it surfaced last month that the company was in play. \nMicrosemi, based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., makes chips for the aerospace, communications, data center and industrials sectors, according to its website. In 2016, the company bought PMC-Sierra Inc. In a sign of the deal frenzy in the industry that continues, PMC-Sierra had been looking to sell itself to Skyworks Solutions Inc. but terminated the deal after Skyworks refused to sweeten its offer. \nChandler, Ariz.-based Microchip has a market value of more than $20 billion. \nThe talks come at a time when the entire semiconductor sector stands to be reshaped. It had record amounts of deal volume in 2015 as companies jockey for position in the burgeoning market for connected cars and other so-called Internet-of-Things devices, rather than personal computers and other technologies that are in decline. \nIn the biggest consolidation move, Broadcom Ltd. is engaged in a hostile pursuit of Qualcomm Inc. that currently values the San Diego chip pioneer at about $117 billion. If a deal were to be signed, it would be the largest technology takeover ever and could cause other players in the industry to seek mergers of their own to better compete. \nWrite to Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com",
