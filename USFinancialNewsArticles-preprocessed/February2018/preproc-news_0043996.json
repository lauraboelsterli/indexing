Our capital markets activity throughout the year was highlighted by the Berkshire Hathaway private placement in June, a $377 million investment representing a 9.8% ownership stake. Additionally, we grew AFFO by 25% for the year and raised our dividend by 7%, providing our shareholders with a well-protected dividend and ownership in a dynamic company that is well-positioned for long-term internal and external growth.”\nFinancial Results\nTotal Revenues\nTotal revenues were $120.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 17.6% from $102.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal revenues for 2017 were $452.8 million, an increase of 20.3% from $376.3 million for 2016. The increase was driven primarily by the growth in the size of STORE Capital’s real estate investment portfolio, which grew from $5.1 billion in gross investment amount representing 1,660 property locations and 360 customers at December 31, 2016 to $6.2 billion in gross investment amount representing 1,921 property locations and 397 customers at December 31, 2017.\nNet Income\nNet income was $41.0 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase from $31.9 million, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes an aggregate net gain on the dispositions of real estate of $3.8 million as compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nNet income includes such items as gain or loss on dispositions of real estate and provisions for impairment. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and impact net income and period-to-period comparisons.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $162.0 million, or $0.90 per basic and diluted share, an increase of 31.4% from $123.3 million, or $0.82 per basic and diluted share, for 2016. Net income for 2017 includes an aggregate $39.6 million net gain on dispositions of real estate as compared to $13.2 million for 2016. Net income for 2017 includes $20.0 million of non-cash charges consisting of a $4.6 million charge to revenue related to the accelerated amortization of lease incentives associated with lease contracts terminated during the third quarter, a $2.0 million charge to interest expense for the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the prepayment of long-term debt in the third quarter and an aggregate $13.4 million of provisions for impairment recognized during the year.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)\nAFFO increased 22.4% to $82.2 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to AFFO of $67.1 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAFFO for 2017 was $306.1 million, or $1.71 per basic and diluted share, an increase of 24.5% from $245.8 million, or $1.65 per basic share and $1.64 per diluted share, for 2016. The increase in AFFO between years was primarily driven by additional rental revenues and interest income generated by the growth in the Company’s real estate investment portfolio.\nDividend Information\nAs previously announced, STORE Capital declared a regular quarterly cash dividend per common share of $0.31 for the fourth quarter of 2017. This dividend, totaling $60.1 million, was paid on January 16, 2018 to stockholders of record on December 29, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company declared regular cash dividends per common share aggregating $1.20 which includes a 6.9% increase in the third quarter.\nReal Estate Portfolio Highlights\nInvestment Activity\nThe Company originated $366.2 million of gross investments representing 110 property locations during the fourth quarter of 2017, adding 15 new customers. These investments had a weighted average initial cap rate of 7.9%. Total investment activity for the year was $1.37 billion representing 316 property locations with an initial weighted average cap rate of 7.8%. The Company defines “initial cap rate” for property acquisitions as the initial annual cash rent divided by the purchase price of the property.\nDisposition Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold 55 properties and recognized an aggregate net gain on the dispositions of real estate of $39.6 million; 15 of these 55 properties were sold in the fourth quarter for an aggregate net gain of $3.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, proceeds from the dispositions of real estate, including loan repayments received in conjunction with certain property sales, aggregated $267.4 million as compared to an aggregate original investment amount of $254.3 million for the properties sold.\nPortfolio\nAt December 31, 2017, STORE Capital’s real estate portfolio totaled $6.2 billion representing 1,921 property locations. Approximately 96% of the portfolio represents commercial real estate properties subject to long-term leases, 4% represents mortgage loans and direct financing receivables primarily on commercial real estate buildings (located on land the Company owns and leases to its customers) and a nominal amount represents loans receivable secured by the tenants’ other assets. As of December 31, 2017, the portfolio’s annualized base rent and interest (based on rates in effect on December 31, 2017 for all lease and loan contracts) totaled $501.0 million as compared to $418.5 million a year ago. The weighted average non-cancelable remaining term of the leases at December 31, 2017 was approximately 14 years.\nThe Company’s portfolio of real estate investments is highly diversified across customers, brand names, or business concepts, industries and geography. The following table presents a summary of the Company’s portfolio.\nPortfolio At A Glance - As of December 31, 2017 Investment property locations 1,921 States 48 Customers 397 Industries in which customers operate 104 Proportion of portfolio from direct origination ~80% Contracts with STORE-preferred terms * (1) 93% Weighted average annual lease escalation (2) 1.8% Weighted average remaining lease contract term ~14 years Occupancy (3) 99.6% Properties not operating but subject to a lease (4) 16 Investment locations subject to a ground lease 20 Investment portfolio subject to NNN leases * 98% Investment portfolio subject to Master Leases * (5) 87% Average investment amount/replacement cost (new) (6) 82% Locations subject to unit-level financial reporting 97% Median unit fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR)/4-Wall coverage ratio (7) 2.1x/2.6x Contracts rated investment grade (8) ~75% * Based on annualized base rent and interest.\n(1)\nRepresents the percentage of our lease contracts that were created by STORE or contain preferred contract terms such as unit-level financial reporting, triple-net lease provisions and, when applicable, master lease provisions.\n(2)\nRepresents the weighted average annual escalation rate of the entire portfolio as if all escalations occurred annually. For escalations based on a formula including CPI, assumes the stated fixed percentage in the contract or assumes 1.5% if no fixed percentage is in the contract. For contracts with no escalations remaining in the current lease term, assumes the escalation in the extension term. Calculation excludes contracts representing less than 0.2% of annualized base rent and interest where there are no further escalations remaining in the current lease term and there are no extension options.\n(3)\nThe Company defines occupancy as a property being subject to a lease or loan contract. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned eight properties that were vacant and not subject to a contract.\n(4)\nRepresents the number of the Company’s investment locations that have been closed by the tenant but remain subject to a lease.\n(5)\nPercentage of investment portfolio in multiple properties with a single customer subject to master leases. Approximately 82% of the investment portfolio involves multiple properties with a single customer, whether or not subject to a master lease.\n(6)\nRepresents the ratio of purchase price to replacement cost (new) at acquisition.\n(7)\nSTORE Capital calculates a unit’s FCCR generally as the ratio of (i) the unit’s EBITDAR, less a standardized corporate overhead expense based on estimated industry standards, to (ii) the unit’s total fixed charges, which are its lease expense, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on indebtedness. The 4-Wall coverage ratio refers to a unit’s FCCR before taking into account standardized corporate overhead expense.\n(8)\nRepresents the percentage of the Company’s contracts that have a STORE Score that is investment grade. The Company measures the credit quality of its portfolio on a contract-by-contract basis using the STORE Score, which is a proprietary risk measure reflective of both the credit risk of the Company’s tenants and the profitability of the operations at the properties. As of December 31, 2017, STORE Capital’s tenants had a median tenant credit profile of approximately ‘Ba2’ as measured by Moody’s Analytics RiskCalc rating scale. Considering the profitability of the operations at each of its properties and STORE’s assessment of the likelihood that each of the tenants will choose to continue to operate at the properties in the event of their insolvency, the credit quality of its contracts, or STORE Score, is enhanced to a median of ‘Baa2.’\nCapital Transactions\nOn February 9, 2018, the Company expanded its unsecured revolving credit facility from $500 million to $600 million and the accordion feature from $300 million to $800 million for a total maximum borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion. The amended credit facility matures in February 2022 and includes two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions.\nDuring 2017, STORE Capital’s corporate credit rating was upgraded by both S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings to BBB with a stable outlook. The Company also received an initial investment grade issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold approximately 3.7 million shares under its $400 million “at the market,” or ATM program, and raised approximately $94.7 million in net proceeds after the payment of sales agents’ commissions and offering expenses. Since the start of its ATM program in September 2016, the Company has sold approximately 11.9 million shares at a weighted average share price of $26.16, raising $304.1 million in aggregate net proceeds after the payment of sales agents’ commissions and offering expenses.\n2018 Guidance\nAffirming its 2018 guidance initially presented in November 2017, the Company currently expects 2018 AFFO per share to be within a range of $1.78 to $1.84, based on projected 2018 annual real estate acquisition volume, net of projected property sales, of approximately $900 million. This AFFO per share guidance equates to anticipated net income, excluding gains or losses on sales of property, of $0.82 to $0.86 per share, plus $0.88 to $0.90 per share of expected real estate depreciation and amortization, plus approximately $0.08 per share related to such items as straight-line rent and the amortization of stock-based compensation and deferred financing costs. AFFO per share is sensitive to the timing and amount of real estate acquisitions, property dispositions and capital markets activities during the year, as well as to the spread achieved between the lease rates on new acquisitions and the interest rates on borrowings used to finance those acquisitions. The midpoint of our AFFO guidance is based on a weighted average cap rate on new acquisitions of 7.75% and target leverage in the range of 5 ½ to 6 times run-rate net debt to EBITDA.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held later today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time / 10:00 a.m. Scottsdale, Arizona Time, to discuss fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 operating results and answer questions.\nLive conference call: 855-656-0920 (domestic) or 412-542-4168 (international) Conference call replay available through March 8, 2018: 877-344-7529 (domestic) or 412-317-0088 (international) Replay access code: 10116320 Live and archived webcast: http://ir.storecapital.com/webcasts\nSTORE Capital Investor Day 2018\nThe STORE Capital executive team invites institutional investors and analysts to join them on Wednesday, April 11, 2018 at the New York Stock Exchange for STORE Capital Investor Day 2018.

STORE Capital is one of the largest and fastest growing net-lease REITs and owns a large, well-diversified portfolio that consists of investments in 1,921 property locations, substantially all of which are profit centers, in 48 states. Additional information about STORE Capital can be found on its website at www.storecapital.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” “approximate” or “plan,” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. For more information on risk factors for STORE Capital’s business, please refer to the periodic reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. These forward-looking statements herein speak only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events. STORE Capital expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, to reflect any change in STORE Capital’s expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO and AFFO\nSTORE Capital’s reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The Company also discloses Funds from Operations, or FFO, and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes these two non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or to cash flows from operations as reported on a statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company computes FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income, excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable property, real estate impairment losses, and depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nTo derive AFFO, the Company modifies the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to certain non-cash revenues and expenses that have no impact on the Company’s long-term operating performance, such as straight-line rents, amortization of deferred financing costs and stock-based compensation. In addition, in deriving AFFO, the Company excludes certain other costs not related to its ongoing operations, such as the amortization of lease-related intangibles.\nFFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among the Company’s peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. Management believes that AFFO provides more useful information to investors and analysts because it modifies FFO to exclude certain additional non-cash revenues and expenses such as straight-line rents, amortization of deferred financing costs and stock-based compensation as such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on long-term operating performance. Additionally, in deriving AFFO, the Company excludes certain other costs, such as the amortization of lease-related intangibles. The Company believes that these costs are not an ongoing cost of the portfolio in place at the end of each reporting period and, for these reasons, the portion expensed is added back when computing AFFO. As a result, the Company believes AFFO to be a more meaningful measurement of ongoing performance that allows for greater performance comparability. Therefore, the Company discloses both FFO and AFFO and reconciles them to the most appropriate GAAP performance metric, which is net income. STORE Capital’s FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nSTORE Capital Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (In thousands, except share and per share data) Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited)\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\nRevenues: Rental revenues $ 113,850 $ 96,415 $ 427,943 $ 356,081 Interest income on loans and direct financing receivables 5,836 5,576 22,565 19,677 Other income 438 150 2,339 585 Total revenues 120,124 102,141 452,847 376,343 Expenses: Interest 28,540 28,753 120,478 105,180 Transaction costs – 33 – 523 Property costs 1,501 1,548 4,773 4,067 General and administrative 11,203 8,732 40,990 33,972 Selling stockholder costs – – – 800 Depreciation and amortization 40,079 32,992 150,279 119,618 Provisions for impairment 1,500 1,720 13,440 1,720 Total expenses 82,823 73,778 329,960 265,880 Income from operations before income taxes 37,301 28,363 122,887 110,463 Income tax expense 119 110 453 358 Income before gain on dispositions of real estate 37,182 28,253 122,434 110,105 Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of tax 3,826 3,687 39,604 13,220 Net income $ 41,008 $ 31,940 $ 162,038 $ 123,325 Net income per share of common stock - basic and diluted: $ 0.21 $ 0.20 $ 0.90 $ 0.82 Weighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n190,765,946 155,987,275 178,586,266 148,878,504 Diluted 191,302,717 156,199,297 178,656,676 149,124,010 Dividends declared per common share $ 0.31 $ 0.29 $ 1.20 $ 1.12 STORE Capital Corporation Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (In thousands, except share and per share data) December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (unaudited) (audited) Assets Investments: Real estate investments: Land and improvements $ 1,898,342 $ 1,536,178 Buildings and improvements 3,958,003 3,226,791 Intangible lease assets 87,402 92,337 Total real estate investments 5,943,747 4,855,306 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (426,931 ) (298,984 ) 5,516,816 4,556,322 Real estate investments held for sale, net 16,741 – Loans and direct financing receivables 271,453 269,210 Net investments 5,805,010 4,825,532 Cash and cash equivalents 42,937 54,200 Other assets, net 51,830 61,936 Total assets $ 5,899,777 $ 4,941,668 Liabilities and stockholders' equity Liabilities: Credit facility $ 290,000 $ 48,000 Unsecured notes and term loans payable, net 570,595 470,190 Non-recourse debt obligations of consolidated special purpose entities, net 1,736,306 1,833,481 Dividends payable 60,068 46,209 Accrued expenses, deferred revenue and other liabilities 71,866 60,533 Total liabilities 2,728,835 2,458,413 Stockholders' equity: Common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 375,000,000 shares authorized, 193,766,854 and 159,341,955 shares issued and outstanding, respectively 1,938 1,593 Capital in excess of par value 3,381,090 2,631,845 Distributions in excess of retained earnings (214,845 ) (151,592 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income 2,759 1,409 Total stockholders' equity 3,170,942 2,483,255 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 5,899,777 $ 4,941,668 STORE Capital Corporation Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (In thousands, except per share data) Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) (unaudited) Net income $ 41,008 $ 31,940 $ 162,038 $ 123,325 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 39,858 32,843 149,556 119,079 Provision for impairment of real estate – 1,720 11,940 1,720 Gain on dispositions of real estate, net of tax (3,826 ) (3,687 ) (39,604 ) (13,220 ) Funds from Operations 77,040 62,816 283,930 230,904 Adjustments: Straight-line rental revenue, net (396 ) 204 (3,358 ) (2,344 ) Transaction costs – 33 – 523 Amortization of: Equity-based compensation 2,051 1,803 7,931 7,022 Deferred financing costs and other noncash interest expense (1) 1,851 1,949 9,978 7,267 Lease-related intangibles and costs (2) 158 336 5,800 1,657 Provision for loan losses 1,500 – 1,500 – Accrued severance costs – – 296 – Selling stockholder costs – – – 800 Adjusted Funds from Operations $ 82,204 $ 67,141 $ 306,077 $ 245,829 Dividends declared to common stockholders $ 60,068 $ 46,209 $ 223,776 $ 170,795 Net income per share of common stock: (3) Basic and Diluted $ 0.21 $ 0.20 $ 0.90 $ 0.82 FFO per share of common stock: (3) Basic $ 0.40 $ 0.40 $ 1.59 $ 1.55 Diluted $ 0.40 $ 0.40 $ 1.59 $ 1.54 AFFO per share of common stock: (3) Basic $ 0.43 $ 0.43 $ 1.71 $ 1.65 Diluted $ 0.43 $ 0.43 $ 1.71 $ 1.64 (1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, includes $2.0 million of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs related to the prepayment of STORE Master Funding debt.
