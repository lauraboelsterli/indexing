    "text": "Bitcoin extends slide with a more than 10 percent fall February 5, 2018 \nLONDON (Reuters) – Bitcoin, the world’s best-known cryptocurrency, fell more than 10 percent on Monday and approached three-month lows on concerns about a global regulatory clampdown on the trading of the digital coins. \nOn the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, Bitcoin traded as low as $7,289 by 1430 GMT, having now fallen by more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 hit in December. \nThe currency, which surged more than 1,300 percent last year, has lost almost half its value so far in 2018, as more governments and banks signal their intention to crack down. Last week it suffered its worst weekly performance since 2013.
