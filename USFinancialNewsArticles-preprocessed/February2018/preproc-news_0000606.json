On storage investments, he said they would be “relatively modest” this year.\nOrsted’s shares were up 2.3 percent at 0940 GMT after it reported fourth-quarter operating profit (EBITDA) of 13.03 billion crowns, beating analysts’ average forecast of 12.06 billion in a Reuters poll.\nThe stock, whose listing in Copenhagen was one of the biggest in 2016 globally, is up around 40 percent since then.\nThis year, EBITDA from existing offshore wind partnership agreements is seen at 12-13 billion crowns, compared with 12.7 billion crowns last year.\nThe company also set a new target for operating profit growth from offshore wind farms in operation of 13-14 percent from 2017 to 2023.\nCOST CUTTING RACE The wind power sector is at a critical juncture as subsidies that have underpinned the industry since the early 1990s disappear because politicians want to make it more commercially viable and able to compete with other energy sources.\nThat has made it increasingly important for developers to reduce costs.\nOrsted said on Thursday capital expenditure (capex) per megawatt had fallen to 20 million crowns from 22-24 million crowns for the projects it had in its buildout portfolio at the time of its 2016 listing.\nCost reductions are being driven in particular by new technology, such as bigger turbines.\n“Offshore wind can now be produced cheaper than power from new-builds of conventional coal- and gas-fired power stations,” Poulsen said.\nOrsted developed the world’s first offshore wind farm in 1991 and has built more than a quarter of the world’s wind farms at sea.\nReporting by Stine Jacobsen; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ",
