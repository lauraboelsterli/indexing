    "text": "Amazon is looking to lease a 50,000-square-meter warehouse just outside Sao Paulo, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as it steps up its push into Latin America's biggest retail market, Brazil .\nThe logistics investment, which would be four times the size of its current book-shipping operation in the country, is a sign the online retailer may soon handle distribution of electronics and other goods sold on its Brazilian website.\nThat would be the first step of its kind for Amazon in Latin\nAmerica's largest economy, where it currently relies on third\nparties to ship their own goods sold on its marketplace, and it\nunderscores the seriousness of the e-commerce giant's renewed\npush into Brazil.\nAmazon declined to comment to questions about leasing a\nwarehouse.\nWhile an estimated two-thirds of Brazil's 209 million people\nhave internet access, online retail was slow to take off at\nfirst, amid concerns over security and complications with tax\nand logistics in the continent-sized country.\nE-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil's roughly\n$300 billion retail market about half its share in the United\nStates but it has doubled in the past four years and is\nforecast to keep growing annually at a double-digit pace.\nNow Amazon, which expanded its Brazil business from books to\nelectronics in October, is gearing up to fight rivals such as\nLatin Ameria's homegrown e-commerce champion Mercado Libre\nand B2w Cia Digital, which is indirectly\ncontrolled by partners of private equity group 3G Capital.\n\"You obviously can't underestimate a company like Amazon,\"\nsaid Pedro Guasti, CEO of Brazilian online consultancy Ebit. \"It\nhas huge capacity to invest and it's obviously taking a bigger\nbite of the cake than it did last year.\"\nMercado Libre and local retailer Magazine Luiza SA\nhave stolen a march on Amazon by storing and shipping\ngoods appearing on their websites even when offered by\nthird-party sellers, to ensure speed and customer satisfaction.\nAmazon, by contrast, has been slow to tackle the challenges\nof shipping in a country where tricky logistics and tax issues\nhave long made online retail an unprofitable venture.\nMexican contrast\nIn Mexico, Amazon launched its third-party marketplace\ncoupled with its own shipping service, called \"Fulfillment by\nAmazon,\" in 2015.\nThe contrast has been stark. Nearly 20 percent of reviews on\nAmazon's Brazilian marketplace are negative, compared with 10\npercent in Mexico and just 4 percent in the United States,\naccording to e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse.\nComplaints in Brazil often focus on delayed or canceled\norders - a problem dramatically reduced in other countries when\nAmazon itself packs and posts orders of third-party goods stored\nat its warehouse facilities.\nIn an early sign of Amazon's Brazilian logistics push, the\ncompany posted more than a dozen listings for distribution jobs\nin the country to LinkedIn last year, including \"Site leader,\nFulfillment Center.\"\nThe new warehouse site outside of Sao Paulo, in the\nmunicipality of Cajamar, looks to be a step in that direction.\nThere San Francisco-based logistics company Prologis Inc\nhas offered a 50,000-square-meter space to Amazon in a\nnew industrial park that hosts DHL and Samsung, according to\nsources, who said adaptation of the warehouse had not begun.\nPrologis, which also partnered with Amazon on a\nmega-warehouse north of Mexico city last year, declined to\ncomment.\nThe preparations in Brazil come as Luft, the local logistics\noperator for Amazon's book business, readies a move into another\nPrologis site nearby in Cajamar, sources said, leaving its\ncurrent 12,000-square-meter facility in the city of Barueri.\nAmazon registered in October to conduct operations in\nCajamar, according to municipal records seen by Reuters.\nThe new logistics investment could spell trouble for rivals.\nMercado Libre has been a success story among Latin America\ntech start ups: its shares have nearly tripled since 2014,\nbringing its market capitalization to more than $15 billion.\nMagazine Luiza's stock has risen sixfold in each of the past\ntwo years as it shifted its rolled out an ambitious e-commerce\nstrategy built on its brick and mortar stores.",
