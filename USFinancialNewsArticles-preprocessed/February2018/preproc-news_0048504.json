    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovaccer Inc. , a leading San Francisco-based healthcare data platform company, today announced that Deepak Murthy has joined as its President and Chief Business Officer (CBO). Mr. Murthy will report to Innovaccer's co-founder and CEO, Abhinav Shashank, and will be responsible for all go-to-market functions including sales, marketing, and business development.\nMr. Murthy brings over 15 years of strategy and enterprise software experience to Innovaccer. Most recently, he was Vice President and General Manager at Box, an enterprise SaaS company based in Redwood City, California. There he oversaw all aspects of the relationship with IBM including product development on the Box Content Platform, customer success, and go-to-market. Formerly, he also served as the Chief of Staff to the COO of Box and was responsible for the company's international expansion execution and strategy.\nBefore Box, Mr. Murthy was Principal at The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) where he served technology, media, and telecom companies across the world on a host of go-to-market and operational improvement efforts. Prior to BCG, he held engineering and program management roles at Cisco and Vivace Networks (a startup acquired by Tellabs).\n\"Innovaccer is undergoing rapid growth, and we are thrilled to have Deepak on our team. He has laid out an inspiring and exciting vision for continued growth that will further our mission of driving healthcare efficiencies throughout the care continuum,\" said Abhinav Shashank, CEO at Innovaccer. \"Deepak brings a tremendous amount of experience from different industries and an in-depth knowledge of accelerating outreach that will play a pivotal role in transforming healthcare across the U.S.,\" he further added.\nMr. Murthy, an alumnus of the Kellogg School of Management, earned an MBA from Northwestern University. He also holds a Master of Science in computer engineering from the University of Kansas.\n\"The healthcare ecosystem has suffered inefficiencies because of the inability to unlock the power of data. Innovaccer's healthcare data platform is enabling the largest Health Systems, ACOs, payers, and application developers to work with previously unusable data, derive insights, and act on those insights to drive efficiency like never before. The technology foundation on which the platform is built and the impact Innovaccer was having on its customers compelled me to join Innovaccer,\" said Mr. Murthy, further talking about his plans for Innovaccer, \"As the potential for customer impact with our platform is immense, my focus will be to scale the business so that we can deliver the best of our platform to our current and future customers,\" he said.\nAbout Innovaccer\nInnovaccer Inc is a leading healthcare data platform company focused on delivering more efficient and effective healthcare by combining pioneering analytics with transparent and accurate data.
