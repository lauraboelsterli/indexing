    "text": "February 13, 2018 / 4:33 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago Italy's 5-Star Movement under fire over missing funds Reuters Staff 3 Min Read ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement came under fire from opponents on Tuesday after media reports that some of its parliamentarians had broken internal rules obliging them to give half their salaries to a fund to help small businesses. Party leader Luigi Di Maio launched an investigation and vowed to “kick out the rotten apples” in the movement, which has staked its political fortune on being squeaky clean and un-corruptible compared with traditional parties. 5-Star believes the salaries of Italy’s parliamentarians are too high and obliges its own members to deposit 50 percent of their monthly pay into a micro-fund. According to the reports, which dominated Italian media on Tuesday, as many as 10 of the movement’s parliamentarians failed to hand over amounts totalling more than 1 million euros. One senator suspended his 5-Star membership in response to the investigative report, which was carried out by an Italian television channel owned by right-wing political rival Silvio Berlusconi. But Barbara Lezzi, a prominent 5-Star senator, denied the accusations made by the TV show. “I have paid everything,” she told the newspaper Corriere della Sera on Tuesday. “When I saw that programme I was shocked. It devastated me.” She said two 5-Star politicians had admitted to not paying enough, but had later made up their contributions. Matteo Renzi, leader of the ruling centre-left Democratic Party, accused Di Maio of overseeing a movement of “scroungers and fraudsters” and urged Italians not to vote for them in the March 4 election. Di Maio said “anyone who betrays our principles will be thrown out,” saying that in the past five years he had relinquished about 370,000 euros of pay or benefits. The 5-Star Movement is the most popular single party going into next month’s election, but it lags behind a conservative alliance of Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and its right-wing allies the Northern League and Brothers of Italy, polls show. The centre-right bloc is expected to win the most seats but fall short of an absolute majority. Reporting By Philip Pullella, editing by Larry King",
