The strong U.S. economy is still boosting freight demand and the spring push by produce growers from Mexico and Southern states to get goods to market is picking up, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, leaving many companies to push business to rail while bracing for higher prices in new shipping contracts . Trucker Werner Enterprises Inc. just raised its outlook for rate increases this year to between 6% and 10%, and big shippers US Foods Holding Corp. and Kellogg Co. say higher logistics costs and tight capacity are weighing on their earnings. Truckers are stepping up incentives to drivers, but in the meantime they’re sending freight to railroads. Truck-trailer traffic on the rails is growing at a double-digit pace, which keeps goods moving even if they’re not going as fast as shippers want.\nThe holiday season is in full swing at logistics operations handling returns, and it’s busier than ever. The secondary retail market is seeing a surge in volume this year, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, a result of the strongest growth in holiday sales in several years and the big gains in the online shopping that often result in returns. That triggers a complicated logistics exercise as retailers try to salvage some value from their sales by pushing clothing, appliances and toys to resellers for pennies on the dollar. The discounts are steep on industrial-scale shipments: On one online auction site, 49 washing machines and dryers recently returned to Best Buy Co. were offered at a 68% discount. January and February are the busiest months for a reverse supply chain that’s exploding in the shadows of e-commerce expansion. Online auction sales have grown 66% since 2008, and some $90 billion in merchandise this year could be headed back through reverse distribution channels.\nThe new U.S. tax law is triggering changes in the supply side of the country’s agriculture supply chains. Some agricultural companies are revamping operations to avoid being stung by the law, the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge and Richard Rubin report, and sidestep problems that could hit crop production as soon as this year. Family-owned grain companies and ethanol makers and are setting up cooperatives to benefit from a provision that gives farmers larger tax savings for selling crops to that kind of business. Executives say if Congress doesn’t change the law or they can’t get their companies recognized as farmer-backed cooperatives, processing plants could run short of crops and small grain elevators could be driven out of business. Small companies and the big commodity traders are pressing for lawmakers to act with speed not usually associated with Congress. With the spring planting season nearing, farmer say the tax treatment of sales could become a big factor in their business this year.\nTRANSPORTATION Photo: Bloomberg News A U.S. demand for cleaner truck engines is fueling a truck sales renaissance in central Tennessee, although it’s hardly the kind rule-makers may have imagined. The family-owned Fitzgerald truck dealership is selling Peterbilt and Freightliner trucks that are new on the outside but equipped with older, rebuilt diesel engines that do not need to comply with rules on modern emissions controls. The trucks are known as “gliders,” and The New York Times reports they’re part of a politically-connected effort to use a loophole in federal law to reuse older engines that spew 40 to 55 times the air pollution of other new trucks but can cut costs to buyers. Companies including Volvo Trucks, Navistar International Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. have condemned the practice. But Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt backs the loophole, and it’s supported by Rep. Diane Black, the Republican running for governor of Tennessee, whose office says the lawmaker merely supports a company bringing jobs to a rural part of the state.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We’d love to haul them but we don’t have any drivers. ’\n—Michael Gerdin, chief executive of Heartland Express, which says it is turning down loads in a high-demand market.\nNumber of the Day 0.9% Share of global container ship fleet kept idle as of early February, down from close to 8% about a year ago, according to Alphaliner.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. industrial output fell in January for the first time since last summer .
