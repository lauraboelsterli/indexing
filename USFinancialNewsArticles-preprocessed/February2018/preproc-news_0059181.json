    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Oasis Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: OMP) (the \"Partnership\" or \"OMP\") today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided its 2018 outlook.\nRecent Highlights:\nCompleted its initial public offering of 8,625,000 common units, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $137.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and structuring fees, of which $132.1 million was distributed to Oasis Petroleum. Declared initial quarterly cash distribution of $0.3750 per unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and declared the third quarter distribution of $0.0245 per unit for the six days ended September 30, 2017. Net income was $33.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and net income attributable to the Partnership was $11.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $37.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and net Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership was $13.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. (1) Distributable Cash Flow was $11.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, resulting in distribution coverage of 1.12x. (1) Completed assignment of second Wild Basin gas plant (\"Gas Plant II\") to Bighorn DevCo, with total capacity of 200 million standard cubic feet per day (\"MMscfpd\") to service gas production from Oasis Petroleum's highly economic inventory. Gas Plant II is on schedule to begin operations in late 2018. Deployed temporary gas processing units with total capacity of 40 MMscfpd in Wild Basin to process gas volumes in excess of current processing capacity.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\"We delivered a successful first full quarter as a public company, positioning ourselves to grow distributions per unit annually at 20%, while also increasing coverage over time,\" said Taylor Reid, Chief Executive Officer of OMP. \"We continue to make progress on our 200 MMscfpd gas plant and expect it to start on time in late 2018 and on budget. Our business development team has identified new opportunities to bring in third party volumes into our Bighorn DevCo and has further identified opportunities to grow volumes in our Bobcat and Beartooth DevCos, as we are forecasting higher throughput volumes than originally anticipated. Our new guidance reflects the incremental capital and volumes that we expect to capture. We continue to invest capital at attractive build multiples, resulting in capital efficient growth opportunities for OMP.\"\nOther Key Developments:\nOptimization of Johnson's Corner pipeline, improving forecasted crude oil throughput volumes by over 15% to 40 - 42 Mbopd; Early success in the fourth quarter of 2017 obtaining third party volumes for Beartooth DevCo, including both produced and freshwater volumes, leading to projected water volumes of 100 to 105 Mbowpd; Spent $94.7 million on Gas Plant II in 2017, which includes $66.7 million for the assignment from Oasis Petroleum, with the remaining of the $140 million total Gas Plant II costs expected to be invested in 2018; and Identified growth opportunities for Bobcat DevCo due to increased gas volumes in Wild Basin. Forecasted gas volumes have increased by over 30% to 132 - 140 MMscfpd in 2018, and OMP now anticipates gas volumes for Bobcat to exceed 200 MMscfpd by mid 2019, which represents an increase of over 50% compared to original forecasts. Additionally, OMP expects to gather incremental oil and water in Wild Basin and will invest additional CapEx in Bobcat to capture these volumes. OMP expects to invest this incremental CapEx at four to five times build multiples.\nOperational and Financial Update\nSelect operational and financial statistics are included in the following table for the period presented:\nQuarter Ended:\n12/31/2017\n(In millions, except throughput volumes)\nBighorn DevCo - 100% owned by OMP\nCrude oil services volumes (Mbopd)\n43.8\nNatural gas services volumes (MMscfpd)\n70.0\nOperating income\n$\n5.3\nDepreciation and amortization\n1.1\nBobcat DevCo - 10% owned by OMP\nCrude oil services volumes (Mbopd)\n34.2\nNatural gas services volumes (MMscfpd)\n108.4\nWater services volumes (Mbowpd)\n32.2\nOperating income\n$\n16.7\nDepreciation and amortization\n1.7\nBeartooth DevCo - 40% owned by OMP\nWater services volumes (Mbowpd)\n98.5\nOperating income\n$\n12.0\nDepreciation and amortization\n1.6\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital Expenditures (\"CapEx\") were $227.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and totaled $129.2 million gross and $105.1 million net for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

The Partnership defines Cash Interest as interest expense plus capitalized interest less amortization and write-offs of deferred financing costs and debt discounts included in interest expense. Cash Interest is not a measure of interest expense as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of interest expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash Interest for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands)\nInterest expense\n$\n—\n$\n1,531\n$\n6,965\n$\n5,481\nCapitalized interest\n562\n289\n1,220\n4,419\nAmortization of deferred financing costs\n(119)\n—\n(126)\n—\nCash Interest\n443\n$\n1,820\n8,059\n$\n9,900\nLess: Cash Interest prior to the initial public offering\n—\n7,603\nCash Interest attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n$\n443\n$\n456\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of the Partnership's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Partnership defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non-cash adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash flows as determined by GAAP.\nDistributable Cash Flow (\"DCF\")\nThe Partnership defines DCF as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to OMP less cash paid for interest and maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the construction or development of new capital assets or the replacement, improvement or expansion of existing capital assets) made to maintain, over the long term, system operating capacity, operating income or revenue. DCF should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF provides information useful to investors and analysts for assessing results of operations, financial performance and OMP's ability to generate cash from business operations without regard to financing methods or capital structure, coupled with OMP's ability to make distributions to OMP unitholders. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands)\nNet income\n$\n33,365\n$\n10,968\n$\n72,547\n$\n40,128\nIncome tax expense\n—\n6,631\n22,858\n24,857\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,371\n3,200\n15,730\n8,525\nEquity-based compensation expenses\n53\n249\n1,052\n911\nImpairment\n—\n—\n—\n—\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n—\n1,531\n6,965\n5,481\nOther non-cash adjustments\n—\n—\n—\n10\nAdjusted EBITDA\n37,789\n$\n22,579\n119,152\n$\n79,912\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA prior to the initial public offering\n—\n79,484\nAdjusted EBITDA subsequent to the initial public offering\n37,789\n39,668\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests\n24,740\n25,955\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n13,049\n13,713\nCash Interest attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n443\n456\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n1,098\n1,183\nDistributable Cash Flow attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n$\n11,508\n$\n12,074\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n8,274\n$\n15,765\n$\n79,843\n$\n72,086\nCurrent tax expense\n—\n8,328\n17,618\n24,069\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest\n—\n1,531\n6,965\n5,481\nChanges in working capital\n29,635\n(3,045)\n14,853\n(21,734)\nOther non-cash adjustments\n(120)\n—\n(127)\n10\nAdjusted EBITDA\n37,789\n$\n22,579\n119,152\n$\n79,912\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA prior to the initial public offering\n—\n79,484\nAdjusted EBITDA subsequent to the initial public offering\n37,789\n39,668\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests\n24,740\n25,955\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n13,049\n13,713\nCash Interest attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n443\n456\nMaintenance capital expenditures\n1,098\n1,183\nDistributable Cash Flow attributable to Oasis Midstream Partners LP\n$\n11,508\n$\n12,074\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oasis-midstream-partners-lp-announces-quarter-and-year-ending-december-31-2017-earnings-and-provides-an-operational-update-and-2018-outlook-300605369.html\nSOURCE Oasis Midstream Partners LP",
