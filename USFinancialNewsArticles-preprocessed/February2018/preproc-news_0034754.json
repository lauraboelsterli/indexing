    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- This year and next year, tax time will be even trickier than usual as Americans adjust to the changes from the recently enacted tax law, including adjusting their withholding, according to Senior CFP Board Ambassador Jill Schlesinger, CFP®.\nThe IRS expects more than 155 million returns to be filed this year, of which more than 70 percent should receive a refund. The filing deadline is delayed. Procrastinators should mark April 17, rather than April 15, as their drop-dead date. The IRS typically audits less than 1 percent of individual tax returns.\nAlthough the IRS has already begun accepting electronic and paper tax returns, paper filers will find that the agency begins processing paper returns later. Choosing e-file and direct deposit for refunds remains the fastest and safest way to file.\nAmericans will feel most of the changes stemming from the tax overhaul next year, in the 2019 tax season, Schlesinger said. But there are a few items people should be aware of:\nThe IRS has created new withholding tables , but the recommended amounts may not be enough to cover many taxpayers, especially those in high tax states who could lose certain deductions. To be safe, at least for the first year of the new law, Americans may want to assume their tax liability will be at least the same as this year. Taxpayers can work with the human resources department at their employer to set their withholding levels.\nThe new law allows people who itemize to deduct qualified medical and dental expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). That's a lower threshold than the previous 10 percent. The level returns to 10 percent beginning Jan. 1, 2019.\nThe new law repealed the individual mandate to carry health insurance. But taxpayers still need to provide proof of coverage for 2017 this year. Those who don't have it will pay the penalty, which is the higher of 2.5 percent of your AGI, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a maximum of $2,085.\nA CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional can help Americans' prepare their taxes, manage inevitable changes in tax law and develop strategies to minimize taxes over time.\nABOUT CFP BOARD\nThe mission of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. is to benefit the public by granting the CFP ® certification and upholding it as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.
