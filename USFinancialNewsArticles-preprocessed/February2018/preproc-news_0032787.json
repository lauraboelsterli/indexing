    "text": "Published: Feb 13, 2018 7:21 a.m. ET Share Protests against President Jacob Zuma on Aug. 7, 2017 \nBy Gabriele Steinhauser \nJOHANNESBURG—South African President Jacob Zuma clung to power Tuesday despite an order from the ruling African National Congress to step down amid multiple allegations of corruption. \nThe ANC’s secretary-general and his deputy visited the presidential guesthouse in Pretoria on Tuesday morning, where, according to state television, they delivered a letter to Zuma ordering him to step down. \nIn parliament, a meeting of the chief whips of all parties was scheduled for Wednesday morning, in apparent preparation for a vote of no confidence against the president. The ANC holds a large majority in the assembly, so would be able to vote out Zuma without the support of the opposition, which has long called for his exit. ",
