    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Battery Ventures and Curve Dental, the leading provider of cloud-based, dental practice management software, announced today an agreement for a significant investment. The capital will be used to accelerate growth, drive product innovation and provide world-class customer service.\nFounded in 2005, Curve Dental pioneered cloud-based software to deliver dental practices cutting-edge technology to manage their clinical and operational needs. With the Curve Dental software platform, dentists and their practices can use a modern, web-based system to manage patient charts and X-rays, front office scheduling and billing, and even patient engagement.\n“The dental industry is at a watershed moment when it comes to technology,” said Ian Zipursky, president and COO of Curve Dental. “Curve Dental has been at the forefront of this shift, helping clients move from cumbersome, outdated software platforms to a modern, intuitive user experience powered by the cloud. As the team looks to further capitalize on this accelerating trend, we are thrilled to join forces with both Battery and Dave Cormack—who will be joining as the chairman of the business’s new board—to help us aggressively grow the business.”\nDave Cormack, a veteran healthcare software executive, has founded, built, and managed several high-growth companies, both in the U.S. and internationally. Most recently he was the CEO of Brightree, a leading provider of clinical- and business-management software for the post-acute care industry. Under his direction, the business grew from less than $1 million in annual revenue in 2005 to over $100 million in 2016, when it was acquired.\nCormack’s expertise in accelerating growth through product development, sales and marketing, as well as his experience executing strategic acquisitions, will be an asset as the Curve business pursues its growth strategy, said Battery General Partner Chelsea Stoner, who is joining the new board along with Battery Vice President Duncan Gills. Stoner specializes in investments in software and healthcare technology.\n“Curve Dental is pioneering a new way for dental offices to manage their business operations, while saving them time and money,” said Stoner. “With its innovative, advanced technology, Curve Dental has carved out a unique position in the market. I look forward to partnering with the Curve Dental team to help the business continue to achieve success and solidify its position as the leader in this sector.”\nThe capital investment will be directed toward product research and development and may also be used to seek acquisitions to offer customers additional, complementary solutions to manage their dental practices.\nAbout Curve Dental\nFounded in 2005, Curve Dental provides web-based dental software and related services to dental practices within the United States and Canada. The company is privately-held, with offices in Orem, Utah and Calgary, Alberta. The company strives to make dental software less about computers and more about the user experience.
