I am very proud to say that Dialogic has achieved that milestone,\" said Bill Crank, President and CEO of Dialogic. \"I am also very pleased to bring Mike into Dialogic at this time to continue to grow our business.

The company has great products with a demonstrated history of success. Now that Dialogic is a software company, the opportunities for growth and upside are tremendous,\" said Mike Ward, EVP Global Field Operations of Dialogic. \"The strategy and vision that Bill has driven, the team that has been assembled globally, and the support from an established and industry-experienced Board of Directors are all compelling reasons why this is the perfect time for me to join Dialogic.
