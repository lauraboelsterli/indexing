    "text": "We're used to hearing stories of triumphant Olympians overcoming all odds to achieve their dreams. But for many, staying afloat financially is a lesser-known hurdle as they ski, skate, jump, flip and twirl their way to gold.\nHere are the athletes competing in the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea — and one former Olympian — talking about all things money: how they make ends meet; the financial products they use; and their money stressors, challenges and sacrifices.\nMore from NerdWallet:\nSoFi review: refinancing student loans and borrowing parent loans\nThese 9 students customized their journey to a career\nHow apprenticeships work and how you can land one\nStacey Cook, alpine skiing Age: 33\nHometown: Mammoth Lakes, California\nOlympic experience: Four-time Olympian (2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018).\nHow she earns a living: Sponsorships with businesses including Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in Mammoth Lakes; prize money; and income from the duplex that she owns and rents out.\nHow funding on the ski team works: The U.S. ski team covers ski and travel costs for the top U.S. skiers — a group called the A team, which Cook is on. Athletes on lower-level teams, some of whom still make it to the Olympics, have to pay to be on the team.\nHow sponsorships work: Each contract is unique, but athletes typically earn sponsor money in two ways, Cook says. There's a retainer, or a sum an athlete gets paid for signing a sponsor contract; and performance incentives, or money an athlete gets based on his or her ranking in the sport.\nJust for fun: She enjoys listening to podcasts including NPR's quiz show, \"Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me\" and the \"BiggerPockets Podcast,\" which is about real estate investing.\nJohn K. Coyle, short track speed skating Age: 49\nHometown: West Bloomfield Township, Michigan\nOlympic experience: Silver medalist in the 5,000-meter relay at the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. Now retired.\nA past money mistake: Coyle amassed $87,000 in credit card debt during his speedskating career. He had 37 cards at one point, he says.\nHow he tackled his debt: Coyle consolidated it and worked with a debt settlement company to negotiate down the total amount he owed. But although that strategy works for some people, debt settlement is risky . Chapter 7 bankruptcy or a debt management plan are almost always better options.\nJust for fun: Coyle is a speaker, author and NBC analyst. He'll be in Pyeongchang for the final 10 days of the Olympics doing features for NBC and live broadcasts on his Facebook page, \"John K. Coyle — The Time Guy.\"\nshow chapters Here's how Marcus Lemonis responds to the phrase \"you work too much.\" 2:12 PM ET Thu, 23 Feb 2017 | 01:35 Megan McJames, alpine skiing Age: 30\nHometown: Park City, Utah\nOlympic experience: Three-time Olympian (2010, 2014 and 2018).\nWhat it means to be an independent athlete: McJames was cut from the U.S. ski team in 2012, but has continued competing internationally anyway. Without the team's financial support, she's responsible for covering 100 percent of her training and competition costs.\nHow she covers skiing and living expenses: Private donations, grants, sponsorships, fundraising, prize money and part-time work as a coach in the summers.\nWhat she wishes fans knew about the financial realities of the sport: She estimates costs for U.S. ski team members who have to pay to be on the team range from $15,000 to $25,000 per season. As an independent skier, her costs are even higher.\nBiggest money stressor: Her budget for one season of independent racing in the World Cup circuit during a non-Olympic year is $50,000, not including coaching. She hasn't had a full-time coach since she's been skiing independently.\nJust for fun: She likes listening to singer Josh Ritter to calm her nerves before a race.\nTommy Biesemeyer, alpine skiing Age: 29\nHometown: Keene, New York\nOlympic experience: The 2018 Pyeongchang Games is his first Olympics.\nHow he covers skiing and living expenses: Team fundraising events and sponsorships with companies including Windham Mountain Resort, a ski area in Windham, New York.\nBiggest money stressor: \"I'm maybe behind in regards to other 29-year-olds in the world that are, like, having full-time jobs and have houses and families. I don't have that.\"\nHow he saves for the future: \"I started an IRA when I was 17, and I'm 29 now. I've made a point to put the maximum amount into it.\"\nJust for fun: If it's an option, he likes to eat baby back ribs before a race. He ate them before winning a state championship race in 2012.\nJaelin Kauf, freestyle skiing Age: 21\nHometown: Alta, Wyoming\nOlympic experience: The 2018 Pyeongchang Games is her first Olympics.\nHow she has covered skiing and living expenses: Prize money, fundraising events, income from part-time jobs and crowdfunding on athlete crowdfunding site RallyMe.\nPast part-time jobs: Busing restaurant tables, cleaning houses.\nWhat she wishes fans knew about the financial realities of the sport: For Kauf's ski event, moguls, only the best U.S. athletes get funding for travel costs during competition season. As a top U.S. mogul skier this year, Kauf was funded. Some of her teammates who are also competing in Pyeongchang have to pay their skiing travel costs out-of-pocket, however.\nJust for fun: She always listens to \"Amazing\" by Kanye West in the start gate before a competition.\nshow chapters These successful people share how to get more done in your 24-hour day 3:43 PM ET Thu, 6 Oct 2016 | 02:39 Jasper Good, Nordic combined Age: 21\nHometown: Steamboat Springs, Colorado\nOlympic experience: The 2018 Pyeongchang Games is his first Olympics.\nHow he covers skiing and living expenses: Fundraising, donations and help from his parents.\nHow he has saved on rent: Storing his belongings in a storage unit while he's traveling for competitions, and staying with friends when he returns to Park City, Utah, where he trains.\nFavorite credit card: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card , because it has travel bonuses and no foreign transaction fees.\nJust for fun: His warmup playlist includes \"Man of the Year\" by Schoolboy Q, \"Rap God\" by Eminem and \"Highway to Hell\" by AC/DC.\nBrita Sigourney, freestyle skiing Age: 28\nHometown: Carmel, California\nOlympic experience: Two-time Olympian (2014 and 2018) competing in the halfpipe event.\nHow she earns a living: Prize money and sponsorships with companies including Monster Energy and Giro, a sports accessories company.\nBiggest financial stressor: Booking plane tickets for ski competitions in places like Europe and New Zealand. She uses an American Express Delta credit card to earn miles and get free checked bags.\nWhat skiers can win in prize money: $10,000 to $25,000 for first place, depending on the competition.\nJust for fun: Recently, she's been listening to the electronic song \"Jubel\" by Klingande before competitions.\nMitch Whitmore, long track speed skating Age: 28\nHometown: Waukesha, Wisconsin\nOlympic experience: Three-time Olympian (2010, 2014 and 2018)\nHow he covers skating and living expenses: Performance-based stipend from the U.S. Olympic Committee.\nBiggest money stressor: \"Rent is always one. Luckily, my girlfriend and I live (in Park City, Utah), in a pretty cheap place at the moment.\"\nWhat he wishes more fans knew about the financial realities of the sport: U.S. Olympic athletes are not government-funded. Olympians in most other countries receive financial support from their government, according to the United States Olympic Committee.\nJust for fun: Whitmore tries to eat Chinese food the night before a race. \"That seems to be a good-luck charm,\" he says. He also drinks cherry juice before bed.\nshow chapters This guy went from a cart collector at Target to running a six-figure company by doing this 2:27 PM ET Wed, 12 Oct 2016 | 00:52 Kikkan Randall, cross-country skiing Age: 35\nHometown: Anchorage, Alaska\nOlympic experience: Five-time Olympian (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018).\nHow she covers skiing and living expenses: Sponsorships with businesses and organizations including Alaska Seafood, L.L. Bean and Kashi.\nFavorite credit cards: Airline credit cards, since she travels so often for races. She has cards that earn miles with Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines.\nA financial challenge of parenting as an athlete: Covering child care for her baby son, Breck, while she's competing overseas. Family members typically watch him, which is free, but Randall pays for their travel costs.\nJust for fun: Kikkan loves drinking chocolate milk after a race.\nChris Kinney, bobsled Age: 29\nHometown: Stockbridge, Georgia\nOlympic experience: The 2018 Pyeongchang Games is his first Olympics.\nHow he covers bobsledding and living expenses: A mix of crowdfunding, income from a part-time job and a stipend from the U.S. Olympic Committee.\nBiggest money lesson he's learned: \"Always live below your means, and save… It's not how much you make, it's how much you save.\"\nBiggest money sacrifice: Giving up a full-time job with good benefits to pursue his dream of becoming an Olympian.\nJust for fun: Kinney loves Korean food. His favorite is a pancake-like dish called pajeon.\nshow chapters 'The Profit' star Marcus Lemonis: What I would do if I had to start over 12:04 PM ET Tue, 18 Oct 2016 | 00:56 Sadie Bjornsen, cross-country skiing Age: 28\nHometown: Winthrop, Washington\nOlympic experience: Two-time Olympian (2014 and 2018).\nHow she covers skiing and living expenses: Sponsorships with businesses including Saltchuk, a transportation and distribution company in Seattle, and Delta Constructors, a construction management company in Anchorage, Alaska.

Olympic bronze medalist in the slopestyle event at the 2014 Sochi Games.\nHow he makes a living: Sponsorships with companies including Red Bull, PowerBar and Nike.\nHow medaling in Sochi affected his sponsorship opportunities: \"In terms of the funding, or sponsorship … it really has everything to do with how you're skiing currently, not four years ago,\" he says. Medaling \"does increase your visibility … but if I'm not skiing well, then it doesn't matter.\"\nWhy he wishes more Olympic money got passed on to athletes: \"A lot of the Olympic athletes don't benefit from the Olympics. A lot of them go broke trying to get there and don't see any financial returns or any notoriety, or anything like that.\"\nJust for fun: \"My kryptonite is chocolate chip cookies — I love chocolate chip cookies.\" He says his grandmother's are the best.\nLike this story?
