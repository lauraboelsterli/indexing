Britain needs to disentangle its WTO membership agreement from the European Unionâ€˜s, and has yet to draft a similar text for trade in goods, expected to be much more complicated because of the need to share out agricultural import quotas. Talks with agricultural supplier nations such as Australia and New Zealand are continuing, trade diplomats said. Reporting by Tom Miles",
