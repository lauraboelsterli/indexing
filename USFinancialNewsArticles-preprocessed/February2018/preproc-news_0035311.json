    "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Thursday said ministers will be banned from sexual relationships with staff under a new code of conduct to be enacted in the wake of his deputy admitting to an extramarital affair with a staffer.\n“Ministers, regardless of whether they are married or single, must not engage in sexual relations with staff,” Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.\n“In 2018, it is not acceptable for a minister to have a sexual relationship with somebody who works for them. It is a very bad workplace practice. And everybody knows that no good comes of it.”\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
