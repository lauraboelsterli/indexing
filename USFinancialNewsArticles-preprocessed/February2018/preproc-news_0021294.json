    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate failed to muster enough votes to advance a stand-alone military funding bill, paving the way for lawmakers to move on to a broader spending measure to keep the federal government open after funding runs out later on Thursday.\nU.S. senators are poised to take up a separate budget deal that increases defense and non-defense spending over two years, with a vote expected later in the day.\nReporting by Richard Cowan, Susan Heavey; Editing by David Alexander\n ",
