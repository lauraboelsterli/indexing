Freshman guard Zhaire Smith added 12 points as Texas Tech moved into a share of first place with Kansas in the Big 12.\nSenior forward Vladimir Brodziansky scored 18 points for the Horned Frogs (16-7, 4-6). Sophomore guard Desmond Bane added 13 points and senior guard Kenrich Williams recorded 12 points and 13 rebounds for TCU, which committed 17 turnovers.\nThe Red Raiders shot 50.9 percent from the field and made 10 of 22 3-point attempts. The Horned Frogs shot 50 percent from the field.\nCulver made four 3-pointers in the first half and Texas Tech was 8-of-13 as a team and took advantage of 11 TCU turnovers en route to a 48-24 halftime lead.\nThe Red Raiders began their assault with an 18-0 surge in the first half.\nTommy Hamilton IV converted a four-point play -- he drained a 3-pointer and the ensuing free throw -- and Culver made consecutive 3-pointers during the spurt that gave Texas Tech a 27-9 edge with 11:01 left in the half.\nThe Red Raiders piled on more with 12 straight points later in the half. Culver knocked down another 3-pointer to increase the margin to 44-18 with 2:56 to play.\nSmith slammed home a dunk 58 seconds into the second half to push the lead to 52-24.\nTCU made a charge later in the half with a 15-3 run to move within 61-48 on Brodziansky’s inside hoop with 7:18 remaining.\nThe Horned Frogs moved within 11 before the Red Raiders regained their form with an 11-4 run. Smith capped it by slamming home an authoritative dunk it make it 74-56 with 3:19 left.\nA layup by Evans increased Texas Tech’s advantage to 78-59 with 2:13 left.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
