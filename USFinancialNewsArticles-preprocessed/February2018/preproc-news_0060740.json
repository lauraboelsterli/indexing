Non-operating expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the change in fair value of the Mercury TRA as well as expenses relating to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities in October 2016.\n(3)\nPrimarily includes an adjustment of $363.6 million to deferred taxes for the change in tax rates and the impact to the TRA discussed in (2) above, both resulting from the Tax Reform enacted on December 22, 2017.\n(4)\nDue to our structure as a C corporation and Vantiv Holding's structure as a pass-through entity for tax purposes, the numerator in the diluted net income per share calculation is adjusted to reflect our income tax expense at an expected effective tax rate assuming the conversion of the Class B units of Vantiv Holding into shares of our Class A common stock. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 15.3 million and 27.2 million weighted-average dilutive Class B units of Vantiv Holding were excluded in computing diluted net income per share because including them would have an antidilutive effect. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 35.0 million weighted-average Class B units of Vantiv Holding were excluded in computing diluted net income per share because including them would have an antidilutive effect. As the Class B units of Vantiv Holding were not included, the numerator used in the calculation of diluted net income per share was equal to the numerator used in the calculation of basic net income per share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, due to the net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017, any remaining potentially dilutive securities were also excluded from the denominator in computing dilutive net income per share.\nSchedule 2\nWorldpay, Inc.\nAdjusted Net Income\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except share data)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nIncome before applicable income\ntaxes\n$\n501,133\n$\n103,220\n385%\n$\n813,712\n$\n422,724\n92%\nNon-GAAP Adjustments:\nTransition, acquisition and\nintegration costs (1)(3)\n62,260\n15,226\n309%\n130,146\n37,558\n247%\nShare-based compensation (3)\n12,787\n9,979\n28%\n47,855\n35,871\n33%\nIntangible amortization (2)(3)\n56,369\n48,118\n17%\n217,849\n190,822\n14%\nNon-operating (income)\nexpenses (4)\n(419,154)\n21,307\nNM\n(432,826)\n36,256\nNM\nNon-GAAP adjusted income\nbefore applicable income taxes\n213,395\n197,850\n8%\n776,736\n723,231\n7%\nLess: Adjustments\nAdjusted tax expense (5)\n38,989\n50,108\n(22)%\n133,804\n184,203\n(27)%\nAdjusted tax rate\n18%\n25%\n17%\n25%\nOther (6)\n661\n(381)\nNM\n1,804\n1,200\n50%\nAdjusted net income\n$\n173,745\n$\n148,123\n17%\n$\n641,128\n$\n537,828\n19%\nAdjusted net income per share\n$\n0.97\n$\n0.75\n29%\n$\n3.37\n$\n2.73\n23%\nAdjusted shares outstanding (7)\n178,625,196\n197,244,208\n190,052,282\n197,158,375\nNon-GAAP and Adjusted Financial Measures\nThis schedule presents non-GAAP and adjusted financial measures, which are important financial performance measures for the Company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.

Combined company guidance is based on an assumed exchange rate of U.S. dollar/pound sterling of $1.35.\n(2)\n2017 actuals include Vantiv, Inc. results only.\n(3)\nRepresents estimated ranges of adjustments for the following items: (a) acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions, charges related to employee termination benefits and other transition activities; (b) share-based compensation; (c) amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and customer portfolio and related asset acquisitions; (d) non-operating expense is primarily associated with the change in the fair value of a TRA entered into as part of the acquisition of Mercury and a realized gain of approximately $56 million relating to the settlement of a deal contingent forward entered into in connection with the acquisition of Worldpay Group plc (e) adjustments to income tax expense to reflect an effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the full year 2018 based on Tax Reform and a new tax structure, assuming conversion of the Fifth Third Bank non-controlling interests into shares of Class A common stock, including the tax effect of adjustments described above; and (f) tax benefits due to the amortization of intangible assets and other tax attributes resulting from or acquired with our acquisitions, and to the tax basis step up associated with our separation from Fifth Third Bank and the purchase or exchange of Class B units of Vantiv Holding, net of payment obligations under tax receivable agreements.\nPRELIMINARY ADJUSTED COMBINED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nWe are providing this preliminary supplemental non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) information to illustrate what the combined Vantiv, Inc./Worldpay Group plc (Company renamed Worldpay, Inc.) would have been had the transactions been effective at the beginning of 2016 with the new segment reporting structure, given the assumptions contained therein.\nManagement uses the preliminary adjusted combined non-GAAP supplemental information for purposes of evaluating business unit and consolidated company performance. The company therefore believes that the non-GAAP measures presented provide useful information to investors by allowing them to view the company's businesses through the eyes of management, facilitating comparison of results across historical periods and providing a focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of its businesses.\nThe company uses the preliminary adjusted combined non-GAAP supplemental information to supplement the financial information presented for Vantiv, Inc. on a GAAP historical basis. This non-GAAP supplemental information is not to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\nThe preliminary historical adjusted combined financial information contained in the following supplemental information is for informational purposes only. These results do not necessarily reflect what the historical results of Worldpay, Inc. would have been if the acquisition of Worldpay Group plc had occurred on January 1, 2016. Nor is this information necessarily indicative of the future results of operations of Worldpay, Inc. The preparation of the preliminary adjusted combined financial information includes the use of estimates that may not have been accurate and assumptions that may not have been valid had the transactions occurred on January 1, 2016. However management believes them to be reasonable.\nThe preliminary historical adjusted combined financial information is not pro forma information prepared in accordance with Article 11 of SEC regulation S-X, and the preparation of information in accordance with Article 11 would result in a significantly different presentation.\nThe preliminary historical adjusted combined financial information constitutes forward-looking information and is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual amounts to differ materially from those anticipated. See \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward Looking Information\" included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K or as amended in subsequent filings.\nThe preliminary historical adjusted combined amounts reflect the historical combined results of Vantiv, Inc. and Worldpay Group plc., including information for the following combined company segments.\nMerchant Solutions\nMerchant Solutions primarily consists of Vantiv, Inc.'s Direct, Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs), Merchant Bank sales channels and Worldpay Group plc's U.S. and U.K segments.\nTechnology Solutions\nTechnology Solutions primarily consists of Vantiv, Inc.'s eCommerce, Paymetric, Integrated Payments sales channels and Worldpay Group plc's Global eCommerce segments.\nIssuer Solutions\nIssuer Solutions primarily consists of Vantiv, Inc.'s Financial Institutions Services segment.\nSupplemental Schedule 1\nWorldpay, Inc.\nCombined Consolidated Statements of Income\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nYTD\nYTD\nTotal revenue\n$\n1,417,254\n$\n1,535,796\n$\n1,575,587\n$\n1,634,324\n$\n6,162,961\n$\n5,565,711\nNetwork fees and other costs\n602,123\n627,102\n640,888\n670,901\n2,541,014\n2,193,627\nNet revenue (1)\n815,131\n908,694\n934,699\n963,423\n3,621,947\n3,372,084\nSales and marketing\n251,479\n263,350\n267,866\n261,404\n1,044,099\n988,555\nOther operating costs (2)\n134,030\n144,498\n148,113\n149,961\n576,602\n528,789\nGeneral and administrative (3)\n79,660\n70,071\n76,706\n79,720\n306,157\n310,730\nDepreciation and amortization (4)\n35,246\n37,191\n41,771\n39,342\n153,550\n126,744\nIncome from operations\n314,716\n393,584\n400,243\n432,996\n1,541,539\n1,417,266\nInterest expense—net\n75,628\n78,524\n83,700\n88,844\n326,696\n310,892\nIncome before applicable income taxes\n239,088\n315,060\n316,543\n344,152\n1,214,843\n1,106,374\nIncome tax expense (5)\n37,440\n59,602\n58,713\n66,046\n221,801\n267,176\nTax rate (5)\n16%\n19%\n19%\n19%\n18%\n24%\nOther (6)\n(256)\n(428)\n(459)\n(661)\n(1,804)\n(1,200)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n201,392\n$\n255,030\n$\n257,371\n$\n277,445\n$\n991,238\n$\n837,998\nNon-GAAP and Adjusted Financial Measures\nThis schedule presents non-GAAP and adjusted financial measures, which are important financial performance measures for the Company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.
