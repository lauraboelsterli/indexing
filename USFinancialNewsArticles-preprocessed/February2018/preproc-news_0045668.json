    "text": "BRASILIA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service said the Brazilian government’s decision to drop its efforts to seek approval of the pension reform proposal in Congress was credit negative.\n“While we already expected that a major pension reform was unlikely, ditching off the plans to pursue its approval is a credit negative development that will severely restrict the authorities’ ability to comply with the government spending ceiling in the coming years,” the credit rating agency said on Tuesday in a note to clients.
