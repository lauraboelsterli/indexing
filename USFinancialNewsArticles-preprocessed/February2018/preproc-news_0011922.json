    "text": "Heritage Gartner Total Contract Value up 16% YoY FX Neutral\nHeritage Gartner Fourth Quarter Revenue up 15% YoY and 13% YoY FX Neutral\nSTAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT), the world's leading research and advisory company, today reported results for fourth quarter and full year 2017 and provided its preliminary financial outlook for 2018. The Company also announced today in a separate Press Release that it has reached a definitive agreement to sell its CEB Talent Assessment business as the outcome of its previously announced review of strategic alternatives.\nConsolidated Results Highlights\nOur consolidated and segment results below for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include the results of CEB Inc. (\"CEB\"), which we acquired on April 5, 2017. References to \"heritage Gartner\" operating results and business measurements refer to Gartner excluding CEB. References to CEB refer to the operating results and business measurements of CEB subsequent to the acquisition. Our commentary below regarding the impact of CEB is supplemented by a slide presentation which is available as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on February 6, 2018, and on the Company's website.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act requires numerous changes and modifications with varying effective dates. The significant changes that impact Gartner for 2017 are the remeasurement of deferred taxes in connection with the reduction in the corporate statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings. The provisional net impact of these adjustments increased our net income for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 by $59.6 million. There are also other provisions of the Tax Act that could materially impact Gartner's results in future years.\nFor fourth quarter 2017 total revenue was $1.0 billion, an increase of 44% over fourth quarter 2016 as reported and 42% on a foreign exchange neutral basis. Heritage Gartner revenue increased 15% on a reported basis and 13% on a foreign exchange neutral basis. Adjusted revenue was $1.1 billion in fourth quarter 2017. Net income was $107.3 million in fourth quarter 2017, while adjusted EBITDA was $220.9 million, a 52% increase over fourth quarter 2016. GAAP diluted income per share was $1.16 in fourth quarter 2017, which includes a favorable impact from the Tax Act of approximately $0.65 per share, compared to $0.79 per share in fourth quarter 2016. Adjusted EPS was $1.17 per share in fourth quarter 2017 compared to $0.97 in fourth quarter 2016. (See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for definitions of our Non-GAAP measures).\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, total revenue was $3.3 billion, an increase of 35% on both a reported and foreign exchange neutral basis. Heritage Gartner revenue increased 14% both as reported and foreign exchange neutral. Net income was $3.3 million in the 2017 period. Adjusted EBITDA was $661.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $457.1 million in the same period of 2016, a 45% increase. GAAP diluted income per share was $0.04, which includes a favorable impact from the Tax Act of approximately $0.66 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.31 per share for the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $3.31 per share in the 2017 period compared to $2.96 per share in the 2016 period.\nGene Hall, Gartner’s chief executive officer, commented, \"We delivered another great year. In 2017, we drove strong operating results, we closed and largely integrated CEB, and we took steps to support future growth. I continue to be excited about our business, our prospects for growth and our strategy to drive value to our shareholders over the long term.\"\nSegment Results Highlights\nResearch\nRevenue for fourth quarter 2017 was $692.8 million, up 43% compared to fourth quarter 2016 on a reported basis and 40% on a foreign exchange neutral basis.

(2) Includes the Talent Assessment business. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain financial measures used in this Press Release are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and as such are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We provide these measures to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. Investors are cautioned that these Non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined in the same manner by other companies and as a result may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Also, these Non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as alternatives, or superior, to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's Non-GAAP financial measures are as follows:\nAdjusted Revenue: Represents GAAP revenue plus non-cash fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues. The majority of the pre-acquisition deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the underlying revenue contract. We believe Adjusted Revenue is an important measure of our recurring operations as it provides a more accurate period-over-period comparison of trends in revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Represents GAAP operating income (loss) excluding stock-based compensation expense; depreciation, amortization, and accretion on excess facilities obligations; amortization of adjustments to pre-acquisition deferred revenues; acquisition and integration charges; and other non-recurring items. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items not representative of our core operating results.\nAdjusted Net Income: Represents GAAP net income adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangibles; incremental and directly-related acquisition and integration charges related to the achievement of certain performance targets and employment conditions, as well as legal, consulting, severance, and other costs; the amortization of fair value adjustments on pre-acquisition deferred revenues; the non-recurring impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and other non-recurring items. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items not indicative of our core operating results.\nAdjusted EPS: Represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. We believe Adjusted EPS is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.\nFree Cash Flow: Represents cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP plus payments for acquisition and integration items directly-related to our acquisitions and certain non-recurring items; less payments for capital expenditures. We believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the Company’s core operations that may be available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.\nTables provided in this Press Release provide reconciliations of these Non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nConference Call Information\nGartner has scheduled a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 to discuss the Company’s financial results for fourth quarter and full year 2017.
