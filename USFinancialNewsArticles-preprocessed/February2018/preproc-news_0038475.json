To facilitate this, Shelly Twibell has been promoted to national training director and Beth Luques moved into the role of director of organizational learning and development.\nPinnacle National Training Director\nBoth leaders report to Jennifer Staciokas, senior vice president of marketing and training, and guide a combined team of 11 individuals.\n“Pinnacle is leveraging the passion, skills and knowledge of both Shelly and Beth to better align our Learning & Development department with overall company goals,” said Staciokas. “We are extremely optimistic about this new structure, which endorses our culture of professional and personal growth.”\nA 5-year veteran of Pinnacle, Twibell moves from a regional operations role with extensive onsite experience to foster the company’s learning environment. In her new position, she will be actively involved in technology rollouts, property transitions, implementation of national projects and the day-to-day oversight of our nationwide trainers.\nTwibell will also help Pinnacle team members up-skill or re-skill as they take part in programs available through the University of Pinnacle, a comprehensive education platform offering coursework specific to job roles. Through this system, team members have 24/7 access to supplemental training resources including user guides and one-topic videos.\nTwibell joined Pinnacle in 2013 after working in managerial and leadership positions at Maxus Properties, Cohen-Esrey Communities and Venterra Realty. She holds designations as a Certified Property Manager, Housing Credit Certified Professional and Certified Occupancy Specialist and brings a passion for training to her role.\nWorking in tandem with Twibell is Luques, who transformed Pinnacle’s Learning and Development department when she joined the company in 2015. She will continue her work with curriculum development while expanding the functionality of the company’s Learning Management System. Luques will also focus on developing specialized programs catered to company leaders and creating on-demand videos designed to refresh skills and advance careers.\nAbout Pinnacle Property Management Services, LLC\nPinnacle Property Management Services, LLC, (“Pinnacle”) is a privately held national real estate provider specializing in third party management of multifamily residential communities.
