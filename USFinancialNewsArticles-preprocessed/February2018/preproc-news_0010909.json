    "text": "  Goldman in talks with Apple to finance iPhone sales: WSJ   Goldman Sachs is in talks to offer financing to shoppers buying Apple products including iPhones, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. \nBuyers of a $1,000 iPhone X could take out a loan from Goldman instead of charging it to credit cards that often carry high interest rates, the report said, citing anonymous sources. ( on.wsj.com/2EaOgYg ) \nTalks between the iPhone maker and the Wall Street bank are ongoing and could still fall apart, the Journal reported. \nNeither Apple nor Goldman were immediately available for comment.
