    "text": "U.S. students plan protests, Washington march, to demand gun... • U.S. students plan protests, Washington march, to demand gun... More Stunned by the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history, students mobilized across the country on Sunday to organise rallies and a national walkout in support of stronger gun laws, challenging politicians they say have failed to protect them. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a former student is accused of murdering 17 people on Wednesday using an assault-style rifle, joined others on social media to plan the events, including a Washington march. “I felt like it was our time to take a stand,” said Lane Murdock, 15, of Connecticut. Murdock, who lives 20 miles (32 km) from Sandy Hook Elementary School where 20 children and six adults were shot to death five years ago, drew more than 50,000 signatures on an online petition on Sunday calling on students to walk out of their high schools on April 20.
