    "text": "SEOUL, Feb 1 (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s Celltrion Inc shares fell almost 3 percent on Thursday, after the biopharma company said it had received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nThe letter asked Celltrion to turn in supplemental documents about changes the FDA had asked for regarding its pharmaceutical production, Celltrion said in a statement on its website.\nThe supplemental documents are part of an ordinary process for the pharmaceutical industry and will be turned in 15 business days as required, a Celltrion spokeswoman said.
