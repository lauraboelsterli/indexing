    "text": "CNBC.com \nTeva Pharmaceutical shares jumped 11 percent after Berkshire Hathaway reported a $358 million stake. \nIn a quarterly regulatory filing on Wednesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported holding 18.9 million shares of Teva. After spiking, Teva shares were still up 7.7 percent in after-hours trading. \nBerkshire also reported a 23.3 percent increase in its holdings of Apple shares, to 165 million, and a 21 percent increase in its holdings of Bank of New York Mellon, to 60.8 million shares. \nAt the same time, Berkshire has cut its holdings of IBM 94 percent, to just over 2 million shares. The regulatory filing reflects Berkshire's stock holdings as of the end of December. Investment managers are required to report such holdings every quarter but with a delay.",
