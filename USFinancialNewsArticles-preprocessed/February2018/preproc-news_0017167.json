    "text": "Roadway Sensors Segment Rebounds from Prior Quarter Weather Disruptions\nSANTA ANA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nIteris, Inc . (NASDAQ: ITI), the global leader in applied informatics for transportation and agriculture, today reported financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $26.0 million, up 15% year over year Transportation Systems revenue of $13.6 million, up 14% year over year Roadway Sensors revenue of $11.0 million, up 18% year over year Agriculture and Weather Analytics revenue of $1.4 million, up 2% year over year\nManagement commentary:\n“We are pleased to report record third quarter total revenue results reflecting solid growth in all business segments and positive market fundamentals,” said Joe Bergera, president and CEO. “With ongoing innovation in both our technology and business models, we remain excited about our business outlook.\n“As anticipated, our Roadway Sensors segment activity in Texas recovered nicely following the prior quarter disruptions from Hurricane Harvey. As a result, the business segment returned to healthy double-digit growth in the third quarter, thanks in part to strong distribution performance.”\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 15% to a record $26.0 million, compared with $22.7 million in the same quarter a year ago. This growth was driven by an 18% increase in Roadway Sensors sales, as a result of business recovery in two of our most strategic markets – Texas and Florida, which were affected by hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017. Our Roadway Sensors segment also had strong performance in the distribution of third-party products. Third quarter revenue growth was also attributable to the solid 14% growth in Transportation Systems revenues and, to a lesser extent, a 2% increase in Agriculture and Weather Analytics revenues. While our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment showed modest growth this period, our ClearAg ® product line revenue continued to show significant growth, which was partially offset by a decline in our ClearPath Weather ® products revenue. The decline in ClearPath Weather was due to a business model change, which we expect to create improved product operating margins. More specifically, we eliminated our dependence on a third-party royalty, which reduces ClearPath Weather’s gross revenue while improving its gross margins and creating positive pricing flexibility going forward.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter were $11.1 million, compared with $10.1 million in the same quarter a year ago. The rise in operating expense was primarily due to increases in selling, general and administrative costs, driven by higher compensation costs that were driven by higher revenues, and an increase in business development costs aimed at the pursuit of large contracts in the Transportation Systems segment.\nOperating loss in the third quarter was $1.1 million, compared with an operating loss of approximately $1.5 million in the same quarter a year ago. Net income in the third quarter was approximately $343,000 or $0.01 per share, compared with a net loss of approximately $1.4 million or ($0.04) per share in the year-ago quarter. The main driver of net income in the third quarter was an income tax benefit of $1.4 million, which contributed $0.04 per share, as a result of the passage of new tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nEarnings Conference Call\nIteris will conduct a conference call today to discuss its fiscal third quarter 2018 results.\nDate: Wednesday, February 7, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-800-263-0877\nInternational dial-in number: 1-323-794-2094\nConference ID: 3213732\nTo listen to the live or archived webcast of the earnings call or to view the press release, please visit the investor relations section of the Iteris website at www.iteris.com .\nA replay of the conference call will be available after 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on the same day through February 21, 2018.
