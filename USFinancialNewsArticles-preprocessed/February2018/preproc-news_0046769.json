Chang Ung, North Korea’s representative on the International Olympic Committee, made the comments a few days after a South Korean provincial governor said Gangwon province, host for the current 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, was considering a proposal to co-host the 2021 Asian Winter Games. The host city for the 2021 event has not been decided yet. Reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Michael Perry",
