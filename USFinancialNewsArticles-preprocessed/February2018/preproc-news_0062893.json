    "text": "Provides Outlook for 2018 Product Volumes\nOKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LSB Industries, Inc. (NYSE:LXU) (“LSB” or the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nNet sales of $88.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $85.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 Net loss from continuing operations of $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a loss of $25.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 Adjusted EBITDA (1) from continuing operations of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016\n“Our sales increased while adjusted EBITDA declined modestly relative to the fourth quarter of last year as increased production from our El Dorado facility, higher product pricing and improved demand for mining products was offset by the impact of downtime at our Pryor facility,” stated Daniel Greenwell, LSB’s President and CEO.\n“With respect to the operating performance of our facilities, Cherokee’s ammonia plant once again ran at a 99% on-stream rate for the quarter, which was its fifth consecutive quarter of running at this level. El Dorado had an ammonia plant on-stream rate of approximately 77% in the fourth quarter, which was an improvement over the fourth quarter of the previous year, but lower than the 90% rate it operated at through the first three quarters 2017 as a result of nineteen days of downtime necessary to address mechanical issues on a boiler and a heat exchanger as discussed on our third quarter call. Since returning to service in late October, El Dorado’s ammonia plant has been producing at a rate in excess of 1,300 tons per day with an on-stream rate from that point to date of 99%. As previously announced, Pryor resumed production in early December after being taken out of service towards the end of September to repair damage to electrical controls, wiring and piping that resulted from a minor fire at its ammonia plant. In addition to those repairs, we completed more extensive maintenance work during the downtime which we expect to allow Pryor to forgo a full turnaround later in 2018 and consistently operate at significantly higher on-stream rates, thus enabling us to better capitalize on the improving pricing environment for ammonia. While we were disappointed with how Pryor operated for the fourth quarter, we believe that the significant work that we have done during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 combined with the enhanced maintenance programs we are implementing, will allow us to operate at improved on-stream rates.”\nMr. Greenwell concluded, “So far in the first quarter of 2018, prices for several of the products we produce and sell, particularly ammonia, and high density ammonium nitrate (HDAN) have been strengthening and are currently above their levels from the first quarter of last year. Pricing in 2017 was negatively impacted by excess inventory in the distribution channel from new capacity brought online by several of our competitors. We believe the market has largely absorbed this excess capacity at this point and do not anticipate product pricing to return to the trough levels we experienced in the second half of 2017 that depressed our full year 2017 results. Additionally, we are focused on the significant technological enhancements we are making to our company wide maintenance management system, which will improve our ability to proactively address potential downtime causing issues and improve the overall reliability of all our plants. We are on track to complete these enhancements by the end of our 2018 second quarter and should start to see the benefit in the second half of 2018. We expect that the improved maintenance system and practices, coupled with the higher selling prices for our products should result in materially improved financial results.”\n(1) This is a Non-GAAP measure. Refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section. 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Sales by Market Sector\nSales\nSector\nMix\nSales\nSector\nMix\n% Change Agricultural $ 32.4 36 % $ 32.8 38 % (1 ) %\nIndustrial, Mining and Other 56.5 64 % 52.6 62 % 7 % $ 88.9 $ 85.4 4 % Comparison of 2017 to 2016 periods:\nNet sales of our agricultural products were essentially flat during the quarter relative to the prior year period. Stronger pricing for HDAN was offset by lower ammonia volumes resulting from downtime at our Pryor facility as well as weaker market pricing for ammonia. Urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) sales included approximately 32,955 tons purchased from third parties to meet customer obligations during the Pryor downtime. UAN selling prices were negatively impacted by forward orders taken during the summer months at lower selling prices. Net sales of industrial ammonia increased as a result of higher volumes from improved on-stream rates at El Dorado. Low density ammonium nitrate (LDAN) sales volumes for mining applications also increased as a result of our sales and marketing efforts and stronger overall demand from this market. Sales of nitric acid from the Baytown facility increased as a result of rising levels of industrial manufacturing throughout the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was lower compared to the prior year period primarily due to the aforementioned downtime at the Pryor facility, partially offset by improved on-stream rates and lower fixed costs at El Dorado as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe following tables provide key sales metrics for our Agricultural products:\n Product (tons sold)\n2017 2016 % Change UAN 97,852 87,662 12 % HDAN 48,782 49,086 (1 ) % Ammonia 13,821 22,770 (39 ) % Other 4,801 4,264 13 % 165,256 163,782 1 % Average Selling Prices (price per ton) (A)\nUAN $ 124 $ 135 (8 ) % HDAN $ 203 $ 168 21 % Ammonia $ 215 $ 284 (24 ) % (A) Average selling prices represent “net back” prices which are calculated as sales less freight expenses divided by product sales volume in tons.

Additionally, we had approximately $41.2 million of borrowing availability under our Working Capital Revolver. There were no borrowings under the Working Capital Revolver at December 31, 2017.\nTotal long-term debt, including the current portion, was $409.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $420.2 million at December 31, 2016. The aggregate liquidation value of the Series E Redeemable Preferred at December 31, 2017, inclusive of accrued dividends of $45.5 million, was $185.2 million.\nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.3 million compared to $9.8 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year of 2018, we expect interest expense to be approximately $35 - $40 million.\nCapital expenditures were approximately $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year of 2018, total capital expenditures, which are related to maintaining and enhancing safety and reliability at our facilities, are expected to be approximately $35 million.\nVolume Outlook\nOur outlook for sales volumes for the full year 2018 (including lost sales related to El Dorado and Cherokee turnarounds) and our actual sales volumes for the full year 2017 are as follows:\nProducts\nFull Year 2018 Sales\n(tons)\nFull Year Actual 2017 Sales\n(tons)\nAgriculture: UAN 480,000 – 490,000 489,000 HDAN 290,000 – 310,000 280,000 Ammonia 115,000 – 125,000 94,000 Industrial, Mining and Other: Ammonia 220,000 – 230,000 229,000 LDAN/HDAN and AN solution 180,000 – 190,000 166,000 Nitric Acid and Other Mixed Acids 90,000 – 100,000 101,000 Sulfuric Acid 120,000 – 130,000 133,000 DEF 15,000 – 20,000 15,000 Conference Call\nLSB’s management will host a conference call covering the fourth quarter results on February 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET/9:00 a.m. CT to discuss these results and recent corporate developments.

These non-GAAP measures are calculated using GAAP amounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nEBITDA Reconciliation\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (which includes DD&A of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible and other assets), less benefit for income taxes and income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. We believe that certain investors consider EBITDA a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance. EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operations or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 ($ in millions) LSB Consolidated\nNet income (loss) $ 0.9 ($21.5 ) ($29.2 ) $ 112.2 Plus: Interest expense 9.3 9.8 37.3 30.9 Loss on extinguishment of debt - 8.7 - 8.7 Provision for impairment - 1.6 - 1.6 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 17.3 18.4 69.2 61.3 Benefit for income taxes (30.0 ) (11.2 ) (40.8 ) (41.9 ) Income from discontinued operations (1.1 ) (3.7 ) (1.1 ) (200.3 ) EBITDA ($3.6 ) $ 2.1 $ 35.4 ($27.5 ) LSB Industries, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (continued)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is reported to show the impact of one time/non-cash items such as, loss on sale of a business and other property and equipment, one-time income or fees, start-up/commissioning costs, certain fair market value adjustments, non-cash stock-based compensation and severance costs. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain items. The following tables provide reconciliations of EBITDA excluding the impact of the supplementary adjustments. Our policy is to adjust for non-cash or non-recurring items that are greater than $0.5 million quarterly or cumulatively.\nLSB Consolidated ($ in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 EBITDA: ($3.6 ) $ 2.1 $ 35.4 ($27.5 ) Consulting fee - Negotiated property tax savings at El Dorado - - - 12.1 Stock-based compensation 1.3 0.8 5.2 4.0 Start-up/Commissioning costs at El Dorado - - - 5.1 Severance costs - 0.2 - 0.9 Derecognition of death benefit accrual - - (1.4 ) - Loss on sale of a business and other property and equipment 2.6 (0.3 ) 7.0 0.3 Fair market value adjustment on preferred stock embedded derivatives - - - 1.0 Delaware unclaimed property liability - - - 0.3 Life insurance recovery - - - (0.7 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 0.3 $ 2.8 $ 46.2 ($4.5 ) Agricultural Sales Price Reconciliation\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total agricultural sales as reported under GAAP in our consolidated financial statement reconciled to “net” sales which is calculated as sales less freight expenses.
