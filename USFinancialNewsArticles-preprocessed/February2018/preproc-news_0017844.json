    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Latest on the court fight between Google spin Waymo and ride-hailing service Uber (all times local):\n10:15 a.m.\nFormer Uber CEO Travis Kalanick says he regarded Google co-founder Larry Page as a \"big brother\" before the relationship between their two companies soured.\nKalanick spoke Wednesday during testimony in a trial pitting Uber's ride-hailing service against Google's self-driving car spinoff, Waymo.\nWhen Google made a large investment in Uber in 2013, Kalanick said it seemed likely Uber would deploy Google's robotic cars in its ride-hailing service.\nBut it later became apparent to Kalanick that Google intended to launch its own ride-hailing service.\nKalanick says that threat led Uber to buy a startup founded by a former Google engineer in 2016. That deal triggered Waymo's allegations that Uber had stolen its trade secrets to help build its self-driving cars.\n9:40 a.m.\nFormer Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is back in a San Francisco courtroom to answer questions about discussions he had with an engineer who is accused of stealing Google's self-driving car technology.\nWednesday is Kalanick's second day of testimony in a trial centered on allegations that he conspired with former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski to rip off Google's self-driving car project, while Uber was attempting build its own robotic vehicles.\nGoogle's project is now called Waymo.\nA Waymo lawyer confronted Kalanick with several texts between the two in an attempt to prove they would go to extremes for a competitive edge.\nIn one text, Kalanick agreed with Levandowski's comment that \"second place is first loser.\" Another text referenced a line from the movie \"Wall Street\" proclaiming that, \"Greed is good.\"",
