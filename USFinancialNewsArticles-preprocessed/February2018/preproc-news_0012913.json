    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 11:28 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Global stocks extend selloff, Treasury yields retreat from near four-year highs Caroline Valetkevitch 3 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on global markets extended their recent selloff on Monday, led by declines in energy shares, while U.S. Treasury yields receded from almost four-year highs overnight. \nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down more than 1 percent on Monday after registering their worst weeks on Friday since early January 2016. \nThe S&P energy index .SPNY, down 2.9 percent, was the biggest daily percentage decliner, followed by healthcare .SPXHC, down 2.2 percent. \nOil prices were lower, pressured by rising U.S. output and other factors. \nBenchmark U.S. 10-year note yields US10YT=RR surged to 2.885 percent overnight, the highest since January 2014, following data Friday that showed hourly wages rose in January. \nThe 10-year notes were last up 6/32 in price to yield 2.8318 percent, down from 2.852 percent late on Friday. A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 5, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nSigns that inflation is firming have raised some traders’ expectations that the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates four times this year. Fed officials have indicated that three rate hikes are likely. \n“Even if you think it’s gone too far, or even if you think we’ve sold off a little more than probably warranted at this point, you don’t really have those buyers that are willing to step in and stop it until we see some signs of slowing,” said Blake Gwinn, an interest rate strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 409.33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 25,111.63, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 38.45 points, or 1.39 percent, to 2,723.68 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 72.23 points, or 1 percent, to 7,168.72. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.51 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS shed 1.52 percent. \nThe euro pared some losses against the dollar after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the euro zone economy has strengthened enough to lift regional inflation towards the ECB’s 2-percent goal. \nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.34 percent, with the euro last EUR= down 0.38 percent to $1.2413. \nIn commodities, U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 2.38 percent to $63.89 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.49, down 1.59 percent on the day.
