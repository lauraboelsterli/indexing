(NYSE: PRLB), a leading online and technology-enabled, quick-turn, on-demand manufacturer, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights include:\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $94.2 million, representing a 30.2 percent increase over revenue of $72.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter revenue included $3.6 million revenue contribution from RAPID Manufacturing (“RAPID”), the New Hampshire company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the revenue from RAPID and the impact of discontinued services, revenue increased 26.1 percent compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter. Adjusting for the positive impact on revenue from foreign currency exchange rates, revenue growth was 28.3 percent. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. The number of unique product developers and engineers served totaled 16,985 in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 20.9 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a record $14.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) resulted in a current period net benefit of $1.9 million, with a benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities partially offset by deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Non-GAAP net income, excluding the after-tax expense of stock compensation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition costs, impairment on assets, unrealized foreign currency gains and the net benefit in the current period resulting from the Tax Act was $15.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nAdditional Fourth Quarter 2017 Highlights include:\nGross margin was 56.2 percent of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 55.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP operating margin was 19.9 percent of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 20.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.1 percent of revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 23.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

The fourth quarter was a strong ending to a great year,” said Vicki Holt, President and Chief Executive Officer. “During the quarter, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in each of our services and in each of our regions on a constant currency basis. We were especially pleased with the growth of revenue from our CNC business, up 37.6 percent organically. We continue to enhance our technology to further expand the services that we can provide to our customers.”\nFull Year 2017 Highlights include:\nRevenue increased 15.6 percent to $344.5 million compared with $298.1 million in 2016. Adjusting for the $3.6 million revenue contribution from RAPID, and the impact of discontinued services, adjusted revenue totaled $340.4 million, an increase of 16.1 percent compared to 2016. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Net income for 2017 increased to $51.8 million, or $1.93 per diluted share compared with $42.7 million, or $1.61 per diluted share in 2016. Non-GAAP net income, excluding the after-tax expense of stock compensation, amortization of intangibles, impairment of assets, acquisition costs, unrealized foreign currency gains, legal settlement and the net benefit in the current period resulting from the Tax Act was $57.4 million, or $2.14 per diluted share. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Cash generated from operations during the year totaled $81.7 million.\nAdditional 2017 Highlights include:\nCompletion of our acquisition of RAPID manufacturing in the fourth quarter. Expansion of our service offerings with the launch of insert molding and on demand manufacturing in injection molding and the addition of multi-jet fusion and Polyjet to our 3D printing service. Served over 37,000 product developers during the year, an increase of 18.5 percent. Established a share repurchase program.\n“Our accomplishments in 2017, including the acquisition of RAPID and the continued expansion of our services, will allow us to provide more of a total solution to our customers. These accomplishments have positioned us well for continued, sustainable growth in both revenue and earnings. Our customer focus will continue in 2018 as we continue to evolve our sales approach to develop deeper customer relationships, further advance each of our four service offerings, and increase the scale of our operations, with an initial focus on integrating the RAPID acquisition.” concluded Holt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company has included non-GAAP adjusted revenue growth that excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and non-GAAP adjusted revenue growth that excludes the impact of acquired and discontinued businesses in this press release to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s financial results. Management believes these metrics are useful in evaluating the underlying business trends and ongoing operating performance of the company.\nThe company has included non-GAAP operating margin, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense, acquisition costs, impairment on assets and facilities-related charges (collectively, “non-GAAP operating margin”), in this press release to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s financial results.\nThe company has included non-GAAP net income, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense, impairment on assets, facilities-related charges, acquisition costs, unrealized foreign currency activity, legal settlement, provisional charges related to the tax effect of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and revaluation of net deferred tax assets associated with the Tax Act (collectively, “non-GAAP net income”), in this press release to provide investors with additional information regarding the company’s financial results.\nThe company has provided below reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP net income, operating margin and revenues, the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
