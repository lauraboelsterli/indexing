    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss group Roche said on Tuesday the European Commission has approved its drug Hemlibra for people with hemophilia A who have developed resistance to standard treatments.\nThe approval was expected after a panel recommended it last month. The drug was already approved in the United States last year.\nHemlibra is among the new medicines that the Basel-based pharmaceuticals maker hopes will offset falling sales of its three biggest drugs, Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin. Some analysts expect peak Hemlibra sales of more than $4 billion a year.\n‍​ Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz, Editing by Michael Shields\n ",
