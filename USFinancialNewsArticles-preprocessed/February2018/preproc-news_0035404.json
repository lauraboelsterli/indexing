    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York today announced that creative duo Amy Ferguson and Julia Neumann have been hired as Executive Creative Directors. Previously at MullenLowe New York, where they led the award-winning JetBlue account since 2015, Ferguson and Neumann will bring their talents to TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York beginning March 1, reporting to agency Chief Creative Officer, Chris Beresford-Hill.\n\"We're at a pivotal point in our creative trajectory with opportunities that we can absolutely turn into great work, and we need leaders like Amy and Julia to push the work and level of craft to make the very most of them,\" said Beresford-Hill.\nFerguson and Neumann were the first hires at MullenLowe New York, where they were brought in to kick-start the office and serve as creative directors on the JetBlue business. They are credited with the airline's hugely successful viral Mother's Day film, \"FlyBabies,\" which was awarded at Cannes Lions, The One Show, The AICP, The Clio Awards, The Effies and took home the inaugural Athena Award at the 3% Conference, as well as JetBlue's Office Souvenirs activation targeting workaholics who never take a vacation. Ferguson and Neumann have both been named to AdAge's list of 'Creatives You Should Know\" as well as Business Insider's \"30 Most Creative Women in Advertising\" list.\nJulia Neumann began her advertising career at Saatchi & Saatchi New York, where she won the agency's very first Cannes Lion for P&G's Tide. She has also had stints at Y&R New York, Wieden+Kennedy in Portland and BBH New York. Among her most notable work is Land Rover's \"Pathological Liar\" and \"4 Year Olds Bucket List,\" as well as the critically acclaimed \"Art Heist for Good\" stunt for WaterIsLife. Neumann has been recognized by every top industry award show, including Cannes Lions, The Clio Awards, D&AD, The Andy Awards, The AICP, The One Show and the Art Directors Club. She's also recently written and directed a short documentary about immigration called Deporting Myself.\nAmy Ferguson returns to TBWA\\Chiat\\Day where she started her career as an intern. She was hired full time as and art director and worked on the Absolut business, helping to create what became the iconic \"In an Absolut World\" campaign. She then moved to Grey New York, where she worked on E-trade and produced a wildly popular and awarded \"Talking Babies\" Super Bowl spot. Ferguson worked as a freelance creative director for several years prior to joining MullenLowe. Freelance afforded her time to work on creative pursuits beyond advertising, including the launch of her own line of greeting cards. She has also served as a juror for several top creative award shows, including Cannes Lions and The One Show.\nIn addition to Ferguson and Neumann, TBWA\\Chiat\\Day NY also announced today that Walt Connelly and Evelyn Neil have been promoted to Executive Creative Directors. Walt Connelly joined the agency as Global Creative Director in 2014, and has been an influential creative leader at the agency ever since, running several key pieces of business, including Travelers Insurance and Thomson Reuters. Evelyn Neil was a freelance Creative Director at TBWA in 2016 before joining the agency full time as Group Creative Director in August 2017 to work on Accenture. She spent the bulk of her career at Wieden+Kennedy in Portland, New York and Amsterdam.\n\"Evelyn and Walt have been leading big business and pushing the work forward, and they belong on a level alongside Amy and Julia, steering the agency's product,\" added Beresford-Hill.\nFrannie Rhodes, who joined the agency in 2016 as Director of Creative Services, has also been elevated to the role of Executive Director of Creative Operations, working in close partnership with Beresford-Hill and the creative leadership team to drive the creative vision and mission of the agency, and execute all aspects of the creative process, including recruiting, sourcing and talent management.\nFor more news from the TBWA network please visit: tbwa.com/news\nAbout TBWA\\Worldwide\nTBWA\\Worldwide ( http://www.tbwa.com ) is a top-ten ranked global advertising collective that holds Disruption® at its core to develop business-changing ideas for brands.
