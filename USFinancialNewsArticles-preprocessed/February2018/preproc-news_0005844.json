    "text": "WATSEKA, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IF Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: IROQ) (the “Company”) the holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”), announced unaudited net loss of $(728,000), or $(0.20) per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The quarter ended December 31, 2017 included an additional $1.3 million income tax expense due to a downward adjustment to our net deferred tax assets (“DTA”) related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act provides for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in the downward adjustment to our DTA. Excluding the $1.3 million impact of the adjustment to the DTA, the Company’s net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, would have been $590,000, or a decrease of $580,000 from the three months ended December 31, 2016. Management believes that presenting net income on a non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of the adjustment to the DTA in the 2017 period provides useful information for evaluating the Company’s operating results and any related trends that may be affecting the Company’s business. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income was $4.4 million compared to $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for loan losses was reduced to a credit of $50,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a credit of $46,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased to $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $5.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense increased to $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $877,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest income decreased to $977,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest expense increased to $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The largest component of this increase in non-interest expense was in other expenses, which increased $486,000, mostly as a result of the accrual of real estate taxes on a large credit in bankruptcy. Provision for income tax increased to $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $691,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company announced unaudited net income of $247,000, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.67 per basic share and $0.66 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2017, was impacted by the DTA adjustment in the second quarter, as discussed above. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income was $8.9 million compared to $9.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for loan losses increased to $358,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, from $33,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Interest and dividend income increased to $11.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, from $10.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense increased to $2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $1.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest income was $2.1 million for both the six months ended December 31, 2017 and the six months ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest expense increased to $8.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $7.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The largest component of this increase was in other expenses, which increased $538,000, mostly as a result of the accrual of real estate taxes on a large credit in foreclosure. Provision for income tax increased to $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $611.5 million compared to $585.5 million at June 30, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $6.7 million at December 31, 2017, from $7.8 million at June 30, 2017. Investment securities increased to $117.0 million at December 31, 2017, from $111.6 million at June 30, 2017. Net loans receivable increased to $458.4 million at December 31, 2017, from $440.3 million at June 30, 2017. Deposits increased to $461.6 million at December 31, 2017, from $439.1 million at June 30, 2017. Total borrowings, including repurchase agreements, increased to $60.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $55.7 million at June 30, 2017. Stockholders’ equity decreased to $83.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $84.0 million at June 30, 2017.\nIF Bancorp, Inc. is the savings and loan holding company for Iroquois Federal Savings and Loan Association (the “Association”).
