    "text": "Accelerated Technologies Holding Corp. Announces Board Appointment and Restructuring\nNEW YORK , Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Accelerated Technologies Holding Corp. ( OTCMarkets.com : ATHC) is a full-service end to end business solution and technology company that specializes in cloud based disruptive technologies. The Company provides consulting and enterprise level technology services. In addition, ATHC is involved in developing its own disruptive technology products in the sectors of artificial social realities, short term alternative funding platforms, electronic payment solutions and Blockchain technologies focused on social engagement, sports, entertainment and content creation.\nAt a Board of Directors meeting, held earlier in 2017, Kevin Kading, Chairman of the Board, appointed Eric Kuvykin as Director and President of ATHC. Also, at a meeting of shareholders of Phantom Fiber Corp. earlier in 2017 the shareholders approved a name change from Phantom Fiber Corp. to Accelerated Technologies Holding Corp. and the execution of a 29 to 1 reverse stock split.\nFollowing the appointment of Mr. Kuvykin, ATHC has engaged a securities attorney to complete and file an S-1 Registration Statement to the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which is expected to be filed during the month of May 2018.\nAdditionally, ATHC began a private placement of $950,000. The note will pay 12% annual interest and offers investors the right to convert the note to common stock at $0.25 per share. In a privately negotiated transaction, ATHC acquired a $2.8 million lien against a real estate property in Nassau County for 500,000 shares of class A common stock.\n“We are very excited about the future of ATHC as we begin to rebrand, acquire assets, enhance developments and expand our joint venture partnerships. We are committed to engage corporate leaders who will advise and navigate the Company through the Blockchain landscape. In 2018 we expect to build a solid foundation for ATHC,\" said Eric Kuvykin, President.\nFor more information visit www.athcorp.com\nStatements made in this letter include certain forward-looking statements, management's objectives, strategies, beliefs and intentions.
