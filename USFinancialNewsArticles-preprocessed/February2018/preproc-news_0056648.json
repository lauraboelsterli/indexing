    "text": "Appointment of Seasoned FinTech and Financial Services Leader Demonstrates Credible’s Commitment to Long-Term Growth\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Credible, the consumer finance marketplace that helps consumers save money and make smarter financial decisions, today announced that it has appointed Chris Bishko as chief financial officer. Mr. Bishko will report to Credible’s founder and CEO Stephen Dash.\nWith over 20 years of experience in technology and financial services as an investor and investment banker, Mr. Bishko joins Credible from Omidyar Technology Ventures, where he was a partner focused on venture investments in financial technology, enterprise software and consumer Internet platforms. Mr. Bishko also brings direct experience in marketplace lending, having served as a board member of Prosper Marketplace since 2013.\nPrior to joining The Omidyar Group, Mr. Bishko worked at JPMorgan as an investment banking client officer for enterprise software companies. He began his career as a private equity investment professional with JPMorgan Capital Corp., where he helped lead more than $450 million of financial services-related investments. Mr. Bishko received a B.S. from Duke University, where he majored in biomedical engineering and English literature.\n“We are proud to have a leader of Chris’ caliber join our team as we enter an exciting stage of growth,” said Stephen Dash, founder and CEO of Credible. “Chris has an impressive track record of helping companies scale, a deep network across the financial technology ecosystem and a shared vision for building long-term value at Credible.”\nMore than 650,000 consumers have used the Credible.com marketplace ( https://www.credible.com/ ) to securely obtain and compare personalized rates, not ballpark estimates, before choosing to move forward with a lender for private student loans or student loan refinancing -- all without impacting their credit or sharing their data. Thousands more have used the company’s marketplace to save on personal loans and find the best credit cards. To date, Credible has helped save borrowers more than $165 million in interest payments.\n“I’m impressed by Credible’s approach to becoming the ‘Expedia for consumer lending,’ where consumers can easily shop for loans across bank and non-bank lenders and receive and accept actual offers within a seamless online marketplace experience,” said Mr. Bishko. “With its impressive team, unique business model, and commitment to making financial services more efficient, convenient and relevant for people, Credible is well positioned to be a leader in the transformation of consumer finance.”\nMr. Bishko joins other recent high-profile appointments at Credible, including Ron Suber as chairman and Alan Gellman as chief marketing officer. The company closed out 2017 with a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\nAbout Credible\nAs a marketplace that empowers consumers to discover financial products and services that are the best fit for their own, unique circumstance, Credible is fiercely independent and committed to delivering fair and unbiased solutions for millennials. Credible’s integrations with lenders and credit bureaus allow consumers to access actual rates through a neutral platform, without sharing their information until they’re ready to proceed with an offer. The Credible.com platform provides an unrivaled customer experience, as reflected by hundreds of positive Trustpilot reviews and a TrustScore of 9.5/10 .
