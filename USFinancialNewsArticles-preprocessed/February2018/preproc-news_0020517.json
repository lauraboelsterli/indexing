    "text": " 03 AM / Updated 31 minutes ago Asset manager Blackrock plans to raise over $10 billion - WSJ Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Blackrock Inc ( BLK.N ) is planning to raise more than $10 billion to buy and hold stakes in companies, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. \nThis is the first attempt by the asset management company to make such direct investments, the WSJ report said, citing sources. \nBlackRock Incâ€™s Investment Institute has said it would take on more risk, particularly in emerging market equities, after the swoon in stock markets earlier this week. \nThe company was not immediately available for comment on the WSJ report.
