Gasoline futures fell sharply, leading the rest of the energy complex lower.\n\"The report was bearish, primarily due to the fairly large crude oil and gasoline inventory builds,\" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 75 cents at $62.26 a barrel, a 1.2 percent decline, as of 10:55 a.m. EST (1555 GMT). Brent crude futures for the most active May contract were down 84 cents at $65.68 a barrel.\nGasoline futures lost 2.2 percent to $1.7636 a gallon. The rise in inventories came even as refineries boosted activity in the most recent week.\n\"In spite of refiners undergoing maintenance, they continue to process more crude compared to previous years adding to gasoline and diesel supply,\" said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.\nSoaring U.S. production kept a lid on oil prices this year, even though the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have reduced output.\nA Reuters survey on Wednesday showed OPEC maintained its supply cuts in February, dropping output to 32.28 million bpd, lowest since April of last year.\n\"Climbing U.S. production continues to weigh on the market as traders fear that the OPEC output cuts will be nullified by the rising U.S. output,\" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.\nU.S. crude production has risen by a fifth since mid-2016 to more than 10 million barrels per day <C-OUT-T-EIA>. Wednesday's release showed weekly production rose again to 10.3 million bpd. More reliable monthly figures are due later in the day, and analysts expect that report to show another large upward revision.\nPrices were pressured earlier after three of the world's top consumers of crude - China, India and Japan - reported a slowdown in monthly factory activity.\nThe U.S. dollar hit a one-month high Wednesday, putting additional pressure on crude. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n(Additional reporting by Scott DiSavino in NEW YORK, Amanda Cooper in LONDON, Aaron Sheldrick in TOKYO and Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE; Editing by Dale Hudson and David Gregorio)",
