    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CoreSite Realty Corporation (NYSE:COR), a premier provider of secure, reliable, high-performance data center and interconnection solutions across the U.S., today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nQuarterly and Subsequent Highlights\nReported fourth-quarter total operating revenues of $125.9 million, representing a 14.0% increase year over year Reported fourth-quarter net income per diluted share of $0.44, consistent with the prior-year level Reported fourth-quarter funds from operations (“FFO”), excluding a one-time non-cash expense related to the original issuance costs associated with CoreSite’s redeemed Preferred Stock, of $1.18 per diluted share and unit, representing 11.3% growth year over year. As reported, FFO per diluted share and unit was $1.09 Executed 128 new and expansion data center leases comprising 41,521 net rentable square feet (NRSF), representing $7.2 million of annualized GAAP rent at an average rate of $174 per square foot Commenced 52,221 NRSF of new and expansion leases representing $8.2 million of annualized GAAP rent at an average rate of $157 per square foot Realized rent growth on signed renewals of 3.5% on a cash basis and 6.2% on a GAAP basis and recorded rental churn of 0.5% in the fourth quarter On January 29, 2018, CoreSite acquired a two-acre land parcel in Chicago, Illinois, on which CoreSite expects to build CH2, a 175,000 square foot turn-key data center building, which should have dark fiber campus connectivity to CoreSite’s existing CH1 facility\n“We finished out the year with solid results, highlighted by fourth-quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FFO growth, before the one-time Preferred Stock redemption charge, of 14%, 13%, and 11%, year over year, respectively,” said Paul Szurek, CoreSite’s Chief Executive Officer. “Organic growth was driven primarily by the continued expansion of existing customers across the portfolio and also by new logo growth as we continue to attract valuable deployments to our facilities, driving interactions and interconnections among our customers. When looking at 2017 in its entirety, we executed well on our strategic priorities and took important steps to grow our differentiated scalable and flexible campus strategy in key markets, including Santa Clara, Northern Virginia, Los Angeles, and most recently, Chicago.”\nFinancial Results\nCoreSite reported net income attributable to common shares of $14.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $14.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net income per diluted share declined 4.3% on a sequential-quarter basis, due to a one-time non-cash expense related to the original issuance costs associated with CoreSite’s redeemed Preferred Stock.\nCoreSite reported FFO per diluted share and unit, excluding the aforementioned one-time non-cash expense related to the original issuance costs associated with CoreSite’s redeemed Preferred Stock, of $1.18 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11.3% compared to $1.06 per diluted share and unit for the three months ended December 31, 2016. FFO per diluted share and unit, adjusted for the non-cash expense, increased 7.3% on a sequential-quarter basis. FFO per diluted share and unit, as reported, was $1.09 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 2.8% year over year. On a sequential-quarter basis, FFO, as reported, declined 0.9%, again reflecting the one-time non-cash expense related to CoreSite’s redeemed Preferred Stock.\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $125.9 million, a 14.0% increase year over year and an increase of 2.3% on a sequential-quarter basis.\nSales Activity\nCoreSite executed 128 new and expansion data center leases representing $7.2 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, comprised of 41,521 NRSF at a weighted-average GAAP rental rate of $174 per NRSF. Leasing to smaller deployments rebounded during the fourth quarter, with annualized GAAP rent signed for leases less than 5,000 square feet increasing 5.2% compared to the trailing twelve-month average.\nCoreSite’s fourth-quarter data center lease commencements totaled 52,221 NRSF at a weighted average GAAP rental rate of $157 per NRSF, which represents $8.2 million of annualized GAAP rent.\nCoreSite’s renewal leases signed in the fourth quarter totaled $11.2 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 78,577 NRSF at a weighted-average GAAP rental rate of $142 per NRSF, reflecting a 3.5% increase in rent on a cash basis and a 6.2% increase on a GAAP basis. The fourth-quarter rental churn rate was 0.5%.\nDevelopment and Acquisition Activity\nDuring the fourth quarter, CoreSite placed into service 13,735 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at BO1 in Boston and 3,087 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at VA1 in Reston, Virginia.\nOn January 29, 2018, CoreSite acquired a two-acre land parcel located in downtown Chicago, Illinois, with a total real estate cost of $4.5 million. CoreSite expects to build CH2, a 175,000 square foot turn-key data center building, on the acquired land parcel, upon the receipt of necessary entitlements. The facility is located in close proximity to CoreSite’s existing CH1 facility and network node and CoreSite expects to achieve campus interconnectivity with diverse, high-count dark fiber between CH1 and CH2.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2017, CoreSite had a total of 220,336 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction and had spent $98.5 million of the estimated $213.6 million required to complete the projects, which consisted of the following.\nReston – CoreSite had 24,922 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at VA3 (Phase 1A). As of December 31, 2017, CoreSite had incurred $16.5 million of the estimated $22.3 million required to complete this phase of the project, and expects to complete development late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2018. During the fourth quarter, CoreSite also had 49,837 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at VA3 (Phase 1B), inclusive of 9,837 square feet of the infrastructure building to support this phase of the data center campus. As of the end of the fourth quarter, CoreSite had incurred $27.4 million of the estimated $100.2 million required to complete VA3 Phase 1B and the infrastructure building, and expects to complete development in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nLos Angeles – CoreSite had 47,338 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at LA2, which capacity was 78.6% pre-leased. As of December 31, 2017, CoreSite had incurred $43.6 million of the estimated $45.2 million required to complete the expansion and expects to complete construction in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, CoreSite had an incremental 39,925 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at LA2. As of the end of the fourth quarter, CoreSite had spent $6.2 million of the estimated $15.0 million required to complete this expansion and expects to complete construction in the first quarter of 2018. In conjunction with the build-out of the fourth floor at LA2, during the fourth quarter CoreSite spent $8.6 million in recurring capital expenditures to substantially complete a chiller plant replacement and upgrade project at LA2. The project is expected to result in improved energy efficiency and reduced maintenance capital requirements.\nWashington, D.C. – CoreSite had 24,563 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at DC2. As of the end of the fourth quarter, CoreSite had spent $4.4 million of the estimated $17.4 million required to complete the project, and expects to complete development in the third quarter of 2018.\nDenver – CoreSite had 15,630 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at DE1. CoreSite expects to spend $7.5 million to complete this expansion and expects to complete construction in the third quarter of 2018.\nNew York – CoreSite commenced construction on 18,121 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at NY2, and expects to spend $6.0 million to complete this expansion in the third quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, CoreSite had net principal debt outstanding of $939.3 million, correlating to 3.4 times fourth-quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA.\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter, CoreSite had $180.9 million of total liquidity consisting of available cash and capacity on its revolving credit facility.\nOn December 12, 2017, CoreSite redeemed all 4,600,000 shares of its 7.25% Series A cumulative redeemable Preferred Stock for $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends in an amount equal to $0.292014 per share, for a total payment of $25.292014 per share.\nDividend\nOn December 7, 2017, CoreSite announced a dividend of $0.98 per share of common stock and common stock equivalents for the fourth quarter of 2017. The $0.98 per share quarterly dividend represents a $0.08, or 8.9%, increase over the prior quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share that was established in May 2017, and a $0.18, or 22.5%, increase over the dividend rate set in December 2016.\nThe fourth-quarter dividend was paid on January 16, 2018, to shareholders of record on December 29, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nCoreSite is introducing its 2018 guidance of net income attributable to common shares in the range of $2.15 to $2.27 per diluted share. In addition, the company’s guidance of FFO per diluted share and unit is a range of $4.92 to $5.04, with the difference between net income and FFO being real estate depreciation and amortization.\nCoreSite’s 2018 guidance of FFO per diluted share reflects the company’s adoption of two new accounting standards – revenue recognition and lease accounting, which are cumulatively expected to reduce FFO per diluted share by approximately $0.06 per share. Absent these accounting changes, CoreSite’s 2018 guidance midpoint would reflect 11.5% year-over-year growth.\nThis outlook is based on current economic conditions, internal assumptions about CoreSite’s customer base, and the supply and demand dynamics of the markets in which CoreSite operates. The guidance does not include the impact of any future financing, investment or disposition activities, beyond what has already been disclosed.\nUpcoming Conferences and Events\nCoreSite will participate in Citi’s 2018 Global Property CEO Conference on March 5-6, 2018, at The Diplomat Resort & Spa in Hollywood, Florida.\nConference Call Details\nCoreSite will host a conference call on February 8, 2018, at 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time (10:00 a.m., Mountain Time), to discuss its financial results, current business trends and market conditions.\nThe call will be accessible by dialing +1-877-407-3982 (domestic) or +1-201-493-6780 (international).

We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and undepreciated land and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO attributable to common shares and units represents FFO less preferred stock dividends declared during the period.\nOur management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nWe offer this measure because we recognize that FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. FFO is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a measure of liquidity, an alternative to net income, cash provided by operating activities or any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. In addition, our calculations of FFO are not necessarily comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us. Investors in our securities should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income.\nReconciliations of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA): (in thousands) Three Months Ended Year Months Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 27,008 $ 24,288 $ 23,161 $ 100,491 $ 81,921 Adjustments: Interest expense 6,635 6,447 4,698 24,147 12,577 Income taxes 24 64 74 174 119 Depreciation and amortization 32,629 32,077 30,674 129,251 108,652 EBITDA $ 66,296 $ 62,876 $ 58,607 $ 254,063 $ 203,269 Non-cash compensation 2,401 2,374 2,018 8,946 8,892 Transaction costs / litigation 58 — — 197 187 Adjusted EBITDA $ 68,755 $ 65,250 $ 60,625 $ 263,206 $ 212,348 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by adding our non-cash compensation expense, transaction costs from unsuccessful deals and business combinations and litigation expense as well as adjusting for the impact of impairment charges, gains or losses from sales of property and undepreciated land and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as indicators of our ability to incur and service debt. In addition, we consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be appropriate supplemental measures of our performance because they eliminate depreciation and interest, which permits investors to view income from operations without the impact of non-cash depreciation or the cost of debt. However, because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and taxes, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utilization as a cash flow measurement is limited.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005647/en/\nCoreSite Realty Corporation\nGreer Aviv\n+1 303-405-1012\n+1 303-222-7276\nVice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\nGreer.Aviv@CoreSite.com\nSource: CoreSite Realty Corporation",
