S. Steel's results, President and Chief Executive Officer David B. Burritt said, \"We finished the year with three solid quarters as investments in our assets helped to provide more stable operating performance, and results for all three of our reportable segments were in line with our expectations. We made good progress on our asset revitalization program in 2017, achieved the quality and reliability improvements we committed to for 2017, and are confident that we will achieve our 2018 improvement objectives.\"\nWe continued to strengthen our balance sheet, with net debt decreasing by over $300 million in 2017 to approximately $1.150 billion. Our total liquidity increased by over $400 million in 2017 and ended the year at approximately $3.350 billion. The improving strength of our balance sheet and total liquidity supports the continued implementation of our asset revitalization program in our Flat-Rolled segment, as well as increasing investment in our Tubular and European businesses.\n2018 Outlook\nCommenting on U. S. Steel’s outlook for 2018, Burritt said, \"Our focus in 2018 remains on improving the fundamental drivers of our business: safety, quality, delivery and cost and we expect the performance momentum from 2017 to continue. We will continue to provide our employees with the support and resources they need to succeed. When our employees succeed, our customers succeed. When our customers succeed, U. S. Steel succeeds.\"\nIf market conditions remain at their January 24, 2018 levels, we expect 2018 net earnings of approximately $685 million, or $3.88 per diluted share, and EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion.\nWe believe market conditions, which include spot prices, raw material costs, customer demand, import volumes, supply chain inventories, rig counts and energy prices, will change, and as changes occur during the balance of 2018, we expect these changes to be reflected in our net earnings and EBITDA.\nPlease refer to the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this document for the reconciliation of Outlook net earnings to consolidated Outlook EBITDA.\nUNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION PRELIMINARY SUPPLEMENTAL STATISTICS (Unaudited) Quarter Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 OPERATING STATISTICS Average realized price: (a) Flat-Rolled ($/net ton) 717 692 726 666 U.

We believe that EBITDA, considered along with net earnings (loss), is a relevant indicator of trends relating to our operating performance and provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We believe net debt is a useful measure in calculating enterprise value. Both EBITDA and net debt are used by analysts to refine and improve the accuracy of their financial models that utilize enterprise value.\nAdjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per diluted share are non-GAAP measures that exclude the effects of gains (losses) associated with our retained interest in U. S. Steel Canada Inc., gains (losses) on the sale of ownership interests in equity investees, restructuring charges, impairment charges, significant temporary idling charges, debt extinguishment and other related costs and effects of tax reform that are not part of the Company's core operations. Adjusted EBITDA is also a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of gains (losses) associated with our retained interest in U. S. Steel Canada Inc., gains (losses) on the sale of ownership interests in equity investees, restructuring charges, impairment charges and significant temporary idling charges. We present adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted net earnings (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance and established trends affecting our core operations, by excluding the effects of gains (losses) associated with our retained interest in U. S. Steel Canada Inc., gains (losses) on the sale of ownership interests in equity investees, restructuring charges, impairment charges, significant temporary idling charges, debt extinguishment and other related costs and effects of tax reform that can obscure underlying trends. U. S. Steel's management considers adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted net earnings (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA as alternative measures of operating performance and not alternative measures of the Company's liquidity. U. S. Steel’s management considers adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted net earnings (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA useful to investors by facilitating a comparison of our operating performance to the operating performance of our competitors. Additionally, the presentation of adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted net earnings (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA provides insight into management’s view and assessment of the Company’s ongoing operating performance, because management does not consider the adjusting items when evaluating the Company’s financial performance or in preparing the Company’s annual financial Outlook. Adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted net earnings (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net earnings (loss), earnings (loss) per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A consolidated statement of operations (unaudited), consolidated cash flow statement (unaudited), condensed consolidated balance sheet (unaudited) and preliminary supplemental statistics (unaudited) for U. S. Steel are attached.\nThe Company will conduct a conference call on fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings on Thursday, February 1, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard. To listen to the webcast of the conference call, visit the U. S. Steel website, www.ussteel.com , and click on the “Investors” section. For more information on U. S. Steel, visit our website.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release contains information that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend the forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in those sections. Generally, we have identified such forward-looking statements by using the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “target,” “forecast,” “aim,” “should,” “will” and similar expressions or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, operating performance, trends, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and earnings per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the Company’s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. It is possible that the Company’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the time made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our Company's historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
