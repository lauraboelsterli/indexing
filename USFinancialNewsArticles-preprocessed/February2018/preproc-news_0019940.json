    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 7:50 PM / in 38 minutes Issue identified with Pratt & Whitney GTF engines for Airbus's A320neo Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - An issue has been identified on some recently delivered Pratt & Whitney ( UTX.N ) GTF engines for European planemaker Airbus’s ( AIR.PA ) A320neo aircraft, the two companies said on Friday \nPratt & Whitney said the problem related to the knife edge seal in the High Pressure Compressor (HPC) aft hub on the PW1100G-JM engine powering the A320neo. \nAirbus said it had informed affected A320neo customers and operators, adding there are currently 113 Pratt & Whitney-powered A320neo aircraft flying with 18 customers. \nPratt & Whitney said in a statement the issue affected a “a limited subpopulation of engines,” without elaborating. \nAirbus said the two companies were assessing the situation and the European Aviation Safety Agency had published an Emergency Airworthiness Directive. Such a directive is issued when an unsafe condition exists that requires immediate action by an aircraft’s owner or operator. Reporting by Alan Charlish; Editing by Mark Potter",
