(NYSE:ARES) announced today that Myles Gilbert, former Managing Director at Cambridge Associates LLC and Co-Chairman of its Credit Investment Committee, has joined the firm as Partner, Head of Investor Strategy & Solutions. In this newly formed position, he will oversee a team of professionals within the Ares Strategy & Relationship Management Group. He is charged with supporting new product development, coordinating cross-platform mandates and overseeing consultant strategy.\nMike Arougheti, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and President, said: “There has been a notable uptick in the number of large investors looking to develop significant strategic mandates across our platform – which I believe speaks to both the increasing awareness of the performance and breadth of Ares’ investment strategies as well as a continuing theme for investors to forge more meaningful partnerships with selected managers of scale. I am excited to welcome Myles to the firm and believe he will be critical in how we identify, structure and coordinate such partnerships.”\nRyan Berry, Partner, Chief Marketing & Strategy Officer and Head of Ares’ Strategy & Relationship Management Group, said: “In a short period of time, Myles is already making a big impact at Ares. His marketplace insights, structuring expertise and overall vision on how we can develop differentiated solutions are making him a critical thought leader and asset to our relationship managers, business heads and product management teams. Myles will play a major role in helping us deepen and broaden our direct institutional and consultant relationships.”\n“It’s a privilege to join Ares and take on this exciting new role,” said Mr. Gilbert, Partner, Head of Investor Strategy & Solutions. “I had the opportunity to work with top global investment management firms in my previous position. I believe Ares is a market leader in alternative asset classes such as credit, real estate and private equity and is well-positioned to offer institutional investors compelling products and solutions across its broad platform. I’m looking forward to contributing to the growth of those strategies.”\nMr. Gilbert brings more than 33 years of experience in financial services, most recently having served as a Managing Director at Cambridge Associates LLC and Co-Chairman of its Credit Investment Committee. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of alternative manager research and investment strategies for institutional clients in a broad range of sectors including leveraged finance, structured credit and distressed securities. Previously, he served as a Managing Partner at Ironside Capital Group and as a Managing Director at private investment affiliates of Manulife Financial Corporation. He also served as a corporate banking executive at Citizens Financial Group, including four years as President and Chief Executive Officer of its asset finance and leasing company.\nAbout Ares Management, L.P.\nAres Management, L.P. is a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager with approximately $106 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2017 and more than 15 offices in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia.
