    "text": "SANTIAGO, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The board of Chile’s Bci bank , the third largest private financial institution in the country, said on Tuesday it will propose a $575 million equity issuance in its next shareholders meeting.\nIn a letter to Chile’s market regulator, Bci did not detail what the additional funds would be used for. The proposal comes after a string of acquisitions last December, including the purchases of Totalbank for $528 million and the financial business of Walmart in Chile for $148 million.\nReporting by Antonio de la Jara; Writing by Cassandra Garrison\n ",
