    "text": "Spencer Dinwiddie scored 27 points, Dâ€˜Angelo Russell added 22 and the Brooklyn Nets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 116-108 Wednesday night at Barclays Center.\nJarrett Allen contributed a career-high-tying 16 points while DeMarre Carroll added 15 and Allen Crabbe had 14, as the Nets snapped a four-game losing streak.\nIt was the first time all season that Dinwiddie and Russell scored at least 20 points in the same game.\nJoel Embiid had 29 points and 14 rebounds while Ben Simmons scored 24 points for the 76ers. JJ Redick returned from a seven-game absence with a leg injury to contribute 20 points.\nDario Saric also had 12, but the Sixers finished 1-3 on their four-game road trip. They dropped their last three games at Oklahoma City, Milwaukee and Brooklyn. Philadelphia fell back to .500 with the loss.\nThe Nets took a 91-88 lead into the fourth quarter.\nDinwiddie hit a 3-pointer from the baseline to cap a 9-0 run for a 100-92 advantage with 7:46 remaining. Jahlil Okafor then knocked down a runner in the lane against his former team for an 11-0 spurt and a 102-92 lead.\nA pair of free throws by Dinwiddie -- he made a career-best 13 -- extended the Brooklyn lead to 107-96 with 5:43 left.\nEmbiid forced his way to the basket and converted a tough layup to get the Sixers within 111-105 with 3:05 left. Another drive by Embiid cut the lead to 111-107.\nThe Nets hit some clutch free throws down the stretch to secure the victory.\nPerhaps disappointed by not being selected as a reserve for the NBA All-Star Game, Simmons was terrific in the first half with 18 points on 9-of-11 shooting.\nEmbiid also scored 14 points, the 53rd straight game he has scored in double figures.\nAfter holding a 34-30 lead after the first, the Sixers still managed to hold on for a 65-64 lead at halftime.\nRussell led the way for the Nets with 17 points in the first half.\nThe Nets knocked down 8 of 16 shots from beyond the arc to stay within one point.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
