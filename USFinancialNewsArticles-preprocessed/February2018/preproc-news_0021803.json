    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After posting its 28th consecutive year of revenue growth, independent Chicago-based creative and technology agency Schafer Condon Carter (SCC) has announced a reorganization of its senior management team. The changes, effective immediately, are being implemented to manage the agency’s growth as a creative AOR and an integrated cloud marketing and e-commerce technology provider.\nTim Condon\nGail Carter\nDavid Selby\n“SCC has come of age. And while we’re still a feisty, scrappy group––and always will be––now is the time for us to organize around the significant growth opportunities we see in the market,” said SCC Co-Founder Tim Condon, who becomes Executive Chairman and Chief Culture Officer. “It’s important that our structure places the right executives in the right roles to lead our organization, match up with our clients across senior management and deliver the full value of our organization. Fortunately, we have a seasoned and talented executive team that works exceptionally well together and is ready to take our offering to the next level.”\nThe moves include David Selby being promoted from Managing Partner, President, to Chief Executive Officer. Selby, recipient of the AAF Silver Medal award in 2015, has been with SCC for nine years following senior positions at Leo Burnett and on the client side over the course of his 39-year career.\nGail Carter, who joined SCC in 1995, has been promoted to President and Chief Client Leadership Officer. In addition to growing SCC’s client leadership team, Carter will be heading up SCC’s training and continuing professional education programming.\nJohn Anthony has been promoted to Chief Digital Officer and will continue managing SCC’s digital transformation capabilities in enterprise-level cloud marketing deployment, and the agency’s technology partnerships.\nOther appointments include the promotion of Suzanne Martineau to the new role of Chief Human Insights Officer from Executive Creative Director; Mike Grossman to Chief Integration Officer, expanding his role from Managing Partner of SCCprism, the agency’s integrated PR, Influencer and Social Media practice; Gwen Friedow to Chief Strategy Officer from Executive Director, Brand Planning; Denny Hebson to Executive Creative Director with full responsibility for SCC’s creative product; SCC’s Chief Operating Officer Greg Wenstrup will continue in his role overseeing Finance, HR, and all agency operations.\nABOUT SCHAFER CONDON CARTER\nSchafer Condon Carter (SCC) is an independent creative and technology company that delivers transformative brand and business ideas to drive results for its clients.
