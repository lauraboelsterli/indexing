    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Docker today announced that Betsy Atkins, CEO and founder of Baja Corporation, has been appointed to Docker’s Board of Directors. Atkins brings to Docker significant entrepreneurial and operational experience in building and managing global enterprise businesses across the energy and software industries through digital transformations. As a member of Docker’s Board, Atkins will provide strategic guidance on scaling Docker’s container platform business to support enterprises worldwide with their modernization initiatives.\nDocker is the world’s leading software company for building, securing and managing applications on its enterprise-ready container platform, Docker Enterprise Edition (EE). Customers using Docker EE realize more than a 50 percent reduction in IT spend, while also leveraging the Docker platform to build and manage a new generation of applications and services.\nCommenting on the appointment, Docker Chairman & CEO, Steve Singh, said: “Enterprises are turning to the Docker platform to be the foundation for key business initiatives across hybrid cloud, app modernization and microservices. In welcoming Betsy to the Docker Board, we gain a seasoned entrepreneur that has piloted companies through all stages of growth, resulting in highly-profitable and scalable businesses. Her operational expertise and knowledge of diverse industries will help us build an enduring business and drive the adoption of Docker’s platform globally.”\nDocker is helping hundreds of Global 10K companies, including ADP, MetLife and Visa to modernize their legacy applications, optimize infrastructure and embark on a path for creating next-generation microservices. These organizations all take advantage of Docker’s Modernize Traditional Applications (MTA) program, an initiative designed to meet the strong demand from enterprise customers that want to seamlessly containerize legacy applications; making them more secure, more efficient and portable across all infrastructure - all without touching the source code.\n“Docker is disrupting the IT industry with a container strategy that breathes life into legacy software, lays the foundation for new apps and provides organizations a path to future innovation,” said Betsy Atkins, CEO and founder of Baja Corporation. “I look forward to collaborating with Steve and other members of the board on go-to-market strategies and end-to-end business processes that will drive and support the adoption of Docker’s platform globally.”\nAtkins has extensive experience in building highly-profitable businesses, leading companies through both successful exits and initial public offerings. Previously, Atkins held the role of CEO at Clear Standards, Inc., acquired by SAP, and was a co-founder at Ascend Communications, acquired by Lucent for $23 billion. Atkins also serves on the board for Cognizant, HD Supply, Volvo Cars and the SAP Advisory Board, as well as other public companies.\nAdditional Resources\nRead more about Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) Try Docker EE for free and view subscription plans Learn more about Modernizing Traditional Apps on Docker Watch Docker’s Kubernetes Announcement at DockerCon Europe 2017\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208005418/en/\nfor Docker\nGabe Taylor\npress@docker.com\nSource: Docker",
