There were no reinsurance benefits used for 2016 catastrophe losses. 2017 catastrophe losses were primarily due to wildfires in Northern and Southern California that occurred in the fourth quarter, severe rainstorms in California that occurred in the first quarter, and the impact of Hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Georgia that occurred in the third quarter. 2016 catastrophe losses were primarily due to severe storms outside of California and rainstorms in California.\n(4)\nThe Company experienced unfavorable development of approximately $36 million and $16 million on prior accident years' loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and unfavorable development of approximately $54 million and $85 million on prior accident years' loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The unfavorable development in 2017 was primarily attributable to higher than estimated California automobile and property losses, while the unfavorable development in 2016 was primarily attributable to the California and Florida automobile lines of business.\nInvestment Results\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(000's except average annual yield)\nAverage invested assets at cost (1)\n$\n3,637,256\n$\n3,482,249\n$\n3,582,122\n$\n3,390,769\nNet investment income (2)\nBefore income taxes\n$\n30,872\n$\n30,431\n$\n124,930\n$\n121,871\nAfter income taxes\n$\n26,862\n$\n26,775\n$\n109,243\n$\n107,140\nAverage annual yield on investments - after income taxes (2)\n3.0\n%\n3.1\n%\n3.1\n%\n3.2\n%\n(1)\nFixed maturities and short-term bonds at amortized cost; equities and other short-term investments at cost. Average invested assets at cost are based on the monthly amortized cost of the invested assets for each period.\n(2)\nAverage annual yield on investments after income taxes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased slightly compared to the corresponding periods in 2016, largely due to the maturity and replacement of higher yielding investments purchased when market interest rates were higher, with lower yielding investments purchased during low interest rate environments. The higher net investment income before and after income taxes resulted from higher average invested assets.\nImpact of Fourth Quarter Catastrophe Losses and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company incurred a total of approximately $109 million in losses, before reinsurance benefits, resulting from two catastrophe events, consisting of the Northern California wildfires with approximately $84 million in losses and the Southern California wildfires with approximately $25 million in losses. The impact of these catastrophe losses on the Company's results of operations was significantly mitigated due to the Company's newly expanded Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty (the \"Treaty\") that became effective July 1, 2017. The total combined loss from these wildfires, net of reinsurance, totaled $20 million, which is the Company's total retention on the two catastrophe events, $10 million each. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $12 million in ceded reinstatement premiums written for reinsurance benefits used up under the Treaty following these wildfires. $3 million of the reinsurance premiums ceded were earned in the fourth quarter and the remaining $9 million will be earned pro-rata during the first six months of 2018.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Act\"), enacted into law on December 22, 2017 and effective for tax years beginning on January 1, 2018, the Company made certain tax adjustments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Adjustments were made to reflect the Company's deferred tax balances at December 31, 2017 that were computed at the new corporate rate of 21%, rather than the pre-enactment rate of 35%. Additional adjustments were made to account for the impact of the Act on the realizability of the Company's tax credit carryforwards and tax balances at December 31, 2017. These adjustments resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $7.4 million ($0.13 per share), which is reflected in both Net Income and Operating Income of the Company for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These income tax effects of the Act are provisional amounts based on the reasonable estimates of the Company's tax obligations using the latest information available, and are subject to changes as additional information becomes available.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6250 per share. The dividend will be paid on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nMercury General Corporation and its subsidiaries are a multiple line insurance organization offering predominantly personal automobile and homeowners insurance through a network of independent producers in many states.

These measures are not intended to replace, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial results.\nNet income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income. Operating income is net income excluding realized investment gains and losses, net of tax. Operating income is used by management along with the other components of net income to assess the Company's performance. Management uses operating income as an important measure to evaluate the results of the Company's insurance business. Management believes that operating income provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's ongoing performance as it reveals trends in the Company's insurance business that may be obscured by the effect of net realized investment gains and losses. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, operating income highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the Company's core insurance business. Operating income, which is provided as supplemental information and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of net income to operating income.\nNet premiums earned , the most directly comparable GAAP measure to net premiums written, represents the portion of premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the periods presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies. Net premiums written is a statutory financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance. Net premiums written is designed to determine production levels and is meant as supplemental information and not intended to replace net premiums earned. Such information should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of net premiums earned to net premiums written.\nIncurred losses and loss adjustment expenses is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses excludes the effects of changes in the loss reserve accounts. Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses is provided as supplemental information and is not intended to replace incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nCombined ratio is the most directly comparable measure to combined ratio-accident period basis. Combined ratio-accident period basis is computed as the difference between two GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio and prior accident periods' loss development ratio. Management believes that combined ratio-accident period basis is useful to investors and it is used to reveal the trends in the Company's results of operations that may be obscured by development on prior accident periods' loss reserves. Combined ratio-accident period basis is meant as supplemental information and is not intended to replace the GAAP combined ratio. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See \"Supplemental Schedules\" above for a reconciliation of GAAP combined ratio to combined ratio-accident period basis.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mercury-general-corporation-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2017-results-and-declares-quarterly-dividend-300592974.html\nSOURCE Mercury General Corporation",
