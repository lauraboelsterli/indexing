    "text": "EL DORADO, Ark., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Murphy USA Inc. (NYSE:MUSA), a leading marketer of retail motor fuel products and convenience merchandise, today announced preliminary financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nKey Highlights:\nNet income was $124.8 million, or $3.58 per diluted share, in Q4 2017 compared to net income of $43.8 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, in Q4 2016. The fourth quarter included an estimated deferred tax benefit of $89 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which increased net income. For the full year, net income was $245.3 million, or $6.78 per diluted share, compared to 2016 net income of $221.5 million, or $5.59 per diluted share.\nTotal fuel contribution (retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale (\"PS&W\") results including RINs) for Q4 2017 was 16.5 cpg compared to 15.4 cpg in Q4 2016. For the full year, total fuel contribution was 16.4 cpg compared to 15.4 cpg in 2016.\nTotal retail gallons declined 2.6% to 1.0 billion gallons for the network during Q4 2017 while volumes on an average per store month (\"APSM\") basis declined 5.9% versus prior year quarter. For the full year, total retail gallons declined 1.3% to 4.1 billion gallons, while APSM volumes were down 5.3%.\nMerchandise contribution dollars grew 8.1% during the quarter to $97.0 million on average unit margins of 16.3%, which was a new quarterly record and up 100 basis points from 15.3% in Q4 of 2016. For the full year, merchandise contribution dollars were up 4.7% on average unit margins of 16.1%, a full year record and a 50 basis point increase versus 2016.\nDuring the quarter, 23 new stores opened, in addition to 4 raze-and-rebuild locations. For the full year, 45 new stores were opened, in addition to 21 raze-and-rebuild locations. Our year-end store count is 1,446.\nCommon shares repurchased during the fourth quarter were approximately 712 thousand for $54 million at an average price of $76 per share. Full year 2017 common shares repurchased totaled 3.0 million shares for $206 million at an average price of $69 per share.\n\"We are extremely pleased with the company’s performance in 2017,\" said President and CEO Andrew Clyde. \"The business was resilient against continued headwinds, challenging macroeconomic conditions, and especially in the first quarter, regulatory uncertainty that resulted in a change to our guidance early in the year. However, our focused strategy and operating discipline generated full-year results that were within the original guidance range for Adjusted EBITDA and well above our guidance for net income thanks to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will provide continued tangible benefits into 2018.” Clyde concluded, \"Although challenges and regulatory uncertainty persist, Murphy USA has repeatedly proven its resilience to external factors and its ability to add value to its business. We enter 2018 with an attractive free cash flow profile to continue executing our balanced capital allocation strategy to create long-term shareholder value.\"\nConsolidated Results\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, Key Operating Metrics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income ($ Millions) $ 124.8 $ 43.8 $ 245.3 $ 221.5 Earnings per share (diluted) $ 3.58 $ 1.14 $ 6.78 $ 5.59 Adjusted EBITDA ($ Millions) $ 99.0 $ 103.2 $ 405.9 $ 400.1 Net income and earnings per share in Q4 2017 were above prior year levels due primarily to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. This tax law change resulted in the existing net deferred tax liabilities being revalued to lower corporate tax rates for future periods and generated an estimated benefit to income tax expense of $88.9 million in Q4 2017. The estimate is based on currently available information and is a non-cash benefit. Adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter was slightly lower than the prior year quarter primarily because of increased charitable donations of $10 million in SG&A expense that were accelerated into December 2017 in advance of lower future corporate tax rates as part of a tax planning strategy. Net income and earnings per share in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 reflect $56.0 million of after-tax gains from the sale of the CAM pipeline system recorded in the first quarter of 2016.\nFuel\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, Key Operating Metrics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total fuel contribution ($ Millions) $ 171.9 $ 164.2 $ 677.7 $ 647.2 Total fuel contribution (including retail, PS&W and RINs) (cpg) 16.5 15.4 16.4 15.4 Total retail fuel contribution ($ Millions) $ 143.9 $ 112.7 $ 581.0 $ 485.8 Retail fuel volume - chain (Million gal) 1,039.3 1,066.5 4,140.9 4,195.2 Retail fuel volume - per site (K gal APSM) 242.1 257.3 245.3 259.1 Retail fuel margin (cpg excl credit card fees) 13.8 10.6 14.0 11.6 PS&W including RINs contribution (cpg) 2.7 4.8 2.4 3.8 Total fuel contribution dollars increased 4.7% in Q4 2017 due primarily to a 27.7% increase in retail margin dollars, partially offset by lower contribution from PS&W including RINs. For the full year, total fuel contribution dollars also increased 4.7%. APSM volumes declined 5.9% quarter-over-quarter to 242,106, primarily due to continued competitive pressures and to a lesser extent, the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The contribution from PS&W including RINs continues to deliver in the guided range of 2 cpg to 3 cpg.\nMerchandise\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, Key Operating Metrics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total merchandise contribution ($ Millions) $ 97.1 $ 89.8 $ 381.2 $ 364.1 Total merchandise sales ($ Millions) $ 595.6 $ 588.4 $ 2,372.7 $ 2,338.6 Total merchandise sales ($K APSM) $ 138.7 $ 141.9 $ 140.5 $ 144.4 Merchandise unit margin (%) 16.3 % 15.3 % 16.1 % 15.6 % Tobacco contribution ($K APSM) $ 13.6 $ 13.1 $ 13.3 $ 13.3 Non-tobacco contribution ($K APSM) $ 9.0 $ 8.6 $ 9.3 $ 9.2 Total merchandise contribution ($K APSM) $ 22.6 $ 21.7 $ 22.6 $ 22.5 Merchandise performance was strong in the fourth quarter with total merchandise contribution dollars increasing 8.1% at 16.3% margins, a new quarterly record, driven by growth in both the tobacco and non-tobacco categories. For the full year, total merchandise contribution dollars were up 4.7%, at 16.1% unit margins, which was a new annual record.\nOther areas\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, Key Operating Metrics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total station and other operating expense ($ Millions) $ 130.3 $ 123.4 $ 514.9 $ 493.3 Station OPEX excl credit card fees ($K APSM) $ 20.6 $ 20.6 $ 20.8 $ 21.4 Total SG&A cost ($ Millions) $ 40.0 $ 28.1 $ 141.2 $ 122.7 Total station and other operating expenses increased $6.9 million for the quarter, reflecting new store additions and slightly higher payment fees due to 12% higher retail fuel prices. However, on a per store basis, operating expenses excluding payment fees were essentially flat. SG&A was higher for the quarter due primarily to accelerated charitable donations of $10 million that were made as part of a tax planning strategy. For the full year, operating expenses excluding credit card fees declined 2.6% on an APSM basis, driven by lower employee related expense.\nStation Openings\nMurphy USA opened 23 retail locations in Q4 2017, in addition to 4 raze-and-rebuild locations, bringing the year end store count to 1,446, consisting of 1,158 Murphy USA sites and 288 Murphy Express sites. For the full year, we opened 45 new stores and completed 21 raze-and-rebuilds.\nFinancial Resources\nAs of December 31, Key Metrics 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents ($ Millions) $ 170.0 $ 153.8 Long-term debt ($ Millions) $ 860.9 $ 629.6\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, Key Metrics 2017 2016 2017 2016 Average shares outstanding (diluted)\n(in thousands) 34,898 38,297 36,156 39,646 Cash balances on December 31, 2017 totaled $170.0 million. Long-term debt consisted of approximately $494 million in carrying value of 6% senior notes due in 2023, $295 million in carrying value of 5.625% senior notes due in 2027 and $92 million of term debt less $20 million of current maturities, which is reflected in current liabilities. Remaining undrawn borrowing capacity under the ABL was $258 million as of December 31, 2017.\nCommon shares repurchased during the current quarter were approximately 712 thousand for $54.0 million. The company completed its previously announced $500 million share repurchase plan during Q4 2017. We remain committed to an ongoing program of share repurchases. In the past, our Board of Directors has typically allocated capital for this purpose at a rate of up to $50 to $100 million per quarter, depending on upcoming liquidity needs and other relevant factors. The amount purchased in any given quarter fluctuates, as we may execute the entire allocation or only a portion, depending on market and other considerations. We expect to continue to conduct share repurchases under quarterly allocations in line with our past practice; however, depending on market conditions and other factors, only a portion may be executed. In addition, there may be certain quarters in which no allocation is made due to competing capital or other business priorities. At December 31, 2017, the Company had common shares outstanding of 34,091,534.\n2017 Guidance Update and 2018 Guidance Ranges\n2018 Guidance 2017 Updated\nGuidance Range 2017 Actual\nResults 2018 Guidance\nRange Organic Growth New Stores 45 to 50 45 Up to 30 Raze and Rebuilds 15 to 20 21 Up to 25 Fuel Contribution Total fuel contribution ($ Millions) N/A $678 $575 to $700 Annual retail volume (Billion gallons) 4.3 to 4.5 4.1 4.1 to 4.3 Retail fuel volume per store\n(K gallons APSM) 255 to 265 245.3 235 to 245 Total fuel contribution (cpg) 12.5 to 15 16.4 14 to 16.5 Fuel Breakeven Merchandise contribution ($ Millions) $380 to $390 $381 $390 to $400 Total merchandise sales ($ Millions) $2,400 to $2,450 $2,373 $2,400 to $2,450 Retail station OPEX excluding credit cards (APSM % YOY change) Flat to -2% (2.6 )% Flat to +2% Corporate Costs SG&A ($ Millions per year) $135 to $140 $141 $135 to $140 Effective Tax Rate N/A (2.2 )% 24% to 26% Capital Allocation Capital expenditures ($ Millions) $250 to $300 $274 $225 to $275 Net income ($ Millions) $90 to $160 $245 $155 to $195 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n($ Millions) $340 to $410 $406 $390 to $440 Management's annual guidance for 2018 reflects the Company's economic and market environment assessment, business improvement initiatives and potential headwinds. Key 2018 guidance ranges include the following assumptions and are subject to the uncertainties noted below:\nOrganic Growth:\nNew store additions and raze-and-rebuild sites reflect a disciplined capital approach to the highest return opportunities\nFuel Contribution:\nTotal fuel contribution guidance reflects a potentially wide range of outcomes given historical volatility in margins Total network fuel volumes are expected to be flat or higher, as the impact from new site additions could be offset by lower per store volumes, and reflect a variety of market scenarios around competitive dynamics Fuel margin guidance of 14 to 16.5 cpg reflects management expectations for the combined results of our retail business and PS&W business, including RIN income\nFuel Breakeven:\nMerchandise contribution represents a range of outcomes based on management's expectations around higher merchandise sales and margin rates bracketing 2017 actuals Store operating expense per site, before credit card fees, are expected to be flat to slightly higher\nCorp Costs:\nSG&A costs reflect investments in IT related enhancements and other corporate projects, subject to timing and allocation of resources The effective tax rate in 2018 is expected to be in a range of 24% to 26%\nCapital Allocation:\nCapital expenditures reflect new store growth, raze-and-rebuild activity, store maintenance and improvements, land acquisition, and continued implementation of various corporate infrastructure projects The Net Income range presented above is subject to additional uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ meaningfully from forecast results, including without limitation (1) the unpredictability of special tax items, changes in profitability mix to states with or without income tax and timing of settlement of outstanding tax matters; (2) the timing of new store development or amount of capital expended to develop these stores; and (3) the existence and/or timing of raze-and-rebuild activity Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA ranges provided reflect the impact of the above guidance components as adjusted for management's expected interactions across the components\nEarnings Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call on February 1, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central time to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results. The conference call number is 1 (844) 613-1037 and the conference number is 5467727.

EBITDA means net income (loss) plus net interest expense, plus income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA adds back (i) other non-cash items (e.g., impairment of properties and accretion of asset retirement obligations) and (ii) other items that management does not consider to be meaningful in assessing our operating performance (e.g., (income) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of assets and other non-operating expense (income)). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures that are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA in our operational and financial decision-making, believing that the measure is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by many of our investors, research analysts, investment bankers, and lenders to assess our operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it allows understanding of a key measure that we evaluate internally when making operating and strategic decisions, preparing our annual plan, and evaluating our overall performance. However, non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP disclosures, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be prepared differently by us than by other companies using similarly titled non-GAAP measures.\nThe reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, (Thousands of dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 124,840 $ 43,817 $ 245,264 $ 221,492 Income tax expense (benefit) (73,631 ) 23,015 (5,242 ) 130,539 Interest expense, net of interest income 12,314 9,820 45,351 39,126 Depreciation and amortization 33,452 25,863 116,966 98,610 EBITDA $ 96,975 $ 102,515 $ 402,339 $ 489,767 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 450 414 1,785 1,650 (Gain) loss on sale of assets 524 428 3,950 (88,212 ) Other nonoperating (income) expense 1,089 (114 ) (2,180 ) (3,080 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 99,038 $ 103,243 $ 405,894 $ 400,125 2018 Full Year Guidance - GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2018 is as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) Fiscal Year 2018 Net Income $155 to $195 Mid-point Income taxes $58 Interest expense, net of interest income $46 Depreciation and amortization $133 Other operating and nonoperating expenses, net $3 Adjusted EBITDA $390 to $440 For purposes of this reconciliation, the midpoint of a range for each reconciling item was used, and therefore actual results for each of these reconciling items is expected to be higher or lower than the amounts shown above. The size of the ranges varies based on the individual reconciling item and the assumptions made.\nSource:Murphy USA Inc.",
