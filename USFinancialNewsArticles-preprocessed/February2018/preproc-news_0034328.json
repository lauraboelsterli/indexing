    "text": "Feb 13 (Reuters) - Under Armour Inc on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ estimates, as it sold more footwear and apparel through its own stores and online.\nThe company reported fourth-quarter loss of $87.9 million, or 20 cents per Class C share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $103.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier, as it incured a one-time charge due to changes in the U.S. tax code.\nNet revenue rose to $1.37 billion from $1.31 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $1.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
