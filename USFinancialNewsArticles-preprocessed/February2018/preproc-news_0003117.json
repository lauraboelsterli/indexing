Rising yields have pummeled the stock market through this week, despite strong corporate earnings report.\nA report showed weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell, pointing to a tight labor market and strong economy.\nHowever, nonfarm productivity fell 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, which was the first drop since the first quarter of 2016 and unit labor costs rose 2.0 percent in the final three months of 2017. Higher labor costs could signal faster inflation than is currently anticipated.\nAt 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 91.9 points, or 0.35 percent, at 26,057.49, the S&P 500 was down 2.26 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,821.55.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 10.55 points, or 0.14 percent, at 7,400.93.\nSix of the 11 major S&P indexes were higher, with the telecommunications index’s 2.02 percent rise leading the advancers.\nStrong fourth-quarter reports from S&P 500 companies so far have pushed up analysts’ profit growth estimate to 13.7 percent, from 12 percent at the start of the month\nShares of Facebook rose 2.3 percent after the company forecast rising ad sales despite a dip in usage on the social media network.\nBut not all earnings reports from marquee companies impressed.\nUPS dropped 6.2 percent after the world’s largest package delivery company reported a fourth-quarter net profit that was hurt by additional costs.\nFedEx fell 0.8 percent. The two rivals are often seen as an indicator of U.S. economic activity and consumer spending.\nEBay jumped 13.2 percent after posting higher revenue. But PayPal fell 7.8 percent after former parent eBay said it planned to move to a new primary payment processor.\nIndustry heavyweights Apple, Alphabet and Amazon are due to report results after the bell.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,565 to 1,011. On the Nasdaq, 1,578 issues fell and 788 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 22 new highs and 23 new lows.
