The increase reflects continued production optimization, the leveraging of fixed infrastructure costs on increased production volume, the introduction of higher margin sparkling water makers, partially offset by a higher portion of sparkling water makers in the product mix. The positive FX impact on revenue was partially offset by an adverse impact of the weakening of the U.S. Dollar/Israeli Shekel exchange rate compared to the same period in 2016. The net positive FX impact on gross profit was approximately $3.9 million.\nSales and marketing expenses were $44.7 million, or 28.3% of revenue, compared to $39.0 million, or 29.6% of revenue, in the same period in 2016. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by $4.6 million to $22.6 million, or 14.3% of revenue, compared to $18.0 million, or 13.7% of revenue, in the same period in 2016. Sales team, distribution and logistics expenses were $22.1 million, or 14.0% of revenue, compared to $21.0 million, or 15.9% of revenue, in the same period in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $3.4 million to $14.5 million, or 9.2% of revenue, compared to $11.1 million, or 8.5% of revenue, in the same period in 2016.\nOperating income increased 36.4% to $25.7 million, or 16.3% of revenue, compared to $18.8 million, or 14.3% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Changes in FX positively impacted operating income by approximately $1.3 million. The positive FX impact on gross profit compared to the same period in 2016 was mainly offset by an adverse impact on operating expenses from the strengthening of the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate.\nNet financial income was $1.4 million compared to net financial expense of $0.8 million in the same period in 2016.\nTax expense was $1.5 million with an effective tax rate of 5.7%, compared to $2.4 million with an effective tax rate of 13.2% in the same period in 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to agreements with tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which had an immaterial impact on the Company's tax results.\nNet income was $25.5 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, based on 22.7 million weighted shares outstanding compared to net income of $15.6 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, based on 22.0 million weighted shares outstanding in the same period in 2016.\nBalance Sheet Review\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and financial investments totaling $155.2 million compared to $57.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nCash flow from operations less investing activities, excluding financial investments, was $14.3 million compared to $11.6 million in the same period in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company invested $50.0 million in short-term investments.\nWorking capital increased 6.0% to $132.3 million compared to $124.8 million at December 31, 2016. Inventories increased 10.3% to $97.1 million compared to $88.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nFull year 2017 financial review\nGeographical Revenue Breakdown\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nIncrease\nIncrease\nIn millions USD\n%\nWestern Europe\n$\n286.5\n$\n325.3\n$\n38.8\n13.5\n%\nThe Americas\n114.8\n127.4\n12.6\n11.0\n%\nAsia-Pacific\n49.6\n61.9\n12.3\n24.8\n%\nCentral & Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa\n25.2\n28.8\n3.6\n14.3\n%\nTotal\n$\n476.1\n$\n543.4\n$\n67.3\n14.1\n%\nProduct Segment Revenue Breakdown\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIn millions USD\n%\nSparkling Water Maker Starter Kits\n$\n170.8\n$\n212.3\n$\n41.5\n24.3\n%\nConsumables\n297.0\n323.5\n26.5\n8.9\n%\nOther\n8.3\n7.6\n(0.7)\n(7.7)\n%\nTotal\n$\n476.1\n$\n543.4\n$\n67.3\n14.1\n%\nProduct Segment Unit Breakdown\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIncrease\n(decrease)\nIn thousands\n%\nSparkling Water Maker Starter Kits\n2,941\n3,657\n716\n24.3\n%\nCO2 Refills\n29,407\n32,518\n3,111\n10.6\n%\nFlavors\n21,957\n20,289\n(1,668)\n(7.6)\n%\nRevenue increased 14.1% to $543.4 million from $476.1 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was driven by growth in all geographical regions, primarily Germany, Canada, Australia and Japan. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates (\"FX\") positively impacted revenue by approximately $7.6 million, mainly driven by the strengthening of the Euro/U.S. Dollar exchange rate.\nGross margin increased 180 basis points to 53.3% compared to 51.5% in the same period in the prior year. The increase reflects continued production optimization, the leveraging of fixed infrastructure costs on increased production volume and the introduction of higher margin sparkling water makers, partially offset by a higher portion of sparkling water makers in the product mix and changes in FX compared to the same period in 2016.\nChanges in FX negatively impacted gross profit by $1.2 million, mainly driven by the strengthening of the Israeli Shekel against the U.S. Dollar compared to the same period in 2016.\nSales and marketing expenses were $159.2 million, or 29.3% of revenue, compared to $144.7 million, or 30.4% of revenue, in the same period in 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was mainly due to higher advertising and promotion expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by $11.8 million to $76.7 million, or 14.1% of revenue, compared to $64.9 million, or 13.6% of revenue, in the same period in 2016. Sales team, distribution and logistics expenses were $82.5 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $79.8 million and 16.8% of revenue, in the same period in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $49.1 million, or 9.0% of revenue, compared to $43.5 million, or 9.1% of revenue in 2016.\nOperating income increased 49.4% to $81.4 million, or 15.0% of revenue, compared to $54.5 million, or 11.4% of revenue in the same period in 2016. Changes in FX negatively impacted operating income by approximately $4.0 million. In addition to the net negative FX impact on gross profit in the amount of $1.2 million, there was a negative impact due to the strengthening of the Euro/U.S. Dollar rate and its effect on operating expenses compared to the same period in 2016.\nNet financial income was $1.4 million compared to net financial expense of $2.1 million in the same period in 2016.\nTax expense was $8.3 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 10.1%, compared to $7.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 15.1%, in the same period in 2016.\nNet income was $74.4 million, or $3.29 per diluted share, based on 22.6 million weighted shares outstanding, compared to net income of $44.5 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, based on 21.5 million weighted shares outstanding in the same period in 2016.\nGuidance\nFor 2018, the Company currently expects full year revenue to increase approximately 12% over 2017 revenue of $543.4 million, of which approximately 2% is expected to result from the acquisition of the Company's French distributor.\nOperating income for 2018 is currently expected to increase approximately 10% over 2017 operating income of $81.4 million, or approximately 20% excluding the increase in share-based payment expense in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDiluted earnings per share is currently expected to increase approximately 5% over 2017 diluted earnings per share of $3.29, or approximately 15%, excluding the increase in share-based payment expense in 2018 compared to 2017.\nFor 2018, the Company currently projects share-based payment expense to increase approximately $9 million over 2017 due to new employee options and restricted stock units expected to be granted by the Company during the first half of 2018. The increase is being driven by the number of new grants and the higher average share price compared with the previous year. Based on IFRS guidelines, close to 60% of the cost associated with new grants of options and restricted stock units is required to be expensed in the first year following the grant date.\nConference Call and Management Commentary\nA supplemental slide presentation has been furnished as part of today's report of a foreign private issuer on a Form 6-K and will be posted on the Company's website at http://sodastream.investorroom.com .\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 AM Eastern Standard Time (U.S. time) today (Wednesday, February 14, 2018) to review the Company's financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure, which is calculated in the same way as EBITDA, and further eliminates the effect of impairment of other intangible assets. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as described above, should be considered in evaluating the Company's operations. Both measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting financial expenses (income), net), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates) and the age and depreciation charges and amortization of fixed and intangible assets, respectively (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense, respectively). Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes unusual costs associated with non-recurring events and without regard to non-cash items.\nNon-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for the IFRS results. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, the most closely comparable IFRS measure, is included at the end of this press release. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this press release, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
