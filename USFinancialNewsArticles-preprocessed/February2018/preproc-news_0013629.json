    "text": "The White House chief of staff said \"dreamers\" would not be a priority for deportation, even if their Obama-era protections expire and a deadlocked Congress hasn't completed a deal to protect them.\nJohn Kelly told reporters at the Capitol that as long as an immigrant in the U.S. illegally has no criminal record, they are likely to stay \"out of anyone's scope\" for a long time. He says, \"They are not a priority for deportation.\"\nKelly says he believes President Donald Trump wouldn't extend protections for \"dreamers\" beyond March 5 because he doesn't think the president has the legal authority to prolong it.\nHe also says Trump won't ask Congress for a short-term extension of that program. Kelly said of lawmakers: \"What makes them act is pressure.\"",
