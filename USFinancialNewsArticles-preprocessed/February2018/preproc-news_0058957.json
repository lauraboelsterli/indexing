    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HFF, Inc. (NYSE:HF) (the Company or HFF) reported today its financial and production volume results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Based on transaction volume, HFF is one of the leading and largest full-service commercial real estate financial intermediaries, providing commercial real estate and capital markets services to both the consumers and providers of capital in the commercial real estate sector.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nRevenue was $185.3 million, a 19.0% increase year-over-year. Net income was $34.2 million, as compared to $27.5 million in the prior year period. Net income per diluted share grew 21.4% to $0.85, as compared to $0.70 in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA improved 24.7% to $59.5 million versus $47.8 million in the prior year period.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nRevenue was $609.5 million, a 17.8% increase over prior year. Net income was $95.0 million, as compared to $77.2 million in the prior year period. Net income per diluted share increased 20.1% to $2.39, as compared to $1.99 during the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 22.4% to $163.5 million compared to $133.6 million in the prior year period.\n“We are pleased with the Company’s fourth quarter and full year of 2017. We believe the combination of our unique partnership culture, the synergies and diversification afforded by our capital markets centric business model, our strong balance sheet, and the strategic investments we continue to make enable us to add value and provide best in class services to our clients while positioning the Company for future growth,” said Mark Gibson, chief executive officer of HFF.\nBased on the Company’s performance in 2017 and considerable liquidity position, the board of directors declared a special cash dividend on January 26, 2018 of $1.75 per share, or $67.5 million. Since 2012, the Company has returned approximately $388.2 million, or $10.27 per share, to shareholders in the form of special cash dividends.\nResults for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company’s revenues were $185.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which represents an increase of $29.6 million, or 19.0% compared to revenue of $155.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company generated operating income of $40.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.3 million, or 9.0% when compared to operating income of $37.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase in operating income is primarily due to the 19.0% increase in revenues which were partially offset by (i) increases in the Company’s compensation-related costs and other expenses associated with the net growth in headcount of 91 associates during the last twelve months, including the start-up of the Company’s London office, (ii) an increase in non-cash stock compensation and (iii) increases in other operating expenses due to the growth in transactional activity and the increase in headcount.\nInterest and other income, net, grew 124.8% to $21.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily a result of higher income from the valuation of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights and other agency-related income.\nThe Company reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $34.2 million, an increase of approximately $6.8 million, or 24.7%, when compared to net income of $27.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017 net income per diluted share was $0.85 compared to $0.70 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure whose reconciliation to net income can be found within this release) for the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 24.7% to $59.5 million, compared to $47.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to the increases in operating income and other income. The Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 32.1%, a 140 basis point increase compared to the Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nResults for the Full Year of 2017\nThe Company’s revenue increased 17.8% to $609.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to revenues of $517.4 million for 2016. The Company generated operating income of $105.3 million during 2017, an increase of $9.6 million, or 10.0% when compared to operating income of $95.8 million for 2016. This increase in operating income is primarily due to the 17.8% increase in revenues which was partially offset by (i) increases in the Company’s compensation-related costs and expenses associated with the net growth in headcount of 91 associates during the year, including the start-up of the London office, (ii) an increase in non-cash stock compensation and (iii) increases in other operating expenses due to the growth in transactional activity and the increase in headcount.\nInterest and other income, net, totaled $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $23.7 million, or 70.6%, when compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily a result of higher income from the valuation of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights and other agency-related income.\nThe Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $95.0 million, an increase of approximately $17.8 million, or 23.0%, when compared to net income of $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income per diluted share was $2.39, or a 20.1% increase when compared to $1.99 in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $163.5 million, a 22.4% increase when compared to $133.6 million in the comparable period in 2016. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA is attributable to the increases in operating income as well as increases in other income. The Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 26.8%, a 100 basis point increase, compared to the Adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.8% in the comparable period in 2016.\nImpact of Tax Reform Act\nThe fourth quarter and full year 2017 include the effect of the reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). The reduction in U.S. corporate tax rates resulted in adjustments related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and a related remeasurement of the payable under the tax receivable agreement which decreased net income by $3.1 million for both the quarter and full year 2017. Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was negatively impacted by $0.08 per share as a result of the adjustments due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act.\nHFF, Inc.

The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in its business operations to, among other things, evaluate the performance of its business, develop budgets and measure its performance against those budgets. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate its overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The Company finds Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes, including the Company’s tax receivable agreement. Note that the Company classifies the interest expense on its warehouse lines of credit as an operating expense and, accordingly, it is not eliminated from net income in determining Adjusted EBITDA. Some of the items that the Company has eliminated from net income in determining Adjusted EBITDA are significant to the Company’s business. For example, (i) interest expense is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and ability to generate revenue because it incurs interest expense related to any outstanding indebtedness, (ii) payment of income taxes is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and (iii) depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of the Company’s costs.\nAny measure that eliminates components of the Company’s capital structure and costs associated with the Company’s operations has material limitations as a performance measure. In light of the foregoing limitations, the Company does not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also considers its GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of consolidated net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Company is calculated as follows: (dollars in thousands) For the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Full Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 34,239 $ 27,453 $ 94,960 $ 77,195 Add: Interest expense 4 9 21 42 Income tax expense 66,175 19,140 106,768 51,036 Depreciation and amortization 4,739 3,209 17,001 11,834 Stock-based compensation (a) 4,336 3,369 17,385 12,310 Valuation of mortgage servicing rights (11,226 ) (5,428 ) (33,455 ) (19,892 ) Decrease (increase) in payable under the tax\nreceivable agreement\n(38,733 ) - (39,212 ) 1,025 Adjusted EBITDA $ 59,534 $ 47,752 $ 163,468 $ 133,550 (a) Amounts do not reflect expense associated with the stock component of estimated incentive payouts under the Company’s firm profit participation plan, office profit participation plans and executive bonus plan that are anticipated to be paid in respect of the applicable year. Such expense is recorded as incentive compensation expense within personnel expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income during the year to which the expense relates. Following the award, if any, of the related incentive payout, the stock component expense is reclassified as stock compensation costs within personnel expenses.
