    "text": "0 COMMENTS Gothamist is being resuscitated nearly four months after it was abruptly shuttered by its owner, billionaire TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. \nThe assets of Gothamist, DCist and LAist were purchased by a group of three public radio stations in a joint deal, the organizations announced Friday. Two anonymous donors helped finance the purchase, though financial terms weren’t disclosed.\nDNAinfo, a network of hyperlocal news sites that had been part of the same company, isn’t being relaunched as part of the acquisition.\nIn stories and statements posted to their websites, public radio stations WNYC in New York, KPCC in Los Angeles, and WAMU in Washington, D.C., each pledged to revive Gothamist, LAist and DCist, respectively. The sites had covered culture, arts and other happenings in their communities for years.\nThe news was first reported by Wired .\nThe purchase represents an abrupt reversal of fortune for the websites, which were shut down in November by Mr. Ricketts, who cited financial reasons. But the sudden decision also raised questions among employees, some of whom had voted to unionize only a week earlier. \nJohn Chao, the chief operating officer for New York Public Radio, said the public radio station plans to fund Gothamist through a combination of sponsorship, events and membership.\n“The reason that we’re excited is because nonprofit media is the place that’s still investing in local journalism in ways that are sustainable,” Mr. Chao said.\nMr. Chao declined to identify the anonymous donors but said their contributions were made through grants. Without going into details of the transaction, he said each public radio station had some “skin in the game.”\nThe news is a rare bright spot for local media, which has struggled in recent years with the erosion of print revenue and the rise of platforms like Google and Facebook , which have captured an ever-larger share of local digital advertising. \nGothamist, founded in 2003 with a focus on arts and culture, had been purchased by DNAinfo and Mr. Ricketts earlier in 2017, only months before he shut it down.\nWNYC has hired the co-founders of Gothamist, Jake Dobkin and Jen Chung, to help it prepare to relaunch the site later this year, Mr. Chao said. WNYC, which already has a website, plans to run Gothamist as a complementary digital property.\n“We’re going to figure this out step-by-step,” said Jim Schachter, vice president for news for WNYC. “At the outset, Gothamist will relaunch in the form that Gothamist readers are used to as WNYC.org continues along in the same way that it has.”\nWNYC has no plans to resurrect DNAinfo, which was a worthy but unsustainable business, said Mr. Chao. The archives of the site will be preserved and continue to be accessible.\nDNAinfo was founded in 2009 and focused on hyperlocal coverage of neighborhoods in the cities where it operated.",
