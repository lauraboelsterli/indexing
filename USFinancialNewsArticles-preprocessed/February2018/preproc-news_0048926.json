    "text": "0 COMMENTS Almost by definition, ordinary investors have few ways to play in the private investing world. One avenue does exist—so-called business development companies. But wariness is warranted.\nIf the private-capital world consists of funds making illiquid, long-term investments out of view of public markets, business-development companies are a kind of hybrid. They raise equity in public markets, borrow more cash, then make loans and take stakes in small and midsize companies that are often deemed too risky by banks.\nTHE RISE OF PRIVATE INVESTING The column is part five of a Heard on the Street series on the explosion in demand for private assets.\nPart 1: Why Private Equity Risks Tripping on Its Own Success Part 2: Does Private Equity Really Beat the Stock Market? Part 3: The New Wizards of Wall Street Part 4: A Mountain of New Debt The companies frequently provide financing for private-equity deals, and some are in fact run by major private-equity firms. For instance KKR & Co. struck a deal in December to replace Blackstone Group as the investment manager of business-development company FS Investment Corp. FSIC -1.00%\nThe attraction for investors is a high dividend yield. But delivering that has gotten harder because there is a huge supply of funds chasing limited opportunities . Competition with other private lenders and bank-originated leveraged loans has driven business-development companies to accept lower rates, higher leverage on the part of borrowers, and weak covenants, says Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Ryan Lynch.\nThe big difference between private lenders and publicly traded business-development companies is that investors can weigh in on the shares, essentially judging their lending practices in real time. Lately they have been pessimistic, sending the Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index, which tracks 42 companies, down by 16% over the past year, compared with an 18% rise for the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, which tracks more traditional lenders.\nThe big worry seems to be a turn in the default cycle. After peaking in 2016 during the energy-market crunch, default rates have fallen, though credit problems are showing up at funds that specialize in so-called lower middle market companies with annual adjusted earnings of around $20 million or less. This includes Alcentra Capital Corp. ABDC -1.00% and Capitala Finance Corp. CPTA -1.49% , with stressed loans of 13.7% and 16% of total respectively in the third quarter, according to KBW. By contrast, at FS Investment Corp. the stressed ratio was just 2.2%.\nThe decline in business-development company shares over the past year shows investors have started to price in some of this risk. The question is, have these gotten cheap enough to overcome the risks? Probably not.\nAt current prices, investors might be tempted by the high yields on offer. The Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index currently yields 10.1%. But credit losses could well keep creeping up. Interest rates are on the rise, and indebted companies can no longer deduct as much of the payments from their U.S. taxes. If the economy loses steam and the credit cycle turns, these types of funds, less diversified than banks and more exposed to riskier companies, will likely feel more pain sooner.\nAnd on another valuation metric, the shares are still hardly screaming bargains—business-development companies are trading at an average of around 0.9 times book value, according to KBW, compared with an average of around 1 times book value over the past five years. That isn’t much of a discount. There is no reason yet for ordinary investors to wade back in.\nWrite to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com",
