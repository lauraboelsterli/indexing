    "text": "Quarterly Revenue Increased 11 Percent over Prior Year Period Full Year 2017 Produced Record Revenue and Backlog Driven by Memory and Specialty Device Markets\nWILMINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: RTEC), a leading provider of semiconductor process control systems, lithography equipment, as well as process control and yield management software for wafer fabs and advanced packaging facilities, today announced financial results for the 2017 fourth quarter.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Highlights\nFourth quarter revenue of $60.1 million, an increase of 11 percent over the 2016 fourth quarter. Orders exceed $100 million in the fourth quarter, including $21 million from two memory customers. Gross margins strengthen to 54 percent. Shipment of JetStep ® S lithography tool to major IDM for pre-production panel fan out packages.\n2017 Year-End Highlights\nThird consecutive record sales year posted for the first time in Company history. GAAP net income was $32.9 million, or $1.02 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $38.9 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, resulting in all-time record non-GAAP earnings. Expanded our positions in high growth markets: Advanced Packaging and Memory. Three new JetStep ® S lithography system customers for panel fan out packaging in 2017. Sales doubled in 2017 for MetaPULSE ® metrology tools to memory customers for hard mask measurements. Received second JetStep ® system order for AMOLED display lithography.\nKey Financial Data for the Quarters Ended December 31, 2017,\nSeptember 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nUS GAAP December 2017 September 2017 December 2016 Revenue $ 60,081 $ 66,920 $ 54,076 Gross profit margin 53.5 % 52.5 % 51.5 % Operating income $ 11,391 $ 25,517 $ 6,339 Net income (loss) $ (804 ) $ 17,369 $ 6,126 Net income (loss) per diluted share $ (0.03 ) $ 0.54 $ 0.19 US NON-GAAP December 2017 September 2017 December 2016 Revenue $ 60,081 $ 66,920 $ 54,076 Gross profit margin 53.6 % 52.6 % 51.6 % Operating income $ 13,059 $ 15,566 $ 9,078 Net income $ 9,437 $ 10,627 $ 6,644 Net income per diluted share $ 0.29 $ 0.33 $ 0.21 Michael Plisinski, chief executive officer, commented, “The fourth quarter capped another year of balanced double digit growth for Rudolph. In the quarter, we continued to build on our foundation for growth adding new customers and applications for our new products and adding an additional panel fan out customer in advanced packaging. Closing the quarter with record backlog spanning multiple markets is providing Rudolph with unusual clarity for the year ahead.”\nMr. Plisinski concluded, “Strong global markets driven by a variety of factors including continued demand for advanced servers for growing cloud and AI applications, continued demand for sensors and advanced computing for autonomous driving and mobile applications is setting up 2018 to be another year of broad based growth for Rudolph.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 GAAP Financial Results\nFourth quarter revenue totaled $60.1 million, a decrease of 10 percent compared with $66.9 million for the third quarter of 2017 and an 11 percent increase compared with $54.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter gross margin improved to 53.5 percent of revenues, compared to 52.5 percent in the third quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $20.7 million, compared to $9.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expense was primarily due to a $13.0 million gain from a litigation settlement in the third quarter, which reduced overall operating expenses. Excluding the gain, operating expenses decreased by $1.9 million primarily due to the timing of research and development projects and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was ($0.8) million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income of $17.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in GAAP net income was primarily due to the after tax impact of the $13.0 million litigation settlement gain recorded in the third quarter, which increased the third quarter net income. Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter change were non-cash discrete tax charges of $9.5 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act “Tax Reform” passed by the U.S. Congress, as discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net income was $6.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.\nFourth Quarter Non-GAAP Financial Results\nFourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income was $9.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share and exceeded the Company’s guidance. Non-GAAP results excluded certain items, as detailed in the attached table. Third quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income was $10.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income was $6.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and marketable securities increased $18.0 million over the previous quarter to $177.4 million and cash provided by operating activities was $21.6 million for the fourth quarter. Accounts receivable decreased slightly in the quarter to $65.3 million and inventory increased slightly to $67.5 million. Working capital increased in the quarter and ended at $279.8 million.\nOutlook\nThe Company is currently anticipating revenue to be in a range of $64 million to $74 million. The Company is also expecting diluted GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.45 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.50. Due to the enactment of tax reform, the Company currently expects its effective tax rate to be in the range of 19 percent to 22 percent.\nConference Call\nRudolph Technologies will discuss its 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results and other matters on a conference call it is hosting today at 4:30 PM EST.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing the Company’s financial results to assess operational performance. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Further, the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics that the Company uses in making operating decisions and because the Company believes that investors and analysts use them to help assess the health of its business and for comparison to other companies. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding the Company’s operating results. The non-GAAP information should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nThe financial statements provided with this release include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to those measures reported in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial measures, used in this press release, reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nShare-based compensation expense. These expenses relate to employee restricted stock units and employee stock options. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because such expenses are non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nAmortization of intangibles. The Company incurs expenses for the amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. The Company excludes these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Company’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company’s core business.\nPatent litigation fees and income. The Company, from time to time, may incur charges or benefits that are outside of the ordinary course of the Company’s business related to litigation. The Company believes it is useful to exclude such charges or benefits because it does not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operation of the Company’s business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the matter.\nGain on sale of building. The Company received this benefit from the sale of one of its assets. The Company believes it is useful to exclude such benefit because it does not consider such amount to be part of the ongoing operation of the Company’s business and because of the singular nature of the matter.\nNet tax provision (benefit) adjustments. This line item represents the income tax effects of the non-GAAP items.\nTax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act impacted the Company’s 2017 results primarily due to (i) a one-time non-cash tax expense estimated at $8 million, reflecting the revaluation of its net deferred tax asset using a U.S. federal tax rate of 21%, (ii) a one-time transition tax estimated at $1.5 million on its unremitted foreign earnings and profits, which are offset by utilized foreign tax credits estimated at $1.6 million and (iii) a valuation allowance associated with any remaining foreign tax credits of $1.5 million, which may not be utilized in future periods. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform during the measurement period.\nAbout Rudolph Technologies\nRudolph Technologies, Inc. is a leader in the design, development, manufacture and support of defect inspection, lithography, process control metrology, and process control software used by semiconductor and advanced packaging device manufacturers worldwide.
