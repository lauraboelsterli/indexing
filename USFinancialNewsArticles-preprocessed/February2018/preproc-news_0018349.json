    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DCR Workforce (DCR), an innovative provider of workforce solutions including services procurement solutions technology, announces two appointments to key positions.\nDaniel Weinfurter has been named Chief Growth Officer, positioning both Sales and Marketing groups together under one leader to leverage relationships and expertise to serve our prospective and current clients' needs. \"DCR is in growth mode, and I'm excited to join the team,\" Weinfurter said. \"As the tide shifts toward a nearly equal split between employees and outsourced workers in organizations, there's a great need for companies to invest in a Vendor Management System to gain insight into all types of non-employee labor. DCR has an exceptional, best-in-class technology and team to help clients manage that process on a global basis.\"\nDan is known for developing and assembling the vision, strategy, people and execution necessary to build high-performing growth businesses. As a serial entrepreneur, he founded and was CEO of GrowthPlay as well as two other private equity-backed companies and was number-two executive at a third, all of which achieved high rankings on the Inc. 500 fastest growing private companies list. He landed Parson Group, his first start-up, on the #1 spot. His early career was at General Electric, hired into the company upon graduation from college. His thought leadership pieces have frequently been featured in Harvard Business Review, Forbes and Inc. Magazine. He's also author of \"Second Stage Entrepreneurship\", an Adjunct Lecturer at Kellogg School of Management and served as board member on various private equity-backed and not-for-profit businesses.\nAdditionally, Dennis Kanegaye has been named EVP Implementation - Delivery & Customer Success, which will provide continuity from Sales to Implementation to Enterprise Solutions, ensuring \"Customer Delight\" â€“ one of DCR's key values. \"Based on Smart Track's comprehensive functionality, extensive configurability and elegant approach for managing SOW projects, DCR is poised to take the VMS market by storm,\" Kanegaye said. \"I'm thrilled and excited to be part of the executive team.\"\nDennis is a proven executive with diversified experience in the professional services, talent acquisition and technology industries. Previous positions include president of business-to-business operations at MBO Partners, president of Guidant Group and SVP role at Parson Group. As a student of \"emergent leadership\", he is a hands-on leader with success developing and growing high-performing teams, setting actionable yet fluid strategies as well as ensuring successful execution and outcomes.\n\"As the demand for an innovative Vendor Management System such as Smart Track swells to keep pace with an increasing number of contingent workers, the growth trajectory at DCR is exponential,\" said Ammu Warrier, President. \"We're excited to welcome these gentlemen to the team as we focus on streamlining our internal processes now to continue to provide the best customer experience in the industry from first point of contact through the entire lifecycle relationship.\"\nAbout DCR Workforce\nDCR is a leading provider of contingent workforce management and services procurement solutions.
