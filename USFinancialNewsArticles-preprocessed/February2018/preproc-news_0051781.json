Our U.S. public finance, international infrastructure and structured finance new business operations combined to produce more annual PVP than in any year since 2010.\"\nTax Reform\nThe Company recognized a provisional tax expense of $61 million attributable to the estimated effect of tax reform under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). This charge includes the net impact of the deemed repatriation of all previously untaxed unremitted earnings of controlled foreign corporations of $24 million, as well as the permanent write down of various tax attributes and other net deferred tax assets of $37 million for the reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Excluding the write down of tax attributes of non-GAAP adjustments, the estimated effect of tax reform on non-GAAP operating income was $35 million. (Please see “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release).\nFourth Quarter Results\nGAAP Financial Information\nNet income for fourth quarter 2017 was $52 million, compared with net income of $197 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 (fourth quarter 2016). The decrease was primarily attributable to lower fair value gains, lower net earned premiums due mainly to lower refundings and terminations, the provisional tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act, offset in part, by lower loss and loss adjustment expenses (LAE).\nLoss and LAE were $34 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $112 million in fourth quarter 2016. The expense in fourth quarter 2017 was due mainly to the increase in loss reserves on Puerto Rico exposures, partially offset by a gain on the settlement of a breach of representations and warranties (R&W) claim. The expense in fourth quarter 2016 was primarily related to an increase in Puerto Rico loss reserves and a reduction in excess spread on certain first-lien United States (U.S.) residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) exposures, which were partially offset by a benefit due to an increase in discount rates.\nFair value gains on credit derivatives were $5 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $74 million in fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 fair value gains were generated primarily by the run-off of credit derivative par and price improvements on the underlying collateral, while fourth quarter 2016 also included a gain resulting from the termination of several credit derivative transactions. Except for credit impairment, the fair value adjustments on credit derivatives in the insured portfolio are non-economic adjustments that reverse to zero over the remaining term of that portfolio. Fair value gains on financial guaranty variable interest entities (FG VIEs) and committed capital securities (CCS) were also lower in fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited) (in millions)\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 178 $ 236 Net investment income 96 117 Net realized investment gains (losses) (14 ) (24 ) Net change in fair value of credit derivatives: Realized gains (losses) and other settlements (29 ) (18 ) Net unrealized gains (losses) 34 92 Net change in fair value of credit derivatives 5 74 Fair value gains (losses) on CCS\n2 50 Fair value gains (losses) on FG VIEs\n5 27 Other income (loss) 9 (10 ) Total revenues 281 470 Expenses: Loss and LAE 34 112 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 6 5 Interest expense 24 25 Other operating expenses 61 57 Total expenses 125 199 Income (loss) before income taxes 156 271 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 104 74 Net income (loss) $ 52 $ 197 Economic Loss Development\nThe economic development in fourth quarter 2017 was $15 million. The development was primarily related to Puerto Rico exposures, partially offset by a $105 million benefit attributable to an R&W settlement. The economic loss development attributable to the change in discount rates was a benefit of $3 million for fourth quarter 2017.\nRoll Forward of Net Expected Loss to be Paid (1) (in millions)\nNet Expected\nLoss to be Paid\n(Recovered) as\nof September 30,\n2017\nEconomic Loss\nDevelopment/\n(Benefit)\nLosses\n(Paid)/\nRecovered\nNet Expected\nLoss to be Paid\n(Recovered) as\nof December 31,\n2017\nPublic finance $ 1,093 $ 122 $ (12 ) $ 1,203 U.S. RMBS 176 (111 ) 8 73 Other structured finance 23 4 — 27 Total $ 1,292 $ 15 $ (4 ) $ 1,303\n(1) Economic loss development represents the change in net expected loss to be paid attributable to the effects of changes in assumptions based on observed market trends, changes in discount rates, accretion of discount and the economic effects of loss mitigation efforts. Economic loss development is the principal measure that the Company uses to evaluate the loss experience in its insured portfolio. Expected loss to be paid includes all transactions insured by the Company, whether written in insurance or credit derivative form, regardless of the accounting model prescribed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nNew Business Production\nNew Business Production (in millions)\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017 2016 GWP PVP(1) Gross Par\nWritten\nGWP PVP(1) Gross Par\nWritten\nPublic finance - U.S. $ 58 $ 59 $ 4,367 $ 70 $ 72 $ 5,465 Public finance - non-U.S. 13 8 116 9 9 107 Structured finance - U.S. (4 ) 7 246 4 3 47 Structured finance - non-U.S. 5 3 47 0 1 24 Total $ 72 $ 77 $ 4,776 $ 83 $ 85 $ 5,643\n(1) Please see “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.\nGWP include amounts collected upfront on all new business written, the present value of future premiums on new financial guaranty business written (discounted at risk free rates), the effects of changes in the estimated lives of transactions in the inforce book of financial guaranty business, and the current installments of non-financial guaranty new business. In fourth quarter 2017, U.S. public finance GWP decreased to $58 million from $70 million in fourth quarter 2016, due primarily to a decrease in new business production.\nU.S. public finance PVP decreased in fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016 due to lower par written in the secondary market. PVP written in the primary market increased 46% compared with fourth quarter 2016 due in part to several large transactions, with higher premium rates. Assured Guaranty once again guaranteed the majority of insured par issued.\nOutside the U.S., the Company generated $8 million of international public finance PVP and $3 million of international structured finance in fourth quarter 2017. The transactions written in fourth quarter 2017 include secondary market guarantees on regulated utilities and reinsurance on aircraft residual value insurance transactions.\nThe average rating on all new business production was A- in both fourth quarter 2017 and 2016.\nOther Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP operating income was $91 million in fourth quarter 2017, compared with $139 million in fourth quarter 2016. Non-GAAP operating income decreased in fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016 due mainly to lower net earned premiums and the provisional tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act, offset in part by lower operating loss expense.\nYear-to-Date Results\nGAAP Financial Information\nNet income was $730 million for FY 2017, compared with $881 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (FY 2016). Net income in both FY 2017 and FY 2016 had significant gains attributable to our strategic initiatives. FY 2017 included pretax commutation gains of $328 million related to the reassumption of previously ceded contracts, a pretax gain of $58 million related to the acquisition of MBIA UK Insurance Limited (MBIA UK) (MBIA UK Acquisition), and a pretax gain of $151 million related to litigation and R&W settlements. FY 2016 included a pretax gain of $259 million related to the acquisition of CIFG Holding Inc. (CIFG Acquisition) and a pretax gain of $89 million related to a loss mitigation transaction. Excluding these items, net income decreased in FY 2017 compared with FY 2016 due mainly to higher loss and LAE, lower net earned premiums from refundings and terminations, and the provisional tax expense related to the Tax Act.\nLoss and LAE expense was $388 million in FY 2017, compared with $295 million in FY 2016. The expense in FY 2017 mainly includes an increase in loss reserves on Puerto Rico, offset in part by benefits attributable to litigation and R&W settlements. FY 2016 loss and LAE expense consisted primarily of an increase in loss reserves on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited) (in millions)\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues: Net earned premiums $ 690 $ 864 Net investment income 418 408 Net realized investment gains (losses) 40 (29 ) Net change in fair value of credit derivatives: Realized gains (losses) and other settlements (10 ) 29 Net unrealized gains (losses) 121 69 Net change in fair value of credit derivatives 111 98 Fair value gains (losses) on CCS (2 ) 0 Fair value gains (losses) on FG VIEs 30 38 Bargain purchase gain and settlement of pre-existing relationships, net 58 259 Other income (loss) 394 39 Total revenues 1,739 1,677 Expenses: Loss and LAE 388 295 Amortization of deferred acquisition costs 19 18 Interest expense 97 102 Other operating expenses 244 245 Total expenses 748 660 Income (loss) before income taxes 991 1,017 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 261 136 Net income (loss) $ 730 $ 881 Economic Loss Development\nThe economic loss development for FY 2017 was $313 million, primarily related to the Company’s Puerto Rico exposure, partially offset by benefits recognized as a result of loss mitigation strategies including benefits attributable to litigation and R&W settlements.\nRoll Forward of Net Expected Loss to be Paid (1) (in millions)\nNet Expected\nLoss to be Paid\n(Recovered) as\nof December 31, 2016\nNet Expected\nLoss to be Paid\n(Recovered) on\nMBIA UK\nas of January\n10, 2017\nEconomic Loss\nDevelopment/\n(Benefit)\nLosses\n(Paid)/\nRecovered\nNet Expected\nLoss to be Paid\n(Recovered) as\nof December 31,\n2017\nPublic finance $ 904 $ 13 $ 549 $ (263 ) $ 1,203 U.S. RMBS 206 — (181 ) 48 73 Other structured finance 88 8 (55 ) (14 ) 27 Total $ 1,198 $ 21 $ 313 $ (229 ) $ 1,303\n(1) Economic loss development represents the change in net expected loss to be paid attributable to the effects of changes in assumptions based on observed market trends, changes in discount rates, accretion of discount and the economic effects of loss mitigation efforts.

Expected loss to be paid includes all transactions insured by the Company, whether written in insurance or credit derivative form, regardless of the accounting model prescribed under GAAP.\nNew Business Production\nNew Business Production (in millions)\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 GWP PVP(1) Gross Par\nWritten\nGWP PVP(1) Gross Par\nWritten\nPublic finance - U.S. $ 190 $ 196 $ 15,957 $ 142 $ 161 $ 16,039 Public finance - non - U.S. 105 66 1,376 15 25 677 Structured finance - U.S. (1 ) 12 489 (1 ) 27 1,114 Structured finance - non-U.S. 13 15 202 (2 ) 1 24 Total $ 307 $ 289 $ 18,024 $ 154 $ 214 $ 17,854\n(1) Please see “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this press release.\nIn FY 2017, GWP increased to $307 million from $154 million in FY 2016, due to increased new financial guaranty business production in U.S. public finance and international infrastructure markets.\nU.S. public finance PVP increased in FY 2017 compared with the comparable prior-year period due mainly to a higher number of large transactions and a more diverse book of underlying credits. The Company's market share, based on par, rose to 58.5% in FY 2017 from 56.2% in FY 2016. Assured Guaranty once again guaranteed the majority of insured par issued while maintaining an A- average rating on new business written.\nOutside the U.S., the Company generated $66 million of public finance PVP in FY 2017, compared with $25 million in FY 2016. In 2017 this included several university housing and regulated utilities transactions, a senior liquidity guarantee as part of a European infrastructure refinancing and a project finance infrastructure/public-private-partnership healthcare transaction. Non-U.S. PVP was strong in both the primary and secondary markets in 2017.\nIn addition, the Company generated $15 million of non-U.S. structured finance PVP in FY 2017 by providing reinsurance of aircraft residual value policies and triple-X life reinsurance polices.\nOther Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP operating income for FY 2017 was $661 million, compared with non-GAAP operating income for FY 2016 of $895 million. Similar to net income results, non-GAAP operating income in FY 2017 included pretax commutation gains of $328 million, a pretax gain of $58 million related to the MBIA UK Acquisition and a pretax gain of $151 million related to litigation and R&W settlements. FY 2016 non-GAAP operating income included a pretax gain of $259 million related to the CIFG Acquisition and a pretax gain of $89 million related to a loss mitigation transaction. Excluding these gains, non-GAAP operating income decreased in FY 2017 compared with FY 2016 due mainly to higher loss and LAE, lower net earned premiums and the provisional tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nOn a per-share basis, shareholders' equity, non-GAAP operating shareholders' equity and non-GAAP adjusted book value increased due to the benefit of the acquisitions and commutations over the past several years and the related recurring income, favorable litigation outcomes and R&W settlements, as well as the accretive effect of the share repurchase program that has been in effect since January of 2013.\nCommon Share Repurchases\nSummary of Share Repurchases\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nAmount Number of\nShares\nAverage Price\nPer Share\n2017 (January 1 - March 31) $ 216 5.43 $ 39.83 2017 (April 1 - June 30) 135 3.46 39.05 2017 (July 1 - September 30) 80 1.85 43.29 2017 (October 1 - December 31) 70 1.93 36.18 2017\n501 12.67 39.57 2018 (January 1 - February 22)\n$ 43\n1.23\n$ 34.90\nFrom 2013 through February 22, 2018, the Company repurchased 82.5 million common shares at an average price of $27.37, representing approximately 43% of the total shares outstanding at the beginning of the repurchase program in 2013. These repurchases can be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\nAs in the past, the Company's execution of its capital management strategy is contingent upon its available free cash and the capital position of the parent company, market conditions, the maintenance of its strong financial strength ratings and other factors. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. It does not have an expiration date.\nInsurance Company Subsidiaries’ Share Repurchases\nIn 2017, the respective regulators of Assured Guaranty Corp. (AGC) and Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. (AGM) approved transfers of approximately $200 million and $101 million, respectively, to the U.S. holding companies in the form of share repurchases. AGM transferred $101 million to Assured Guaranty Municipal Holdings Inc. in 2017, and AGC transferred $200 million to Assured Guaranty US Holdings Inc. in January 2018.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) (in millions)\nAs of December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Assets Investment portfolio: Fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale, at fair value $ 10,674 $ 10,233 Short-term investments, at fair value 627 590 Other invested assets 94 162 Total investment portfolio 11,395 10,985 Cash 144 118 Premiums receivable, net of commissions payable 915 576 Ceded unearned premium reserve 119 206 Deferred acquisition costs 101 106 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 44 80 Salvage and subrogation recoverable 572 365 Credit derivative assets 2 13 Deferred tax asset, net 98 497 Current income tax receivable 21 12 FG VIE assets, at fair value 700 876 Other assets 322 317 Total assets $ 14,433 $ 14,151 Liabilities and shareholders' equity Liabilities Unearned premium reserve $ 3,475 $ 3,511 Loss and LAE reserve 1,444 1,127 Reinsurance balances payable, net 61 64 Long-term debt 1,292 1,306 Credit derivative liabilities 271 402 FG VIE liabilities with recourse, at fair value 627 807 FG VIE liabilities without recourse, at fair value 130 151 Other liabilities 294 279 Total liabilities 7,594 7,647 Shareholders' equity Common stock 1 1 Additional paid-in capital 573 1,060 Retained earnings 5,892 5,289 Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) 372 149 Deferred equity compensation 1 5 Total shareholders' equity 6,839 6,504 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 14,433 $ 14,151 Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo reflect the key financial measures that management analyzes in evaluating the Company’s operations and progress towards long-term goals, the Company discloses both financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and financial measures not determined in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP financial measures).\nFinancial measures identified as non-GAAP should not be considered substitutes for GAAP financial measures. The primary limitation of non-GAAP financial measures is the potential lack of comparability to financial measures of other companies, whose definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those of the Company.\nBy disclosing non-GAAP financial measures, the Company gives investors, analysts and financial news reporters access to information that management and the Board of Directors review internally. The Company believes its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, along with the effect of FG VIE consolidation, provides information that is necessary for analysts to calculate their estimates of Assured Guaranty’s financial results in their research reports on Assured Guaranty and for investors, analysts and the financial news media to evaluate Assured Guaranty’s financial results.\nGAAP requires the Company to consolidate certain VIEs that have issued debt obligations insured by the Company. However, the Company does not own such VIEs and its exposure is limited to its obligation under its financial guaranty insurance contract. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to remove FG VIE consolidation (which the Company refers to as its core financial measures), as well as GAAP financial measures and other factors, to evaluate the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and progress towards long-term goals. The Company uses these core financial measures in its decision making process and in its calculation of certain components of management compensation. Wherever possible, the Company has separately disclosed the effect of FG VIE consolidation.\nMany investors, analysts and financial news reporters use non-GAAP operating shareholders’ equity, adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE consolidation, as the principal financial measure for valuing AGL’s current share price or projected share price and also as the basis of their decision to recommend, buy or sell AGL’s common shares. Many of the Company’s fixed income investors also use this measure to evaluate the Company’s capital adequacy.\nMany investors, analysts and financial news reporters also use non-GAAP adjusted book value, adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE consolidation, to evaluate AGL’s share price and as the basis of their decision to recommend, buy or sell the AGL common shares. Non-GAAP operating income adjusted for the effect of FG VIE consolidation enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s financial results in comparison with the consensus analyst estimates distributed publicly by financial databases.\nThe core financial measures that the Company uses to help determine compensation are: (1) non-GAAP operating income, adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE consolidation, (2) non-GAAP operating shareholders' equity, adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE consolidation, (3) growth in non-GAAP adjusted book value per share, adjusted to remove the effect of FG VIE consolidation, and (4) PVP.\nThe following paragraphs and tables define each non-GAAP financial measure disclosed by the Company and describe why it is useful. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented below.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nManagement believes that non-GAAP operating income is a useful measure because it clarifies the understanding of the underwriting results and financial condition of the Company and presents the results of operations of the Company excluding the fair value adjustments on credit derivatives and CCS that are not expected to result in economic gain or loss, as well as other adjustments described below. Management adjusts non-GAAP operating income further by removing FG VIE consolidation to arrive at its core operating income measure. Non-GAAP operating income is defined as net income (loss) attributable to AGL, as reported under GAAP, adjusted for the following:\n1) Elimination of realized gains (losses) on the Company’s investments, except for gains and losses on securities classified as trading. The timing of realized gains and losses, which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of sales is largely subject to the Company’s discretion and influenced by market opportunities, as well as the Company’s tax and capital profile.\n2) Elimination of non-credit-impairment unrealized fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives, which is the amount of unrealized fair value gains (losses) in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. Such fair value adjustments are heavily affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market interest rates, the Company's credit spreads, and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss.\n3) Elimination of fair value gains (losses) on the Company’s CCS. Such amounts are affected by changes in market interest rates, the Company's credit spreads, price indications on the Company's publicly traded debt, and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss.\n4) Elimination of foreign exchange gains (losses) on remeasurement of net premium receivables and loss and LAE reserves. Long-dated receivables and loss and LAE reserves represent the present value of future contractual or expected cash flows. Therefore, the current period’s foreign exchange remeasurement gains (losses) are not necessarily indicative of the total foreign exchange gains (losses) that the Company will ultimately recognize.\n5) Elimination of the tax effects related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments.\nSummary Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income (1) (in millions)\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 52 $ 197 $ 730 $ 881 Less pre-tax adjustments: Realized gains (losses) on investments (14 ) (24 ) 40 (30 ) Non-credit impairment unrealized fair value gains\n(losses) on credit derivatives\n(17 ) 68 43 36 Fair value gains (losses) on CCS 2 50 (2 ) 0 Foreign exchange gains (losses) on remeasurement\nof premiums receivable and loss and LAE reserves\n8 (12 ) 57 (33 ) Total pre-tax adjustments (21 ) 82 138 (27 ) Less tax effect on pre-tax adjustments (18 ) (24 ) (69 ) 13 Non-GAAP operating income $ 91 $ 139 $ 661 $ 895 Gain (loss) related to FG VIE consolidation (net of\ntax provision of $1, $9, $6 and $7) included in non-\nGAAP operating income\n$ 2 $ 16 $ 11 $ 12\n(1) The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered a substitute for financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income Adjustments and Effect of FG VIE Consolidation (in millions)\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Quarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Non-GAAP\nOperating\nIncome\nAdjustments\n(1)\nEffect of FG\nVIE\nConsolidation\n(2)\nNon-GAAP\nOperating\nIncome\nAdjustments\n(1)\nEffect of FG\nVIE\nConsolidation\n(2)\nAdjustments to revenues: Net earned premiums $ — $ (3 ) $ — $ (4 ) Net investment income — (1 ) — (1 ) Net realized investment gains (losses) (14 ) — (24 ) — Net change in fair value of credit derivatives 1 — 64 — Fair value gains (losses) on CCS 2 — 50 — Fair value gains (losses) on FG VIEs — 5 — 27 Other income (loss) 8 0 (13 ) 0 Total revenue adjustments (3 ) 1 77 22 Adjustments to expenses: Loss expense 18 (2 ) (5 ) (3 ) Total expense adjustments 18 (2 ) (5 ) (3 ) Pre-tax adjustments (21 ) 3 82 25 Tax effect of adjustments\n18\n(3)\n1 24 9 After-tax adjustments $ (39 ) $ 2 $ 58 $ 16\n(1) The \"Non-GAAP Operating Income Adjustments\" column represents the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations that the Company removes to arrive at non-GAAP operating income.\n(2) The \"Effect of FG VIE Consolidation\" column represents the amounts included in the consolidated statements of operations and non-GAAP operating income that the Company removes to arrive at the core financial measures that management uses in certain of its compensation calculations and its decision making process.\n(3) Fourth quarter 2017 includes $26 million adjustment to tax expense related to the estimated effect of tax reform.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income Adjustments and Effect of FG VIE Consolidation (in millions)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Non-GAAP\nOperating\nIncome\nAdjustments\n(1)\nEffect of FG\nVIE\nConsolidation\n(2)\nNon-GAAP\nOperating\nIncome\nAdjustments\n(1)\nEffect of FG\nVIE\nConsolidation\n(2)\nAdjustments to revenues: Net earned premiums $ — $ (15 ) $ — $ (16 ) Net investment income — (5 ) 8 (10 ) Net realized investment gains (losses) 40 — (29 ) — Net change in fair value of credit derivatives 86 — 49 — Fair value gains (losses) on CCS (2 ) — 0 — Fair value gains (losses) on FG VIEs — 30 — 38 Other income (loss) 57 0 (34 ) 0 Total revenue adjustments 181 10 (6 ) 12 Adjustments to expenses: Loss expense 43 (7 ) 20 (7 ) Other operating expenses — — 1 — Total expense adjustments 43 (7 ) 21 (7 ) Pre-tax adjustments 138 17 (27 ) 19 Tax effect of adjustments\n69 (3)\n6 (13 ) 7 After-tax adjustments $ 69 $ 11 $ (14 ) $ 12\n(1) The \"Non-GAAP Operating Income Adjustments\" column represents the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations that the Company removes to arrive at non-GAAP operating income.\n(2) The \"Effect of FG VIE Consolidation\" column represents the amounts included in the consolidated statements of operations and non-GAAP operating income that the Company removes to arrive at the core financial measures that management uses in certain of its compensation calculations and its decision making process.\n(3) FY 2017 includes $26 million adjustment to tax expense related to the estimated effect of tax reform.\nNon-GAAP Operating Shareholders’ Equity and Non-GAAP Adjusted Book Value\nManagement believes that non-GAAP operating shareholders’ equity is a useful measure because it presents the equity of the Company excluding the fair value adjustments on investments, credit derivatives and CCS, that are not expected to result in economic gain or loss, along with other adjustments described below. Management adjusts non-GAAP operating shareholders’ equity further by removing FG VIE consolidation to arrive at its core operating shareholders' equity and core adjusted book value.\nNon-GAAP operating shareholders’ equity is the basis of the calculation of non-GAAP adjusted book value (see below). Non-GAAP operating shareholders’ equity is defined as shareholders’ equity attributable to AGL, as reported under GAAP, adjusted for the following:\n1) Elimination of non-credit-impairment unrealized fair value gains (losses) on credit derivatives, which is the amount of unrealized fair value gains (losses) in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses, and non-economic payments. Such fair value adjustments are heavily affected by, and in part fluctuate with, changes in market interest rates, credit spreads and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss.\n2) Elimination of fair value gains (losses) on the Company’s CCS. Such amounts are affected by changes in market interest rates, the Company's credit spreads, price indications on the Company's publicly traded debt, and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss.\n3) Elimination of unrealized gains (losses) on the Company’s investments that are recorded as a component of AOCI (excluding foreign exchange remeasurement). The AOCI component of the fair value adjustment on the investment portfolio is not deemed economic because the Company generally holds these investments to maturity and therefore should not recognize an economic gain or loss.\n4) Elimination of the tax effects related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments.\nManagement uses non-GAAP adjusted book value, adjusted for FG VIE consolidation, to measure the intrinsic value of the Company, excluding franchise value. Growth in non-GAAP adjusted book value per share, adjusted for FG VIE consolidation (core adjusted book value), is one of the key financial measures used in determining the amount of certain long-term compensation elements to management and employees and used by rating agencies and investors. Management believes that non-GAAP adjusted book value is a useful measure because it enables an evaluation of the Company’s in-force premiums and revenues net of expected losses. Non-GAAP adjusted book value is non-GAAP operating shareholders’ equity, as defined above, further adjusted for the following:\n1) Elimination of deferred acquisition costs, net. These amounts represent net deferred expenses that have already been paid or accrued and will be expensed in future accounting periods.\n2) Addition of the net present value of estimated net future revenue on non-financial guaranty contracts. See below.\n3) Addition of the deferred premium revenue on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected loss to be expensed, net of reinsurance. This amount represents the expected future net earned premiums, net of expected losses to be expensed, which are not reflected in GAAP equity.\n4) Elimination of the tax asset or liability related to the above adjustments, which are determined by applying the statutory tax rate in each of the jurisdictions that generate these adjustments.\nThe unearned premiums and revenues included in non-GAAP adjusted book value will be earned in future periods, but actual earnings may the estimated amounts used in determining current non-GAAP adjusted book value due to changes in foreign exchange rates, prepayment speeds, terminations, credit defaults and other factors.\nReconciliation of GAAP Shareholders' Equity to Non-GAAP Operating Shareholders' Equity (1) and Non-GAAP Adjusted Book Value (1) (in millions, except per share amounts)\nAs of December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Shareholders' equity $ 6,839 $ 6,504 Less pre-tax adjustments: Non-credit impairment unrealized fair value gains (losses) on credit\nderivatives\n(146 ) (189 ) Fair value gains (losses) on CCS 60 62 Unrealized gain (loss) on investment portfolio excluding foreign\nexchange effect\n487 316 Less taxes (83 ) (71 ) Non-GAAP operating shareholders' equity 6,521 6,386 Pre-tax adjustments: Less: Deferred acquisition costs 101 106 Plus: Net present value of estimated net future revenue 146 136 Plus: Net unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in\nexcess of expected loss to be expensed\n2,966 2,922 Plus taxes (512 ) (832 ) Non-GAAP adjusted book value $ 9,020 $ 8,506 Gain (loss) related to FG VIE consolidation included in non-GAAP\noperating shareholders' equity (net of tax (provision) benefit of $(2)\nand $4)\n$ 5 $ (7 ) Gain (loss) related to FG VIE consolidation included in non-GAAP\nadjusted book value (net of tax benefit of $3 and $12)\n$ (14 ) $ (24 ) Shares outstanding at the end of the period 116.0 128.0 Per share: Shareholders' equity $ 58.95 $ 50.82 Non-GAAP operating shareholders' equity 56.20 49.89 Non-GAAP adjusted book value 77.74 66.46\n(1) The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered a substitute for financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nNet Present Value of Estimated Net Future Revenue\nManagement believes that this amount is a useful measure because it enables an evaluation of the value of future estimated revenue for non-financial guaranty insurance contracts. There is no corresponding GAAP financial measure. This amount represents the present value of estimated future revenue from the Company’s non-financial guaranty insurance contracts, net of reinsurance, ceding commissions and premium taxes, for contracts without expected economic losses, and is discounted at 6%. Estimated net future revenue may change from period to period due to changes in foreign exchange rates, prepayment speeds, terminations, credit defaults or other factors that affect par outstanding or the ultimate maturity of an obligation.\nPVP or Present Value of New Business Production\nManagement believes that PVP is a useful measure because it enables the evaluation of the value of new business production for the Company by taking into account the value of estimated future installment premiums on all new contracts underwritten in a reporting period as well as premium supplements and additional installment premium on existing contracts as to which the issuer has the right to call the insured obligation but has not exercised such right, whether in insurance or credit derivative contract form, which management believes GAAP gross written premiums and the net credit derivative premiums received and receivable portion of net realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives (Credit Derivative Realized Gains (Losses)) do not adequately measure. PVP in respect of contracts written in a specified period is defined as gross upfront and installment premiums received and the present value of gross estimated future installment premiums, discounted, in each case, at 6%. Under GAAP, financial guaranty installment premiums are discounted at a risk free rate. Additionally, under GAAP, management records future installment premiums on financial guaranty insurance contracts covering non-homogeneous pools of assets based on the contractual term of the transaction, whereas for PVP purposes, management records an estimate of the future installment premiums the Company expects to receive, which may be based upon a shorter period of time than the contractual term of the transaction. Actual future earned or written premiums and Credit Derivative Realized Gains (Losses) may differ from PVP due to factors including, but not limited to, changes in foreign exchange rates, prepayment speeds, terminations, credit defaults, or other factors that affect par outstanding or the ultimate maturity of an obligation.\nReconciliation of GWP to PVP(1) (in millions)\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017 Public Finance Structured Finance U.S. Non - U.S. U.S. Non - U.S. Total GWP $ 58 $ 13 $ (4 ) $ 5 $ 72 Less: Installment GWP and other GAAP\nadjustments(2)\n(2 ) 13 (4 ) 2 9 Upfront GWP 60 — 0 3 63 Plus: Installment premium PVP (1 ) 8 7 — 14 PVP $ 59 $ 8 $ 7 $ 3 $ 77 Quarter Ended December 31, 2016 Public Finance Structured Finance U.S. Non - U.S. U.S. Non - U.S. Total GWP $ 70 $ 9 $ 4 $ 0 $ 83 Less: Installment GWP and other GAAP\nadjustments(2) (2 ) 9 1 0 8 Upfront GWP 72 — 3 — 75 Plus: Installment premium PVP — 9 0 1 10 PVP $ 72 $ 9 $ 3 $ 1 $ 85 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Public Finance Structured Finance U.S. Non - U.S. U.S. Non - U.S. Total GWP $ 190 $ 105 $ (1 ) $ 13 $ 307 Less: Installment GWP and other GAAP\nadjustments(2)\n(3 ) 103 (1 ) 0 99 Upfront GWP 193 2 0 13 208 Plus: Installment premium PVP 3 64 12 2 81 PVP $ 196 $ 66 $ 12 $ 15 $ 289 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Public Finance Structured Finance U.S. Non - U.S. U.S. Non - U.S. Total GWP $ 142 $ 15 $ (1 ) $ (2 ) $ 154 Less: Installment GWP and other GAAP\nadjustments(2)\n(19 ) 15 (4 ) (2 ) (10 ) Upfront GWP 161 — 3 — 164 Plus: Installment premium PVP 0 25 24 1 50 PVP $ 161 $ 25 $ 27 $ 1 $ 214",
