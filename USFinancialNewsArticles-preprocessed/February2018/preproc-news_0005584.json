Gastroenterology +23.7% fueled by market share growth of ENTYVIO ® and TAKECAB ® . Oncology +13.8% driven by the expansion of NINLARO ® and ADCETRIS ® , and the addition of revenue from ICLUSIG ® and ALUNBRIG ® . Neuroscience +26.4% led by robust growth of TRINTELLIX ® in the U.S. Emerging Markets +1.9% with strong performance in Russia and Brazil offsetting temporary declines in China and the Middle East. Underlying Revenue performance was driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. (U.S. +17.0%, Japan +1.3%, Europe & Canada +4.9%). Reported revenue grew +4.1%, with the positive contribution from Takeda's Growth Drivers and favorable currency impact (+3.4pp) more than offsetting the negative impact of divestitures (-5.9pp).\nDouble-digit EPS growth reflecting strong revenue growth and progress of Global Opex Initiative\nUnderlying Core Earnings grew +32.8%, reflecting strong revenue growth and margin step-up of 3.9pp (+2.3pp gross margin; +1.6pp from OPEX margin). Reported operating profit was up +48.2%, driven mainly by Core Earnings growth. It also includes one-time gains of 136.9 billion yen, including the sale of shares held in Wako Pure Chemical Ltd., disposal of real estate, and the transfer of additional long-listed products to Teva Takeda Yakuhin Ltd. Underlying Core EPS was up +25.8%, and reported EPS increased +45.5% to 309 yen per share.\nNet leverage improved due to steady progress on cash flow\nYear-to-date Operating Free Cash Flow increased +25.1% to 152.1 billion yen, and the disposal of non-core assets generated an additional 142.9 billion yen of cash. Net Debt / EBITDA dropped to 1.9x from 2.7x in March 2017.\nJames Kehoe, Chief Financial Officer, commented:\n\"Our Growth Drivers continued to power ahead and, together with our cost management initiatives, led to double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect higher Velcade sales, and we now project Core Earnings margin expansion of approximately 300bps. Takeda will continue to deliver value to patients and shareholders as we execute against our key mid-term priorities of growing the portfolio, rebuilding the pipeline, and boosting profitability.\"\nReported Results for Q3 YTD (April - December) FY2017\n(billion yen) FY2016\nQ3 YTD\nFY2017\nQ3 YTD\n% Growth vs Prior Year Reported Underlying 2 Revenue 1,315.8 1,369.6 +4.1% +6.7% Core Earnings 1 228.3 292.7 +28.2% +32.8% Operating Profit 217.4 322.3 +48.2% - Net Profit 3 165.7 240.9 +45.4% - EPS 212 yen 309 yen +45.5% +25.8% 1\nCore Earnings is calculated by deducting SG&A expenses and R&D expenses from reported Gross Profit.
