    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German builder Hochtief ( HOTG.DE ) secured unconditional EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its bid to buy Spanish airports and motorway operator Abertis ( ABE.MC ).\nThe European Commission said the takeover bid raised no competition concerns, confirming a Reuters report on Feb. 1.\nHochtief, majority-owned by Spanish builder ACS ( ACS.MC ), is battling Italian airports and motorway operator Atlantia for Abertis. The EU antitrust enforcer approved Atlantiaâ€™s offer last year without asking for concessions.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee\n ",
