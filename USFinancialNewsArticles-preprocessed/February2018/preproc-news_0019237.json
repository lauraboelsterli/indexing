MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.15 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.16 percent.\nIn the energy market, oil prices fell. U.S. crude fell 2.08 percent to $62.07 per barrel and Brent was last at $66.12, down 1.11 percent on the day. U.S. data showed an unexpected build in refined products, fanning fears of oversupply headed into the slow-demand season.\nEASING VOLATILITY\nIt was a steep spike in yields last Friday that sparked the initial Wall Street rout, forcing sales by a host of highly leveraged funds, which ramped up volatility and drove yet more selling.\nInvestors are also wary about U.S. lawmakers wrangling to extend the so-called debt ceiling - funding for the U.S. government runs out on Feb. 8 unless a stopgap bill manages to pass the Senate later on Wednesday.\nLike many others, BlackRock analysts described the rout as a buying opportunity, seeing the leveraged products moves as essentially driven by jitters over recent equity gains on one hand, and the possibility of higher interest rates on the other.\nStrategists also point out that the improving global economic outlook is a positive for stocks overall.\nU.S. Treasury prices fell before the Treasury Department was due to auction new 10-year notes.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.7999 percent, from 2.766 percent late on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies amid the gains on Wall Street.\nThe dollar index rose 0.61 percent, with the euro down 0.68 percent to $1.2292.\n(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York; Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Nick Zieminski)",
