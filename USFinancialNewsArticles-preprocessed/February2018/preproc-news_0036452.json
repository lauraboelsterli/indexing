Vanda Non-GAAP net loss was $3.4 million for the full year 2017, compared to a Non-GAAP net income of $1.5 million for the full year 2016.\nVanda provides Non-GAAP financial information, which it believes can enhance an overall understanding of its financial performance when considered together with GAAP figures. Refer to the sections of this press release entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for more detailed information regarding Non-GAAP financial information.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nVanda expects to achieve the following financial objectives in 2018:\nFull Year 2018\nFinancial Objectives\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance\nCombined net product sales from both HETLIOZ ® and Fanapt ®\n$180 to $200 million\nHETLIOZ ® net product sales\n$108 to $118 million\nFanapt ® net product sales\n$72 to $82 million\nNon-GAAP Operating expenses, excluding Cost of goods sold (1)\n$163 to $173 million\nIntangible asset amortization\n$1.7 million\nStock-based compensation\n$11 to $15 million\nYear-end 2018 Cash (2)\n$115 to $125 million\n(1) Non-GAAP Operating expenses, excludes Cost of goods sold, intangible asset amortization and stock-based compensation.\n(2) Year-end 2018 Cash includes the expected payment of a $25 million milestone obligation based on cumulative HETLIOZ ® net product sales.\nConference Call\nVanda has scheduled a conference call for today, Wednesday, February 14, 2018, at 4:30 PM ET. During the call, Vanda's management will discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and other corporate activities. Investors can call 1-888-771-4371 (domestic) or 1-847-585-4405 (international) and use passcode 46291578. A replay of the call will be available on Wednesday, February 14, 2018, beginning at 7:00 PM ET and will be accessible until Wednesday, February 21, 2018, at 11:59 PM ET. The replay call-in number is 1-888-843-7419 for domestic callers and 1-630-652-3042 for international callers.

The call will also be archived on Vanda's website for a period of 30 days.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nVanda believes that the Non-GAAP financial information provided in this press release can assist investors in understanding and assessing the ongoing economics of Vanda's business and reflect how it manages the business internally and sets operational goals. Vanda's \"Non-GAAP Selling, general and administrative expenses\" and \"Non-GAAP Research and development expenses\" exclude stock-based compensation. Vanda's \"Non-GAAP Net income (loss),\" \"Non-GAAP Net income (loss) per share\" and \"Non-GAAP Operating expenses excluding Cost of goods sold\" exclude stock-based compensation and intangible asset amortization.\nVanda believes that excluding the impact of these items better reflects the recurring economic characteristics of its business, as well as Vanda's use of financial resources and its long-term performance.\nThis press release includes a projection of 2018 Non-GAAP Operating expenses, excluding Cost of goods sold, a forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measure under the heading \"2018 Financial Guidance.\" This Non-GAAP financial measure is determined by excluding cost of goods sold, stock-based compensation and intangible asset amortization. Vanda is unable to reconcile this Non-GAAP guidance to GAAP because it is difficult to predict the future impact of these adjustments.\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since not all companies may calculate these measures in an identical manner and, therefore, they are not necessarily an accurate measure of comparison between companies.\nThe presentation of these Non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for guidance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these Non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant elements that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Vanda's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management in determining these Non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, Vanda presents its Non-GAAP financial guidance in connection with its GAAP guidance. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAbout Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nVanda is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies to address high unmet medical needs and improve the lives of patients.
