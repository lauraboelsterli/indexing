attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions\n(non-GAAP) $ 153,151 $ 797,734 $ 717,805 $ 1,457,583 Per diluted share (non-GAAP) $ 0.80 $ 4.20 $ 3.75 $ 7.66 FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of our net income to FFO is provided above. In addition to FFO, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of FFO to FFO, as adjusted are provided on page 3 of this press release.\nConference Call and Audio Webcast\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a quarterly earnings conference call and an audio webcast on Tuesday, February 13, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).
