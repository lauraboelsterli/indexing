    "text": "There is actually some good news in the market and the chip industry.\nAmid the focus on the market's recent volatility, Micron announced better-than-expected guidance on Monday.\nThe memory chipmaker raised its fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenue forecast range to $7.2 billion to $7.35 billion from its previous target of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion. Micron also increased its earning per share guidance for the quarter to $2.70 to $2.75 from $2.51 to $2.65.\nMicron shares closed up 7.5 percent Tuesday.\nThe company also announced Monday it has appointed David Zinsner as its chief financial officer, effective Feb. 19, replacing Ernie Maddock.\nKeyBanc Capital Markets raised its rating to overweight from sector weight for Micron shares, following the announcements.\n\"Micron preannounced F2Q (Feb.) positively amid strong DRAM pricing,\" semiconductor analyst Weston Twigg wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"We are raising our estimates to reflect the preannouncement, and we're upgrading to Overweight as valuation and long-term trends are too compelling to ignore.\"\nMicron will report its earnings results on March 22.\nDisclaimer",
