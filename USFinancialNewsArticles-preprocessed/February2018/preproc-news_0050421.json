    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) today reported its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP” or the “Partnership”) reported a net income of $1.10 billion, an increase of $1.43 billion compared to a net loss of $336 million for the same period last year primarily due to a deferred tax benefit resulting from the recent tax reform. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $1.94 billion, an increase of $453 million over the same period last year, reflecting significantly higher results from the midstream and crude oil transportation and services segments, as discussed in the segment results analysis below. Distributable Cash Flow attributable to the partners of ETP, as adjusted, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $1.20 billion, an increase of $240 million compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the increase in adjusted EBITDA.\nETP’s other recent key accomplishments include the following:\nOn February 14, 2018, ETP paid a quarterly distribution of $0.565 per unit ($2.26 annualized) on ETP Common Units for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Partnership’s distribution coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1.30x. ETP announced that Phase 1A and Phase 1B of the Rover pipeline were placed in service in August 2017 and December 2017, respectively. In January 2018, ETP announced the entry into an agreement pursuant to which ETP will contribute certain compression assets to USA Compression Partners, LP for an aggregate consideration of $1.7 billion, consisting of $447 million in equity and $1.225 billion in cash. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2018. In February 2018, after the record date for Sunoco LP’s fourth quarter 2017 cash distributions, Sunoco LP repurchased 17,286,859 Sunoco LP common units owned by ETP for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $540 million. As of December 31, 2017, ETP’s $5.00 billion revolving credit facilities had $2.34 billion of outstanding borrowings, and its leverage ratio, as defined by the credit agreement, was 3.96x.\nAn analysis of ETP’s segment results and other supplementary data is provided after the financial tables shown below.

As a result, the prior period amounts reported above differ from information previously reported by legacy ETP, as follows:\nDistributable cash flow attributable to the partners of ETP includes amounts attributable to the partners of both legacy ETP and legacy Sunoco Logistics. Previously, the calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to the partners of ETP (as previously reported by legacy ETP) excluded the distributable cash flow attributable to Sunoco Logistics and only included distributions from legacy Sunoco Logistics to legacy ETP. Distributable cash flow attributable to noncontrolling interest in other consolidated subsidiaries includes amounts attributable to the noncontrolling interests in the other consolidated subsidiaries of both legacy ETP and legacy Sunoco Logistics. The transaction-related expenses adjustment in distributable cash flow attributable to the partners of ETP, as adjusted, includes amounts incurred by both legacy ETP and legacy Sunoco Logistics. Distributions to limited partners include distributions paid on the common units of both legacy ETP and legacy Sunoco Logistics but exclude the following distributions in the prior periods on units that were cancelled in the merger, which comprise the following: (i) distributions paid by legacy Sunoco Logistics on its common units held legacy ETP and (ii) distributions paid by legacy ETP on its Class H units held by ETE. Distributions on General Partner interests and incentive distribution rights are reflected on a pro forma basis, based on the pro forma cash distributions to limited partners and the current distribution waterfall per the limited partnership agreement (i.e., the legacy Sunoco Logistics distribution waterfall). Common units outstanding for the pre-merger periods reflect (i) the legacy ETP common units outstanding at the end of the period multiplied by a factor of 1.5x and (ii) the legacy Sunoco Logistics common units outstanding at the end of the period minus 67.1 million legacy Sunoco Logistics common units held by ETP, which were cancelled in connection with the closing of the merger.\n(b) During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Partnership changed its accounting policy related to certain inventories. Certain crude oil, refined product and NGL inventories associated with the legacy Sunoco Logistics business were changed from the LIFO method to the weighted average cost method. These changes have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented, and the prior period amounts reflected below have been adjusted from those amounts previously reported. Certain other prior period amounts have also been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including a reclassification between capitalized interest and AFUDC from the nine months ended September 30, 2017.\n(c) Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures used by industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of ETP’s fundamental business activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or other GAAP measures.\nThere are material limitations to using measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, including the difficulty associated with using either as the sole measure to compare the results of one company to another, and the inability to analyze certain significant items that directly affect a company’s net income or loss or cash flows. In addition, our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP, such as segment margin, operating income, net income, and cash flow from operating activities.\nDefinition of Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as total partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities include unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and inventory fair value adjustments (excluding lower of cost or market adjustments). Adjusted EBITDA reflects amounts for less than wholly-owned subsidiaries based on 100% of the subsidiaries’ results of operations and for unconsolidated affiliates based on our proportionate ownership.\nAdjusted EBITDA is used by management to determine our operating performance and, along with other financial and volumetric data, as internal measures for setting annual operating budgets, assessing financial performance of our numerous business locations, as a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition and as a measurement component of incentive compensation.\nDefinition of Distributable Cash Flow\nWe define Distributable Cash Flow as net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, less maintenance capital expenditures and a proportionate amount of the distributions to be paid on our redeemable perpetual preferred units. Non-cash items include depreciation, depletion and amortization, non-cash compensation expense, amortization included in interest expense, gains and losses on disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and deferred income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities includes unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and inventory fair value adjustments (excluding lower of cost or market adjustments). For unconsolidated affiliates, Distributable Cash Flow reflects the Partnership’s proportionate share of the investee’s distributable cash flow.\nDistributable Cash Flow is used by management to evaluate our overall performance. Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all available cash, and Distributable Cash Flow is calculated to evaluate our ability to fund distributions through cash generated by our operations.\nOn a consolidated basis, Distributable Cash Flow includes 100% of the Distributable Cash Flow of ETP’s consolidated subsidiaries. However, to the extent that noncontrolling interests exist among our subsidiaries, the Distributable Cash Flow generated by our subsidiaries may not be available to be distributed to our partners. In order to reflect the cash flows available for distributions to our partners, we have reported Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partners, which is calculated by adjusting Distributable Cash Flow (consolidated), as follows:\nFor subsidiaries with publicly traded equity interests, Distributable Cash Flow (consolidated) includes 100% of Distributable Cash Flow attributable to such subsidiary, and Distributable Cash Flow attributable to our partners includes distributions to be received by the parent company with respect to the periods presented. For consolidated joint ventures or similar entities, where the noncontrolling interest is not publicly traded, Distributable Cash Flow (consolidated) includes 100% of Distributable Cash Flow attributable to such subsidiary, but Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partners is net of distributions to be paid by the subsidiary to the noncontrolling interests.\nFor Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partners, as adjusted, certain transaction-related and non-recurring expenses that are included in net income are excluded.\n(d) During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded goodwill impairments of $223 million related to the compression business, $229 million related to the entity that owns the general partner of Panhandle, $262 million related to the interstate transportation and storage segment, and $79 million related to the NGL and refined products transportation and services segment. In addition, impairment losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 also include a $127 million impairment to the property, plant and equipment related to Sea Robin.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded goodwill impairments of $638 million in the interstate transportation and storage segment and $32 million in the midstream segment. In addition, impairment losses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 also include a $133 million impairment to property, plant and equipment in the interstate transportation and storage segment.\n(e) For the three months ended December 31, 2017, impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates includes non-cash impairments of the Partnership’s investments in FEP and HPC of $141 million and $172 million, respectively, and equity in losses of affiliates includes the impact of non-cash impairments recorded by HPC, which reduced the Partnership’s equity in earnings by $185 million.\n(f) Beginning with the second quarter of 2017, PennTex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ETP. The amounts reflected above for PennTex relate only to the first quarter of 2017, and no distributable cash flow has been attributed to noncontrolling interests in PennTex subsequent to March 31, 2017.\n(g) Distributions on ETP Common Units and the number of ETP Common Units outstanding at the end of the period, both as reflected above, exclude amounts related to ETP Common Units held by subsidiaries of ETP.\n(h) Reflects the sum of (i) the ETP Common Units outstanding at the end of period multiplied by a factor of 1.5x and (ii) the Sunoco Logistics Common Units outstanding at end of period minus 67.1 million Sunoco Logistics Common Units held by ETP, which units were cancelled in connection with the closing of the merger.\n(i) Distribution coverage ratio for a period is calculated as Distributable Cash Flow attributable to partners, as adjusted, divided by net distributions expected to be paid to the partners of ETP in respect of such period.\nSUMMARY ANALYSIS OF QUARTERLY RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n(Tabular dollar amounts in millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Segment Adjusted EBITDA: Intrastate transportation and storage $ 146 $ 152 Interstate transportation and storage 298 269 Midstream 393 258 NGL and refined products transportation and services (1) 433 424 Crude oil transportation and services (1) 544 237 All other 124 145 $ 1,938 $ 1,485 (1) Subsequent to the Sunoco Logistics Merger, the Partnership’s reportable segments were revised. Amounts reflected in prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current reportable segment presentation for NGL and refined products transportation and services and crude oil transportation and services. In the following analysis of segment operating results, a measure of segment margin is reported for segments with sales revenues. Segment Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that Segment Margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.\nIn addition, for certain segments, the sections below include information on the components of Segment Margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of Segment Margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin, and other margin. These components of Segment Margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of Segment Margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.\nFor prior periods reported herein, certain transactions related to the business of legacy Sunoco Logistics have been reclassified from cost of products sold to operating expenses; these transactions include sales between operating subsidiaries and their marketing affiliates. These reclassifications had no impact on net income or total equity.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of segment margin to operating income (loss), as reported in the Partnership’s consolidated statements of operations:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Intrastate transportation and storage $ 205 $ 191 Interstate transportation and storage 268 240 Midstream 568 448 NGL and refined products transportation and services 582 530 Crude oil transportation and services 683 307 All other 102 72 Intersegment eliminations (4 ) 5 Total segment margin 2,404 1,793 Less: Operating expenses 567 480 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 619 517 Selling, 99 122 Impairment losses 920 813 Operating income (loss) $ 199 $ (139 ) Intrastate Transportation and Storage\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Natural gas transported (BBtu/d) 8,944 8,134 Revenues $ 741 $ 756 Cost of products sold 536 565 Segment margin 205 191 Unrealized gains on commodity risk management activities (21 ) (5 ) Operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (44 ) (45 ) Selling, expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (5 ) (5 ) Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates 11 16 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 146 $ 152 Transported volumes increased primarily due to higher demand for exports to Mexico, more favorable market pricing, and the addition of new pipelines to our intrastate pipeline system. These increases were partially offset by lower production volumes in the Barnett Shale region.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our intrastate transportation and storage segment decreased due to the net impacts of the following:\na decrease of $13 million in transportation fees due to renegotiated contracts resulting in lower billed volumes. This decrease was offset by increased margin from optimization activity recorded in natural gas sales and other; and a decrease of $5 million in adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to a decrease of $7 million due to a reserve recorded pursuant to the bankruptcy filing of a transport customer on our Louisiana intrastate system and a decrease of $2 million due to lower demand volumes related to renegotiation of a contract on our Louisiana intrastate pipeline system, offset by an increase of $4 million related to two new joint venture pipelines placed in service in 2017; offset by an increase of $9 million in natural gas sales and other (excluding net changes in unrealized gains and losses of $12 million) primarily due to higher realized gains from pipeline optimization activity; and an increase of $2 million in storage margin (excluding net changes in unrealized gains and losses of $4 million related to fair value inventory adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives).\nInterstate Transportation and Storage\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Natural gas transported (BBtu/d) 7,185 5,322 Natural gas sold (BBtu/d) 18 17 Revenues $ 268 $ 240 Operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation, amortization and accretion expenses (76 ) (79 ) Selling, expenses, excluding non-cash compensation, amortization and accretion expenses (13 ) (11 ) Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates 115 118 Other 4 1 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 298 $ 269 Transported volumes reflected increases of 812 BBtu/d due to the partial in-service of the Rover pipeline, 410 BBtu/d on the Tiger pipeline as a result of an increase in production in the Haynesville Shale and deliveries into third party storage and the intrastate markets, and 390 BBtu/d and 356 BBtu/d on the Trunkline and Panhandle pipelines, respectively, resulting from higher demand due to colder weather.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our interstate transportation and storage segment increased due to the net effect of the following:\na net increase of $28 million in revenues primarily due to additional revenues of $44 million from the placement in partial service of the Rover pipeline. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in reservation and gas parking and storage revenues of $13 million on the Panhandle and Trunkline pipelines due to lack of customer demand as a result of weak spreads. In addition, revenues on the Tiger pipeline decreased $3 million due to contract restructuring; a decrease in operating expenses of $3 million primarily due to lower maintenance expense and lower leased storage expense due to expiration of a lease; and an increase in other of $3 million primarily due to higher tax gross up income from reimbursable projects; offset by a decrease in adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates of $3 million primarily due to higher maintenance expense on Citrus and lower earnings from Midcontinent Express resulting from lower margins and higher ad valorem taxes.\nMidstream\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Gathered volumes (BBtu/d) 11,525 9,694 NGLs produced (MBbls/d) 502 431 Equity NGLs produced (MBbls/d) 27 29 Revenues $ 1,926 $ 1,414 Cost of products sold 1,358 966 Segment margin 568 448 Unrealized losses on commodity risk management activities 3 15 Operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (168 ) (168 ) Selling, expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (18 ) (42 ) Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates 8 5 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 393 $ 258 Gathered volumes and NGL production increased primarily due to recent acquisitions, including PennTex, and gains in the Permian, Northeast and South Texas regions, partially offset by basin declines in the North Texas and Mid-Continent/Panhandle regions.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our midstream segment increased due to the net impacts of the following:\nan increase of $61 million (excluding net changes in unrealized gains and losses of $12 million) in non-fee based margin due to higher crude oil and NGL prices; an increase of $40 million in fee-based revenue due to minimum volume commitments in the South Texas region as well as volume increases in the Permian, Northeast and South Texas regions. These increases were partially offset by volume declines in North Texas and the Mid-Continent/Panhandle regions; an increase of $7 million in fee-based revenue due to recent acquisitions, including PennTex; and a decrease of $24 million in selling, expenses primarily due to certain reserves that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNGL and Refined Products Transportation and Services\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 NGL transportation volumes (MBbls/d) 963 791 Refined products transportation volumes (MBbls/d) 618 627 NGL and refined products terminal volumes (MBbls/d) 792 818 NGL fractionation volumes (MBbls/d) 455 394 Revenues $ 2,533 $ 2,080 Cost of products sold 1,951 1,550 Segment margin 582 530 Unrealized (gains) losses on commodity risk management activities (28 ) 16 Operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (120 ) (122 ) Selling, expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (15 ) (15 ) Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates 14 14 Other — 1 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 433 $ 424 NGL transportation volumes increased from the Permian, Barnett/East Texas, Eagle Ford, and Louisiana. Refined products transportation volumes decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year primarily due to lower volumes from our Midwest refineries.\nNGL and refined products terminal volumes decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period last year primarily due to the sale of one of our refined product terminals in April 2017.\nAverage volumes fractionated at our Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation facility increased 19% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year primarily due to the commissioning of our fourth fractionator in October of 2016, which has a capacity of 120 MBbls/d, as well as increased producer volumes as mentioned above.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our NGL and refined products transportation and services segment increased due to net impact of the following:\nan increase in transportation margin of $33 million primarily due to increased throughput on our Texas NGL pipelines resulting from increased producer volumes as noted above and the ramp up of volumes on our Mariner East system; an increase in fractionation and refinery services margin of $27 million (excluding changes in unrealized gains and losses of $1 million) primarily due to higher NGL volumes from most major producing regions feeding our Mont Belvieu fractionation facility as well as the placing in service of our fourth fractionator at Mont Belvieu, Texas, as noted above; and an increase in terminal services margin of $10 million due to higher throughput volumes at our Marcus Hook and Nederland NGL terminals; offset by a decrease in marketing margin of $56 million (excluding changes in unrealized gains and losses of $43 million) primarily due to the timing of the recognition of margin from optimization activities; and a decrease in storage margin of $6 million primarily due to fewer stored volumes as a result of the expiration of various contracts.\nCrude Oil Transportation and Services\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Crude Transportation Volumes (MBbls/d) 3,816 2,784 Crude Terminals Volumes (MBbls/d) 2,059 1,573 Revenues $ 3,938 $ 2,393 Cost of products sold 3,255 2,086 Segment margin 683 307 Unrealized losses on commodity risk management activities 4 2 Operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (125 ) (62 ) Selling, expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (20 ) (14 ) Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates 2 4 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 544 $ 237 For the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period last year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA related to our crude oil transportation and services segment increased due to the following:\nan increase of $247 million resulting primarily from placing our Bakken Pipeline in service in the second quarter of 2017, as well as the acquisition of a crude oil gathering system in West Texas and the addition of certain joint venture crude transportation assets; an increase of $57 million from existing transport assets due to increased volumes throughout the system; an increase of $61 million in margin from our crude oil acquisition and marketing business; and an increase of $12 million from Nederland terminal due to increased crude throughput fees and tank rentals; offset by an increase of $63 million in operating expenses primarily due to an increase of $38 million resulting primarily from placing the Bakken Pipeline, as well as certain joint venture crude transportation assets in service in the first and second quarter of 2017, and an increase of $22 million from existing transport assets mainly due to higher utilities, line testing, environmental costs and maintenance dredging; and an increase of $6 million in selling, expenses primarily due to merger costs and legal fees.\nAll Other\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Revenue $ 652 $ 751 Cost of products sold 550 679 Segment margin 102 72 Unrealized losses on commodity risk management activities 3 7 Operating expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (31 ) (22 ) Selling, expenses, excluding non-cash compensation expense (21 ) (26 ) Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates 69 77 Other — 24 Elimination 2 13 Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 124 $ 145 Amounts reflected in our all other segment primarily include:\nour equity method investment in limited partnership units of Sunoco LP.
