    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. budget deal announced on Wednesday in the Senate would increase military and non-defense spending over two years, boost infrastructure investments and extend a popular children’s health insurance program, a congressional source familiar with the agreement said.\nThe deal would increase non-defense spending by $131 billion and include $20 billion for infrastructure, the source said. It also would extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for 10 years instead of the current six years, according to the source.\nReporting by Richard Cowan; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham\n ",
