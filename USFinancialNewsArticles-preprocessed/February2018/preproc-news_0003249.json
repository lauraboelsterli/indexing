    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Meredith Corporation (NYSE: MDP; meredith.com ) announced today it has completed its acquisition of Time Inc., and that February 1, 2018, will be the first day of operations for the combined company. Time Inc. shareholders received $18.50 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.8 billion originally announced on November 26, 2017.\nMeredith also announced fiscal 2018 second quarter and first half results today. The details are included later in this release.\n\"With this acquisition, we are creating a premier media and marketing company serving 200 million American consumers that's positioned for growth across industry-leading digital, television, print, video, mobile, and social platforms,\" said Meredith Corporation Chairman and CEO Stephen M. Lacy. \"The combined portfolio joins the rich content-creation capabilities of many of the media industry's strongest national brands with a powerful local television business that is generating record earnings.\"\n\"I want to welcome our new employees to Meredith,\" said Meredith President and Chief Operating Officer Tom Harty. \"Together, we are eager to start serving consumers and advertisers alike with trusted, premium multi-platform content and innovative marketing solutions. Since our announcement, teams from Meredith and Time have been developing an integration plan that has positioned us to hit the ground running. We look forward to delivering on our pledge to achieve the identified synergies and grow shareholder value.\"\nKey Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Time Inc. Acquisition:\nCreates an unparalleled portfolio of national media brands with greater scale and efficiency – Combined, Meredith's brands now have a readership of more than 135 million and paid circulation of nearly 60 million, with leading positions in entertainment, food, lifestyle, news and sports, parenting, and home content creation, as well as enhanced positions in the beauty, fashion, and luxury advertising categories. Continues the strong and growing contribution from Meredith's Local Media Group – Meredith's portfolio of 17 high-performing television stations in 12 markets is a consistent generator of strong cash flow. Meredith's stations — which reach 11 percent of U.S. television households — are primarily Big 4 network affiliates located in fast-growing markets. Advances Meredith's digital position by adding significant scale – Meredith is now a Top 10 digital media company with approximately 170 million monthly unique visitors in the U.S., over 10 billion annual video views, and nearly $700 million in annualized digital advertising revenues. Meredith is well-positioned to benefit from fast-growing advertising platforms, including native, video, shopper marketing, programmatic and social. It now operates the No. 1 premium content digital network for American consumers with unmatched reach to Millennials, including 85 percent of U.S. Millennial women. Provides consumer revenue diversification and growth – Meredith expects to increase consumer revenue from diversified streams, including bundled circulation activities that leverage its reach to nearly 60 million individual magazine subscribers; brand licensing; and e-commerce. Enhances financial strength and flexibility – Meredith expects the acquisition will be accretive to free cash flow in the first full year of operations. Meredith anticipates generating annual cost synergies at the high end of its previously stated range of $400 million to $500 million in the first two full years of combined operations. Meredith has an excellent track record of achieving cost synergies with prior acquisitions, and is confident in its ability to optimize the cost structure of the combined business. Increases Total Shareholder Return – Meredith remains committed to delivering top-third Total Shareholder Return. On January 27, 2018, Meredith raised its annual dividend 4.8 percent to $2.18 per share, the 25 th straight year it has raised its dividend. Meredith has now paid a dividend for 71 consecutive years.\n\"This portfolio of media assets offers advertisers and marketers unparalleled reach to American consumers,\" Harty said. \"In particular, we are creating a powerful digital media business that enhances Meredith's leadership position in reaching Millennials.\"\nFinancing Highlights:\nTo finance the transaction, Meredith secured the following:\n$1.8 billion of senior secured term loans (Term Loan B) maturing in 2025 and priced at LIBOR plus 3.00 percent $1.4 billion of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2026 and priced at 6.875 percent $350 million of a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility that is currently undrawn $650 million investment from a private equity firm\nThese proceeds were used to finance the acquisition, refinance existing debt and pay transaction costs.\nMEREDITH REPORTS FISCAL 2018 SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF RESULTS\nMeredith today reported fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings per share were $3.49, compared to $1.58 per share in the prior-year period. Fiscal 2018 second quarter results included the following special items:\nA benefit of $2.92 per share related to changes to the U.S. corporate income tax rate Transaction expenses of $0.23 per share related to Meredith's acquisition of Time Inc. A charge of $0.34 per share related to the impairment of a trademark and a realignment in Meredith's National Media Group\nExcluding these special items, fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings per share were $1.14. This compares to earnings per share excluding special items of $1.30 in the prior-year period. As expected in an off-election year, Meredith recorded $38 million, or $0.52 per share, less of high-margin incremental political advertising revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 than in the prior year. (See Tables 1-4 for supplemental disclosures regarding non-GAAP financial measures.)\n\"We were quite pleased to report record earnings per share for a non-political second quarter and first half, driven by strong growth in non-political advertising revenue in our Local Media Group, along with record digital performance and solid expense discipline in our National Media Group,\" said Lacy.\nLooking more closely at Meredith's fiscal 2018 second quarter results compared to the prior-year period:\nLocal Media Group revenues were $170 million. Non-political advertising revenues grew 13 percent to $104 million, driven by strong performance in the Phoenix, Atlanta and Las Vegas markets. Other revenues increased 25 percent, primarily due to growth in retransmission revenues. Operating profit was $51 million, a record for a non-political second quarter. National Media Group revenues were $247 million. Operating profit was $12 million, compared to $47 million. Excluding special items in both periods, operating profit increased 2 percent to $35 million, driven primarily by lower operating expenses in Meredith's magazine business, along with revenue growth from its digital and circulation activities. Total Company digital advertising revenues were a record for any fiscal quarter. Traffic across Meredith's digital properties averaged 89 million monthly unique visitors. Digital advertising revenues accounted for 44 percent of the National Media Group's advertising revenues. Total revenues were $418 million, compared to $443 million in the prior-year period, reflecting the absence of $38 million of political advertising revenue.\nFiscal 2018 first half earnings per share were $4.23, or $1.83 excluding special items. In comparison, prior-year earnings per share were $2.33, or $2.05 excluding special items. Meredith recorded $53 million, or $0.72 per share, less of high-margin incremental political advertising revenues in the first half of fiscal 2018 than in the prior year, as expected in an off-election year. Total company revenues were $810 million, compared to $843 million in the prior-year period.\nAll earnings-per-share figures in the text of this release are diluted. Both basic and diluted earnings per share can be found in the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings. All fiscal 2018 second quarter and first half comparisons are against the comparable prior-year period unless otherwise stated.\nIMPACT OF TAX REFORM\nThe \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\" (the Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Meredith will have a blended federal rate of 28 percent retroactive to the beginning of its fiscal 2018.\nThe reduced rate resulted in an adjustment to lower fiscal 2018 first quarter tax expense by $4 million. Meredith recorded this adjustment in its fiscal 2018 second quarter. In addition, absent the Act, Meredith estimates that second quarter tax expense on second quarter earnings would have been $4 million higher.\nAlso as a result of the Act, Meredith remeasured its deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and tax reserves during its second fiscal quarter, resulting in a net tax benefit of $133 million that Meredith reported as a special item.\nOUTLOOK\nMeredith is temporarily altering its outlook practices due to the following factors:\nThe ongoing review of the combined Company's media portfolio, following today's closing of its acquisition of Time Inc. The impact of tax reform on the combined company The timing of the identified synergies Evaluation of Time Inc.'s balance sheet as part of the purchase accounting process, including performing fair value calculations\nMeredith expects to resolve these items and provide a more definitive outlook, including expectations for revenue and profit for the balance of its fiscal 2018, when it reports fiscal 2018 third quarter results in late April.\nMeredith expects to return to its traditional guidance methodology in July when it reports full year fiscal 2018 results and updates expectations for its fiscal 2019.\nCONFERENCE CALL WEBCAST\nMeredith will host a conference call on January 31, 2018, at 4:30 pm EST to discuss the closing and integration of the Time Inc. acquisition and fiscal 2018 second quarter results. A live webcast will be accessible to the public on the Company's website, and a replay will be available for two weeks. A transcript will be available within 48 hours of the call at meredith.com .\nRATIONALE FOR USE AND ACCESS TO NON-GAAP RESULTS\nManagement uses and presents GAAP and non-GAAP results to evaluate and communicate its performance. Non-GAAP measures should not be construed as alternatives to GAAP measures. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin are common supplemental measures of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes that EBITDA provides an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from core operations and delineate underlying trends. Management does not use EBITDA as a measure of liquidity or funds available for management's discretionary use because it excludes certain contractual and non-discretionary expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding special items.\nResults excluding special items are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures. While these adjusted results are not a substitute for reported results under GAAP, management believes this information is useful as an aid in further understanding Meredith's current performance, performance trends and financial condition. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are attached to this press release and available at meredith.com .\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
