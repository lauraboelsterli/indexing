    "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece gave the green light to its gaming committee to launch a tender for a new casino license, removing another obstacle for a major tourism project in Athens, which is a key conditionality of the country’s international bailout.\nThe decision was published in the Feb. 22 Government Gazette, the same day as Greece’s top administrative court approved the project’s development plan.\nA finance ministry official told Reuters that an advisor for the tender would be hired soon.\nProperty developer Lamda signed a 99-year lease with the state in 2014 to convert 620 hectares of wasteland at the former Hellenikon Athens airport into a complex of luxury residences, hotels, a yachting marina, including a casino.\nProgress on the project, which has been beset by delays, is being watched closely by Greece’s creditors as a test of the government’s commitment to privatizations under its multi-billion euro bailout.\nReporting by Lefteris Papadimas, editing by David Evans\n ",
