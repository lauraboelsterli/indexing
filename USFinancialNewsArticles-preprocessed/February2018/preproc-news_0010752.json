The Dow closed at 18,332.74 on Election Day, Nov. 8, 2016, which means it has 6,013 points to go before the Trump rally gains disappear. \nAfter Monday's market close, the White House said Trump is focused on the country's \"long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong.\" WATCH: The market's 'tumultuous Trump tumble' show chapters ",
