    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ziyen Inc.’s Energy Division are proud to announce they have acquired the mineral rights to an additional two oil fields in the Illinois basin; making a total of 5 oil fields held by the company. The most recent acquisitions total 260 acres, one which is 140 acres and another 120 acres, respectively.\nThis time Ziyen Inc. have acquired the mineral rights, including the oil, gas and coal, which provides an excellent long-term asset for the company.\nZiyen Inc. Oil Intelligence Director, Shane Fraser said,\n“As we steadily continue to grow the list of assets Ziyen Energy has acquired in the last few months, we keep in mind the importance of having a good overall historical picture of the land on which the mineral rights we own are now located; these last two acquisitions in particular have extensive geological surveys, which gives us a good indication of the plans we will need to draft in order to commence oil production.”\nAlastair Caithness, CEO, stated\n“It has been just over 6 months since we picked up our first oil asset and now we have acquired 5 in the Illinois Basin. We are on track to reaching our goal of acquiring $500 million in oil reserve assets and we plan on bidding on more oil leases and mineral rights in the next few months.”\nFor information on investing in Ziyen, please visit the company website at www.ziyen.com , or for a copy of the latest company overview, please email marketing@ziyen.com\nAbout Ziyen Inc.\nFounded in 2016, Ziyen Inc. is a Scottish-American company developing cutting edge procurement software to provide clients with industry specific government and private contracts via procurement portals.
