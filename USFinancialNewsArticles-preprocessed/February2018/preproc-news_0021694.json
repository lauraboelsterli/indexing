    "text": "Kyrie Irving poured in 28 points to help keep the Boston Celtics in first place in the Eastern Conference with a 110-104 overtime win against the host Washington Wizards 110-104 on Thursday night.\nIrving’s efforts were aided by 18 points from Jaylen Brown and 15 from Marcus Morris for Boston, which remained a game up on Toronto atop the East standings after the Raptors’ win in New York.\nOtto Porter Jr. had 27 points and Bradley Beal netted 18 for the Wizards, who were playing their seventh straight game without John Wall after the All-Star point guard underwent left knee surgery.\nBoston bounced back from a 111-91 rout in Toronto on Tuesday to win for the fifth time in six games. Washington has dropped two in a row after its season-high, five-game winning streak.\nGreg Monroe had five points and six rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench in his Celtics debut after signing with Boston earlier in the day following a buyout from the Phoenix Suns.\nBrown’s 3-pointer beat the shot clock to put Boston up 108-103 with 1:43 left in overtime. Kelly Oubre Jr. made one of two free throws with 1:14 to go to bring Washington within four.\nAfter missed 3-point attempts by Beal and Porter, Irving claimed a rebound and was fouled by Beal with 15.5 ticks to go. Irving made both free throws to seal the win.\nBoston trailed 51-49 at halftime but outscored Washington 26-19 in a pivotal third quarter to open a 75-70 advantage heading into the fourth.\nPorter hit a pair of free throws with 12.8 second to go to in regulation give the Wizards a 98-95 edge. Irving was fouled by Markieff Morris on a leaning 3-point attempt with 9.8 seconds left and made all three free throws to tie it.\nBeal’s turnaround jumper at the buzzer was off target, forcing overtime.\nBoston opens a three-game homestand Friday against Indiana. Washington kicks off a three-game trip Saturday in Chicago.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
