Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA for incentive compensation purposes. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenues.
