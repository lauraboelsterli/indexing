    "text": "DULUTH, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AGCO, Your Agriculture Company (NYSE:AGCO), a worldwide manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment, reported net sales of approximately $2.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately 20.7% compared to net sales of approximately $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported net income was $0.55 per share and adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses and a tax charge related to U.S. tax reform, was $1.10 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. These results compare to reported net income of $0.77 per share and adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses, of $0.84 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding favorable currency translation impacts of approximately 5.9%, net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased approximately 14.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet sales for the full year of 2017 were approximately $8.3 billion, an increase of approximately 12.1% compared to 2016. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation of approximately 1.6%, net sales for the full year of 2017 increased approximately 10.5% compared to 2016. For the full year of 2017, reported net income was $2.32 per share and adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses, a non-cash expense related to waived stock compensation and a tax charge related to U.S. tax reform, was $3.02 per share. These results compare to reported net income of $1.96 per share and adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring expenses and a non-cash deferred income tax adjustment, of $2.47 per share for the full year of 2016.\nHighlights\nReported fourth quarter regional sales results (1) : Europe/Middle East (“EME”) +25.9%, North America +18.9%, South America +2.5%, Asia/Pacific/Africa (“APA”) +23.0% Constant currency fourth quarter regional sales results (1)(2)(3) : EME +16.6%, North America +17.4%, South America +3.2%, APA +16.8% Generated $578 million in cash flow from operations and $374 million in free cash flow (3) in 2017 Quarterly dividend increased to $0.15 per share effective first quarter 2018 Full-year earnings forecast for 2018 remains at approximately $3.50 per share\n(1) As compared to fourth quarter 2016\n(2) Excludes currency translation impact.\n(3) See reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures in appendix.\n“Stabilizing market demand and solid operational execution allowed AGCO to meet its financial targets for 2017 and deliver improved results compared to 2016,” stated Martin Richenhagen, AGCO’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Over the past few years, we worked diligently on cost reduction strategies targeted at purchasing actions, factory productivity as well as new product development, which now positions us well to seek new opportunities for growth. Looking forward to 2018, we are forecasting further earnings improvement as industry conditions trend positively from the lower end of the agricultural equipment cycle in key markets. In addition to cost management, we will continue to make long-term investments to raise the efficiency of our factories, improve our service levels and strengthen our product offerings.”\nMarket Update\nIndustry Unit Retail Sales\nTractors\nCombines\nChange from Change from Year ended December 31, 2017\nPrior Year Period\nPrior Year Period\nNorth America (1) Flat 10% South America 13% 13% Western Europe (2) 4% (6)% (1)\nExcludes compact tractors.\n(2) Based on Company estimates.\n“The 2017 global harvest is the fourth consecutive year of near record production,” continued Mr. Richenhagen. “With these robust harvests, crop production has outpaced demand, thereby keeping crop prices and farm income at relatively low levels. Global industry farm equipment demand started to recover following three years of strong declines. In North America, the farm equipment fleet has begun to age, and industry retail sales were mixed throughout 2017. Tractor and combine demand was higher compared to last year, while sales in other row crop equipment remained weak. Overall, we project industry tractor sales to be relatively flat in 2018 compared to 2017, with some modest improvements in combines and hay equipment. Industry retail sales in Western Europe improved in 2017, but remained below historic levels. Growth was strongest in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Recovery in the dairy sector provided support to retail sales and helped improve overall confidence in the region. While farm income remains under pressure due to low commodity prices, 2018 farm income is expected to improve modestly driven primarily by better dairy economics and higher 2017 wheat production. Based on these assumptions, we expect farmer sentiment to remain positive and 2018 demand to be relatively flat compared to 2017 levels. Industry retail sales in South America increased during 2017 as demand in Brazil grew strongly from depressed first-half levels experienced last year. Industry sales in Brazil slowed in the second half of 2017, however, as ongoing macroeconomic weakness continued to hurt farmer confidence. Industry demand in Argentina remained robust as more supportive government policies continued to stimulate growth. Our South American industry forecast for 2018 assumes industry sales are flat to modestly up compared to 2017. Our long-term global view remains positive. Increasing demand for commodities, driven by the growing world population, rising emerging market protein consumption and biofuel use, are expected to support elevated farm income and healthy conditions in our industry.”\nRegional Results\nAGCO Regional Net Sales (in millions)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 %\nchange\nfrom\n2016\n% change\nfrom 2016 due\nto currency\ntranslation (1)\n% change from\n2016 due to\nacquisitions (1)\nNorth America $ 531.8 $ 447.4 18.9% 1.5% 4.3% South America 315.9 308.1 2.5% (0.7)% 0.5% EME 1,434.6 1,139.3 25.9% 9.4% 1.5% APA 245.1 199.2 23.0% 6.2% 4.6% Total $ 2,527.4 $ 2,094.0 20.7% 5.9% 2.2% Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 %\nchange\nfrom\n2016\n% change\nfrom 2016 due\nto currency\ntranslation (1)\n% change from\n2016 due to\nacquisitions (1)\nNorth America $ 1,876.7 $ 1,807.7 3.8% 0.3% 2.1% South America 1,063.5 917.5 15.9% 4.5% 0.4% EME 4,614.3 4,089.7 12.8% 1.4% 2.7% APA 752.0 595.6 26.3% 2.3% 4.0% Total $ 8,306.5 $ 7,410.5 12.1% 1.6% 2.4% (1) See Footnotes for additional disclosures\n(2) Effective January 1, 2017, AGCO realigned its regional structure as reflected in the table above. A schedule showing restated segment results for 2016 is available on AGCO’s website at www.agcocorp.com on the “Company/Investors” page.\nNorth America\nNorth American net sales increased approximately 3.6% in the full year of 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the positive impact of currency translation. Acquisitions benefited sales by approximately 2% in 2017. Mixed industry demand and dealer inventory reduction efforts pressured sales volumes. Sales growth in tractors, driven by new product introductions, were mostly offset by sales declines in hay tools, sprayers and grain storage equipment. Income from operations increased approximately $25.6 million for the full year of 2017 compared to 2016 due to the benefit of higher sales and margin improvement.\nSouth America\nNet sales in the South American region improved approximately 11.4%, excluding favorable currency translation impacts, in the full year of 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by significantly higher sales in Argentina and modest growth in Brazil. Income from operations decreased approximately $5.4 million for the full year of 2017 compared to 2016 due to the negative impact of material cost inflation and higher costs related to the localization of emissions compliant products.\nEurope/Middle East\nAGCO’s EME net sales increased approximately 11.4% in the full year of 2017 compared to 2016, excluding favorable currency translation. Acquisitions benefited sales by approximately 3% during 2017 compared to the full year of 2016. Most of the sales growth was achieved in the key markets of the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. Income from operations increased approximately $90.6 million for the full year of 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher sales and improved margins resulting from new product introductions and increased production.\nAsia/Pacific/Africa\nNet sales in AGCO’s Asia/Pacific/Africa region, excluding the positive impact of currency translation, increased approximately 23.9% in the full year of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Sales growth was driven primarily by China and Australia. Acquisitions benefited sales by approximately 4% during the full year of 2017 compared to the same period last year. Income from operations improved approximately $29.1 million in 2017 compared to the full year of 2016 due to higher sales and production levels.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nThe income tax provision during the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a one-time charge of approximately $42.0 million resulting from the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The charge includes an estimate of approximately $14.3 million related to the transition tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.\nOutlook\nRelatively stable industry demand is anticipated across all regions in 2018. AGCO’s net sales for 2018 are expected to reach approximately $9.1 billion reflecting improved sales volumes, positive pricing as well as acquisition and foreign currency translation impacts. Gross and operating margins are expected to improve from 2017 levels, reflecting the positive impact of pricing and cost reduction efforts partially offset by increased engineering expenses. Based on these assumptions, 2018 earnings per share is targeted to be approximately $3.50.\n* * * * *\nAGCO will be hosting a conference call with respect to this earnings announcement at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, February 6, 2018. The Company will refer to slides on its conference call. The conference call and slide presentation can be accessed on AGCO’s website at www.agcocorp.com in the “Events” section on the “Company/Investors” page of our website. A replay of the conference call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the conference call for twelve months following the call. A copy of this press release will be available on AGCO’s website for at least twelve months following the call.\n* * * * *\nSafe Harbor Statement\nStatements that are not historical facts, including the projections of earnings per share, sales, industry demand, market conditions, world population, biofuel use and protein consumption, currency translation, farm income levels, margin levels, industry inventory levels, investments in product and technology development, cost reduction initiatives, production volumes, and general economic conditions, are forward-looking and subject to risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the statements. The following are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nOur financial results depend entirely upon the agricultural industry, and factors that adversely affect the agricultural industry generally, including declines in the general economy, increases in farm input costs, lower commodity prices, lower farm income and changes in the availability of credit for our retail customers, will adversely affect us. A majority of our sales and manufacturing take place outside the United States, and, many of our sales involve products that are manufactured in one country and sold in a different country, and as a result, we are exposed to risks related to foreign laws, taxes and tariffs, trade restrictions, economic conditions, labor supply and relations, political conditions and governmental policies. These risks may delay or reduce our realization of value from our international operations. Most retail sales of the products that we manufacture are financed, either by our joint ventures with Rabobank or by a bank or other private lender. Our joint ventures with Rabobank, which are controlled by Rabobank and are dependent upon Rabobank for financing as well, finance approximately 40% of the retail sales of our tractors and combines in the markets where the joint ventures operate. Any difficulty by Rabobank to continue to provide that financing, or any business decision by Rabobank as the controlling member not to fund the business or particular aspects of it (for example, a particular country or region), would require the joint ventures to find other sources of financing (which may be difficult to obtain), or us to find another source of retail financing for our customers, or our customers would be required to utilize other retail financing providers. As a result of the recent economic downturn, financing for capital equipment purchases generally has become more difficult in certain regions and in some cases, can be expensive to obtain. To the extent that financing is not available or available only at unattractive prices, our sales would be negatively impacted. Both AGCO and our finance joint ventures have substantial account receivables from dealers and end customers, and we would be adversely impacted if the collectability of these receivables was not consistent with historical experience; this collectability is dependent upon the financial strength of the farm industry, which in turn is dependent upon the general economy and commodity prices, as well as several of the other factors listed in this section. We have experienced substantial and sustained volatility with respect to currency exchange rate and interest rate changes, including uncertainty associated with the Euro, which can adversely affect our reported results of operations and the competitiveness of our products. Our success depends on the introduction of new products, particularly engines that comply with emission requirements, which requires substantial expenditures. Our production levels and capacity constraints at our facilities, including those resulting from plant expansions and systems upgrades at our manufacturing facilities, could adversely affect our results. Our expansion plans in emerging markets, including establishing a greater manufacturing and marketing presence and growing our use of component suppliers, could entail significant risks. We depend on suppliers for components, parts and raw materials for our products, and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed, or by us to promptly address supplier issues, will adversely impact our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products. We also are subject to raw material price fluctuations, which can adversely affect our manufacturing costs. We face significant competition, and if we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers, we would lose customers and our net sales and profitability would decline. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and, as a result, we are subject to certain restrictive covenants and payment obligations that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.\nFurther information concerning these and other factors is included in AGCO’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent Form 10-Qs. AGCO disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.\n* * * * *\nAbout AGCO\nAGCO (NYSE: AGCO) is a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of agricultural solutions and supports more productive farming through its full line of equipment and related services.

SEGMENT REPORTING\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company modified its system of reporting, resulting from changes to its internal management and organizational structure, which changed its reportable segments from North America; South America; Europe/Africa/Middle East; and Asia/Pacific to North America; South America; Europe/Middle East; and Asia/Pacific/Africa. The Asia/Pacific/Africa reportable segment includes the regions of Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Europe/Africa/Middle East segment no longer includes certain markets in Africa. Effective January 1, 2017, these reportable segments are reflective of how the Company’s chief operating decision maker reviews operating results for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.\nThe Company’s four reportable segments distribute a full range of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts. The Company evaluates segment performance primarily based on income from operations. Sales for each segment are based on the location of the third-party customer. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses and engineering expenses are charged to each segment based on the region and division where the expenses are incurred. As a result, the components of income from operations for one segment may not be comparable to another segment. Segment results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31, North America\nSouth America\nEurope/ Middle East\nAsia/ Pacific/Africa\nConsolidated\n2017 Net sales $ 531.8 $ 315.9 $ 1,434.6 $ 245.1 $ 2,527.4 Income from operations 12.0 0.7 163.4 25.6 201.7 2016 Net sales $ 447.4 $ 308.1 $ 1,139.3 $ 199.2 $ 2,094.0 (Loss) income from operations (4.9 ) 13.6 122.0 11.3 142.0 Years Ended December 31, North America\nSouth America\nEurope/\nMiddle East Asia/\nPacific/Africa Consolidated\n2017 Net sales $ 1,876.7 $ 1,063.5 $ 4,614.3 $ 752.0 $ 8,306.5 Income from operations 64.7 14.5 500.0 48.8 628.0 2016 Net sales $ 1,807.7 $ 917.5 $ 4,089.7 $ 595.6 $ 7,410.5 Income from operations 39.1 19.9 409.4 19.7 488.1 A reconciliation from the segment information to the consolidated balances for income from operations is set forth below:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Segment income from operations $ 201.7 $ 142.0 $ 628.0 $ 488.1 Corporate expenses (34.7 ) (29.4 ) (120.9 ) (119.7 ) Stock compensation (expense) credit (6.5 ) 1.1 (35.6 ) (16.9 ) Restructuring expenses (2.7 ) (6.4 ) (11.2 ) (11.9 ) Amortization of intangibles (15.5 ) (15.9 ) (57.0 ) (51.2 ) Consolidated income from operations $ 142.3 $ 91.4 $ 403.3 $ 288.4 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nThis earnings release discloses adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, net sales on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, each of which excludes amounts that are typically included in the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of each of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of reported income from operations, net income and net income per share to adjusted income from operations, net income and net income per share for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Income From\nOperations\nNet Income (1) Net Income\nPer Share (1)\nIncome From\nOperations\nNet Income (1)\nNet Income\nPer Share (1)\nAs reported $ 142.3 $ 44.3 $ 0.55 $ 91.4 $ 62.0 $ 0.77 Restructuring expenses (2) 2.7 2.4 0.03 6.4 5.6 0.07 U.S. tax reform (3) — 42.0 0.52 — — — As adjusted $ 145.0 $ 88.7 $ 1.10 $ 97.8 $ 67.6 $ 0.84 (1) Net income and net income per share amounts are after tax. (2) The restructuring expenses recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 related primarily to severance costs associated with the Company’s rationalization of certain U.S., European, South American and Chinese manufacturing operations and various administrative offices. (3) During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42.0 million resulting from the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The charge includes an estimate of approximately $14.3 million related to the transition tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, with the remainder primarily related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower U.S. corporate tax rate, as well as other tax impacts associated with unremitted foreign earnings. The one-time charge related to the enacted tax reform legislation is based on the Company’s current estimates. The final impact of the tax reform legislation may differ materially due to factors such as further refinement of the Company’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company and its advisors have made, additional guidance that may be issued in the future by the U.S. government, and actions that the Company may take as a result of the legislation.

(3) The restructuring expenses recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 related primarily to severance costs associated with the Company’s rationalization of certain U.S., European, South American and Chinese manufacturing operations and various administrative offices. (4) The Company recorded accelerated stock compensation expense associated with a waived award declined by the Company’s CEO of approximately $4.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. (5) The Company recorded a non-cash adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred income tax assets of approximately $31.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016. (6) During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a one-time charge of approximately $42.0 million resulting from the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017, as previously described.
