    "text": "WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Treliant has promoted two executives to senior positions in its litigation support and global financial crimes compliance service areas, underscoring its breadth of services to clients.\nBenjamin “B.J.” McComas was named Managing Director for Treliant’s litigation support service and Constandino “Dino” Papagiannis was named a Principal in the firm’s global financial crimes compliance service. Both promotions recognize the executives’ leadership in areas of growing significance for Treliant’s clients.\n“Treliant has made its mark by cultivating an exceptional team to serve industries that are grappling with constant business and regulatory change,” said Susanna K. Tisa, Treliant's Chief Executive Officer. “B.J. and Dino are two standouts who consistently demonstrate knowledge and insight into risk management and compliance, and exemplify our commitment to help clients resolve pressing priorities.”\nB.J. McComas works closely with clients and their legal representatives in connection with litigation and enforcement actions. He draws on more than a decade in practice as an attorney and consultant. McComas has served as “first chair” attorney in both jury and bench trials. While at Treliant, he has organized the presentation of expert testimony in some of the largest financial services litigation to go to trial in the post-crisis era and has also led efforts on behalf of clients facing enforcement matters by state and federal regulators.\n“Since joining Treliant five years ago, B.J. has greatly enhanced the firm’s ability to provide expert support to financial services companies involved in litigation and disputes,” said Robert D. Broeksmit, Treliant’s President and Chief Operating Officer. “By combining courtroom experience with banking expertise, he plays a pivotal advisory role, helping financial services practitioners and their legal teams anticipate how litigation could unfold, communicate clearly, and prepare wisely.”\nDino Papagiannis specializes in handling complex matters involving regulatory and financial crimes compliance, including advising on formal and informal enforcement actions. He joined Treliant in March 2016 from GE Capital, where he was a managing director and audit executive responsible for oversight of global compliance and financial crimes compliance. He is a lawyer who has accumulated hands-on experience in Anti-Money Laundering, Bank Secrecy Act, and Office of Foreign Assets Control risk management programs over a 25-year compliance career in financial institutions, consulting firms, and state and federal agencies. Other areas of expertise include consumer compliance, enforcement action remediation, and enterprise risk management.\n“Enforcement actions due to compliance lapses can be costly and even devastating for organizations. Right-sizing compliance programs to an organization’s risks is essential to an effective and efficient program,” Managing Director Ross Marrazzo said. “Dino is a builder and leader of teams with a consistent track record of helping clients stay ahead of financial crimes issues and detect and correct shortcomings in compliance.”\nAbout Treliant\nTreliant provides financial services companies and consumer-oriented businesses with trusted advisory services that strengthen compliance, risk management, and business performance.
