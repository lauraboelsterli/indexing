FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders (2) $ 55.6 $ 69.2 -19.7 % $ 267.5 $ 322.6 -17.1 % Adjusted FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders (2) $ 60.0 $ 69.8 -14.0 % $ 280.1 $ 328.9 -14.8 % FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders per diluted share/unit (2) $ 0.49 $ 0.61 -19.7 % $ 2.36 $ 2.85 -17.2 % Adjusted FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders per diluted share/unit (2) $ 0.53 $ 0.62 -14.5 % $ 2.47 $ 2.90 -14.8 % (1) Full year 2017 net income and EBITDA (as defined below) included $85.5 million of gains from the sales of Hotel Deca, Lansdowne Resort, Alexis Hotel, Hotel Triton, and Westin Philadelphia. Full year 2016 net income and EBITDA included $104.8 million of gain from the sale of Indianapolis Marriott Downtown. (2) See the discussion of non-GAAP measures and the tables later in this press release for reconciliations from net income to such measures, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA, funds from operations (“FFO”), adjusted FFO and pro forma hotel EBITDA. Room revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) is presented on a pro forma basis to reflect hotels in the Company’s current portfolio. See “Statistical Data for the Hotels - Pro Forma” later in this press release. “During the fourth quarter, we began seven exciting room renovations and were able to re-open both of our resorts in Key West,” said Michael D. Barnello, President and Chief Executive Officer of LaSalle Hotel Properties. “We are grateful for all of the employees at Southernmost and Marker Key West for their hard work and dedication to re-opening for business, and it’s great to see the rest of Key West back to its pre-Irma vibrant lifestyle.”\n“Key West results negatively impacted RevPAR change for our portfolio by 160 basis points during the fourth quarter and by 75 basis points for the full year. Other challenges we faced included incremental renovation displacement and growing hotel supply. Despite the soft top line results, we are proud of our operators and asset management team’s ability to find continued efficiencies.”\nFull Year 2017 Results\nNet Income: The Company’s net income attributable to common shareholders was $175 million, which decreased by $60 million from 2016. RevPAR: Excluding Key West in the second half of the year, the Company’s 2017 RevPAR decreased 1.8% to $204, driven by a 1% reduction in average daily rate to $243 and an occupancy decline of 0.8% to 83.8%. Hotel EBITDA Margin: Excluding Key West in the second half of the year, the Company’s hotel EBITDA margin was 33.0%, which was 64 basis points below full year 2016. The Company’s hotel expenses declined by 1.1% from 2016. Adjusted EBITDA: The Company’s adjusted EBITDA was $339 million, a decrease of $57 million from 2016, which included $50 million from seven assets the Company sold between July 2016 and June 2017 (the “Disposed Assets”): Indianapolis Marriott Downtown, the mezzanine loan on Shutters on the Beach and Casa Del Mar, Hotel Deca, Lansdowne Resort, Alexis Hotel, Hotel Triton, and Westin Philadelphia.\nFull Year 2017 2016 % Var. (dollars in millions) Adjusted EBITDA $ 339.4 $ 396.8 -14.5 % Disposed Assets Hotel EBITDA (7.1 ) (49.5 ) Adjusted EBITDA for Comparable Portfolio $ 332.3 $ 347.3 -4.3 % Adjusted FFO: The Company generated adjusted FFO of $280 million, or $2.47 per diluted share/unit, compared to $329 million, or $2.90 per diluted share/unit, for full year 2016. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, the Disposed Assets provided approximately $47 million of adjusted FFO during 2016.\nKey West Impact Update: Both of the Company’s resorts in Key West are now fully open, following repairs from Hurricane Irma in September 2017. The Marker Waterfront Resort resumed full operations at the end of October 2017, and the Southernmost Beach Resort Key West re-opened its rooms in phases throughout the fourth quarter, with all rooms available by the end of December 2017. The Company maintains property, flood, fire and business interruption insurance at its two resorts in Key West. For the combined properties, insurance is subject to deductibles of approximately $5 million in total, which encompasses both property and business interruption coverage. The Company did not record any business interruption proceeds in 2017 due to Hurricane Irma. The Company is currently in the process of filing business interruption claims for both of the Key West properties.\nDisposition and Investment Activity\nAsset Sales: The Company completed five asset sales during 2017 for $409 million ($405,000 per key) at an average 6.8% trailing net operating income capitalization rate. The asset sales included Hotel Deca, Lansdowne Resort, Alexis Hotel, the leasehold interest in Hotel Triton, and Westin Philadelphia. Capital Investments: The Company invested $120 million of capital in its hotels throughout the year, completing renovations at L’Auberge Del Mar and Embassy Suites Philadelphia – Center City. During the fourth quarter, the Company invested $53 million of capital in its hotels, of which the majority was for ongoing renovations at the end of 2017 and into early 2018. The two largest projects are lifecycle rooms renovations at Westin Copley Place in Boston and Paradise Point Resort and Spa in San Diego. The Company will also be completing room renovations over the next few months at Chamberlain and Le Montrose in West Hollywood, Serrano Hotel and Harbor Court Hotel in San Francisco, and The Heathman Hotel in Portland.\nDuring 2018, the Company anticipates investing approximately $175 million of capital in its hotels, which includes some carryover from 2017 renovations and room renovations scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Markets Activities\nBalance Sheet Summary as of December 31, 2017: The Company had total outstanding debt of $1.1 billion, and total net debt to trailing 12 month Corporate EBITDA (as defined in the financial covenant section of the Company’s senior unsecured credit facility, adjusted for all cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet) was 2.1 times. The Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio was 5.5 times, and its weighted average interest rate for the fourth quarter was 3.1%. The Company had capacity of $773 million available on its credit facilities, in addition to $401 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. Credit Facility Refinancing: In January 2017, the Company refinanced $1.05 billion of debt, reducing the interest cost on its $750 million revolver and $300 million five-year term loan and extending their maturities to January 2022 (including the exercise of extension options pursuant to certain conditions). Share Repurchase Authorization: In February 2017, the Company’s Board of Trustees authorized an expanded share repurchase program to acquire up to an additional $500 million of the Company’s common shares. Including the previous authorization, the Company has $570 million of capacity remaining in its share repurchase program. The Company did not acquire any common shares during 2017 or to date during the first quarter of 2018. Series H Preferred Share Redemption: In May 2017, the Company redeemed all 2,750,000 of its issued and outstanding 7.5% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares. Interest Rate Hedge: In July 2017, the Company swapped the interest rate on its $300 million senior unsecured term loan to an all-in fixed rate of 3.23% through loan maturity in January 2022.\nFull Year 2018 Base Case Outlook\nThe Company is providing a full year base case outlook for 2018. The outlook is based on the current economic environment and assumes no acquisitions, dispositions, or capital markets activity other than repayment of the bonds on Hyatt Regency Boston Harbor on March 1, 2018. The Company’s RevPAR, hotel EBITDA margin, and financial expectations for 2018 are shown in the table below:\nFull Year 2018 Base Case (dollars in millions except per share/unit data) Net income $ 68 RevPAR change -2.0% Hotel expenses change 2.0% Hotel EBITDA margin 30.4% Hotel EBITDA margin change -275 bps Adjusted EBITDA $ 291 Adjusted FFO $ 235 Adjusted FFO per diluted share/unit $ 2.06 There are a few anomalies affecting the Company’s full year 2018 outlook. As a result, the Company has provided the following bridge to reconcile the impact of the Presidential inauguration, Hurricane Irma in Key West, San Francisco, renovation displacement versus prior year, and general market conditions.\nFull Year 2017 and 2018 RevPAR Bridge\nInauguration (1) Key West (2) San\nFrancisco (2)\nRenovation\nDisplacement\nSubtotal\nAnomalies\nMarket\nConditions\nFull Year 2017 RevPAR Impact 60 bps -75 bps -125 bps -5 bps -145 bps -115 bps -2.6% 2018 RevPAR Impact -70 bps 40 bps 65 bps -70 bps -35 bps -165 bps -2.0% (1) First quarter 2017 RevPAR (and the 2017 inauguration impact) did not include the results from Mason & Rook Hotel because it was not open for the first quarter of 2016. Mason & Rook Hotel is included in the full year 2018 outlook.\n(2) Assumes the Company regains approximately half of the 2017 RevPAR impact in 2018. First Quarter 2018 Base Case Outlook\nThe Company is providing a first quarter base case outlook for 2018, as shown in the following table.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Base Case (dollars in millions except per share/unit data) Net loss $ (7.8) RevPAR change -8.5% Adjusted EBITDA $ 41.5 Adjusted FFO $ 31.0 Adjusted FFO per diluted share/unit $ 0.27 There are a few anomalies affecting the Company’s first quarter 2018 outlook. As a result, the Company has provided the following bridge to reconcile the impact of the Presidential inauguration, renovation displacement versus prior year, and general market conditions.\nFirst Quarter 2017 and 2018 RevPAR Bridge\nInauguration (1) Renovation\nDisplacement\nSubtotal\nAnomalies\nMarket\nConditions\nFirst\nQuarter\nFirst Quarter 2017 RevPAR Impact 275 bps 100 bps 375 bps -235 bps 1.4% First Quarter 2018 RevPAR Impact -330 bps -265 bps -595 bps -255 bps -8.5% (1) First quarter 2017 RevPAR (and the 2017 inauguration impact) did not include the results from Mason & Rook Hotel because it was not open for the first quarter of 2016. Mason & Rook Hotel is included in the full year 2018 outlook.\nIf any of the foregoing estimates and assumptions prove to be inaccurate, actual results for the first quarter and full year 2018 may vary, and could vary significantly, from the amounts show above. Achievement of the anticipated results is subject to the risks discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDividend\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company declared a fourth quarter 2017 dividend of $0.45 per common share of beneficial interest.\nSince 2012, the Company has paid dividends of approximately 100% of its taxable income. In 2016 and 2017, the Company generated taxable gains of approximately $91 and $101 million, respectively, as a result of asset sales. These gains were included in the Company’s taxable income for each year. For both 2016 and 2017, the Company did not need to pay a special dividend, nor did it pay a dividend in excess of its normal requirement. Essentially, the Company distributed the gains from its asset sales to its shareholders through the regular payment of the dividend at $1.80 per common share.\nThe Company’s base case outlook for 2018 does not include any further dispositions or additional taxable gains. As such, if the 2018 base case materializes as expected, the Company is likely to reduce its annual dividend to a level that would continue to meet its REIT distribution requirements, which it currently estimates to be approximately $0.80 to $0.90 per common share. However, the actual dividend requirement will be impacted by several factors, including specific hotel performance, lessee income, and depreciation. The Company is not reducing its common dividend at this time and will continue to evaluate its options based on how the year progresses.\nIf the Company’s Board of Trustees does elect to reduce the dividend in this scenario, the Company would likely use the amount of cash equal to the dividend reduction to repurchase common shares under the share repurchase program.\nThe Company’s Board of Trustees has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form, and amount of any dividends. No assurance can be given that the Company will make dividends to shareholders at expected levels, or at all. In addition, the share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be suspended, modified, or terminated at any time for any reason without prior notice.\nEarnings Call\nThe Company will conduct its quarterly conference call on Wednesday, February 21, 2018 at 11:00 AM eastern time. To participate in the conference call, please dial (800) 406-5345 . Additionally, a live webcast of the conference call will be available through the Company’s website.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nFFO, EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA\nThe Company considers the non-GAAP measures of FFO (including FFO per share/unit), EBITDA and hotel EBITDA to be key supplemental measures of the Company’s performance and should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of the Company’s operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO, EBITDA and hotel EBITDA to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations.\nThe White Paper on FFO approved by NAREIT in April 2002, as revised in 2011, defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by GAAP as extraordinary, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairment writedowns, and after comparable adjustments for the Company’s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO consistent with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company.\nWith respect to FFO, the Company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items, real estate-related depreciation and amortization and impairments, and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs, even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders. However, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs.\nWith respect to EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of non-operating expenses and non-cash charges, and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance, can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization, and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between REITs, even though EBITDA also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nWith respect to hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses, non-cash items, and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities, provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control. The Company believes property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of its hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating its business on a property-level basis.\nFFO, EBITDA and hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, EBITDA and hotel EBITDA are not measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are FFO, EBITDA and hotel EBITDA indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. These measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred. FFO, EBITDA and hotel EBITDA may include funds that may not be available for management’s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, and other commitments and uncertainties. To compensate for this, management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the Company’s operating performance.\nAdjusted FFO and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company presents adjusted FFO (including adjusted FFO per share/unit) and adjusted EBITDA, which adjusts for certain additional items including gains on sale of property and impairment losses (to the extent included in EBITDA), acquisition transaction costs, costs associated with the departure of executive officers, costs associated with the recognition of issuance costs related to the calling of preferred shares and certain other items. The Company excludes these items as it believes it allows for meaningful comparisons with other REITs and between periods and is more indicative of the ongoing performance of its assets. As with FFO, EBITDA, and hotel EBITDA, the Company’s calculation of adjusted FFO and adjusted EBITDA may be different from similar adjusted measures calculated by other REITs.\nTrailing NOI Capitalization Rate\nThe Company calculates the capitalization rate by dividing the trailing 12-month net operating income of the subject hotels by the sales prices for such hotels. The Company defines net operating income as hotel revenues (room and other hotel operating revenues) less hotel expenses (hotel operating expenses, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance, ground rent, FF&E reserve, and other hotel expenses). The average capitalization rate is the simple average of the capitalization rates of the subject hotels.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220006551/en/\nLaSalle Hotel Properties\nKenneth G.
