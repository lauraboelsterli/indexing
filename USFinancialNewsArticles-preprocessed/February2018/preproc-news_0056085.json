    "text": "Today, all 680 of West Virginia's public schools were closed because of a state-wide teacher strike . Teachers are protesting for higher wages and better benefits.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), teachers in West Virginia are among the lowest paid in the country. Recent figures from the BLS estimate that the average annual income for a high school teacher in West Virginia is $45,240. In other parts of the country, teachers can make close to six figures. \nIn fact, the amount teachers earn can vary greatly by state. The BLS reports that the lowest-paid 10 percent of high school teachers earn less than $38,180 and the highest 10 percent earn more than $92,920. \nWest Virginia teachers are back in Charleston for a second day of picketing for higher wages. All public schools in the state are closed for a second day as a result of the work stoppage. Video from Christine Campbell: pic.twitter.com/xpbat4hYFs \nâ€” Sarah L. Jorgensen (@SarahLJorgensen) February 23, 2018 Pay disparity is one reason why Shawn Sheehan, Oklahoma's 2016 Teacher of the Year, decided to move to Texas , where teachers are paid significantly more. Last year he told NPR , \"It feels good because I know I'm doing the right thing for my family, but it also feels sad.\"\nAt the time Sheehan and his wife Kaysi, also a public school teacher, brought in $3,600 a month. \"After all bills are paid, we're sitting on about $400-450 per month,\" he explains.\nWhen the Sheehan family had their first child, they had to reassess their finances. \"Sure, life can be done on $400, $450 a month, but I would challenge others out there to buy diapers, groceries and all the things that you need for a family of three on $400,\" he says.\nThe average salary for a high school teacher in Oklahoma is $42,460. In Texas, the average salary is $55,500. Both of the Sheehans were offered positions that included $40,000 raises. \nAccording to the BLS, Oklahoma pays its teachers less than any other state. Here are the five highest and lowest-paying states for high school teachers: \nHero Images | Getty Images The five lowest-paying states for high school teachers: 1.

West Virginia \nAnnual mean wage: $45,240 \nJetta Productions | Getty Images As states compete to best educate their students, they also are vying for the best teachers. Hawaii, a state where the average salary for a high school teacher is $58,480, is facing a teacher shortage . The state is having difficulty filling 1,600 open teacher positions.\nBarbara Krieg, assistant superintendent for the Office of Human Resources, told the AP, \"Teachers are in such demand everywhere. Every school district is trying to steal from the other's district.\"\nThe five highest-paying states for high school teachers: 1. Alaska \nAnnual mean wage: $82,020 \n2.
