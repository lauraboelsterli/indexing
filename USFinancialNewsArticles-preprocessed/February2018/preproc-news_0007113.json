    "text": "AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian foreign ministry denied on Saturday U.S. allegations it had used chemical weapons against rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave near Damascus, saying the accusations were “lies” without evidence.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday the Syrian government had repeatedly used chlorine as a weapon. A day earlier, Washington said it was prepared to consider military action if necessary to deter chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian government.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
