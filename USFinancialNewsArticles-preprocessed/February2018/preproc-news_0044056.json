    "text": "PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The New York Attorney General's lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein further implicates Weinstein Company Board Members for creating a culture of sexual harassment and victimization of women.\nThe National women's group, Women United Now, is calling on The Everglades Foundation to remove Paul Tudor Jones, a long time personal friend of Harvey Weinstein and Weinstein Company board member, from their board and to give the $3,518,167 that Paul Tudor Jones donated to the Foundation in 2015 and 2016 to a fund for the victims of Harvey Weinstein.\nIn addition, they are calling on billionaire Paul Tudor Jones to give $100 Million to the same fund, as part of Women United's national campaign to hold Harvey Weinstein's billionaire board members accountable.\n\"It's time we shine light on not just predators like Weinstein, but also on the enablers like Paul Tudor Jones. By bringing these enablers to justice we can change the culture for all women. It starts with groups like The Everglades Foundation taking actions now to show they support the victims and not Paul Tudor Jones,\" stated Catrena Carter, Founder of Women United Now.\nJust this week, Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General of the State of New York, filed suit to stop the sale of The Weinstein Company. The suit stated:\nThe Attorney General brings this action to remedy a years-long gender-based hostile work environment, a pattern of quid pro quo sexual harassment, and routine misuse of corporate resources for unlawful ends that extended from in or about 2005 through at least in or about October 2017.\nThe company's management and board of directors were repeatedly presented with credible evidence of HW's sexual harassment of TWC employees and interns, and his use of corporate employees and resources to facilitate sexual activity with third parties, amidst allegations that HW had engaged in unlawful sexual conduct. (Document Attached).\nMr. Schneiderman also stated:\n\"Any sale of the Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enablers will be unjustly enriched,\" (New York Times).\nThe Harvey Weinstein scandal arose in October 2017, when over 100 women came forward with claims of sexual assault and abuse against Weinstein. These allegations date as far back as the 1970s. Paul Tudor Jones maintained a direct relationship to Harvey Weinstein- both as a board member and as a personal friend, continuing to support Weinstein even after the allegations against him had become public. In October 2017, Paul Tudor Jones emailed his friend, proclaiming, \"I love you,\" and telling Weinstein that \"everyone would soon forget about the allegations.\"\nPaul Tudor Jones has shown a pattern that is discriminatory towards women. In 2013, when asked at a UVA function why industrial trading was mostly men, he said that when women have children, it becomes a \"focus killer.\" Specifically, Jones told an audience of University of Virginia students, alumni and others that it is difficult for mothers to be successful traders because connecting with a child is a focus \"killer.\"\n\"As soon as that baby's lips touched that girl's bosom, forget it,\" Jones said, motioning to his chest. In the video of the event, Jones says, \"every single investment idea . . . every desire to understand what is going to make this go up or go down is going to be overwhelmed by the most beautiful experience . . . which a man will never share.\" As the video goes on, he says, \"You will never see as many great women investors or traders as men — period, end of story.\"\nCarter is a 30-year veteran of both the civil rights and women's movements and has led successful, grassroots efforts around the country by getting women involved in the political process, most recently the \"Vote or Die\" movement that defeated accused sexual predator, Roy Moore.\nWomen United Now is a next phase of the #MeToo movement. As their message states, now it's time to #DemandRespect. In addition to releasing ads, the group will also be launching a grassroots effort to shine a light on the structure of powerful and successful men that allow abuse to go unchecked and unreported.\n\"Until these men are exposed, the culture of tolerating assaults on women will continue,\" said Carter.\nEarlier this week, Women United Now announced they had collected more than 5,000 petitions at the University of Virginia, calling on the University to remove the Jones name from the Basketball Arena. The University of Pennsylvania removed the Wynn name from its building for similar actions by Steve Wynn.\nCarter, along with volunteers, will continue petitioning UVA throughout the month to have the Jones name removed from all UVA buildings.\nLearn more about Women United Now, get involved and sign the petition here:\nhttps://www.womenunitednow.org/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-womens-group-calls-on-the-everglades-foundation-to-remove-paul-tudor-jones-from-their-board-and-forfeit-donations-300602939.html\nSOURCE Women United Now",
