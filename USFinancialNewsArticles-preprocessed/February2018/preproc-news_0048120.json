    "text": "NEWARK, Calif., Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nShotSpotter, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSTI), the leader in gunshot detection solutions that help law enforcement officials and security personnel identify, locate and deter gun violence, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights\nQuarterly revenue increased to $6.5 million, a 43% increase from Q4 2016. Added 23 net new “go-live” square miles of coverage during the quarter. Achieved annual revenue retention rate of 141%. Reported sales and marketing spend for annualized contract revenue of $0.34 per $1.00. Announced a Smart Communities agreement with Verizon to add gunshot detection to its Light Sensory Network. Increased revenue guidance for full year 2018 to a range of $31 million to $33 million.\nManagement Commentary\n“We were pleased to end the year on a solid quarter, achieving 43% revenue growth while deploying 23 net new go-live miles in five cities, helping protect those at-risk communities from gun violence,” said Ralph Clark, CEO of ShotSpotter. “For the full year we saw growth accelerate across the business, including revenue, go-live miles deployed and total miles covered, even as we began to benefit from the financial leverage in our model. We look for this momentum to continue in 2018, as ShotSpotter’s technology is increasingly being recognized as a proven and effective method to address the growing problem of gun violence in cities across the United States and beyond.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 43% to $6.5 million from $4.6 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in revenues was driven by new customer deployments, expansion of miles covered with existing customers and strong customer renewal rates.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 56% to $3.2 million (49% of revenue) from $2.0 million (45% of revenue) in the same period of 2016. The increase in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily a result of subscription revenue growth outpacing cost of revenue, a large portion of which are fixed.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 107% to $5.4 million from $2.6 million in the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses included public company costs, including certain legal and listing expenses, as well as professional and outside service fees.\nNet loss totaled $2.5 million or $0.26 per share (based on 9.7 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared with a net loss of $0.9 million or $0.54 per share (based on 1.6 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding) in the same period in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues in 2017 increased 53% to $23.8 million from $15.5 million in 2016.\nGross profit in 2017 increased 95% to $11.6 million (49% of revenue) from $6.0 million (38% of revenue) in 2016. The increase in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily a result of subscription revenue growth outpacing cost of revenue, a large portion of which are fixed.\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 increased 46% to $15.9 million from $10.9 million in 2016. The increase in operating expenses included public company costs, including certain legal and listing expenses, as well as professional and outside service fees.\nNet loss totaled $10.0 million or $1.61 per share (based on 6.2 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared with a net loss of $6.9 million or $4.28 per share (based on 1.6 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding) in the same period in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company was debt free, had cash and cash equivalents of $19.6 million and short-term deferred revenue of $15.8 million.\n2018 Outlook\nThe company expects revenue for the full year 2018 to be approximately $31 to $33 million, revised upward from the previous revenue guidance range of approximately $30 to $32 million. The company remains on track to achieve GAAP profitability by the end of 2018.\nThe company’s outlook statements are based on current expectations.
