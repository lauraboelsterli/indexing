The notes are offered through a syndicate of agents led by Scotia Capital Inc., TD Securities Inc., and BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. Closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about March 1, 2018.\nThe 3.625 per cent 10-year Series CX notes were priced at $98.949 per $100 principal amount for an effective yield of 3.752 per cent per annum and will mature on March 1, 2028. The 4.70 per cent Series CW notes were priced at $101.411 per $100 principal amount for an effective yield of 4.612 per cent per annum and will mature on March 6, 2048.\nThe net proceeds will be used to repay approximately $725 million of outstanding commercial paper, as well as to fund the repayment, on maturity, of a portion of the $250 million principal amount outstanding on TELUS’ 1.50 per cent Series CS notes due March 27, 2018.
