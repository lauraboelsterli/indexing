    "text": "Why investors don’t understand their own risk tolerance February 21, 2018 \nWhen people start investing money, one of the exercises they engage in is determining their own risk tolerance. Usually, this process is handled by filling out some sort of questionnaire, such as the one below, that has multiple-choice questions: \nIf you had $10,000 to invest, would you: \n• Be willing to chance earning 30 percent growth knowing you could lose 30 percent? • Be willing to chance earning 10 percent growth knowing you could lose only 5 percent? • Be willing to lose nothing, knowing you could earn no more than 5 percent? \nWe often whiz through these quizzes at a blazing pace because, in a simulation exercise, we know exactly who we are. However, there are two types of behaviors that we have within our personality: How we act in a natural state, when we are relaxed and have no pressure, and the adaptive state, when we are under heavy pressure. Unfortunately, these quizzes don’t really put us under any pressure, so they don’t really tell us how we would react when markets are in roller coaster mode. \nWith the Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing two 1,000-point drops in recent weeks, and having fielded many, many investors’ calls, I was reminded that investors truly do not know how to measure risk. \nMore from Advisor Insight: ",
