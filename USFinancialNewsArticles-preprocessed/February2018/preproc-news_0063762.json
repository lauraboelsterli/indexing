    "text": "113 COMMENTS Last year Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett dismissed the need for a U.S. corporate income tax cut. He now calls the recently enacted federal rate reduction a “huge tailwind” for American business.\nCNBC reports :\n“It certainly means corporations will pay quite a bit less in tax than they otherwise would,” he said. “When we make money in 2018 domestically, and subject to a lot of little things here and there, basically we’ll be paying at 21 percent instead of 35 percent. That’s a lot of money.” Mr. Buffett is the world’s most famous investor for good reason. Since 1965 shares in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate have delivered compounded annual gains of almost 21%, more than double the 9.9% posted by the S&P 500. Mr. Buffett’s remarkable ability to select companies to buy has made him fabulously wealthy. Forbes pegs his net worth at nearly $90 billion. \nHe’s also become famous as a Democrat who favors higher taxes on the wealthy—although he’s been remarkably adept at finding perfectly legal ways to avoid taxation . \nMr. Buffett supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has expressed skepticism about the Trump tax plan. But give the Omaha billionaire credit for acknowledging in a Saturday letter to shareholders why the company’s earnings surged in 2017:\nBerkshire’s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 23%. Over the last 53 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value [for the A shares] has grown from $19 to $211,750, a rate of 19.1% compounded annually. The format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: A large portion of our gain did not come from anything we accomplished at Berkshire. The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real – rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire’s operations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code. A significant reduction in tax liabilities has made the company more valuable--just as the tax cut is doing for companies all over America. \nSpeaking of companies all over, Mr. Buffett and his Berkshire colleagues haven’t been buying all that many of them lately. Mr. Buffett says that in 2017 “prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers.” \nBut for the long haul the Berkshire boss counts himself among the optimists. “Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America’s economic soil remains fertile,” he says. “In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.” Mr. Buffett adds that “as has been the case since 1776 – whatever its problems of the minute, the American economy was going to move forward.”\nThe amazing returns at Berkshire no doubt help Mr. Buffett maintain his sunny outlook. And he notes that a key ingredient in Berkshire’s success has been that he and his colleague Charlie Munger share a healthy reluctance to take on debt: \nOur aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need. We held this view 50 years ago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold it today after a million or so “partners” have joined us at Berkshire. The 320 million or so partners in the wonderful enterprise called America can only hope that someday Washington politicians will develop such an aversion.\n***\nIn Other News \nSo Much for the War on Drugs \n“Supreme Court case could deal major blow to unions in New York,” New York Post, Feb. 24 \nGolden State Back in Play? \n“Feinstein blocked from California Democratic Party backing and activists fracture in governor’s race,” Los Angeles Times, Feb. 25 \nThe Oxfam Incident \n“Oxfam loses 7,000 donors since sexual exploitation scandal,” The Guardian, Feb. 20 \n***\nBottom Stories of the Day \nIt’s On \n“The fight against ‘fake meat’ has officially begun,” CNBC, Feb. 23 \nAnd How Has It End ed? \n“Science Says: European art scene began with Neanderthals,” Associated Press, Feb. 22 \nIt’s Always in the Last Place You Look \n“Stolen painting by French master Degas found on bus near Paris,” Reuters, Feb. 23 \nThe New Entitlement? \n“Indian state offers free breast implants to poor women,” AFP, Feb. 23 \n***\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter. \nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click. \nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com . \n(Carol Muller and Lisa Rossi help compile Best of the Web.
