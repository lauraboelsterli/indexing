    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 1:24 AM / in 36 minutes Japan PM tells South Korea's Moon that 2015 'comfort women' deal is final Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nPYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe restated Tokyo’s opposition to revising a 2015 agreement on “comfort women” in talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday, calling the deal a promise between nations and the basis of two-way ties. \nAbe also said, however, that the two leaders had agreed the two countries needed to create a “future-oriented” relationship. \nJapan and South Korea share a bitter history that includes Japan’s 1910-45 colonization of the peninsula and the use of “comfort women”, a euphemism for women - many Korean - forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels. \nA renewed feud over the issue has frayed ties even as America’s two key Asian allies confront the challenge of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. \nUnder the 2015 deal reached under Abe and Moon’s predecessor, Japan apologised to former comfort women and provided a 1 billion yen ($9 million) fund to help them. South Korean President Moon Jae-in talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during their meeting in Pyeongchang, South Korea February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nSouth Korea earlier this year said the agreement failed to meet victims’ needs and called for more steps, but Japan insists the agreement should not be changed. \n“The Japan-South Korea agreement is one that finally and irreversibly resolves (the issue). It is a promise between the two countries and the foundation of our bilateral ties,” Abe told reporters after meeting Moon in Pyeongchang, where he will attend the opening of the Winter Olympic Games. Slideshow (4 Images) \nAbe, whose decision to attend the Games angered some of his conservative backers, has said the agreement will not be altered “by even one millimetre”. \nMoon, speaking at the start of the talks, also said he wanted to create a firm basis for forward-looking ties in his “frank” talks with the Japanese leader. \nAbe said he had confirmed with Moon the need to maintain strong pressure on North Korea to get it to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, reiterating Tokyo’s stance that “talk for the sake of talk is pointless”. \nA North-South Olympics detente has raised concerns in Washington and Tokyo that Seoul may ease up on the “maximum pressure” campaign by the United States and its allies to rein in North Korea.
