    "text": "Meet The Millionaire Kids Shaping the Toy Industry 2/26/2018 1:24PM Evan and Jillian, famous for playing with toys on camera, are just 12 and 9, but also two of the most important figures in the billion dollar toy industry. Thatâ€™s because millions of kids tune in to watch clips on their YouTube channels, which combined have over 3.5 billion views. We followed the duo around the annual Toy Fair in New York City as they endorsed toys and met with companies to design their own line of clothes. Photo: Edward Schneckloth",
