    "text": "Published: Feb 18, 2018 4:37 p.m. ET Share \nSecond major crash in a month, after no commercial fatalities in 2017 Tasnim News Agency via Reuters Relatives of passengers who were believed to have been killed in a plane crash react near the town of Semirom, Iran, on Sunday. \nBy Asa Fitch \nAn Iranian passenger plane carrying 66 people crashed Sunday in a remote mountainous area in Iran, killing all those aboard. \nThe Aseman Airlines flight was en route from Tehran to Yasuj, a small city in southern Iran, when it disappeared from the radar at around 8:50 a.m. local time, a spokesman for the carrier told state TV, adding that all on board were presumed dead. It was carrying 60 passengers and six crew, he said. \nIranian carriers at times have struggled with poor safety records, hobbled by a lack of access to spare parts and new planes for aging fleets because of yearslong Western sanctions. \nThe crash Sunday also marked a setback for aviation security globally. The incident marks the second major fatal accident this month after the global airline industry avoided fatalities in commercial jetliner operations during all of 2017. A Russian plane crashed on Feb. 11, killing all 71 people aboard.",
