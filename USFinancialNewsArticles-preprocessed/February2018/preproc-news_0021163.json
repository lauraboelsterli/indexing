(NASDAQ: ODFL) today announced financial results for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017. The financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include $9.8 million of expense related to a special bonus paid in December to non-executive employees following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This Act also required the Company to revalue its net deferred tax liability, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $104.9 million that is included in the 2017 results presented below:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, (In thousands, except per share amounts)\n2017 2016 % Chg.\n2017 2016 % Chg.\nRevenue $ 891,117 $ 745,738 19.5% $ 3,358,112 $ 2,991,517 12.3% Operating income $ 143,457 $ 113,447 26.5% $ 575,886 $ 483,835 19.0% Operating ratio 83.9% 84.8% 82.9% 83.8% Net income $ 197,250 $ 68,511 187.9% $ 463,774 $ 295,765 56.8% Basic earnings per share $ 2.40 $ 0.83 189.2% $ 5.63 $ 3.56 58.1% Diluted earnings per share $ 2.39 $ 0.83 188.0% $ 5.63 $ 3.56 58.1% Basic weighted average shares outstanding 82,282 82,381 (0.1)% 82,308 83,112 (1.0)% Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 82,376 82,450 (0.1)% 82,407 83,154 (0.9)% “Old Dominion produced Company-record results for both revenue and operating income in the fourth quarter,” said David S. Congdon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dominion. “We were pleased to see an acceleration in our revenue growth, which continued the momentum that began earlier in 2017. We believe that this growth was the result of continued strength in the domestic economy as well as our ability to win market share by providing shippers with network capacity and a value proposition that includes superior service at a fair price. Our superior service offering during the fourth quarter included on-time deliveries of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of less than 0.3%.\n“Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 19.5%, which consisted of a 14.4% increase in LTL tonnage and a 5.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The increase in our LTL tonnage included an 11.4% increase in LTL shipments and a 2.7% increase in LTL weight per shipment. We believe the industry pricing environment strengthened in the fourth quarter, which drove the 3.1% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. Consistent with our long-term pricing philosophy, we will continue to target rate increases necessary to offset cost inflation in our business and address individual account profitability. In the current pricing environment, we believe that this approach will enhance our ability to win market share and produce profitable growth.\n“The Company’s operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 83.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The quality of our revenue growth generated operating leverage that reduced our depreciation expense and direct operating costs as a percent of revenue, despite the impact of the employee special bonus. We expect our operating ratio to improve again in 2018, although our employee benefit costs are expected to increase this year due to enhancements to our paid-time-off policy and larger 401(k) matching contributions. We have historically made a discretionary matching contribution to our 401(k) plan to increase our aggregate matching contribution to 10% of our net income, and we believe that this year’s discretionary contribution will increase more than it would have otherwise due to a lower 2018 effective tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.”\nCash Flow and Use of Capital\nOld Dominion’s net cash provided by operating activities was $148.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $536.3 million for the year, which was a 5.2% decrease compared to the year-to-date period of 2016. The Company had $127.5 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, and its ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 4.0% compared with 5.4% at December 31, 2016.\nCapital expenditures were $93.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $382.1 million for the year. The Company expects its capital expenditures for 2018 to total approximately $510 million, including planned expenditures of $200 million for real estate and service center expansion projects; $265 million for tractors and trailers; and $45 million for technology and other assets.\nOld Dominion returned $8.2 million of capital to its shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $40.9 million for the year. The year-to-date total includes $32.9 million in cash dividends and $8.0 million of share repurchases.\nIncrease to Quarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Company's Board of Directors has declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.13 per share, which is a 30% increase to the quarterly dividend paid in 2017. The dividend is payable on March 20, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2018.\nSummary\nMr. Congdon concluded, “Old Dominion’s strong operating and financial performance for the fourth quarter and throughout 2017 highlights our team’s outstanding execution of a proven and differentiated business model. As we enter 2018, we are encouraged by our recent trends that demonstrate continued customer demand for our services and a strong domestic economy. We believe that the ongoing execution of our business model, which includes a commitment to continuously invest in our employees and network capacity, will allow us to produce further profitable growth and increased shareholder value in 2018.”\nOld Dominion will hold a conference call to discuss this release today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
