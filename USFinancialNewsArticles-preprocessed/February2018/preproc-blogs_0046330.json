    "text": "President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that he has been \"much tougher on Russia \" than his predecessor, Barack Obama , and called suggestions otherwise \"Fake News!\"\nTrump's claim — which isn't true — came in a tweet was the latest in a flurry of posts he has made since Friday's bombshell indictment of a group of Russians and Russian entities on charges of interfering the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nTweet \nTrump earlier had praised a Fox News show for detailing what he called \"the failures of the Obama administration has against Russia.\"\nTweet \nDespite claims by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia did meddle in that election, Trump has resisted calls to punish Russia for its actions.\nLast month, the Trump administration said it would not impose additional sanctions on Russia, despite a new law that called for those measures. \nObama, in contrast, imposed sanctions in December 2016, and reportedly signed off on a plan to plant cyberweapons in Russia's computer infrastructure. \nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at the suggestion that his election victory may have been due to Russia interference.\nWATCH: Trump claims vindication following Mueller indictment of Russians show chapters Trump claims vindication following Mueller indictment of Russians      6:32 PM ET Fri, 16 Feb 2018 | 00:57",
