    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE: ASC) (\"Ardmore\" or the \"Company\" or \"we\") today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights and Recent Activity\nReported a net loss of $12.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, or $0.37 basic and diluted loss per share, as compared to a net profit of $3.7 million, or $0.12 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The Company reported EBITDA (see Non-GAAP Measures section below) of $45.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Reported a net loss of $3.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, or $0.12 basic and diluted loss per share, as compared to a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.11 basic and diluted loss per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The Company reported EBITDA (see Non-GAAP Measures section below) of $11.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Acquired the Ardmore Sealancer, a high-quality 47,500 Dwt MR product tanker constructed at Onomichi Dockyard Co. Ltd. in Japan in 2008. Ardmore took delivery of the vessel on January 23, 2018. Repurchased 1,435,654 of Ardmore's common shares for $11.1 million in the aggregate in November 2017, as part of the GA Holdings LLC secondary offering. Ardmore's repurchase price of $7.72 per share represented a significant discount to net asset value, thereby realizing substantial value for shareholders. Transaction underwriters exercised an over-allotment option in January 2018 resulting in proceeds to the Company of $2.4 million. Spot and pool MR tankers earned an average TCE rate of $12,975 per day for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, including $12,131 per day in the three months ended December 31, 2017. Eco-Design chemical tankers earned an average of $11,949 per day for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, including $13,369 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Maintaining our dividend policy of paying out 60% of earnings from continuing operations. Consistent with this policy, the Company is not declaring a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAnthony Gurnee, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"Ardmore continues to execute on its strategy in spite of soft charter market conditions. Throughout 2017, we achieved a number of key accomplishments that we believe position Ardmore to benefit from long-term trends driving the market for MR product and chemical tankers.\nWe completed an accretive share purchase of 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter at a steep discount to net asset value, thus improving per share earnings power. We remain intensely focused on operating performance, cost efficiency and building value through improvements to ROIC. We are pleased to have taken delivery of the Ardmore Sealancer, a high-quality 2008 Japanese-built MR, in January 2018. With its low break-even and attractive price equating to a 30% discount to age-adjusted newbuild, we expect the vessel to boost earnings growth in an improving charter market and build value for shareholders.\nThe charter market was soft overall for 2017, in spite of some strength during the summer months. Nevertheless, we believe that underlying fundamentals will prevail in 2018; oil demand growth remains firm as the global economy continues to strengthen and oil inventories have declined to more normalized levels, enabling trading activity to resume and re-introducing an additional layer of tonne-mile demand for MRs. Meanwhile, MR supply growth is less than 1%, setting the stage for a potential strong and sustained charter market recovery.\nWith a strong balance sheet, modern fleet, low cost structure and revenue days set to increase again in 2018, we believe Ardmore is well positioned to take advantage of the anticipated charter market recovery and thus generate strong returns and value accretion for our shareholders.\"\nSummary of Recent and Fourth Quarter 2017 Events\nFleet\nFleet Operations and Employment\nThe Company has 28 vessels currently in operation including the Ardmore Sealancer, comprising 22 Eco MR tankers ranging from 45,000 Dwt to 49,999 Dwt (15 Eco-Design and seven Eco-Mod) and six Eco-Design IMO 2 product / chemical tankers ranging from 25,000 Dwt to 37,800 Dwt.\nMR Tankers (45,000 Dwt – 49,999 Dwt)\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had 21 Eco MR tankers trading in the spot market or in pools. The Eco MR tankers, earned an average of $12,131 per day in the fourth quarter of 2017. Overall for the quarter, our 15 Eco-Design MR tankers earned $12,042 per day, and our six Eco-Mod MR tankers earned $13,163 per day.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to have all revenue days for its MR Eco-Design and MR Eco-Mod tankers employed in the spot market or in pools. As of February 7, 2018, the Company has fixed approximately 45% of its total MR spot and pool revenue days for the first quarter of 2018 at approximately $13,300 per day.\nProduct / Chemical Tankers (IMO 2: 25,000 Dwt – 37,800 Dwt)\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had six Eco-Design IMO 2 product / chemical tankers in operation, all of which were trading in the spot market or in pools. During the fourth quarter of 2017, across all employment types, the Company's six Eco-Design product / chemical vessels earned an average daily rate of $13,369 per day in the quarter.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects to have all of its revenue days for its Eco-Design IMO 2 product / chemical tankers employed in the spot market or in pools. As of February 7, 2018, the Company has fixed approximately 87% of its Eco-Design IMO 2 product / chemical tankers spot and pool revenue days for the first quarter of 2018 at approximately $12,000 per day.\nDrydocking\nThe Company had 15 drydock days in the fourth quarter of 2017. Ardmore expects 18 scheduled drydock days in the first quarter of 2018.\nVessel Delivery and Financing\nOn January 23, 2018, Ardmore took delivery of its most recent vessel acquisition, the Ardmore Sealancer, a 2008 MR product tanker built at Onomichi, Japan. Upon delivery, and repositioning, the vessel commenced employment in the spot market. The vessel was partly financed under a Japan operating lease arrangement which was completed on January 30, 2018.\nArdmore completed a new $15 million revolving credit facility in October 2017, further improving its financial flexibility. The total amount drawn down on this facility to date is $11.4 million, resulting in a cash balance as at January 31, 2018 of $44.8 million.\nShare Repurchase\nIn November 2017, Ardmore repurchased 1,435,654 of its own common shares for $11.1 million, in the aggregate, from GA Holdings LLC as part of GA Holdings' secondary offering. The repurchase price of $7.72 per share represented a significant discount to net asset value, thereby realizing substantial value for Ardmore shareholders. To facilitate an orderly execution of the secondary offering, Ardmore granted the underwriter an option to purchase additional shares of its common stock, which option the underwriter exercised in January 2018, for a total of 305,459 shares, resulting in proceeds to the Company of $2.4 million.\nDividend\nBased on the Company's policy of paying out dividends equal to 60% of earnings from continuing operations, the Company's Board of Directors has not declared a dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, in which the Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $3.8 million. The Company did not pay out dividends for the first three quarters of 2017. The Company paid out a total of $0.27 per share in dividends for the full year 2016. The Company's Board of Directors reaffirmed its intention to maintain a policy of paying out dividends equal to 60% of earnings from continuing operations moving forward. Earnings from continuing operations is defined as earnings per share (\"EPS\") reported under U.S. GAAP, as adjusted for unrealized and realized gains and losses and extraordinary items.\nResults for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe Company reported a net loss of $3.8 million, or $0.12 basic and diluted loss per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.11 basic and diluted loss per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported EBITDA (see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below) of $11.0 million, an increase of $0.1 million from $10.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nResults for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe Company reported a net loss of $12.5 million, or $0.37 basic and diluted loss per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net profit of $3.7 million, or $0.12 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported EBITDA (see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below) of $45.7 million, a decrease of $8.5 million from $54.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $47.8 million, an increase of $4.6 million from $43.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOur average number of owned vessels remained at 27.0 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2016, resulting in revenue days of 2,438 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2,417 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nWe had 19 and 17 vessels employed directly in the spot market as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. For spot chartering, we had 1,704 revenue days for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 1,465 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase in revenue days derived from spot chartering, resulted in an increase in revenue of $5.0 million, while changes in spot rates resulted in an increase in revenue of $2.7 million.\nWe had eight and 10 vessels employed under time charter and pool arrangements as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Revenue days derived from time charter and pool arrangements were 734 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 952 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in revenue days in time charter and pool arrangements resulted in a decrease in revenue of $2.8 million, while a decrease in pool earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 resulted in a decrease in revenue of $0.3 million.\nIn direct spot employment, all voyage expenses are borne by Ardmore as opposed to the charterer, while under time chartering and pool arrangements, the charterer typically pays voyage expenses.\nFor vessels employed directly in the spot market, revenue is recognized on a gross freight basis, while under time chartering and pool arrangements, the charterer typically pays voyage expenses and revenue is recognized on a net basis.\nCommissions and Voyage Related Costs. Commissions and voyage related costs were $17.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.1 million from $13.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Commissions and voyage related costs increased due to the increased number of spot revenue days for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Revenue days increased to 2,438 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2,417 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For spot chartering arrangements, we had 1,704 revenue days for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 1,465 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nTCE Rate. The average TCE rate for our fleet was $12,583 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $276 per day from $12,307 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average TCE rate was the result of higher spot rates for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nVessel Operating Expenses. Vessel operating expenses were $16.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2016. Due to the nature of this expenditure, vessel operating expenses are prone to fluctuations between periods. Fleet operating costs per day, including technical management fees, were $6,269 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6,531 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $8.6 million, an increase of $0.1 million from $8.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Deferred Drydock Expenditure. Amortization of deferred drydock expenditure for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million, an increase of $0.3 million from $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The capitalized costs of drydockings for a given vessel are depreciated on a straight-line basis to the next scheduled drydocking of the vessel.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: Corporate. Corporate-related general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $2.5 million, an increase of $0.5 million from $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase reflects an increase in staff costs in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: Commercial and Chartering. Commercial and chartering expenses are the expenses attributable to our chartering and commercial operations departments in connection with our spot trading activities. Commercial and chartering expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $0.6 million, a decrease of $0.2 million from $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This reduction is due to costs savings realized by bringing our post-fixture operations in house.\nInterest Expense and Finance Costs. Interest expense and finance costs include loan interest, capital lease interest, and amortization of deferred financing fees, and are net of capitalized interest. Interest expense and finance costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $5.4 million, consistent with the three months ended December 31, 2016. Cash interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $0.6 million to $4.7 million, from $4.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase in cash interest expense is attributable to an increased average LIBOR during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, as well as a change in debt structure due to our new capital leases. Amortization of deferred financing charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.7 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in amortization of deferred financing charges is due to the write-off of deferred finance fees for terminated credit facilities.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $39.5 million (December 31, 2016: $56.0 million) available in cash and cash equivalents.

charter rate or gross pool rate, as applicable, per revenue day plus Communication, Victualing and Entertainment Income (\"CVE\"). Revenue days are the total number of calendar days the vessels are in our possession less off-hire days generally associated with drydocking or repairs. For vessels employed on voyage charters, TCE is the net rate after deducting voyage costs incurred, including all commissions and pool administration fees. MR Tankers Spot & Pool TCE is reported on a discharge to discharge basis.\n(3)\nFleet operating costs per day are routine operating expenses and comprise crewing, repairs and maintenance, insurance, stores, lube oils and communication costs. They do not include additional costs related to upgrading or enhancement of the vessels that are not capitalized.\n(4)\nTechnical management fees are fees paid to third-party technical managers.\n(5)\nVessel operating costs per day include technical management fees.\nArdmore Shipping Corporation\nFleet List as at February 7, 2018\nVessel Name\nType\nDwt Tonnes\nIMO\nBuilt\nCountry\nFlag\nSpecification\nArdmore Seavaliant\nProduct/Chemical\n49,998\n2/3\nFeb-13\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seaventure\nProduct/Chemical\n49,998\n2/3\nJun-13\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seavantage\nProduct/Chemical\n49,997\n2/3\nJan-14\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seavanguard\nProduct/Chemical\n49,998\n2/3\nFeb-14\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Sealion\nProduct/Chemical\n49,999\n2/3\nMay-15\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seafox\nProduct/Chemical\n49,999\n2/3\nJun-15\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seawolf\nProduct/Chemical\n49,999\n2/3\nAug-15\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seahawk\nProduct/Chemical\n49,999\n2/3\nNov-15\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Endeavour\nProduct/Chemical\n49,997\n2/3\nJul-13\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Enterprise\nProduct/Chemical\n49,453\n2/3\nSep-13\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Endurance\nProduct/Chemical\n49,466\n2/3\nDec-13\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Encounter\nProduct/Chemical\n49,478\n2/3\nJan-14\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Explorer\nProduct/Chemical\n49,494\n2/3\nJan-14\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Exporter\nProduct/Chemical\n49,466\n2/3\nFeb-14\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Engineer\nProduct/Chemical\n49,420\n2/3\nMar-14\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Seafarer\nProduct/Chemical\n45,744\n3\nAug-04\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Seatrader\nProduct\n47,141\n—\nDec-02\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Seamaster\nProduct/Chemical\n45,840\n3\nSep-04\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Seamariner\nProduct/Chemical\n45,726\n3\nOct-06\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Sealancer\nProduct\n47,451\n—\nJun-08\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Sealeader\nProduct\n47,463\n—\nAug-08\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Sealifter\nProduct\n47,472\n—\nJul-08\nJapan\nMI\nEco-mod\nArdmore Dauntless\nProduct/Chemical\n37,764\n2\nFeb-15\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Defender\nProduct/Chemical\n37,791\n2\nFeb-15\nKorea\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Cherokee\nProduct/Chemical\n25,215\n2\nJan-15\nJapan\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Cheyenne\nProduct/Chemical\n25,217\n2\nMar-15\nJapan\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Chinook\nProduct/Chemical\n25,217\n2\nJul-15\nJapan\nMI\nEco-design\nArdmore Chippewa\nProduct/Chemical\n25,217\n2\nNov-15\nJapan\nMI\nEco-design\nTotal\n28\n1,250,019\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release describes EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share from continuing operations, which are not measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are reconciled below. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before certain items that Ardmore believes are not representative of its operating performance. Earnings per share from continuing operations is defined as earnings per share (\"EPS\") reported under U.S. GAAP as adjusted for unrealized and realized gains and losses and extraordinary items.\nThese non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release as the Company believes that it provides investors with a means of evaluating and understanding how Ardmore's management evaluates operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. All amounts in the tables below are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated.\nReconciliation of net (loss) / profit to\nEBITDA\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nNet (loss) / profit\n(3,829,392)\n(3,687,774)\n(12,490,335)\n3,747,932\nInterest income\n(109,179)\n(57,204)\n(436,195)\n(164,629)\nInterest expense and finance costs\n5,350,638\n5,459,297\n21,380,165\n17,754,118\nIncome tax\n11,728\n(16,816)\n59,567\n60,434\nDepreciation\n8,645,709\n8,513,101\n34,271,091\n30,091,237\nAmortization of deferred drydock expenditure\n952,818\n665,018\n2,924,031\n2,715,109\nEBITDA\n11,022,322\n10,875,622\n45,708,324\n54,204,201\nLoss on disposal of vessels\n-\n-\n-\n2,601,148\nADJUSTED EBITDA\n11,022,322\n10,875,622\n45,708,324\n56,805,349\nEarnings per share from continuing operations\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nNet (loss) / profit\n(3,829,392)\n(3,687,774)\n(12,490,335)\n3,747,932\nAdjust for loss on disposal of vessels\n-\n-\n-\n2,601,148\nAdjusted net (loss) / profit\n(3,829,392)\n(3,678,774)\n(12,490,335)\n6,349,080\nEPS from continuing operations\n(0.12)\n(0.11)\n(0.37)\n0.21\nWeighted average number of shares\n33,045,043\n33,575,611\n33,441,879\n30,141,891\nForward Looking Statements\nMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts. The Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \"believe\", \"anticipate\", \"intends\", \"estimate\", \"forecast\", \"plan\", \"potential\", \"may\", \"expect\", and similar expressions.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, including, without limitation, Ardmore management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company's records and other data available from third parties. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company's control, the Company cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.\nIn addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in the Company's view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include: the failure of counterparties to fully perform their contracts with the Company; the strength of world economies and currencies; general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values; changes in demand for and the supply of tanker vessel capacity; changes in the Company's operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs; the market for the Company's vessels; competition in the tanker industry; availability of financing and refinancing; charter counterparty performance; ability to obtain financing and comply with covenants in such financing arrangements; changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities; general domestic and international political conditions; potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, piracy or political events; vessels breakdowns and instances of off-hires; and other factors. Please see the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties.\nInvestor Relations Enquiries:\nMr. Leon Berman\nThe IGB Group\n45 Broadway, Suite 1150\nNew York, NY 10006\nTel: 212-477-8438\nFax: 212-477-8636\nEmail: lberman@igbir.com\nOr\nMr. Bryan Degnan\nThe IGB Group\n45 Broadway, Suite 1150\nNew York, NY 10006\nTel: 646-673-9701\nFax: 212-477-8636\nEmail: bdegnan@igbir.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ardmore-shipping-corporation-announces-financial-results-for-the-three-and-twelve-months-ended-december-31-2017-300595003.html\nSOURCE Ardmore Shipping Corporation",
