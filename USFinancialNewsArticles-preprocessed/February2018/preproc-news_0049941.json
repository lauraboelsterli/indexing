    "text": "LUXEMBOURG, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (“Altisource” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ASPS) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, reporting full year service revenue of $899.6 million and fourth quarter 2017 service revenue of $207.3 million. Full year 2017 net income attributable to Altisource was $308.9 million, or $16.53 per diluted share, and adjusted net income attributable to Altisource (1) for the full year 2017 was $52.3 million, or adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) of $2.80. Fourth quarter 2017 net income attributable to Altisource was $286.4 million, or $15.72 per diluted share and adjusted net income attributable to Altisource (1) for the fourth quarter 2017 was $9.8 million, or adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) of $0.54.\n“In 2017, we generated service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) that were 105% and 102%, respectively, of our scenario mid-point. We also continued our long history of strong cash flow generation with $110.5 million of adjusted cash flows from operating activities (1) ,” said Chief Executive Officer William B. Shepro.\nMr. Shepro further commented, “Importantly, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we had strong sales momentum which we continued to build upon in the first quarter of 2018. We are also making meaningful investments to support our competitive positioning and the tremendous opportunities that our newer businesses represent. We believe these investments, our customer relationships and recent momentum of customer wins position us well for 2018 and beyond.”\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a net income tax benefit of $284.1 million relating to the merger of two of the Company’s Luxembourg subsidiaries, the impact of statutory tax rate changes in the U.S. and Luxembourg, and foreign income tax reserves. In December 2017, the Company merged two of its Luxembourg subsidiaries in connection with an internal restructuring plan designed to simplify and streamline the Company’s structure. For Luxembourg tax purposes, the transaction was recognized at fair value and generated a net operating loss of $1.3 billion. The Luxembourg net operating loss is not subject to any limitation on its usage and has a 17 year life.\n2017 Highlights (2)\nCorporate\nGenerated $66.1 million of cash flows from operating activities and $110.5 million of adjusted cash flows from operating activities (1) Ended 2017 with $154.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $23.84 per share Repurchased $60.1 million par value of our senior secured term loan at a weighted average discount of 10.7%, recognizing a net gain of $5.6 million on the early extinguishment of debt Recognized a net income tax benefit of $284.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to the merger of two of the Company’s Luxembourg subsidiaries, the impact of statutory tax rate changes in the U.S. and Luxembourg and foreign income tax reserves Amended our senior secured term loan to allow the Company to directly repurchase its debt in the open market and permit the internal restructuring of our Luxembourg subsidiaries\nServicer Solutions\nSelected by 9 bank and non-bank loan servicers to provide property preservation and inspection services, real estate brokerage and auction services, or title insurance and settlement services Selected as a service provider by 4 servicers in the first quarter of 2018 Grew non-Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”) and non-NRZ (defined below) service revenue by 9% compared to 2016 Maintained Altisource as one of the leading REO asset managers and online auctioneers of residential real estate through its Hubzu.com platform Entered into agreements with New Residential Investment Corp.

We believe these measures are useful to management, existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability and cash flow generation more on the basis of continuing cost and cash flows as they exclude amortization expense related to acquisitions that occurred in prior periods, as well as the effect of more significant non-recurring items from earnings and cash flows from operating activities. We believe these measures are also useful in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. Furthermore, we believe the exclusion of more significant non-recurring items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.\nIt is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Altisource’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. The non-GAAP financial information should not be unduly relied upon.\nPretax income (loss) attributable to Altisource is calculated by deducting non-controlling interests from income (loss) before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Adjusted pretax income attributable to Altisource is calculated by adding intangible asset amortization expense and the litigation settlement loss, net of $4.0 million insurance recovery to, and deducting non-controlling interests from, income (loss) before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Adjusted net income attributable to Altisource is calculated by adding intangible asset amortization expense (net of tax) and net litigation settlement loss, net of insurance recovery (net of tax) and adding or deducting certain income tax related items relating to the Luxembourg subsidiary merger, other income tax rate changes in Luxembourg and the United States and an increase in foreign income tax reserves (and related interest) from net income attributable to Altisource. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Altisource plus intangible asset amortization expense (net of tax) and net litigation settlement loss (net of tax) and adding or deducting certain income tax related items described above, by the weighted average number of diluted shares. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities is calculated by adding the cash payment related to the net litigation settlement loss and the increase in short-term investments in real estate to cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities less additions to premises and equipment is calculated by adding the cash payment related to the net litigation settlement loss and the increase in short-term investments in real estate to, and deducting additions to premises and equipment from, cash flows from operating activities.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are as follows:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, Three months ended\nSeptember 30, Years ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Income (loss) before income taxes and non-controlling interests $ 3,112 $ (19,537 ) $ 10,357 $ 35,375 $ 44,321 Non-controlling interests (633 ) (720 ) (805 ) (2,740 ) (2,693 ) Pretax income (loss) attributable to Altisource 2,479 (20,257 ) 9,552 32,635 41,628 Intangible asset amortization expense 8,224 11,144 8,604 35,367 47,576 Litigation settlement loss, net of $4,000 insurance recovery — 28,000 — — 28,000 Adjusted pretax income attributable to Altisource $ 10,703 $ 18,887 $ 18,156 $ 68,002 $ 117,204 Net income (loss) attributable to Altisource $ 286,350 $ (20,384 ) $ 6,961 $ 308,891 $ 28,693 Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax 7,597 6,477 6,452 27,523 36,819 Certain income tax related items, net (284,108 ) — — (284,108 ) — Net litigation settlement loss, net of tax — 24,583 — — 24,583 Adjusted net income attributable to Altisource $ 9,839 $ 10,676 $ 13,413 $ 52,306 $ 90,095 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 15.72 $ (1.08 ) $ 0.38 $ 16.53 $ 1.46 Impact of using diluted share count instead of basic share count for a loss per share — 0.01 — — — Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax, per diluted share 0.42 0.34 0.35 1.47 1.88 Certain income tax related items, net (15.60 ) — — (15.20 ) — Net litigation settlement loss, net of tax, per diluted share — 1.28 — — 1.25 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.54 $ 0.55 $ 0.73 $ 2.80 $ 4.59 Calculation of the impact of intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax Intangible asset amortization expense $ 8,224 $ 11,144 $ 8,604 $ 35,367 $ 47,576 Tax benefit from intangible asset amortization (627 ) (4,667 ) (2,152 ) (7,844 ) (10,757 ) Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax 7,597 6,477 6,452 27,523 36,819 Diluted share count 18,211 19,246 18,429 18,692 19,612 Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax, per diluted share $ 0.42 $ 0.34 $ 0.35 $ 1.47 $ 1.88 Certain income tax related items, net, resulting from: Luxembourg subsidiaries merger, net $ (300,908 ) $ — $ — $ (300,908 ) $ — Other income tax rate changes 6,270 — — 6,270 — Foreign income tax reserves 10,530 — — 10,530 — Certain income tax related items, net (284,108 ) — — (284,108 ) — Diluted share count 18,211 19,246 18,429 18,692 19,612 Certain income tax related items, net, per diluted share $ (15.60 ) $ — $ — $ (15.20 ) $ — Calculation of the impact of net litigation settlement loss, net of tax Net litigation settlement loss $ — $ 28,000 $ — $ — $ 28,000 Tax benefit from net litigation settlement loss — (3,417 ) — — (3,417 ) Net litigation settlement loss, net of tax — 24,583 — — 24,583 Diluted share count 18,211 19,246 18,429 18,692 19,612 Net litigation settlement loss, net of tax, per diluted share $ — $ 1.28 $ — $ — $ 1.25 Cash flows from operating activities $ 18,953 $ 20,783 $ 34,612 $ 66,082 $ 126,818 Net litigation settlement loss payment — — — 28,000 — Increase in short-term investments in real estate 4,761 4,330 9,530 16,380 13,025 Adjusted cash flows from operating activities 23,714 25,113 44,142 110,462 139,843 Less: Additions to premises and equipment (3,029 ) (6,744 ) (1,827 ) (10,514 ) (23,269 ) Adjusted cash flows from operating activities less additions to premises and equipment $ 20,685 $ 18,369 $ 42,315 $ 99,948 $ 116,574\nCONTACT: Indroneel Chatterjee Chief Financial Officer T: +352 2469 7988 E: Indroneel.Chatterjee@altisource.com\nSource:Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A.",
