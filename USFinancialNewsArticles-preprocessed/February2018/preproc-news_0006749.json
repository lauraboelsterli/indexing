Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Levante vs Real Madrid - Ciutat de Valencia, Valencia, Spain - February 3, 2018 Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema in action with Levante’s Postigo REUTERS/Heino Kalis \n“We were controlling the game but we made two mistakes and conceded two goals; that is football,” Casemiro told beIN Sports. \n“If you do that in defence then the other team can hurt you. We have to think game by game, we are playing well and improving.” Slideshow (11 Images) \nRamos, making his first league appearance since Dec. 23 when Madrid were crushed by Barcelona in the Clasico, opened the scoring with a header which earned him the individual record of being the first defender to score in 14 consecutive seasons. \nHowever his day soon soured when he was booked for an elbow on Boateng and then played Morales onside for Levante’s equaliser.

It paid dividends when Karim Benzema set up the Spaniard to fire home, before Pazzini put Levante level again. Reporting by Rik Sharma; Editing by Clare Fallon",
