    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Prices of long-term Japanese government bonds edged higher, pushing the 40-year JGB yield down to the lowest in more than a year on Thursday, after an auction of 20-year bonds attracted solid demand.\nThe 40-year JGB yield slipped to as low as 0.900 percent , its lowest level since January 2017.\nThe 30-year JGB yield touched a low of 0.770 percent , its lowest level since April 2017.\nThe price of 10-year JGB futures rose 0.05 point to 150.83 , having pulled up from an intraday low of 150.76.\nThe 10-year JGB yield was little changed at 0.055 percent\nEarlier on Thursday, the 10-year JGB futures had come under pressure after U.S. Treasury yields surged on Wednesday as the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting affirmed expectations of further rate increases this year.\nHedging activity ahead of an auction of 20-year bonds also weighed on JGB futures earlier in the session.\nThe auction of 20-year bonds, however, attracted solid demand, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 4.44 times, up from 4.17 times at the previous 20-year JGB auction.
