Both join Avison Young from Newmark Knight Frank in Las Vegas and will continue to work as a team. They will continue to focus on industrial property sales and leasing, vacant land and investment sales.\n\"We're thrilled that Ben and Dave have joined our company in Las Vegas,\" comments Jewkes. \"Their appointments reaffirm the high professional standards embraced by Avison Young here in Las Vegas and across the company.

He is particularly adept at logistics analysis, valuation, cash flow modeling and sale-leaseback transactions and has completed hundreds of transactions valued at more than $350 million throughout his career.\"\nJewkes continues: \"Together, Ben and Dave will assist clients with acquisitions, dispositions and lease-ups of industrial, mixed-use and office properties, as well as land sales. They will add opportunities and significant client relationships to Avison Young's growing operation in Las Vegas.\"\nMillis brings 13 years of commercial real estate industry experience to Avison Young, most recently with Newmark Knight Frank in Las Vegas where he was a managing director.

He also recently achieved the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors (SIOR) designation.\n\"I'm excited to join Avison Young's growing operation in Las Vegas,\" states Millis. \"When I was considering my career options, Avison Young stood out because of its aggressive growth strategy, and Principal-led, no-silos, client-centric business model. The most compelling factor for me, however, was the incredible culture at Avison Young. The company prioritizes ethics, giving back to the community, collaboration, and universal respect for employees and clients. I look forward to continuing to work with Dave and collaborating with our new colleagues across the company as we help expand Avison Young's client and business relationships in Southern Nevada.\"\nWrzesinski brings 15 years of commercial property experience to Avison Young, most recently as an associate director with Newmark Knight Frank in Las Vegas.

During his career, he has appraised more than $750 million worth of real estate, including all property types.\n\"I'm looking forward to being part of Avison Young's operation in Las Vegas and the company's collaborative culture,\" says Wrzesinski. I'm also excited to continue working with Ben as we provide creative leasing and investment sales solutions for our new and existing clients.\"\nAvison Young opened its Las Vegas office in November 2011 and a second Nevada office in Reno in March 2012.
