    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CyberOptics Corporation (Nasdaq: CYBE) today reported operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 ended December 31.\nFourth quarter sales, which were modestly above the previously-issued guidance for this period, totaled $13.2 million, compared to $13.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. CyberOptics also reported earnings of $503,000 or $0.07 per share, which included a $414,000 income tax benefit related to recent changes in federal income tax law. Earnings of $6.1 million or $0.85 per share were reported in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included a $5.3 million non-cash income tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.\nFor full-year 2017, CyberOptics reported sales of $53.3 million, compared to $66.2 million in 2016. Earnings for the year came to $1.3 million or $0.19 per share, compared to $11.6 million or $1.64 per share in 2016.\nCyberOptics’ fourth quarter performance benefited from strongly higher sales of OEM sensors, including 3D MRS-enabled products, and WaferSense products for the semiconductor industry. Sales of all 3D MRS-based products increased 59% year-over-year to $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year, total MRS-based revenues rose 17% to $14.3 million. However, the underlying growth rate was 88%, absent $4.7 million of SQ3000 sales to one customer in 2016.\nSensor sales increased 25% year-over-year to $3.5 million in the fourth quarter, paced by higher volumes of 3D MRS-enabled sensors and legacy 2D products. Fourth quarter sales of 3D MRS sensors to KLA-Tencor and Nordson YESTECH, our principal OEM customers for these products, increased by approximately 100% year-over-year. With demonstrations underway of its MRS-enabled mid-end semiconductor inspection capability, the company believes initial sales of these sensors are possible during the second half of 2018.\nSales of SMT inspection systems declined 31% year-over-year to $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Reduced demand for legacy 2D products more than offset solidly higher sales of SQ3000 3D AOI systems, which increased nearly 70% year-over-year to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter. During this period, CyberOptics added six new SQ3000 customers as more manufacturers are recognizing the competitive advantages of this important inspection technology. For the year, 24 new SQ3000 customers were added, nearly double the number of new customers in 2016.\nSales of semiconductor sensors, principally the WaferSense product line, increased 29% year-over-year to $3.4 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting favorable industry conditions and the steadily growing traction these productivity enhancement tools are gaining in the semiconductor industry. Sales of general-purpose metrology products increased 26% year-over-year to $1.7 million in the fourth quarter, driven by legacy scanning products and services. Prospective metrology customers are showing interest in the recently introduced SQ3000 3DCMM (Coordinate Measurement) system that has a significant speed advantage over traditional CMM’s. This 3D MRS-based system incorporates the SQ3000’s AOI inspection capabilities with some of the metrology functionality of the CyberGage360 Scanning System, but with greater resolution and measurement performance. CyberOptics believes that general-purpose metrology is an attractive market for its products.\nDr. Subodh Kulkarni, president and chief executive officer, commented: “We are very optimistic about the future prospects of our 3D MRS technology, particularly in the areas of inspection and metrology for mid-end semiconductor and advanced packaging applications and inspection of complex electronics in areas such as automotive and mobile devices. As discussed previously, we have started to make incremental additions to our sales team and will continue to enhance our global sales channels.”\nHe continued: “CyberOptics ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with an order backlog of $11.4 million, up modestly from the level at the end of the third quarter. Sales of $12.5 - $13.5 million are currently forecasted for the first quarter of 2018 ending March 31.”\nKulkarni added: “We are very optimistic about CyberOptics’ future. Our positive outlook reflects the competitive advantages of our suite of MRS-enabled sensors and inspection systems, the potential for incremental revenue from mid-end semiconductor inspection, and the steadily growing acceptance of our WaferSense products.”\nAbout CyberOptics\nCyberOptics Corporation ( www.cyberoptics.com ) is a leading global developer and manufacturer of high precision sensing technology solutions.
