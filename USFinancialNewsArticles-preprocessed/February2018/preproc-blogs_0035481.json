    "text": "Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editor: Sexy and empowered can go together This year, the magazine is featuring black-and-white nudes that are meant to convey a message. The feature is meant to illustrate and give voice to the diversity of the women that we feature in our magazine, editor MJ Day says. \"I'm inspired by this moment in time that we're in,\" she says. Published 38 Mins Ago CNBC.com \nThe Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition wants to send a message that sexy and empowered can go together, its editor, MJ Day, told CNBC on Wednesday. \nThis year, the magazine is trying something new. In addition to featuring women in bathing suits, there are black-and-white nudes that are meant to convey a message. \nIt's part of the magazine's \"in her own words\" project meant to \"illustrate and give voice to the diversity of the women that we feature in our magazine, to make the statement that they are more than just a beautiful face,\" Day said in an interview with \" Power Lunch. \" \nWords like \"strong,\" \"truth,\" \"genuine\" and \"mother\" are written on the models' naked bodies. Raisman tweet \nThe idea was born before the #MeToo movement \"was even a whisper,\" she added. #MeToo began trending to help bring attention to sexual assault and harassment, particularly in the workplace. \nCritics have been quick to respond to the magazine's latest feature, even before the latest edition was released.",
