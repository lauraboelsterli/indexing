(NASDAQ:FGEN), a science-based biopharmaceutical company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and provided an update on the company’s recent developments.\n“In 2017, we continued to make significant progress on key clinical and regulatory milestones. Our first NDA submission for roxadustat was accepted for review by the China Food and Drug Administration. With our partners, we are advancing the roxadustat Phase 3 CKD anemia programs to completion with plans to file for market approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. In our fibrosis program, pamrevlumab has demonstrated tremendous potential in multiple indications. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in IPF, pamrevlumab was well-tolerated and achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of FVC % predicted, in FVC, and in the secondary endpoints of quantitative changes of lung fibrosis, disease progression, and patient-reported outcomes,” said Thomas B. Neff, FibroGen’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are intensely focused on the execution of critical activities for our CKD anemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pancreatic cancer programs as these approach important new milestones in 2018.”\nRecent Developments and Highlights\nRoxadustat for CKD Anemia in U.S./ROW\nWith our partner AstraZeneca, we have agreed to a timeline for Phase 3 enrollment completion in the second quarter of 2018 and data readout in the fourth quarter of 2018 to support U.S. regulatory submission in the first half of 2019 DSMB recommended Phase 3 clinical studies to continue under current protocols with no changes\nRoxadustat for CKD Anemia in China\nPositive efficacy and safety results reported from two Phase 3 trials New Drug Application accepted for filing by the CFDA\nRoxadustat for CKD Anemia in Japan\nOur partner Astellas has completed three of six Phase 3 trials Topline positive Phase 3 results reported in peritoneal dialysis study\nRoxadustat for MDS Anemia\nEnrollment commenced in our first U.S./Europe Phase 3 study for the treatment of anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)\nPamrevlumab for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)\nStatistically significant high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) results achieved in our randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study Positive Phase 2b study results presented at European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2017\nPamrevlumab for Pancreatic Cancer\nReported positive interim Phase 2 open-label results at 2017 ASCO-GI conference showing a majority of pamrevlumab-treated patients converted from unresectable to resectable cancer; all resection evaluations complete and results continue to be favorable for pamrevlumab\nCorporate and Financial\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.1 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to $34.0 million, or $0.54 per share one year ago Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $126.2 million, or $1.73 per share, compared to $61.7 million, or $0.98 per share one year ago At December 31, 2017, FibroGen had $762.2 million in cash, restricted time deposits, cash equivalents, investments, and receivables Received a $15.0 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon roxadustat NDA submission to CFDA Completed financings in April 2017 and in August 2017 with net proceeds of $115.1 million and $356.2 million, respectively\n2018 Outlook\nU.S. Phase 3 CKD anemia enrollment completion in the second quarter of 2018 U.S. Phase 3 CKD anemia data readout in the fourth quarter of 2018 to support U.S. regulatory submission in the first half of 2019 NDA approval decision expected in China for CKD anemia by the end of 2018 Expect to confirm plans with our partner Astellas for regulatory submissions in Europe and Japan Anticipate data readout from two Japan Phase 3 hemodialysis studies, a long-term conversion study and a correction (ESA-naïve) study, in the first quarter of 2018 Anticipate initiation of roxadustat Phase 2/3 clinical study in China for anemia associated with MDS in first half of 2018 Expect to present HRCT and health-related quality-of-life results from the IPF Phase 2b trial at an upcoming scientific conference Design pivotal trials for IPF and locally advanced pancreatic cancer\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nFibroGen will host a conference call and webcast today, February 27, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss financial results and provide a business update.

Roxadustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), promotes erythropoiesis, or the production of red bloods, by increasing endogenous erythropoietin, improving iron regulation, and reducing hepcidin, including in the presence of inflammation and without need for supplemental intravenous iron.\nThe roxadustat Phase 3 program is the largest Phase 3 clinical program in anemia to date, and is supported by extensive Phase 2 results demonstrating correction and maintenance of hemoglobin levels in anemia in multiple subpopulations of CKD dialysis and non-dialysis patients. A New Drug Application (NDA) has been accepted for review by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), and enrollment completion and data readout for the Phase 3 program are expected in 2018. Roxadustat is also in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S. and Europe, and expected to shortly enter Phase 2/3 development in China, for anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). For information about roxadustat studies currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .\nAbout Pamrevlumab\nPamrevlumab is a first-in-class antibody developed by FibroGen to inhibit the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders characterized by persistent and excessive scarring that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Pamrevlumab is advancing towards Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pancreatic cancer, and is currently in a Phase 2 trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pamrevlumab has been well tolerated in a number of Phase 2 clinical studies to date, with a good safety and tolerability profile. For information about pamrevlumab studies currently recruiting patients, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .\nAbout FibroGen\nFibroGen, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, CA with subsidiary offices in Beijing and Shanghai, PRC, is a leading science-based biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing a pipeline of first-in-class therapeutics. The company applies its pioneering expertise in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) biology and clinical development to advance innovative medicines for the treatment of anemia, fibrotic disease, and cancer. Roxadustat, the company’s most advanced product candidate, is an oral small molecule inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylase activity in worldwide Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with the exception of China, where a New Drug Application is currently under review by the CFDA for regulatory approval. Roxadustat is in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S. and Europe, and expected to shortly enter Phase 2/3 development in China, for anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Pamrevlumab, a fully-human monoclonal anti-CTGF antibody, is advancing towards Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pancreatic cancer, and is currently in a Phase 2 trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). FibroGen is also developing a biosynthetic cornea in China.
