    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 10:26 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Port Said stadium reopens six years after 72 killed Amr Abdallah Daish 2 Min Read \nPORT SAID, Egypt (Reuters) - Football returned to the Port Said Stadium, site of the death of 72 people in Egypt’s worst violence at a soccer stadium, for the first time since the 2012 disaster on Saturday. \nHome club Al Masry beat Green Buffaloes of Zambia 4-0 on the opening weekend of action in this year’ African Confederation Cup. \nA restricted crowd of 10,000 people were allowed into the stadium amid tight security and a heavy army presence as the Egyptian government relaxed restrictions on spectators attending local matches. \n“We have been waiting for this for a long while. We had nothing to do with what happened. Port Said is innocent from what happened. But thank God,” said 32-year-old home fan Mahran Al Sayed. \nAl Masry supporters had been accused of inciting the violence with many of the dead crushed when panicked fans tried to escape from the stadium after a post-match pitch invasion by home supporters. Others fell or were thrown from terraces.

Slideshow (11 Images) \nSoccer matches were often a flashpoint for violence in Egypt but since 2012 successive governments have curbed the number of people allowed to attend games. \nEgypt’s Sports Minister Khaled Abdel Aziz announced on Tuesday that that policy would be changed to allow a maximum of 10,000 in to watch local league games. \nFan clubs known as Ultras were outlawed in 2015. \nRelations between the Ultras and security forces have been tense for four years after the fans played a key role in the 18 days of street protests that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.
