    "text": "MIAMI, Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB:RXMD), a healthcare services and technology company, announces record breaking month of January 2018.\nPharmCo, LLC filled over 23,000 prescriptions during the month of January, generating $1.8 million in net revenues. Prescriptions filled increased by 34% compared to the same month last year and by 10% over the last record breaking month in October 2017. Revenues increased by approximately 9% as compared to January 2017. The company also filled over $450,000 worth of prescriptions (not included in Net Revenues) for 340B entities in January, generating fees to the pharmacy of just over $20,000. Current growth has been driven by expansion into Palm Beach County, the digital marketing campaign with Mass Ventures Corp, proficiency of medication therapy management and adherence programs, and the visibility of the pharmacy’s 5 star service rating among physicians and patients throughout South Florida.\n“We are thrilled about the fast start to 2018,” stated S. Parikh Mars, CEO. \"We are just beginning to see the results from the groundwork we laid in 2017. Over the past 12 months, we have strategically positioned ourselves to take advantage of the changing trends in the healthcare industry. Today, more physicians than ever before are recognizing the impact PharmCo and its model has on their bottom line. They are increasingly seeking out our services to improve patient outcomes and increase profitability.”\nCommon Shares Issued and Outstanding:\nAs of February 13, 2018 the number shares of common stock issued and outstanding stood at 365,408,769 shares. This amount is net of the number of shares owned by PharmCo, LLC of 1,718,000. The Company has fully paid off its first installment from Chicago Venture Partners. The Company paid approximately $130,000 in cash and $150,000 in stock.
