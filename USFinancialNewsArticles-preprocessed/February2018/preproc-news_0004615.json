    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales eased in December, pulled down mainly by a lower volume of sold fuel and clothes, data from the European Unionâ€™s statistics office Eurostat showed on Monday.\nEurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.1 percent month-on-month in December against a 2.0 percent rise in November and against market expectations of a 1.0 percent decline.\nIn year-on-year terms, retail sales rose 1.9 percent, as expected, a sharp slowdown from a 3.9 percent yea-on-year rise in the previous month.\nThe monthly numbers were mainly affected by a 1.5 percent decline in the volume of sold automotive fuel and a 3.3 percent fall in the volume of sold clothes and shoes.\nYear-on-year a 0.8 percent decline in sold fuel as well as a lower rise in the volume of sold food drinks and tobacco were behind the slow-down.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski\n ",
