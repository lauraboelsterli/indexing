    "text": "February 24, 2018 / 11:23 AM / in 10 minutes Quotes from the Pyeongchang Winter Games on day 15 Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Memorable quotes from the Pyeongchang Olympics on Saturday: “I told (team mate) Matt (Hamilton), ‘I think it’s a dream. I’ll wake up tomorrow and this might not be real’. It’s just fantastic.” - John Shuster on the medal ceremony after the U.S. beat Sweden to claim their first ever Olympic men’s curling gold. “The chicken place was not so good. The Koreans are not so good in doing KFC. I‘m really looking forward to get to Europe for different kitchen (cooking) because it’s quite a long time already I‘m here. No eating today. I will just go to bed because I‘m quite tired.” - Czech Ester Ledecka on her plans after winning the snowboard parallel giant slalom. “I think the expectation of winning gold medals is pretty out of whack and I think we need to be proud of all our athletes for how much they’ve put in to be here.” - Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn on the pressure on the U.S. to top the medal table at the Games. “All these guys are my good friends so I was like wishing the best to all the guys. I wasn’t wishing for them to fall but I was definitely wishing myself to win the medal.” - Canada’s Sebastien Toutant on having to wait for others to finish before clinching the gold medal in men’s snowboarding big air final. “Maybe my coach was a bit nervous about the race because I often start too hard, too early. This time I suffered a little. You just need to live the moment and play the game. If you don’t try, you can’t win and this time I was the strongest man.” - Finland’s Iivo Niskanen on winning the 50km mass start race gold. Compiled by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru",
