    "text": "Blake Wheeler scored twice and added an assist and goalie Connor Hellebuyck made 30 saves to collect his 30th win of the season as the Winnipeg Jets blasted the Colorado Avalanche 6-1 Friday night at Bell MTS Place in Winnipeg.\nMark Scheifele collected three assists for the Jets, giving him seven points in four games since returning from a shoulder injury.\nHellebuyck is the first Jets goalie to collect 30 wins in a season since the franchise moved to Winnipeg in 2011-12.\nWheeler opened the scoring at 10:09 of the first period to snap a 15-game drought. While the Jets were buzzing around the Colorado zone, the captain sent the puck toward the front of the net from below the goal line, and it banked in off Colorado goalie Jonathan Bernier.\nKyle Connor doubled the lead when he kicked off Winnipeg’s three-goal second period at 10:49 of the frame. After Dustin Byfuglien won the battle along the boards and fed him the puck at the right faceoff circle, Connor wristed home a shot.\nAndrew Copp’s shorthanded marker at 15:50 made it a 3-0 game, collected by one-timing the shot on a 2-on-1 rush with Scheifele, and Patrik Laine’s power-play goal with 27.3 seconds left in the middle frame extended the lead further.\nBernier didn’t return to the net for the third period after surrendering four goals on 20 shots, making way for Semyon Varlamov.\nThe Jets kept their feet on the gas. Nikolaj Ehlers made it a five-goal bulge at the 5:24 mark of the third period when he deflected a Tyler Myers point shot for his 22nd of the season, and then Wheeler added his second of the night exactly two minutes later during a 5-on-3 power play to make it 6-0.\nLaine, Myers and Byfuglien each had two-point games for the Jets, who are 5-2-1 through eight games of their 10-game homestand.\nColorado’s Mikko Rantanen broke the shutout bid with a wraparound goal at 14:04 of the third period.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
