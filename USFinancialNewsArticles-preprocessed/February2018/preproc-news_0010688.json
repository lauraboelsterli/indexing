    "text": "LAWRENCEBURG, Ind., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DSA Financial Corporation (OTC Pink Markets:DSFN) today announced that its Board of Directors has adopted a stock repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 61,770 shares of its common stock, or approximately 4.39% of the current outstanding shares.\nThe repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in open market or private transactions, through block trades, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRepurchases will be made at management’s discretion at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company’s financial performance.\nThe repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares.\nAbout DSA Financial Corporation\nThe Company is the holding company for Dearborn Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank headquartered in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
