    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seattle Genetics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGEN) today announced that the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the “HSR Act”) with respect to Seattle Genetics’ proposed acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASC) expired at 11:59 p.m. on February 15, 2018. The expiration of the HSR Act waiting period satisfies one of the conditions to consummate the tender offer and the acquisition. Other offer conditions remain to be satisfied, including among others, a minimum tender of at least a majority of outstanding Cascadian Therapeutics shares on a fully diluted basis. Unless the tender offer is extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the merger agreement governing the tender offer and the related transactions, the offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 9, 2018 (one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 8, 2018).\nAbout Seattle Genetics\nSeattle Genetics is an innovative biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of people with cancer through novel antibody-based therapies.
