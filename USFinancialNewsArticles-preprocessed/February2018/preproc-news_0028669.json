    "text": "Published: Feb 14, 2018 11:22 a.m. ET Share \n420TV and Burn TV are getting buzz, ‘but it’s a very touchy subject with the people at the top’ Robert Voets/Netflix Aaron Moten (left), Dougie Baldwin and Kathy Bates in the Netflix series 'Disjointed' \nBy Joe Flint \nWith marijuana-centric shows like HBO’s TWX, +0.66% “High Maintenance” and Netflix’s NFLX, +4.14% “Disjointed,” and seemingly constant references to the drug on other mainstream television series, it would seem the time is right for a channel devoted to those who like to get high. \nBut as entrepreneurs Dan Goman and Alex Nahai are learning with 420TV, their Beverly Hills, Calif.-based video-on-demand and streaming service, there are hurdles upon hurdles when it comes to cannabis content. \nSet to launch online on Feb. 22, 420TV has struggled to find major TV distributors willing to carry the service and advertisers to sponsor it. Getting insurance coverage to produce shows has been a challenge, since many insurers are reluctant to get involved with programs featuring marijuana or that have it on set. \nThere are scores of legal issues, ranging from when and how marijuana use can be shown, to how the programming and channel—its name is a nod to a popular time of day for pot consumption—can be marketed. Laws vary from state to state, further complicating matters.",
