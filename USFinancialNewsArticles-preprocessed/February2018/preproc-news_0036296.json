    "text": "By Natasha Bach 5:56 AM EST \nAt least one person has been bit by the green-eyed monster after the successful launch of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket last week. \nRichard Branson admitted to CNN that he was “a little bit jealous” of the launch. His own venture, Virgin Galactic, is racing Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin to be the first to launch tourists into space. \nRead: This Will Be ‘The Next Big Thing,’ According to Richard Branson \nNevertheless, Branson had kind words for his competitor, calling the launch “extraordinary,” and saying the team responsible for the launch “did just fantastic.” But, Branson continued, “watch this space,” as his team will hopefully be coming out with something “very exciting” in the next few months. \nBranson hopes that Virgin Galactic will be in space—with people—in the next few months, saying that he hopes it will be “the first of the three entrepreneurs” to do so. And, not willing to stop there, the business magnate said he and his team are working on finding a way to “upstage” Musk’s launch. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
