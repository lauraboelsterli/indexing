    "text": "(Reuters) - Hertz Global Holdings Inc ( HTZ.N ) reported a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss amid efforts by the car rental company to turn around itself by spending more on fleet and technology upgrades and marketing initiatives.\nShares of the Estero, Florida-based company, which forecast elevated expenses in 2018, fell 6.5 percent to $18.00 in extended trading on Tuesday.\nTotal interest expense rose 20.3 percent to $172 million in the quarter, while selling, general and administrative costs increased about 4 percent to $221 million.\nVehicle and operating expenses were up 6 percent to $1.22 billion.\n“We will have elevated investments throughout the year as we implement several, major technology conversions,” Chief Executive Officer Kathryn Marinello said in a statement.\n“By 2019, we should begin to evolve toward a more competitive earnings profile.”\nMarinello was appointed to the top job more than a year ago with backing from the company’s biggest shareholder Carl Icahn, who held a 34.95 percent stake as of Dec. 31.\nShe took over in 2017 from John Tague who overbought compact and mid-sized cars at a time when more American drivers were opting for SUVs. ( reut.rs/2EUOROp )\nAs part of the turnaround plan, Hertz has been overhauling its rental fleet and investing more in technology upgrades of its app amid pressure from industry over-capacity and pricing.\nThe rise of car-sharing companies has also intensified competition for Hertz.\nHertz benefited from a one-time gain of $679 million due to changes in the U.S. tax law and reported net income from continuing operations of $616 million, or $7.42 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $438 million, or $5.28 per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, Hertz reported a loss of 77 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 60 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose to $2.09 billion from $2.01 billion, beating the analysts’ estimates of $2.06 billion.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
