(Photo: Business Wire)\nStephenson joins Zeevo’s advisory team after more than a decade with a leading global lessor, Dublin-based AerCap (NYSE: AER), where he undertook the implementation of numerous performance-boosting initiatives that delivered financial and operational advantages from streamlined operations; in particular, the synergies achieved through combined operations post AerCap’s acquisition of industry pioneer International Lease Finance Corporation.\n“We are very excited to welcome Dean to Zeevo and to tap his expertise to streamline revenue and finance operations for our aviation clients,” said Zeevo Group Principal Joey Johnsen. “With a continued expansion of the aviation finance sector, technology is playing an increasingly important role in building successful platforms that manage vast volumes of information in an integrated and efficient way.”\nZeevo Group Advisor Dean Stephenson commented: “During my career I have always sought opportunities to provide expertise, leadership, and mentorship in order to improve operations. I am excited to take on an advisory role with Zeevo and further evolve the firm’s solutions for asset management, revenue, and finance operations that enhance leasing clients’ shareholder value.”\nIn a report recently published by KPMG entitled: “The Aviation Industry Leaders,” Peter Chang, President and CEO of Hong Kong-headquartered CDB Aviation, indicated that “big data is among the major issues impacting this burgeoning industry.” Chang explained that “the ability to manage and use our data changes an entire complexion about our business. It allows us to trade with more accuracy and to protect our asset values.” Zeevo has been working with a number of lessors to instill fundamental controls and systems for their asset management, revenue, and finance operations, which will provide the key information to inform decision-making.\n“Technology is today’s de facto competitive advantage. Profit-generating and efficiency-boosting revenue and financial optimization solutions are key to ensuring sustainable future for lessors,” stressed Johnsen.\nAs Zeevo accelerates efforts to solidify its position as a market-leading provider of services to aircraft lessors, the company has also made inroads into knowledge sharing and skill building by enlisting a senior manager to lead its new training practice. Through the Learning and Development service offering, Zeevo aims to support clients as they enhance their teams’ professional skills, imbue knowledge transfer strategies, and prepare for the next phase of industry growth.\nTo bring these and other innovative solutions to the market, Zeevo representatives will be attending ISTAT Americas March 4-6. Company principals Joey Johnsen, John McCartney, and Karen Curtis; Angela Geremia, Head of Technical Operations; and Dave Johnson, Advisor, will be available for individual meetings with existing and prospective clients.\nAbout Zeevo Group LLC\nZeevo Group LLC (\"Zeevo\") provides business, finance and information technology consulting services and products to a broad range of clients representing such key industries as aircraft leasing, technology and consumer products. www.zeevogroup.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005053/en/\nZeevo Group LLC\nMedia Contact:\nCatie Anaya, Direct: +1 760-933-8607\ncanaya@zeevogroup.com\nSource: Zeevo Group LLC",
