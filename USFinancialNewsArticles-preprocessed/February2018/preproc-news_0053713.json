Highlights include:\nAverage 2017 production of approximately 547,800 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, up 3 percent compared to 2016 levels, adjusted for asset sales; oil production up 11 percent in 2017 fourth quarter compared to 2016 fourth quarter, adjusted for asset sales Reduced production, general and administrative and gathering, processing and transportation expenses by approximately $510 million, down 18 percent compared to 2016 levels Projected 2018 capital expenditures program of approximately $1.975 - $2.375 billion, down 12 percent compared to 2017 levels, using midpoint Total 2018 production, adjusted for asset sales, expected to grow approximately 3 percent year-over-year, using midpoint; oil volumes adjusted for asset sales, expected to grow by approximately 5 percent compared to 2017 levels, using midpoint\nDoug Lawler, Chesapeake's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance, as we made significant progress toward our goals of reducing our debt, increasing cash flow generation and margin enhancement. Fiscal year 2017 was a pivotal year for Chesapeake, as we restored our production and increased net cash provided by operations, increased our oil production, adjusted for asset sales, and significantly improved our cost structure by reducing our combined production, general and administrative and gathering, processing, and transportation expenses by approximately $510 million. We further demonstrated the depth of our portfolio by closing on approximately $1.3 billion in asset and property sales and signed additional asset sales for approximately $575 million that we expect to close by the end of the 2018 second quarter. We reduced our outstanding secured term debt by approximately $1.3 billion, or 32 percent, continued to remove legal obligations and recorded the best environmental and safety performance in our company's history.\n\"We are well-positioned to build on our 2017 accomplishments and progress our strategic goals, with our 2018 guidance highlighting improvements in our cost structure, increased oil production, adjusted for asset sales, and increased net cash and margins provided by operations. We expect to deliver production growth, adjusted for asset sales, of 1 percent to 5 percent on reduced capital expenditures. The expected improvements in our cost structure, as well as improved basis pricing differentials and higher NYMEX pricing, result in higher forecasted year-over-year cash flows.\n\"Over the last four years, we have fundamentally transformed our business, removing financial and operational complexity, significantly improving our balance sheet, and addressing numerous legacy issues that have affected past performance. Chesapeake Energy continues to get stronger, and we believe we are well positioned to create meaningful shareholder value in the years ahead.\"\n2017 Full Year Results\nFor the 2017 full year, Chesapeake reported net income of $953 million and net income available to common stockholders of $813 million, or $0.90 per diluted share.

The company's liquidity as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $2.893 billion, which included cash on hand and undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately $2.888 billion under the company's senior secured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the company had $781 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had used $116 million of the revolving credit facility for various letters of credit.\nThe company recently signed additional asset sales agreements for properties in the Mid-Continent, including our Mississippian Lime assets, for approximately $500 million in proceeds that we expect to close by the end of the 2018 second quarter.

In December 2017, the LEBAR 15-34-69 A TR 22H well was placed on production in the gas condensate window of the Turner with a lateral length of approximately 10,100 feet. This well reached a peak rate of 2,600 boe per day (50% oil) and has cumulatively produced 115,000 boe (50% oil) in its first 60 days of production. The LEBAR well is currently producing approximately 2,000 boe per day (45% oil) with a flowing tubing pressure of 2,600 psi after approximately 80 days on production. Chesapeake's seventh producing well targeting the Turner formation, the BB 35-35-72 USA A TR 21H, was completed with a 9,677-foot lateral and is scheduled to be placed on production next week. In January 2018, Chesapeake placed three wells on production from the Sussex formation, averaging approximately 6,895 feet in lateral length, and achieving an average peak rate of 880 boe per day (90% oil), while still cleaning up. Chesapeake added a third rig in October 2017 and expects to add a fourth rig in April 2018. Chesapeake expects to place on production up to 33 wells in 2018, compared to 25 wells in 2017.\nIn the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas, Chesapeake is currently utilizing five drilling rigs and expects to place on production up to 140 wells in 2018, compared to 166 wells in 2017.\nIn the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania, Chesapeake is currently utilizing one drilling rig and expects to place on production up to 55 wells in 2018, compared to 43 wells in 2017. Chesapeake expects to keep its total gross operated production from the region effectively flat compared to 2017 at approximately 2.1 bcf per day.\nIn the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana, Chesapeake is currently utilizing three drilling rigs and expects to place on production up to 25 wells in 2018, compared to 36 wells in 2017. In December 2017, Chesapeake placed the Nabors 13&12-10-13 1HC well on production from the Bossier formation, its first ever Bossier horizontal well with a lateral length of more than 10,000 feet, which achieved a peak rate of 35.8 million cubic feet of gas per day.\nIn the Utica Shale in northeast Ohio, Chesapeake is currently utilizing two drilling rigs and expects to place on production up to 40 wells in 2018, compared to 67 wells in 2017.\nIn the company's Mid-Continent operating area in Oklahoma, Chesapeake is currently utilizing one drilling rig and expects to place on production up to 40 wells in 2018, compared to 71 wells in 2017. Chesapeake expects to spud its first horizontal well targeting the Chester formation in Woods County in May 2018 and its first horizontal well targeting the Hunton formation in June 2018. If successful, Chesapeake could drill up to 10 additional Chester and Hunton tests in 2018.\nKey Financial and Operational Results\nThe table below summarizes Chesapeake's key financial and operational results during the 2017 fourth quarter and full year as compared to results in prior periods.\nThree Months Ended\nFull Year Ended\n12/31/17\n12/31/16\n12/31/17\n12/31/16\nBarrels of oil equivalent production (in mmboe)\n55\n53\n200\n233\nOil production (in mmbbls)\n9\n8\n33\n33\nAverage realized oil price ($/bbl) (a)\n56.47\n47.37\n53.19\n43.58\nNatural gas production (in bcf)\n239\n236\n878\n1,049\nAverage realized natural gas price ($/mcf) (a)\n2.76\n2.41\n2.75\n2.20\nNGL production (in mmbbls)\n5\n5\n21\n24\nAverage realized NGL price ($/bbl) (a)\n27.98\n20.90\n22.98\n14.43\nProduction expenses ($/boe)\n2.50\n2.98\n2.81\n3.05\nGathering, processing and transportation expenses ($/boe)\n7.15\n7.92\n7.36\n7.98\nOil - ($/bbl)\n3.90\n3.87\n3.94\n3.61\nNatural Gas - ($/mcf)\n1.30\n1.46\n1.34\n1.47\nNGL - ($/bbl)\n7.83\n8.05\n7.88\n7.83\nProduction taxes ($/boe)\n0.45\n0.38\n0.44\n0.32\nGeneral and administrative expenses ($/boe) (b)\n1.19\n1.11\n1.13\n0.87\nGeneral and administrative expenses (stock-based compensation) (non-cash) ($/boe)\n0.15\n0.17\n0.18\n0.16\nDD&A of oil and natural gas properties ($/boe)\n5.23\n4.03\n4.56\n4.31\nDD&A of other assets ($/boe)\n0.37\n0.40\n0.41\n0.45\nInterest expense ($/boe) (a)\n2.25\n1.61\n2.11\n1.18\nMarketing, gathering and compression net margin($ in millions)\n(4)\n(25)\n(87)\n(194)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities ($ in millions)\n472\n(254)\n745\n(204)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities ($/boe)\n8.65\n(4.79)\n3.73\n(0.88)\nOperating cash flow ($ in millions) (c)\n577\n(107)\n1,216\n557\nOperating cash flow ($/boe)\n10.57\n(2.02)\n6.09\n2.39\nNet income (loss) ($ in millions)\n334\n(341)\n953\n(4,399)\nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders ($ in millions)\n309\n(740)\n813\n(4,915)\nNet income (loss) per share available to common stockholders – diluted ($)\n0.33\n(0.83)\n0.90\n(6.43)\nAdjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) (d)\n706\n385\n2,160\n1,350\nAdjusted EBITDA ($/boe)\n12.94\n7.26\n10.80\n5.79\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to Chesapeake ($ in millions) (e)\n314\n64\n742\n(31)\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to Chesapeake per share - diluted ($ in millions) (f)\n0.30\n0.07\n0.82\n(0.03)\n(a)\nIncludes the effects of realized gains (losses) from hedging, but excludes the effects of unrealized gains (losses) from hedging.\n(b)\nExcludes expenses associated with stock-based compensation, which are recorded in general and administrative expenses in Chesapeake's Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n(c)\nDefined as cash flow provided by operating activities before changes in components of working capital and other assets and liabilities.

Forward-looking statements are statements other than statements of historical fact. They include statements that give our current expectations, management's outlook guidance or forecasts of future events, production and well connection forecasts, estimates of operating costs, anticipated capital and operational efficiencies, planned development drilling and expected drilling cost reductions, anticipated timing of wells to be placed into production, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures, the timing of anticipated asset sales and proceeds to be received therefrom, the expected use of proceeds of anticipated asset sales, projected cash flow and liquidity, our ability to enhance our cash flow and financial flexibility, plans and objectives for future operations, the ability of our employees, portfolio strength and operational leadership to create long-term value, and the assumptions on which such statements are based. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate or changed assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include those described under \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in Chesapeake's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K (available at http://www.chk.com/investors/sec-filings ). These risk factors include the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms; the availability of cash flows from operations and other funds to finance reserve replacement costs or satisfy our debt obligations; downgrade in our credit rating requiring us to post more collateral under certain commercial arrangements; write-downs of our oil and natural gas asset carrying values due to low commodity prices; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; our ability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; commodity derivative activities resulting in lower prices realized on oil, natural gas and NGL sales; the need to secure derivative liabilities and the inability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations; adverse developments or losses from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings, including royalty claims; charges incurred in response to market conditions and in connection with our ongoing actions to reduce financial leverage and complexity; drilling and operating risks and resulting liabilities; effects of environmental protection laws and regulation on our business; legislative and regulatory initiatives further regulating hydraulic fracturing; our need to secure adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and to dispose of or recycle the water used; impacts of potential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change; federal and state tax proposals affecting our industry; potential OTC derivatives regulation limiting our ability to hedge against commodity price fluctuations; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry; a deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions; negative public perceptions of our industry; limited control over properties we do not operate; pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and transportation interruptions; terrorist activities and cyber-attacks adversely impacting our operations; an interruption in operations at our headquarters due to a catastrophic event; certain anti-takeover provisions that affect shareholder rights; and our inability to increase or maintain our liquidity through debt repurchases, capital exchanges, asset sales, joint ventures, farmouts or other means.\nIn addition, disclosures concerning the estimated contribution of derivative contracts to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Our production forecasts are also dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. Expected asset sales may not be completed in the time frame anticipated or at all. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation to update any of the information provided in this release or the accompanying Outlook, except as required by applicable law.

Operating cash flow is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under GAAP and provides useful information to investors for analysis of the Company's ability to generate cash to fund exploration and development, and to service debt. Operating cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate cash that is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Operating cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. Because operating cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net cash provided by operating activities and may vary among companies, our calculation of operating cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The increase in operating cash flow for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is mainly due to an increase in prices and volumes. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $290 million paid to assign an oil transportation agreement to a third party and $126 million paid to terminate future natural gas transportation commitments.\n(b)\nEBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. EBITDA is presented as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of our business. We believe that it provides additional information regarding our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. This measure is widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. EBITDA is also a financial measurement that, with certain negotiated adjustments, is reported to our lenders pursuant to our bank credit agreements and is used in the financial covenants in our bank credit agreements. EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance (or liquidity) under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income from operations or cash flows from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA\n($ in millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n$\n764\n$\n(199)\n$\n2,376\n$\n(3,186)\nAdjustments:\nUnrealized losses (gains) on oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives\n73\n395\n(354)\n818\nUnrealized losses on supply contract derivative\n—\n—\n—\n297\nRestructuring and other termination costs\n—\n3\n—\n6\nProvision for legal contingencies, net\n(73)\n11\n(38)\n123\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n—\n—\n—\n2,564\nImpairments of fixed assets and other\n(5)\n43\n421\n838\nNet gains on sales of fixed assets\n(3)\n(7)\n(3)\n(12)\nImpairments of investments\n—\n119\n—\n119\nLoss on sale of investment\n—\n—\n—\n10\n(Gains) losses on purchases or exchanges of debt\n(50)\n19\n(233)\n(236)\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(1)\n(1)\n(4)\n9\nOther\n1\n2\n(5)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (a)\n$\n706\n$\n385\n$\n2,160\n$\n1,350\n(a)\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results.

Management believes that PV-9 provides useful information to investors regarding the company's collateral position and that PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, management believes the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating the company. Neither PV-9 nor PV-10 should be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as computed under GAAP.\nCHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK AS OF FEBRUARY 22, 2018\nChesapeake periodically provides guidance on certain factors that affect the company's future financial performance.\nYear Ending\n12/31/2018\nProduction Growth adjusted for asset sales (a)\n1% to 5%\nAbsolute Production\nLiquids - mmbbls\n51.0 - 55.0\nOil - mmbbls\n31.0 - 33.0\nNGL - mmbbls\n20.0 - 22.0\nNatural gas - bcf\n825 - 875\nTotal absolute production - mmboe\n190 - 200\nAbsolute daily rate - mboe\n515 - 550\nEstimated Realized Hedging Effects (b) (based on 2/16/18 strip prices):\nOil - $/bbl\n($5.38)\nNatural gas - $/mcf\n$0.19\nNGL - $/bbl\n$0.02\nEstimated Basis to NYMEX Prices:\nOil - $/bbl\n$1.00 - $1.20\nNatural gas - $/mcf\n($0.10) - ($0.20)\nNGL - $/bbl\n($5.20) - ($5.60)\nOperating Costs per Boe of Projected Production:\nProduction expense\n$2.60 - $2.80\nGathering, processing and transportation expenses\n$6.95 - $7.65\nOil - $/bbl\n$3.90 - $4.10\nNatural Gas - $/mcf\n$1.25 - $1.40\nNGL - $/bbl\n$7.85 - $8.25\nProduction taxes\n$0.50 - $0.60\nGeneral and administrative (c)\n$1.25 - $1.35\nStock-based compensation (noncash)\n$0.10 - $0.20\nDD&A of natural gas and liquids assets\n$5.00 - $6.00\nDepreciation of other assets\n$0.35 - $0.45\nInterest expense (d)\n$2.40 - $2.60\nMarketing, gathering and compression net margin (e)\n($60) - ($40)\nBook Tax Rate\n0%\nAdjusted EBITDA, based on 2/16/18 strip prices ($ in millions) (f)\n$2,200 - $2,400\nCapital Expenditures ($ in millions) (g)\n$1,800 - $2,200\nCapitalized Interest ($ in millions)\n$175\nTotal Capital Expenditures ($ in millions)\n$1,975 - $2,375\n(a)\nBased on 2017 production of 515 mboe per day, adjusted for 2017 asset sales and 2018 asset sales signed to date.\n(b)\nIncludes expected settlements for oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives adjusted for option premiums. For derivatives closed early, settlements are reflected in the period of original contract expiration.\n(c)\nExcludes expenses associated with stock-based compensation, which are recorded in general and administrative expenses in Chesapeake's Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n(d)\nExcludes unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate derivatives.\n(e)\nExcludes non-cash amortization of approximately $22 million related to the buydown of a transportation agreement.\n(f)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by management to evaluate the company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and natural gas producing companies. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net income but, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the amount or significance of events or transactions that may be included in future GAAP net income but that management does not believe to be representative of underlying business performance. The company further believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile forecasted adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income would imply a degree of precision that may be confusing or misleading to investors. Items excluded from net income to arrive at adjusted EBITDA include interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense as well as one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated.\n(g)\nIncludes capital expenditures for drilling and completion, leasehold, geological and geophysical costs, rig termination payments and other property, plant and equipment. Excludes any additional proved property acquisitions.\nOil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Hedging Activities\nChesapeake enters into oil, natural gas and NGL derivative transactions in order to mitigate a portion of its exposure to adverse changes in market prices. Please see the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K filed by Chesapeake with the SEC for detailed information about derivative instruments the company uses, its quarter-end derivative positions and accounting for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids derivatives.\nAs of February 22, 2018, including January and February derivative contracts that have settled, the company had downside price protection on a portion of its 2018 oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production. Through swaps, the company had downside oil price protection at an average price of $52.87 per bbl, and under three-way collar arrangements based on an average bought put NYMEX price of $47.00 per bbl and exposure below an average sold put NYMEX price of $39.15 per bbl. Through swaps and two way collars, the company had downside gas price protection at an average price of $3.10 per mcf. Chesapeake also had downside ethane, propane and butane price protection through swaps at an average price of $0.28, $0.73 and $0.88 per gallon (as well as a portion of butane at 70.5% of WTI), respectively. Further details summarized below.\nIn addition, the company had downside protection, through open swaps on a portion of its 2019 oil production at an average price of $56.04 per bbl.\nThe company's crude oil hedging positions were as follows:\nOpen Crude Oil Swaps\nGains (Losses) from Closed Crude Oil Trades\nOpen Swaps\n(mbbls)\nAvg.
