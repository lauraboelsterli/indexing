    "text": "Romania: Thousands demonstrate to support Romania’s anti-corruption prosecutor February 26th, 2018 Europe \nThousands of people rallied in freezing weather across Romania on Sunday, protesting a government call to sack the country’s chief anti-corruption prosecutor and demanding the resignation of the justice minister. \nOn Thursday, the minister, Tudorel Toader had called for the president to dismiss the prosecutor, Laura Codruta Kovesi for “excess of authority”, a move that would disrupt a crackdown on corruption in one of the European Union’s most graft-prone members. \nIn Bucharest, an estimated 4,000 protesters rallied in front of the government, braving heavy snow and shouting “Thieves, thieves,” “Tudorel, do something, Resign!” and “Codruta, keep it up!” \n  uk.reuters.com",
