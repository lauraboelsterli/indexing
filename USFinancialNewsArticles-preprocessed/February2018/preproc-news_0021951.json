All amounts are expressed per share of common stock based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may differ from federal income tax regulations.\nDistribution Estimates\nJanuary 2018\nYear-to-date (YTD)\nSources\nPer Share Amount\n% of Current Distribution\nPer Share Amount\n% of Cumulative Distributions\nNet Investment Income\n$0.012\n19%\n$0.066\n34%\nNet Realized Short-Term Capital Gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNet Realized Long-Term Capital Gains\n0.011\n17%\n0.129\n66%\nReturn of Capital (or Other Capital Source)\n0.042\n64%\n-\n-\nTotal (per common share)\n$0.065\n100%\n$0.195\n100%\nDecember 31, 2017\nAverage annual total return* on NAV for the 5 years\n13.18%\nAnnualized current distribution rate as a percentage of NAV\n8.03%\nCumulative total return on NAV for the fiscal year\n-1.39%\nCumulative fiscal year distributions as a percentage of NAV\n1.34%\nThe Fund will issue a separate 19(a) notice at the time of each monthly distribution using the most current financial information available. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution plan.\nThe Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n* Simple arithmetic average of each of the past five annual returns.\nDNP Select Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: DNP) is a closed-end diversified investment management company. The Fund's primary investment objectives are current income and long-term growth of income. The Fund seeks to achieve these objectives by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities of companies in the public utilities industry.
