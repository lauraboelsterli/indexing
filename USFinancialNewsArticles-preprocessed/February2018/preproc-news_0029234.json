For its part, AI — which is used in everything from autonomous cars and translation services to tailored recommendations on what to watch and buy — is slowly but surely becoming an increasingly important part of the modern world. Will.i.am hailed the transformative nature of technology. \n\"No-one thought that Ubers would help solve, you know, social issues with cab drivers in New York not stopping for African-Americans,\" he said. \"Well, Uber tells the world that that person is not African-American, that person is data, and you don't need… a security barrier because we're not going to exchange in cash.\" \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .
