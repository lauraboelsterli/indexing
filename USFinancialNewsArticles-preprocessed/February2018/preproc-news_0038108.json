The two properties under development were 100% pre-leased and are expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2018. Approximately 90% of the GLA for HTA's 2017 investments are located in HTA's existing key markets, allowing HTA to manage and service these properties with its existing property management, building services, and leasing platform, thereby generating additional cash flow opportunities. Cash NOI: During the quarter, HTA generated $33.9 million of Cash NOI on its 2017 investments, including a partial period impact for acquisitions that had closed and developments that were completed during the period.

In addition, during the quarter, HTA entered into renewal leases totaling approximately 95,000 square feet of GLA. HTA executed these leases utilizing its existing in-house leasing representatives which would have resulted in capitalized leasing commissions totaling $0.3 million, or approximately 1% of quarterly Cash NOI, if third party brokers had been used by HTA. Property Management & Building Services: As of December 31, 2017, HTA provided property management services to 95% of its 2017 investments as measured by GLA. During the quarter, HTA earned approximately $1.3 million of property management fees related to these properties which were included in total Cash NOI. On an annual basis, these properties generated a total of approximately $5.2 million in property management fees. As of December 31, 2017, HTA provided building services to approximately 65% of the multi-tenant properties included in its 2017 investments. In addition, during the quarter, HTA earned $0.4 million in expense recoveries from building services which were included in total Cash NOI.

As such, five of the seven development properties acquired by HTA as a part of the Duke Assets have been completed, with a majority thereof fully leased at this time. As of the end of the quarter, these five properties were 82% leased and generated $1.0 million of Cash NOI. HTA is currently in the late stages of lease negotiations for an additional 14,000 square feet of GLA that would bring the leased rate on these properties to 89% if completed. The seven development properties are projected to generate between $2.50 million and $2.75 million in quarterly Cash NOI upon completion and stabilization.\nYear Ended 2017 Highlights\nOperating\nNet Income Attributable to Common Stockholders: Increased 39.2% to $63.9 million, compared to 2016.

Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2017, transaction costs included $4.6 million of non-incremental costs related to the Duke acquisition.\n(2)\nSame-Property includes 343 and 295 buildings for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) before: (i) general and administrative expenses; (ii) transaction expenses; (iii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iv) impairment; (v) interest expense and net change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (vi) gain or loss on sales of real estate; (vii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (viii) income or loss from unconsolidated joint venture; and (ix) other income or expense. HTA believes that NOI provides an accurate measure of the operating performance of its operating assets because NOI excludes certain items that are not associated with the management of its properties. Additionally, HTA believes that NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). However, HTA's use of the term NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance. NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nCash NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes from NOI: (i) straight-line rent adjustments; and (ii) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests. Contractual base rent, contractual rent increases, contractual rent concessions and changes in occupancy or lease rates upon commencement and expiration of leases are a primary driver of HTA's revenue performance. HTA believes that Cash NOI, which removes the impact of straight-line rent adjustments, provides another measurement of the operating performance of its operating assets. Additionally, HTA believes that Cash NOI is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance of REITs. However, HTA's use of the term Cash NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs as they may have different methodologies for computing this amount. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance. Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nTo facilitate the comparison of Cash NOI between periods, HTA calculates comparable amounts for a subset of its owned and operational properties referred to as \"Same-Property\". Same-Property Cash NOI excludes properties which have not been owned and operated by HTA during the entire span of all periods presented, excluding properties intended for disposition in the near term, development and land parcels, HTA's share of unconsolidated joint ventures, notes receivable interest income and certain non-routine items. Same-Property Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance. Same-Property Cash NOI should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nHEALTHCARE TRUST OF AMERICA, INC.\nFFO, NORMALIZED FFO AND NORMALIZED FAD\n(unaudited and in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$\n42,526\n$\n16,551\n$\n63,916\n$\n45,912\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to investments in real estate\n71,543\n46,067\n243,221\n175,544\nGain on sale of real estate, net\n(37,799)\n(4,754)\n(37,802)\n(8,966)\nImpairment\n8,829\n3,080\n13,922\n3,080\nProportionate share of joint venture depreciation and amortization\n463\n—\n969\n—\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n85,562\n$\n60,944\n$\n284,226\n$\n215,570\nTransaction expenses (1)\n267\n1,541\n1,242\n6,538\nGain on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, net\n—\n(3,488)\n(884)\n(1,344)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt, net\n—\n3\n11,192\n3,025\nNoncontrolling income from partnership units included in diluted shares\n903\n513\n1,538\n1,315\nOther normalizing items, net (2)\n—\n—\n4,643\n117\nNormalized FFO attributable to common stockholders\n$\n86,732\n$\n59,513\n$\n301,957\n$\n225,221\nOther income\n(42)\n(66)\n(29)\n(286)\nNon-cash compensation expense\n1,377\n1,935\n6,870\n7,071\nStraight-line rent adjustments, net\n(2,803)\n(523)\n(8,637)\n(4,159)\nAmortization of (below) and above market leases/leasehold interests and corporate assets, net\n652\n554\n2,119\n2,030\nDeferred revenue - tenant improvement related\n(5)\n—\n(28)\n—\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount/premium, net\n1,287\n816\n4,216\n3,104\nRecurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions\n(14,588)\n(10,032)\n(45,608)\n(32,898)\nNormalized FAD attributable to common stockholders\n$\n72,610\n$\n52,197\n$\n260,860\n$\n200,083\nNet income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share\n$\n0.20\n$\n0.11\n$\n0.34\n$\n0.33\nFFO adjustments per diluted share, net\n0.21\n0.31\n1.19\n1.21\nFFO attributable to common stockholders per diluted share\n$\n0.41\n$\n0.42\n$\n1.53\n$\n1.54\nNormalized FFO adjustments per diluted share, net\n0.01\n(0.01)\n0.10\n0.07\nNormalized FFO attributable to common stockholders per diluted share\n$\n0.42\n$\n0.41\n$\n1.63\n$\n1.61\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\n208,626\n146,050\n185,278\n140,259\n(1)\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, amounts reflect the prospective presentation of the early adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017.\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, other normalizing items include $4.6 million of non-incremental costs related to the Duke acquisition that were included in transaction expenses on HTA's condensed consolidated statements of operations. In addition, other normalizing items excludes lease termination fees as they are deemed to be generated in the ordinary course of business.\nHTA computes FFO in accordance with the current standards established by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property and impairment write-downs of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to investments in real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. HTA presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen based on market conditions, many industry investors have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, among other items, it provides a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss attributable to common stockholders.\nHTA computes Normalized FFO, which excludes from FFO: (i) transaction expenses; (ii) gain or loss on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments; (iii) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (iv) noncontrolling income or loss from partnership units included in diluted shares; and (v) other normalizing items, which include items that are unusual and infrequent in nature. HTA presents this non-GAAP financial measure because it allows for the comparison of its operating performance to other REITs and between periods on a consistent basis. HTA's methodology for calculating Normalized FFO may be different from the methods utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to other REITs. Normalized FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance, nor is it indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Normalized FFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nHTA also computes Normalized FAD, which excludes from Normalized FFO: (i) other income or expense; (ii) non-cash compensation expense; (iii) straight-line rent adjustments; (iv) amortization of below and above market leases/leasehold interests and corporate assets; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premium/discount; and (vi) recurring capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. HTA believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance. Normalized FAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its financial performance, nor is it indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Normalized FAD should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthcare-trust-of-america-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-ended-2017-earnings-300599818.html\nSOURCE Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.",
