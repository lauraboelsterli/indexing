    "text": "WASHINGTON—Prices for foreign-made goods imported to the U.S. rose in January, driven by a broad range of product price increases and capping a week of solid inflation readings.\nImport prices increased 1% in January from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday, beating expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The January rise matched November’s increase and hasn’t been exceeded since May 2016, when the index grew 1.2%.\n ",
