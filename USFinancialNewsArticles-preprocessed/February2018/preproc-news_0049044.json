    "text": "Company Grew Net Sales by 12% and Delivered Record Operating Cash Flow in 2017\nCompany delivered $289 million of net earnings and record adjusted EBIT of $855 million Roofing produced revenue of $2.6 billion and EBIT of $535 million Composites posted EBIT of $291 million, a fifth consecutive year of improved performance Insulation increased revenue by 14% and delivered EBIT of $177 million, up 40% Completed acquisition of Paroc Group on February 5, 2018\nTOLEDO, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) today reported consolidated net sales of $1.6 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, compared with $1.4 billion in fourth-quarter 2016, an increase of 16%. Full-year 2017 consolidated net sales were $6.4 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in 2016, an increase of 12%.\nFourth-quarter 2017 net loss attributable to Owens Corning was $4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $86 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, during the comparable quarter in 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings were $125 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with $81 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, during the same period one year ago (See Use of Non-GAAP Measures, See Table 7).\nFull-year 2017 net earnings were $289 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $393 million, or $3.41 per diluted share, during 2016. Adjusted earnings in 2017 were $498 million, or $4.40 per diluted share, compared with $419 million, or $3.63 per diluted share, during 2016.\n“Owens Corning had another great year. We were pleased by the continued momentum in our three businesses and the addition of Paroc and Foamglas to our portfolio,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Thaman. “In 2018, the company is again positioned to produce strong revenue and earnings growth with substantial free cash flow.”\nConsolidated Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results\nOwens Corning continued to perform at a very high level of safety in 2017, with a recordable incident rate of 0.50, a slight improvement over 2016. Reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for fourth-quarter 2017 were $150 million, up from $136 million during the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBIT in fourth-quarter 2017 was $215 million, up from $157 million in 2016 (See Table 2). Reported EBIT for full-year 2017 was $737 million, compared with $699 million during 2016. Adjusted EBIT in 2017 was $855 million, up from $746 million in 2016. The company generated record operating cash flow of $1.0 billion and record free cash flow of $679 million in 2017 (See Table 8). The company converted adjusted earnings to free cash flow at a rate of 136%. During 2017, Owens Corning repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $142 million. As of the end of 2017, 7.5 million shares were available for repurchase under the current authorization. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company recorded $65 million in charges excluded from adjusted EBIT, primarily related to pension risk mitigation actions, an environmental provision for a closed site and costs associated with prior decisions in the Composites business. As a result of the U.S. tax reform legislation, the company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $82 million, producing a loss in the fourth quarter.\nOther Significant Matters\nOn February 5, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Paroc Group, a leading producer of mineral wool insulation in Europe, further broadening the product portfolio and expanding the geographic footprint of the Insulation business. The company issued $400 million of 30-year notes at 4.4% on January 23, 2018 in association with this transaction. On February 1, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share, a 5% increase compared with the same period in the prior year. The dividend will be payable on April 3, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 9, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nThe company expects an environment consistent with consensus expectations for U.S. housing starts and global industrial production growth. In Roofing, the company expects growth in both the new construction and remodeling markets. Storm demand at historical averages would result in a mid-single digit decline of the overall asphalt shingle market. The components business is expected to continue to grow at a double-digit rate. In Composites, the company expects continued growth in the glass fiber market, driven by global industrial production growth. In 2018, the company expects EBIT improvement of about $20 million, with the benefit of market growth and improved pricing partly offset by accelerated inflation and higher rebuild costs. In Insulation, the company expects to deliver EBIT growth of about $150 million, primarily from the realization of previously implemented pricing actions, the 2018 benefit from Paroc and Foamglas, and improvement in the mineral wool business. This outlook does not include the potential benefit of additional price actions, primarily in the U.S. residential new construction business. The company estimates an effective tax rate of 26 percent to 28 percent, a six-point reduction from the 2017 guidance, as a result of tax reform. The company continues to expect a cash tax rate of 10 percent to 12 percent on adjusted pre-tax earnings, due to the company’s U.S. tax net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The company’s advantaged cash tax position is largely unchanged as a result of the tax reform. The company expects general corporate expenses to be between $140 million and $150 million in 2018. Capital additions in 2018 are expected to total approximately $500 million. Interest expense is expected to be between $125 million and $130 million.\nNext Earnings Announcement\nFirst-quarter 2018 results will be announced on Wednesday, April 25, 2018.\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Conference Call and Presentation\nWednesday, February 21, 2018\n11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time\nAll Callers\nLive dial-in telephone number: U.S. 1.888.317.6003; Canada 1.866.284.3684; and other international +1.412.317.6061.\nEntry number: 911-0581 (Please dial in 10-15 minutes before conference call start time)\nLive webcast: https://services.choruscall.com/links/oc180221.html\nTelephone and Webcast Replay\nTelephone replay will be available one hour after the end of the call through February 28, 2018.

For more information, please visit www.owenscorning.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nOwens Corning uses non-GAAP measures in its earnings press release that are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information. These non-GAAP measures include EBIT, adjusted EBIT, adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Owens Corning common stockholders (“adjusted EPS”), adjusted pre-tax earnings, and free cash flow. When used to report historical financial information, reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included in the financial tables of this press release. Specifically, see Table 2 for EBIT and adjusted EBIT, Table 7 for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS, and Table 8 for free cash flow.\nFor purposes of internal review of Owens Corning’s year-over-year operational performance, management excludes from net earnings attributable to Owens Corning certain items it believes are not representative of ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures resulting from these adjustments (including adjusted EBIT, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted pre-tax earnings) are used internally by Owens Corning for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors, analysis of performance, and related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these adjustments result in a measure that provides a useful representation of its operational performance; however, the adjusted measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings attributable to Owens Corning as prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to help evaluate the company's ability to generate cash to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow is not a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures due to the company’s mandatory debt service requirements. Free cash flow is used internally by the company for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors of the company and analysis of performance. Management believes that this measure provides a useful representation of our operational performance and liquidity; however, the measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow provided by operating activities as prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWhen the company provides forward-looking expectations for non-GAAP measures (adjusted EBIT and adjusted pre-tax earnings), the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures are generally not available without unreasonable effort due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP measures in future periods. The variability in timing and amount of adjusting items could have significant and unpredictable effect on our future GAAP results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
