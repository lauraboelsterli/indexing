    "text": "FRANKLIN, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Third Century Bancorp (“Company”) (OTCPINK:TDCB), the holding company for Mutual Savings Bank (“Bank”) announced it had net income of $1,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $226,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share. The decline in net income for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily driven by a $173,000 income tax charge due to the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act lowered the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%, which will lower the Company’s provision for federal income taxes in future years. The Tax Act was signed into law during the fourth quarter of 2017 and generally accepted accounting principles requires that the impact of the provisions of the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. As such, the Company was required to write down the value of its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net income of $560,000, or $0.47 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, or $0.55 per basic and diluted share. The decrease in net income for 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the $173,000 income tax charge related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets described above.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income decreased $225,000, or 99.56%, to $1,000 as compared to $226,000 for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 was primarily a result of the $173,000 income tax charge related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets. Offsetting this one-time non-recurring charge was a $155,000, or 14.29%, increase in net interest income, which was achieved through an increase in interest income of $209,000, or 17.27%, partially offset by a $54,000, or 43.05%, increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, along with higher average loan balances. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average balances of interest bearing liabilities and a higher average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities.\nThe increase in net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was partially offset by a $26,000 increase in provision for loan losses compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher levels of loan growth.\nThe decrease in net income for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by a $64,000 decrease in noninterest income, a $168,000 increase in noninterest expense and a $122,000 increase in income tax expense. The decrease in noninterest income was due to decreases in gains on sales of loans, trust income, and deposit fee and service charge income for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period. The increase in noninterest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits as well as a write down related to a property that the Company holds for sale. The increase in income tax expense was due to the income tax charge related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets that took place in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income decreased $131,000, or 19.00%, to $560,000 from $691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of $658,000, or 14.79%, to $5.0 million from $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a $708,000, or 14.43%, increase in interest income partially offset by a $140,000, or 30.63%, increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets, along with higher average loan balances. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average balances of interest bearing liabilities and a higher average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities.\nThe increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially offset by a $116,000 increase in the provision for loan losses compared to 2016. The increase in provision for loan losses was primarily driven by credit quality factors, including net loan charge-offs of $267,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net loan recoveries of $3,000 for 2016.\nThe increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by a $105,000 decrease in noninterest income, a $291,000 increase in noninterest expense and a $187,000 increase in income tax expense. The decrease in noninterest income was due to decreases in gains on sales of loans, trust income, and deposit fee and service charge income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits. The increase in income tax expense was due to the income tax charge related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets, as well as an increase in income before income tax for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.\nTotal assets increased $15.1 million to $151.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $135.9 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of 11.04%. The increase was primarily due to a $9.6 million, or 8.73%, increase in net loans, primarily funded by a $14.9 million, or 15.25%, increase in total deposits. At December 31, 2017, the weighted average rate of all Federal Home Loan Bank advances was 1.44% compared to 1.35% at December 31, 2016, and the weighted average maturity was 4.3 years at December 31, 2017 compared to 3.5 years at December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for loan losses decreased by $145,000, or 11.63%, to $1.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2016. The decline was due to net loan charge-offs of $267,000, partially offset by the provision for loan losses of $122,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses totaled 103.37% of non-performing loans and 0.91% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans totaled $1,066,000 or 0.88% of total loans as of December 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity was $15.9 million at December 31, 2017, up from $15.8 million at December 31, 2016. Stockholders’ equity increased by $99,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 with net income of $560,000, partially offset by the repurchase of 17,202 shares of common stock at a total cost of $211,000 and cash dividends paid of $249,000. Equity as a percentage of assets decreased to 10.52% at December 31, 2017 compared to 11.61% at December 31, 2016.\nOn February 22, 2018 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.06 per share for shareholders of record on March 15, 2018. The dividend payable date is April 2, 2018.\nFounded in 1890, Mutual Savings Bank is a full-service financial institution based in Johnson County, Indiana.
