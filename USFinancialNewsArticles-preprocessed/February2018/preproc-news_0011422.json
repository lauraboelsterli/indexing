    "text": "How much you will pay in taxes in retirement depends a lot on where you live.\nNew research from personal finance website GOBankingRates compiles data on sales, property and income taxes, as well as whether Social Security benefits are taxed, to identify the states where retirees face the smallest and biggest bills.\nOne thing that the states that landed at the top of the list have in common: no state taxes on Social Security benefits and mostly low, if any, income taxes.\n\"If you don't have income tax and you don't tax Social Security, you're going to be a great destination for retirees, even if you didn't make the top five,\" said Andrew DePietro, research and data analyst at GOBankingRates.\nWhile Florida came in seventh, it is number one among the most populous states, DePietro noted.\n\"It's definitely going to stay a haven for retirees,\" DePietro said. \"I don't really see that changing.\"\nMost tax-friendly states Rank State State sales tax State tax on Social Security benefits Property tax Income tax 1 Alaska 1.76% None 0.97% 0.00% 2 Wyoming 5.41% None 0.52% 0.00% 3 Delaware 0.00% None 0.57% 5.55% 4 New Hampshire 0.00% None 1.94% 0.00% 5 Washington 6.29% None 0.89% 0.00% 6 Nevada 7.98% None 0.65% 0.00% 7 Florida 6.80% None 0.90% 0.00% 8 South Dakota 6.39% None 1.19% 0.00% 9 Tennessee 9.46% None 0.71% 0.00% 10 Hawaii 4.35% None 0.29% 7.20% Source: GOBankingRates States that had high taxes in any of the categories GOBankingRates evaluated were pushed farther down the list.\n\"You don't have to be the worst tax in each category, but if they aggregate together, that's how you get a very bad ranking,\" DePietro said.\nLeast tax-friendly states Click to edit State State Sales Tax State Tax on Social Security Benefits Property Tax Income Tax 1 Nebraska 6.89% Taxpayer can subtract SS income included in federal AGI if AGI is less than or equal to $58K for married couples filing jointly or $43K for other filers 1.60% 5.01% 2 Minnesota 7.30% Taxed to the extent they are taxed at the federal level 1.09% 7.05% 3 Connecticut 6.35% Exempt for individual taxpayers w/ federal adjusted gross income less than $50K and married taxpayers filing jointly w/ federal AGI less than $60K 1.66% 5.00% 4 Kansas 8.62% Exempt from Kansas income tax for residents w/ federal AGI of $75K or less 1.26% 4.90% 5 Missouri 7.89% Not taxed for single taxpayers w/ AGI less than $85K and married couples w/ AGI less than $100K 0.96% 6.00% 6 Vermont 6.18% Taxed to the extent they are taxed at the federal level 1.76% 3.55% 7 Rhode Island 7.00% No tax for single filers w/ up to $80K in AGI and married filers w/ up to $100K in AGI 1.51% 3.75% 8 New Mexico 7.55% Taxed, but can be included as part of an overall retirement-income exemption of up to $8K per person 0.65% 4.90% 9 West Virginia 6.29% Taxed to the extent they are taxed at the federal level 0.51% 6.00% 10 Utah 6.76% Benefits taxed; may qualify for retirement-income tax credit 0.62% 5.00% Source: GOBankingRates More from Personal Finance\nRetire in paradise: 5 countries where you can live the dream\nThe rule that protects your retirement savings may be on the ropes\nThe number of 401(k) millionaires hits an all-time high.
