(2) Same store sales growth is the percentage change in sales of comparable stores period over period. A store is considered comparable on the first day of the 13th full month of operation. When a store is relocated, it is excluded from the same stores sales growth calculation. Same store sales growth amounts include total charges to customers less any actual returns. Same store sales data reported by other companies may be prepared on a different basis and therefore may not be useful for purposes of comparing our results to those of other businesses. (3) Amounts are adjusted to exclude tax reform and shareholder and other litigation costs. See the “Non-GAAP Information” section below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017\nChanges in Management\nAs announced on October 27, 2017, the Company’s founder and former CEO, Robert Rucker, is serving as the interim CEO until the Company’s Board of Directors identifies a permanent replacement. Effective February 19, 2018, the Company appointed Cabell Lolmaugh as the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\nNet Sales\nNet sales grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to net sales of $5.7 million from stores not included in the comparable store base, offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 4.9%, or $3.7 million. Full year 2017 net sales grew 6.3% compared to 2016. This was driven by 15 stores opened in 2017 and an increase of 0.5% in comparable store sales in 2017. Traffic weakened during the fourth quarter due in part to the Company’s shift in promotional strategy.\nGross Margin Rate\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 66.8% compared with 69.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year gross margin for 2017 was 68.5% compared with 70.0% in 2016. The gross margin rate decline for the fourth quarter was driven primarily by promotions and competitive pricing activity tied to orders initiated during third quarter that were closed in the fourth quarter and orders generated over the Black Friday weekend. Inventory control costs and product mix changes also contributed to the decrease in gross margin for the quarter. The gross margin rate decline for the year was primarily due to promotions and competitive pricing activity and product mix changes.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $56.1 million compared with $51.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $4.4 million increase was driven by approximately $6.0 million of costs associated with opening and operating fifteen new stores. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 included $1.1 million of non-cash impairment charges and $0.9 million of incremental expenses related to work to identify and prioritize growth and expansion opportunities. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a $5.2 million decrease in special charges related to litigation. Full year 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses were $210.4 million in 2017 and $194.0 million in 2016. The $16.4 million increase was primarily due to costs associated with opening and operating fifteen new stores during the year.\nTax and Tax Reform\nIncome tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.3 million compared with $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year, the Company’s effective tax rate was 55.2% in 2017 and 41.1% in 2016. The increase in tax expense and the Company’s overall tax rate was primarily due to a $4.6 million charge taken during the fourth quarter to reduce the value of the Company’s deferred tax assets in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Company anticipates an annual effective tax rate of approximately 26% to 28% in 2018.\nStore Expansion\nThe Company opened four new retail stores in the fourth quarter of 2017, consisting of three Houston, TX area locations (The Woodlands, Houston, and Willowbrook) and its second location in the Orlando, FL market. As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated 138 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\nDIVIDEND\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share. The dividend is payable March 16, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business March 5, 2018. The Company initiated its quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2017.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company’s return to its historical focus on product, service, and presentation, rather than price, will likely result in continued volatility of comparable store traffic and sales in the near term. As a result, the Company is limiting its outlook to the following:\nThree new store openings in 2018 including one store in Hartford, CT that opened on January 19, 2018 and one store in Austin, TX that opened on January 31, 2018. Capital investment of approximately $27 to $32 million, including remodeling approximately 30 stores to support our product presentation strategy. Inventory investment of approximately 25% to 35% year over year, over the next several quarters, to support our product assortment strategy. SG&A expense increase of approximately $5 to $7 million to support our service strategy, including increased expenses for (1) the addition of regional sales leader positions, (2) sales and warehouse staff compensation, and (3) customer relationship management and content management capabilities. The $5 to $7 million increase in SG&A expense is incremental to the expected SG&A expense increases associated with a full year of operations for the fifteen stores opened in 2017 and the three new stores opening in 2018.\nLonger term, the Company remains committed to achieving both Adjusted EBITDA margin and pretax return on capital employed of greater than 20%.\nNon-GAAP Information\nThe Company presents non-GAAP (loss) income and Adjusted EBITDA to provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s normalized operating performance.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.4 million compared with net income of $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year non-GAAP net income for 2017 was $16.5 million compared with $23.1 million in 2016. Non-GAAP diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.05 compared with $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2017 was $0.32 compared with $0.45 per share in 2016. See the “Non-GAAP (Loss) Income Reconciliation” table and the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP income.\nNon-GAAP (Loss) Income Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Per Share Per Share Pretax Net of Tax Amounts Pretax Net of Tax Amounts (in thousands, except share and per share data) GAAP income $ (4,045 ) $ (7,351 ) $ (0.14 ) $ 1,356 $ 273 $ 0.01 Special charges: Shareholder and other litigation costs 678 413 0.01 5,791 3,524 0.07 Tax reform (1) - 4,562 0.09 - - - Non-GAAP (loss) income (2) $ (3,367 ) $ (2,376 ) $ (0.05 ) $ 7,147 $ 3,797 $ 0.07\n(1) Represents an adjustment for impacts of a change in the income tax provision due to the re-measurement of deferred income tax positions to reflect the new corporate tax rates pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. Non-GAAP net income excludes special charges related to tax reform and shareholder and other litigation costs, and is net of tax. The Company calculates pretax return on capital employed by taking income from operations divided by total assets net of non-interest bearing debt. Non-interest bearing debt includes accounts payable, income taxes payable, other accrued liabilities, deferred rent and other long-term liabilities.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Company management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare Company performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation, and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and the Board of Directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other specialty retailers, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nCompany management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “plan”, “outlook”, and “project” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward looking statements include any statements regarding the Company’s strategic and operational plan and expected financial performance (including the financial performance of new stores). Forward looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward looking statements, including but not limited to unforeseen events that may affect the retail market or the performance of the Company’s stores. The Company does not intend, and undertakes no duty, to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. Investors are referred to the most recent reports filed with the SEC by the Company.\nTile Shop Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n($ in thousands, except share data)\nDecember 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (unaudited) (audited) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,621 $ 6,067 Restricted cash 855 3,000 Trade receivables, net 2,381 2,414 Inventories 85,259 74,295 Income tax receivable 5,726 1,670 Other current assets, net 4,717 8,755 Total Current Assets 105,559 96,201 Property, plant and equipment, net 151,405 141,037 Deferred tax assets 11,654 21,391 Long-term restricted cash - 3,881 Other assets 2,107 2,763 Total Assets $ 270,725 $ 265,273 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 30,771 $ 20,321 Current portion of long-term debt 8,833 6,286 Income tax payable 17 120 Other accrued liabilities 22,413 33,461 Total Current Liabilities 62,034 60,188 Long-term debt, net 18,182 22,126 Capital lease obligation, net 576 697 Deferred rent 41,290 37,595 Other long-term liabilities 4,769 5,768 Total Liabilities 126,851 126,374 Stockholders’ Equity: Common stock, par value $0.0001;
