This is mainly the result of our high charter contract coverage which remains at 86% for the next 12 months based on current operating revenues and 69% in terms of contracted operating days.\nAdjusted net income of $31.2 million for the quarter represented an increase of $8.0 million, or 34.5%, compared to $23.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was attributable to a $5.2 million increase in the operating revenues of the vessels that were previously chartered to Hanjin compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and improved operating performance of $2.8 million.\nAs previously reported, the Company is in breach of certain financial covenants as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy. We are currently engaged in discussions with our lenders regarding restructuring our debt, substantially all of which matures on December 31, 2018. In the meantime, we continue to generate positive cash flows from our operations and currently have sufficient liquidity to service all our operational obligations as well as all scheduled principal amortization and interest payments under the original terms of our debt agreements leading up to the December 2018 maturity date.\nThe charter market in general has stabilized at slightly better levels compared to the lows of 2016. However, although the size segment above 10,000 TEU has recently seen some improvement, the size segment between 5,000 to 10,000 TEU has retracted from the charter rate levels achieved within 2017. For panamax vessels between 4,000 to 5,000 TEU the market is stagnant however comfortably above operating costs. For the smaller feeder sector there is a firming market however the lack of long term fixtures shows that there is no faith in the sustainability. We do not expect a material improvement in the market environment within 2018, given the large number of scheduled vessel deliveries. Danaos continues to have low near term exposure to the weak spot market as a result of the aforementioned charter coverage.\nDuring this extended period of market weakness which has presented many challenges, we remain focused on taking necessary actions to preserve the value of our company.\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Danaos had an average of 55 containerships. Our fleet utilization for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 97.8%, while fleet utilization for the vessels under employment, excluding the off charter days of the vessels that were previously chartered to Hanjin Shipping (\"Hanjin\"), was 97.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 99.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOur adjusted net income amounted to $31.2 million, or $0.28 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million, or $0.21 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. We have adjusted our net income in the three months ended December 31, 2017 for refinancing related professional fees of $5.0 million and a non-cash amortization charge of $3.4 million for fees related to our 2011 comprehensive financing plan (comprised of non-cash, amortizing and accrued finance fees). Please refer to the Adjusted Net Income reconciliation table, which appears later in this earnings release.\nThe increase of $8.0 million in adjusted net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to a $2.1 million increase in operating revenues, a $5.1 million decrease in total operating expenses, a $1.0 million decrease in realized loss on derivatives, a $0.5 million increase in other income and a $0.3 million improvement in the operating performance of our equity investment in Gemini Shipholdings Corporation (\"Gemini\"), which were partially offset by a $1.0 million increase in net finance expenses.\nOn a non-adjusted basis, our net income amounted to $22.8 million, or $0.21 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a loss of $446.6 million, or $4.07 loss per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, which includes $466.9 million of impairment related expenses.\nOperating Revenues\nOperating revenues increased by 1.9%, or $2.1 million, to $114.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $112.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflect:\n$5.2 million increase in revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 due to the recorded charter income of $6.7 million from eight of our vessels previously chartered to Hanjin Shipping (\"Hanjin\") that had recorded operating revenues of $1.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. $2.7 million decrease in revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 due to the re-chartering of certain of our vessels at lower rates. $0.4 million decrease in revenues attributed to fleet utilization in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses increased by 1.2%, or $0.3 million, to $26.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $25.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The average daily operating cost per vessel for vessels on time charter was $5,583 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5,303 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Management believes that our daily operating cost ranks as one of the most competitive in the industry.\nDepreciation & Amortization\nDepreciation & Amortization includes Depreciation and Amortization of Deferred Dry-docking and Special Survey Costs.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation expense decreased by 13.8%, or $4.5 million, to $28.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $32.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016, mainly due to decreased depreciation expense for twenty-five vessels for which we recorded an impairment charge on December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Deferred Dry-docking and Special Survey Costs\nAmortization of deferred dry-docking and special survey costs increased by $0.1 million, to $1.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $1.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million to $5.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $6.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther Operating Expenses include Voyage Expenses.\nVoyage Expenses\nVoyage expenses decreased by $0.9 million to $3.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is mainly due to decreased bunkering expenses.\nImpairment Loss\nWe have recognized an impairment loss of $415.1 million in relation to 25 of our vessels as of December 31, 2016 compared to nil in the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nInterest expense increased by 4.7%, or $1.0 million, to $22.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $21.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to the increase in average cost of debt due to the increase in US$ Libor by about 50 bps between the two periods, which was partially offset by a decrease in our average debt by $212.3 million, to $2,340.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $2,553.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016 and a $0.4 million decrease in the amortization of deferred finance costs.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the debt outstanding gross of deferred finance costs was $2,340.8 million compared to $2,527.3 million as of December 31, 2016.\nInterest income decreased by $0.1 million, to $1.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $1.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nOther Finance Expenses, net\nOther finance expenses, net decreased by $0.6 million, to $1.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $1.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nEquity Income/(Loss) on Investments\nEquity income on investments amounted to $0.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the equity loss on investments of $14.6 million (mainly attributed to our share of impairment loss for Gemini vessels) in the three months ended December 31, 2016 and relates to the improved operating performance of Gemini, in which the Company has a 49% shareholding interest.\nUnrealized Loss on Derivatives\nUnrealized loss on interest rate swaps amounted to nil in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to an unrealized loss of $6.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The unrealized loss in the three months ended December 31, 2016 was mainly attributed to the accelerated amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $7.7 million.\nRealized Loss on Derivatives\nRealized loss on interest rate swaps decreased to $0.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from a loss of $1.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is attributable to swap expirations. As of December 31, 2016, all of our interest rate swaps have expired.\nOther Income/(Expenses), net\nOther expenses, net amounted to $4.3 million and related mainly to the professional fees of $5.0 million due to refinancing discussions with our lenders in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to other expenses, net of $29.2 million incurred mainly due to a $29.4 million impairment loss on Zim equity and debt securities recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 5.4%, or $4.1 million, to $80.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $75.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. As outlined earlier, this increase is attributable to a $2.1 million increase in operating revenues, by a $0.7 million decrease in operating expenses, a $0.3 million operating performance improvement on equity investments and a $1.0 million decrease in other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is adjusted for refinancing professional fees of $5.0 million.

Please refer to the Adjusted Net Income reconciliation table, which appears later in this earnings release.\nThe decrease of $26.0 million in adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to a $41.3 million decrease in operating revenues during the first half of the year as a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy partially offset by $11.2 million increase in operating revenues earned by the ex Hanjin vessels that earned operating revenues of $1.5 million during the second half of 2016, a decline in operating revenues of $15.5 million as a result of weaker charter market conditions that were prevailing when expiring charters were entered into, and a $1.0 million decrease in operating revenues attributed to fleet utilization, which were partially offset by a $15.8 million decrease in total operating expenses, a $2.0 million decrease in net finance expenses mainly due to interest rate swap expirations and increased interest income, a $2.6 million improvement in the operating performance of our equity investment in Gemini and a $0.2 million increase in other income.\nOn a non-adjusted basis, our net income amounted to $83.9 million, or $0.76 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net loss of $366.2 million, or $3.34 loss per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, which includes $466.9 million of impairment related expenses.\nOperating Revenues\nOperating revenues decreased by 9.4%, or $46.6 million, to $451.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from $498.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect:\n$41.3 million decrease in revenues during the first half of the year due to loss of revenue from cancelled charters with Hanjin for eight of our vessels due to Hanjin's bankruptcy. These vessels were re-chartered at lower rates and in some cases experienced off hire time in the 2017 period. $11.2 million increase in revenues during the second half of 2017 due to the recorded charter income of $12.7 million from eight of our vessels previously chartered to Hanjin that earned operating revenues of $1.5 million during the second half of 2016. $15.5 million decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the re-chartering of certain of our vessels at lower rates. $1.0 million decrease in revenues due to lower fleet utilization in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nVessel Operating Expenses\nVessel operating expenses decreased by 2.2%, or $2.4 million, to $107.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from $109.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.

We are currently in discussions with our lenders regarding our non-compliance with these covenants and restructuring our debt, which substantially exceeds the market value of our fleet and matures in December 2018.

However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or \"GAAP.\" We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financings, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, items which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nNote: Items to consider for comparability include gains and charges. Gains positively impacting net income are reflected as deductions to net income. Charges negatively impacting net income are reflected as increases to net income.\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
