    "text": "Completed $750M Credit Facility amendment and extension to run through January 2023\nClosed Muuto Acquisition on January 25th Expects Significant EPS Benefit From New Tax Rates\nEAST GREENVILLE, Pa., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Knoll, Inc. (NYSE:KNL), a leading designer and manufacturer of furnishings and coverings for the workplace and home, today announced results and year ended December 31, 2017. Net sales were $316.1 million , an increase of 7.9%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating profit for the quarter was $12.6 million, a decrease of 64.8% when compared to operating profit of $35.8 million of 2016. Adjusted operating profit was $31.6 million, a decrease of 11.7% when compared to adjusted operating profit of $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net earnings of 2017 were $32.7 million, an increase of 52.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net earnings of 2017 were $17.6 million, a decrease of 17.8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $41.0 million , a decrease of 8.7% when compared to $44.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $0.67 and $0.44 of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was heavily impacted by the changes in tax law, offset by asset impairment, pension settlement, and acquisition charges. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.36 and $0.44 of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet sales were $1,132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 2.7% from 2016. Operating profit for the year decreased 35.5% to $88.0 million, compared to operating profit of $136.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted operating profit was $109.2 million, a decrease of 19.9% when compared to adjusted operating profit of $136.3 million in 2016. Net earnings for 2017 were $80.2 million, a decrease of 2.3% when compared to 2016. Adjusted net earnings for 2017 were $68.0 million, a decrease of 17.2%, when compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $144.5 million for 2017, a decrease of 14.3% when compared to $168.7 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $1.63 and $1.68 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.38 and $1.68 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Muuto A.P.S. (\"Muuto\"), the Copenhagen-based designer and provider of affordable luxury furniture, lighting and accessories for the workplace and home, for approximately $300.0 million in cash, less certain customary adjustments. Concurrent with the Muuto acquisition, the Company amended its credit facility, which provides for a $750.0 million credit facility that matures in five years, consisting of a revolving commitment of $400.0 million, a US term loan commitment of $250.0 million and a multi-currency term loan commitment of €81.7 million. The proceeds of the credit facility were used to fund the Muuto acquisition, refinance certain indebtedness and for ongoing working capital requirements.\nAndrew Cogan, President and CEO, stated, “2017 was an important rebuilding year for Knoll as we made fundamental investments across our residential and commercial businesses. In particular, adjustments to our go to market strategy and product portfolio in our Office segment responded to rapidly changing market conditions. The return to growth that we delivered in the fourth quarter demonstrates the traction we believe we are gaining in our core markets and bodes well for the year ahead. With the Muuto acquisition now closed, and integration with our North American sales teams well underway, our momentum in the market should build.\"\n“While in the short term these investments dampened our profitability, we believe in the year ahead the combination of continued growth, a plateauing of the ramp up in investment spending, our lean initiatives, and a significantly lower tax rate, should lead to meaningful earnings per share growth,” he added.\nFourth Quarter Results\nFourth quarter 2017 financial results highlights are as follows:\nDollars in Millions, Except Per Share Data Three Months Ended December 31, Percent 2017 2016 Change Net Sales $ 316.1 $ 292.9 7.9 % Gross Profit 112.3 111.3 0.9 % Gross Profit % 35.5 % 38.0 % (6.6 )% Operating Expenses 99.7 75.6 32.0 % Asset Impairment Charge 16.3 — 100.0 % Pension Settlement Charge 2.2 — 100.0 % Acquisition Costs 0.5 — 100.0 % Adjusted Operating Expenses (1) 80.7 75.6 6.9 % Operating Profit 12.6 35.8 (64.8 )% Operating Profit % 4.0 % 12.2 % (67.2 )% Adjusted Operating Profit (1) 31.6 35.8 (11.7 )% Adjusted Operating Profit % (1) 10.0 % 12.2 % (18.0 )% Net Earnings 32.7 21.4 52.4 % Adjusted Net Earnings (1) 17.6 21.4 (17.8 )% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 41.0 44.9 (8.7 )% Adjusted EBITDA % (1) 13.0 % 15.3 % (15.0 )% Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.67 $ 0.44 52.3 % Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) $ 0.36 $ 0.44 (18.2 )% (1) For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nNet sales were $316.1 million of 2017, an increase of 7.9%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales for the Office segment were $198.9 million of 2017, an increase of 9.9%. The increase in the Office segment was due primarily to strong growth in the commercial business compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. New workplace platforms and complimentary products drove sales growth, partially offset by a modest decline in legacy system sales. Net sales for the Studio segment were $90.7 million of 2017, an increase of 8.7%. The increase in the Studio segment was led by growth in both the contract and residential markets at Knoll Europe, and gains at HOLLY HUNT. Net sales for the Coverings segment were $26.5 million of 2017, a decrease of 6.9%. The decrease in the Coverings segment was due primarily to fewer large project opportunities.\nGross profit of 2017 was $112.3 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 0.9%, when compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin decreased from 38.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016, to 35.5% of 2017. The decrease was due primarily to unfavorable net price realization and accelerated commodity inflation in the Office segment, partially offset by higher sales volume.\nOperating expenses were $99.7 million of 2017, or 31.6% of net sales, compared to $75.6 million, or 25.8% of net sales, of 2016. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 included an asset impairment charge of $16.3 million, a pension settlement charge of $2.2 million, and acquisition costs of $0.5 million. The asset impairment charge related to the write-off of capitalized software costs, previously included in construction in progress, and was a result of the global design review of the next phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation. The pension settlement charge was related to cash payments from lump sum elections made by employees affected by the restructuring activities in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were $80.7 million of 2017, or 25.5% of net sales compared to $75.6 million of 2016. The increase in adjusted operating expenses was related primarily to the expansion of our sales force and higher incentive compensation compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, other expense was $0.6 million compared to other income of $0.1 million of 2016. Other income and expense was related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign subsidiaries.\nNet earnings of 2017 was $32.7 million, or $0.67 diluted earnings per share, compared to $21.4 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings per share, of 2016. Net earnings of 2017 included a $26.6 million one-time benefit, primarily related to the re-measurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate of 21% in response to the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\"). This amount is an estimate based on the facts and circumstances at year end and may be subject to further refinement during the applicable measurement period. Net earnings of 2017 also included non-recurring asset impairment, pension settlement, and acquisition charges. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform and these non-recurring operating expenses, adjusted net earnings of 2017 was $17.6 million, or $0.36 adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to $21.4 million, or $0.44 adjusted diluted earnings per share, of 2016.\nThe effective tax rate of 2017 was (227.6)% compared to 38.1% of 2016. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, the effective tax rate of 2017 would have been 39.2%, compared to 38.1% of 2016. The mix of pretax income and the varying effective tax rates in the countries and states in which we operate directly affects our consolidated effective tax rate.\nCapital expenditures of 2017 totaled $11.1 million compared to $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company paid a quarterly dividend of $7.3 million, or $0.15 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nFull Year Results\nFull year 2017 financial results highlights are as follows:\nDollars in Millions, Except Per Share Data Year Ended December 31, Percent 2017 2016 Change Net Sales $ 1,132.9 $ 1,164.3 (2.7 )% Gross Profit 414.6 446.0 (7.0 )% Gross Profit % 36.6 % 38.3 % (4.4 )% Operating Expenses 326.6 309.7 5.5 % Asset Impairment Charge 16.3 — 100.0 % Pension Settlement Charge 2.2 — 100.0 % Restructuring Charges 2.2 — 100.0 % Acquisition Costs 0.5 — 100.0 % Adjusted Operating Expenses (1) 305.4 309.7 (1.4 )% Operating Profit 88.0 136.3 (35.5 )% Operating Profit % 7.8 % 11.7 % (33.3 )% Adjusted Operating Profit (1) 109.2 136.3 (19.9 )% Adjusted Operating Profit % (1) 9.6 % 11.7 % (17.9 )% Net Earnings 80.2 82.1 (2.3 )% Adjusted Net Earnings (1) 68.0 82.1 (17.2 )% Adjusted EBITDA (1) 144.5 168.7 (14.3 )% Adjusted EBITDA % (1) 12.8 % 14.5 % (11.7 )% Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.63 $ 1.68 (3.0 )% Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) $ 1.38 $ 1.68 (17.9 )% (1) For a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nNet sales were $1,132.9 million for the year ended 2017, a decrease of 2.7% from 2016. Net sales for the Office segment were $682.9 million in 2017, a decrease of 6.6% from 2016. The decrease in the Office segment was due to declines in both government and commercial sales, primarily in the first half of the year. Net sales for the Studio segment were $341.0 million in 2017, an increase of 5.4%. The increase in the Studio segment was due primarily to growth from HOLLY HUNT and Knoll Europe, as well as incremental sales from a full year of DatesWeiser acquired in December of 2016. Net sales for the Coverings segment were $109.0 million in 2017, a decrease of 0.5%. Continued year-over-year growth in Spinneybeck | FilzFelt sales, particularly in the architectural application space, was offset by lower volume at KnollTextiles and Edelman.\nGross profit for 2017 was $414.6 million, a decrease of $31.4 million, or 7.0%, when compared with 2016. During 2017, gross margin decreased to 36.6% from 38.3% in 2016. This decrease was driven by the Office segment where fixed-cost leverage was impacted by lower volume combined with commodity inflation.\nOperating expenses were $326.6 million in 2017, or 28.8% of net sales, compared to $309.7 million, or 26.6% of net sales in 2016. Operating expenses for 2017 includes an asset impairment charge of $16.3 million, a pension settlement charge of $2.2 million, restructuring charges of $2.2 million, and acquisition costs of $0.5 million. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were $305.4 million, or 27.0% of sales, for 2017, compared to $309.7 million for 2016. The decrease in adjusted operating expenses was primarily related to reduced incentive compensation due to decreased profitability, partially offset by increased sales headcount.\nDuring 2017, other expense was $1.9 million compared to $3.4 million in 2016. Other expense was related primarily to foreign exchange losses that resulted from the revaluation of intercompany balances between our US and foreign entities in both 2017 and 2016.\nNet earnings for 2017 was $80.2 million, or $1.63 diluted earnings per share, compared to $82.1 million, or $1.68 diluted earnings per share for 2016. Net earnings for 2017 included a $26.6 million one-time benefit stemming from Tax Reform. This is amount is an estimate based on the facts and circumstances at year end and may be subject to further refinement during the applicable measurement period. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform and certain operating expenses mentioned in the full year operating expense discussion, adjusted net earnings for 2017 was $68.0 million, or $1.38 adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to $82.1 million, or $1.68 adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2016.\nThe effective tax rate for 2017 was (2.0)% compared to 35.6% for 2016. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 31.8%, compared to 35.6% for 2016. The Company expects its effective tax rate will be between 24% and 26% in fiscal year 2018. The mix of pretax income and the varying effective tax rates in the countries and states in which we operate directly affects our consolidated effective tax rate.\nCapital expenditures for 2017 totaled $40.6 million compared to $40.1 million in 2016. The Company paid dividends of $30.3 million, or $0.60 per share, and $29.2 million, or $0.60 per share, in 2017 and 2016, respectfully.\n“We are very pleased with the strong support we received from our lenders as we amended and extended our credit facility in conjunction with the Muuto acquisition. In addition, Tax Reform legislation will have a positive impact on Knoll's cash flow as we anticipate a significant reduction in our effective tax rate. The additional cash flow will allow us to further invest in our business and strategic initiatives as well as reduce our outstanding debt,” noted Charles Rayfield, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBusiness Segment Results\nThe Company manages its business through its reporting segments: Office, Studio, and Coverings.

A “non-GAAP financial measure” is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the statements of income, balance sheets, or statements of cash flows of the company. We present non-GAAP measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe them to be useful to display ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not indicative of our operating performance. Pursuant to applicable reporting requirements, the company has provided reconciliations below of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented within this press release are Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Net Earnings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share. These non-GAAP measures are not indicators of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, in evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. We compensate for these limitations by providing equal prominence of our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only as supplemental presentations.\nThe following table reconciles Operating Expenses to Adjusted Operating Expenses for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 ($ in millions) Knoll Inc.
