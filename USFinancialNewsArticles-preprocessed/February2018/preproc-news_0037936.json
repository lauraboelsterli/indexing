Yameen imposed the state of emergency on Feb. 6 for 15 days, having defied a Supreme Court ruling after it quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders, and ordered his government to release those held in prison. The state of emergency was to end on Tuesday. Reporting by Mohamed Junayd; writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",
