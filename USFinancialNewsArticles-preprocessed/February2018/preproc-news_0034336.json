We are pleased to recognize their accomplishments and significant contributions to the company.\n“Mike has been an invaluable contributor since joining CBL in 2013. His significant financial and prior real estate experience have served as a strong foundation as he has worked effectively across departments to improve CBL’s systems and implement new technologies. Mike is an innovative thinker who will play a valuable role in advancing CBL’s operations going forward.”\nSince taking over the management division, Alan has proven himself to be a hands-on leader with a team-centric approach, and he has built strong relationships with the mall teams. In this role, Alan will continue to oversee approximately 300 field team members who staff CBL’s property portfolio.\nCBL also announced two promotions within the management division. Don Sewell has been promoted to senior vice president – management and Dan Wolfe to vice president – management.\nLebovitz added, “Alan’s team has decades of proven leadership within CBL and a strong desire to move the company forward. Don joined CBL in 1973, has been instrumental in supervising operations of our malls, and has worked tirelessly to achieve higher productivity for each property. Dan has exhibited great leadership with his mall teams, and he has used his extensive management background to maximize the performance of the mall management teams with which he works.”\nIn late 2013, Mike joined CBL to provide leadership and oversight of new strategic initiatives and technology solutions with the goal of improving CBL’s operations. CBL launched this program, dubbed CBL 2.0, in January 2014, and the first phase became fully operational in October 2015. Prior to joining CBL, Mike served for two years as senior vice president real estate and chief financial officer for a private real estate developer, owner and operator. Mike’s prior experience also includes 18 years of senior level consulting practice focused on strategic management in the real estate industry.\nAlan joined CBL in 1995 serving various roles in management, leasing and development. In 2002, he was promoted to vice president – asset management and in 2009 to senior vice president – asset management. In June 2017, Alan assumed the role as head of CBL’s management division in addition to overseeing CBL’s third party and asset management division. Alan has an in-depth knowledge of the CBL portfolio and has fostered strong relationships with each mall team.\nDon joined CBL in 1973 as general manager of Heartland Mall in Brownwood, Texas, and was later transferred to Post Oak Mall in College Station, Texas. In 1986, Don moved to Chattanooga and became director of operations – malls. In 2000, Don was promoted to vice president – mall management and has been instrumental in supervising the operations of CBL’s malls to achieve higher productivity.\nDan joined CBL in 1999, and prior to joining CBL’s home office management staff in 2016, he served as general manager of several CBL properties in the southeast. In his new role, Dan will be charged with assisting in the oversight of the management division as well as the marketing department.\nAbout CBL Properties\nHeadquartered in Chattanooga, TN, CBL Properties owns and manages a national portfolio of market-dominant properties located in dynamic and growing communities.
