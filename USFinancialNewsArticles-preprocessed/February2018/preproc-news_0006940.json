    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 9:37 PM / in 5 minutes Soccer club Nacional apologize for fans who mocked Chapecoense crash Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian football club Chapecoense, whose squad was almost entirely wiped out in a 2016 plane crash, called on authorities to expel Nacional from the Libertadores Cup on Friday after their fans were caught making mocking airplane gestures. \nAn investigation was opened into Wednesday’s incidents by South American football’s governing body CONMEBOL. \nCONMEBOL asked Nacional to present their defense by Feb 8, a day after the teams meet in the second leg of their qualifying match. Nacional won the first leg 1-0 in Brazil. \nChapecoense requested that “the judgment take place before Feb 7 or that the game be delayed until after the judgment”. \n“Chapecoense is asking for Nacional to be excluded from the ... Libertadores,” the club said in a statement. \nThe Uruguayan club apologized on behalf of their fans in an open letter published on Thursday and a day later identified one of those responsible and stripped him of his club membership.

The winner will qualify for the third and final qualifying round ahead of the group stages. Reporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Toby Davis and Pritha Sarkar",
