    "text": "14 COMMENTS British Prime Minister Theresa May rejected a new European Union proposal that would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., accusing Brussels of trying to undermine “the constitutional integrity” of Britain after the country leaves the bloc.\nAn EU document laying out proposed divorce terms with the U.K. created a firestorm Wednesday by proposing a common economic area on the island of Ireland after Brexit . It would leave Northern Ireland subject to some EU taxes and to a broad swath of EU rules in areas such as agriculture, state aid and the environment, effectively dividing Northern Ireland’s economic rules from the rest of the U.K.\nMrs. May sharply rejected the proposal, telling the House of Commons it would “threaten the constitutional integrity of the U.K. by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea. No U.K. prime minister could ever agree to it.”\nThe proposal, a first legal draft described by the EU as fall-back option​in the absence of workable alternatives from the U.K., is designed to avoid the creation of such a border on the island of Ireland .​\nIt appeared calculated to force Mrs. May to spell out how the U.K would keep to its agreement to let goods​flow freely between the north and south. The U.K. leader, who has so far been vague on how to resolve the issue, is scheduled to give a major speech on Brexit on Friday\nWith just over a year to go before Britain leaves the bloc, Ireland, the only EU member with which the U.K. shares a border, has emerged as a central problem in the Brexit talks, almost derailing negotiations on the U.K.’s separation from the bloc last December before the two sides decided to leave the question open .\nIt has been so far impossible to reconcile the absence of a hard border with Mrs. May’s pledge that the U.K. will leave the EU’s customs union and its single market of goods and services. Politicians from both sides fear a new border could threaten the fragile peace on the island.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused the EU of using the Irish issue to try to keep the U.K. in the single market “so we can’t leave the EU.”\nThe pound fell 0.6% to $1.3820 Wednesday, weakened by concerns that differences could delay the onset of talks on a post-Brexit transition deal, due to begin after an EU summit next month. The U.K. is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019.\nUnder the EU’s proposal, economic rules in Northern Ireland would remain broadly aligned with Ireland. This option would put Northern Ireland inside the EU’s customs union, while the rest of the U.K. leaves it, in effect creating a customs border in the Irish Sea. It would also mean EU courts would have a key role in overseeing the application of EU rules in the province.\nThe Irish issue is particularly sensitive for the prime minister because her minority government needs support from the Democratic Unionist Party, a Northern Irish group that strongly resists any separation of Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K.\nThe proposal is “an utterly preposterous suggestion,” said Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP. “We didn’t leave the EU to oversee the breakup of the United Kingdom.”\nThe Irish government also faces a difficult balancing act. It believes the introduction of a border threatens a return to three decades of violent conflict over Northern Ireland that was effectively ended by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. But it doesn’t want to endanger a relationship with Britain that has since then been the most cordial in a long and troubled history.\nDublin said Wednesday it would prefer something other than the option proposed by the EU. However, Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, said Mrs. May has been pursuing “incompatible” objectives.\n“If the British government wants to solve this issue, we have to see an approach that allows for trade between the EU and the U.K. that doesn’t require borders,” he told Irish state-owned broadcaster RTE.\nMichel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, said the EU was not trying to provoke a political crisis or interfere in British constitutional arrangements.\n“This draft text contains no surprise for our British counterparts... It includes the position of the union which was already known,” he said, adding that Brussels awaited U.K. proposals on alternative solutions that could avoid implementation of the proposal.\n—Jason Douglas in London\ncontributed to this article.\nWrite to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com",
