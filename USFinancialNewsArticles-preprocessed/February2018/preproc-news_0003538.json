    "text": "PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The French state will provide five million euros ($6.24 million) to support the Ascoval steel plant in Saint-Saulve, northern France for a year, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday, a move that will retain several hundred jobs.\nThe Hauts de France region, Swiss company Schmolz + Bickenbach and French steel pipe maker Vallourec at the same time agreed to create a 14-million-euro fund to help staff if there are future job cuts.\n“The state has agreed to put up 5 million euros,” Le Maire said after meeting with representatives from Ascoval’s unions, local officials and Schmolz + Bickenbach.\nSchmolz + Bickenbach was chosen by a Strasbourg court this week to buy troubled French steelmaker Ascometal. Ascometal, which makes specialty steel and employs around 1,300 workers, filed for court protection last November.\nBut the rescue by Schmolz + Bickenback left out Ascoval, a joint-venture between Ascometal and Vallourec, which employs 300 people. An agreement was reached to guarantee activity at the plant for another year while a buyer is sought. (Reporting by Myriam Rivet, Writing by Dominique Vidalon; editing by Luke Baker)\n ",
