    "text": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish oil refiner and biofuel producer Neste expects the reinstatement of the renewable fuel tax credit in the United States to increase its first quarter profit, the company said on Friday.\nThe retroactive approval of the 2017 biodiesel credit was part of the budget deal approved by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, averting a government shutdown.\nNeste did not disclose a number for the profit boost, but said it would be “somewhat lower than in the full year 2016”.\nThe company did not disclose the 2016 number either, but analysts estimated it to be around 100 million euros ($122 million). The credit added 169 million euros to Neste’s operating profit in 2015.\nBiofuel blenders in the United States are eligible for a tax credit of $1 per gallon, and the benefit is shared between the buyer and seller.\nNeste exports renewable diesel to the U.S. market from its plants in Singapore and Rotterdam.\nEarlier this week, Neste posted better-than-expected 2017 earnings.\n($1 = 0.8168 euros)\nReporting by Tuomas Forsell; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
