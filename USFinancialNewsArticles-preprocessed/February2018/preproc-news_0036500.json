    "text": "NEW YORK, Jerrick Media Holdings, Inc., (OTCQB: JMDA) (the \"Company\" or \"Jerrick\"), a technology company and the creators of Vocal , today announced that it completed an offering of two-year, 15% Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the \"New Notes\") generating gross proceeds of $750,000 and exchanged existing short-term debt totaling $290,925 (principal plus accrued interest) into the Notes (the \"Offering\"). The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $0.20 per share and hold a second priority security interest against the Company's assets up to $1,000,000. Holders of the New Notes received warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock equal to the number of shares into which the Notes may be converted at an exercise price of $0.20. Network 1 Financial Securities conducted the Offering. More details related to the Offering can be found on sec.gov on the Company current report on Form 8-K filed on February 13, 2018.\nJerrick intends to use the net cash proceeds from the sale of the New Notes for working capital, to strengthen its balance sheet, and for the further development of its Vocal platform. \"Our metrics continue to experience record growth. The technology underlying our platform was built for significant scale. As we did with user accounts, page views and multiple key-performance indicators, we are creating a solid base on which to significantly increase revenues throughout the upcoming year,\" said CEO and founder Jeremy Frommer.\nVocal Dashboard statistics\nQ2 2017 Average\nQ3 2017 Average\nQ4 2017 Average\nJanuary 31, 2018\nCommunities\n14\n20\n28\n30\nPage Views per Month\n1.4mm\n2.1mm\n4.1mm\n6.1mm\nContent Creator Accounts\n7,588\n26,008\n89,208\n155,000\nAverage # of Submissions\n/Day\n44\n183\n350\n493\nAverage # of Published Articles /Day\n25\n91\n213\n289\nIn addition, Jerrick's Vocal platform added two new community sites to its portfolio. \"Our new community Trader ( https://trader.media ) is all about the financial markets and will provide professional traders, analysts and Wall Street enthusiasts alike an open environment to vocalize their thoughts and perspective.
