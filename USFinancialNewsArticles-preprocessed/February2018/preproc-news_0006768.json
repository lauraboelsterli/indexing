    "text": "The U.S. stock market's open on Tuesday was rather smooth after a volatile two days, New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley told CNBC.\nStocks erased earlier losses Tuesday as the indexes tried to recover from Monday's 1,175-point sell-off. The Dow Jones industrial average turned negative again after rising more than 350 points Tuesday morning.\nEven after Monday's plunge, Farley said, it's worth mentioning the stock market's gains since the 2016 presidential election and the improving economy.\n\"I think it's worth taking a step back, taking a deep breath and acknowledging the Dow is up\" since the election, Farley said on \" Squawk on the Street \" shortly after the open. \"Unemployment is down. ... GDP is up.\"\nSince the election, the Dow is up more than 32 percent as of Monday's close; the S&P 500 is 23 percent higher; the Nasdaq is up more than 34 percent.\nThe unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in January, while GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the Commerce Department.\nAt this point, a movement in volatility and a pullback in price is to be expected, Farley said.\n\"As a group, we need to take a step back and say, 'We're going to be OK,'\" he added.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
