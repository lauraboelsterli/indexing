We exit a very successful 2017 as a public company with earnings more than triple the prior year.\nWe remain positive about titanium dioxide industry fundamentals and have started 2018 with tremendous momentum. Margins are set to increase as higher selling prices should outpace our cost advantaged ores. Additionally, 2018 will see $30 million further of combined benefit from our business improvement program in our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives segments.\nWe continue to see an elongated TiO 2 cycle and despite significant rebuild cost escalation, we remain on schedule to restore our specialty business capacity, and ultimately full operation of the remaining capacity as economic conditions warrant at our Pori, Finland site.\"\nSegment Analysis for 4Q17 Compared to 4Q16\nTitanium Dioxide\nThe $30 million, or 8%, increase in revenues in our Titanium Dioxide segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices, partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes. The improvement in selling prices reflected continued improvement in business conditions for TiO 2 , allowing for an increase in prices globally, and improvement from favorable exchange rates, primarily against the Euro. Sales volumes decreased primarily as a result of the fire at our Pori, Finland manufacturing facility. Excluding the impact of the fire at our Pori plant, sales volumes increased by 1%.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA of our Titanium Dioxide segment increased by $86 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This improvement was primarily a result of higher average selling prices and a $9 million EBITDA benefit from our Business Improvement Program, partially offset by increases in raw material and other direct costs.\nPerformance Additives\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Additives segment of $7 million, or 5%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 was due to an increase in average selling prices. The improvement in selling prices was primarily in certain color pigment and functional additives product lines, where we successfully raised prices to offset increases in raw material costs.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA in our Performance Additives segment increased by $2 million, or 15%, due to higher selling prices.\nCorporate and Other\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for Corporate and other represented a $16 million loss for the fourth quarter 2017. Although we expect our annual run-rate to be around $50 million a year, the fourth quarter included certain operational expenses that are not expected to recur.\nUpdate on Pori\nConstruction for the specialty and differentiated products portion of the facility is on pace and we expect it to be complete by the end of 2018, however we are paying a fast-track premium. Prior to the fire, this part of the facility represented 60% of site capacity and contributed, on average, 75% of the site EBITDA. Current TiO 2 business conditions are favorable and provide compelling economics for the rebuild of the remaining 40% commodity portion of site capacity. However, this part of the rebuild program will not be accelerated and capacity will be reintroduced to the market no sooner than 2020.\nBased on current estimates, we expect the total cost to rebuild the Pori facility (including the commodity portion) will exceed the limits of our insurance policy by as much as $325 million, or up to $375 million when providing additional contingency for the upper limits of our current design and construction cost estimates. This amount includes increased costs associated with the faster than normal build schedule of the specialty and differentiated products portion of the facility, and greater equipment replacement costs than we previously estimated. We expect to account for our uncovered costs as capital expenditures. Based on current and anticipated market conditions, we currently expect our business interruption losses to be fully reimbursed within our insurance policy limits.\nTax Items\nWe recorded income tax expense of $24 million and income tax benefit of $9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIn 2017, our adjusted effective tax rate was 18%. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We expect our adjusted long-term effective tax rate will be approximately 15% to 20%. We believe the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"2017 Tax Act\") on our adjusted long-term effective tax rate will not be material, given the low percentage of our global pre-tax income earned in the United States. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act we have recorded a provisional decrease of $3 million to our net deferred tax assets with a corresponding net tax expense of $3 million. Also due to the 2017 Tax Act, other income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $34 million as a result of the decrease in the future expected payments to Huntsman pursuant to the tax matters agreement entered into as part of our separation. We expect our cash tax rate will be between 10% to 15% in 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $238 million compared with $186 million as of September 30, 2017. In addition, we have in place an undrawn asset based revolving credit facility available for our working capital needs and general corporate purposes, with a borrowing base of $243 million.\nIn December 2017, we entered into three cross-currency interest rate contracts to exchange an aggregate notional $200 million for an aggregate notional â‚¬169 million. The swaps reduce our overall weighted average cost of debt to 4.4% from 5.0%, with annual interest savings of approximately $5 million, or approximately $21 million by maturity in July 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2017, net debt was $519 million, compared with $565 million as of September 30, 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nWe will hold a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.\nCall-in numbers for the conference call:\nU.S. participants\n1-866-807-9684\nInternational participants\n1-412-317-5415\n(No passcode required)\nIn order to facilitate the registration process, you may use the following link to pre-register for the conference call.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) from continuing operations, depreciation and amortization, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation (gain) expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) (gain) loss on disposition of businesses/assets (e) net income of discontinued operations net of tax; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident (credits) costs; and (i) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs. We believe that net income (loss) is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nNevertheless, our management recognizes that there are limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of us as compared to net income. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone.\nIn addition to the limitations noted above, adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods because certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events, and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of future results. For example, while EBITDA from discontinued operations is a recurring item, it is not indicative of ongoing operating results and trends or future results.\nAdjusted net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Venator Materials PLC ordinary shareholders: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses; (b) separation (gain) expense, net; (c) U.S. income tax reform; (d) (gain) loss on disposition of businesses/assets; (e) net income of discontinued operations; (f) certain legal settlements and related expenses; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) net plant incident (credits) costs; (i) restructuring, impairment, plant closing and transition costs. Basic adjusted net earnings (losses) per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted diluted net earnings (losses) per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. For the periods prior to our IPO, the average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted adjusted net income per share was based on the ordinary shares that were outstanding at the time of our IPO. Adjusted net earnings (losses) and adjusted net earnings (losses) per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information.\n(2)\nThe income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach. We do not adjust for changes in tax valuation allowances because we do not believe it provides more meaningful information than is provided under U.S. GAAP.\n(3)\nManagement internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate the Company's liquidity, (b) to evaluate strategic investments, (c) to evaluate the Company's ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations and used in investing activities. Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the Company's consolidated and combined statement of cash flows; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. Free cash flow is presented as supplemental information.\nAbout Venator\nVenator is a global manufacturer and marketer of chemical products that comprise a broad range of pigments and additives that bring color and vibrancy to buildings, protect and extend product life, and reduce energy consumption.
