    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ark Restaurants Corp. (NASDAQ:ARKR) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nTotal revenues for the three-month period ended December 30, 2017 were $39,352,000 versus $38,420,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The comparison of sales is skewed by New Year’s Eve which did not fall in the just completed quarter but was included in revenue in the December 2016 quarter. The December 2016 quarter included revenues of $1,496,000 from three restaurants that did not operate during the December 2017 quarter. Also, during the quarter ended December 30, 2017 the revenues from our two Oyster House Restaurants were $2,388,000. The Oyster House properties, one in Gulf Shores and one in Spanish Fort, AL, were acquired on November 30, 2016. The December 2016 quarter included sales of $707,000 from these two properties.\nCompany-wide same store sales increased 2.2% for the three-month period ended December 30, 2017 compared to the same three month period last year.\nRestaurant operating income was $882,000 for the three-month period ended December 30, 2017 versus $1,333,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The comparison of restaurant operating income is skewed by New Year’s Eve which did not fall in the just completed quarter but was included in revenue in the December 2016 quarter.\nThe Company’s EBITDA, adjusted for non-cash stock option expense, and non-controlling interests, for the three-month period ended December 30, 2017 was $2,071,000 versus $4,102,000 during the same three-month period last year. EBITDA for the December 2016 quarter included $1,637,000 which resulted from the recognition of a gain in the prior year period in connection with the sale of the real estate underlying our Rustic Inn, Jupiter, FL property. Without this gain the comparative EBITDA for the December 2016 quarter would have been $2,465,000.\nNet income for the three-month period ended December 30, 2017 was $1,627,000, or $0.47 per basic ($0.46 per diluted share) compared to $1,734,000, or $0.51 per basic share ($0.49 per diluted share), for the same three-month period last year.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As a result, income tax expense reported for the first quarter ended December 30, 2017 was adjusted to reflect the effects of the change in the tax law and resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 million. While we were able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in the corporate tax rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act.\nArk Restaurants owns and operates 20 restaurants and bars, 19 fast food concepts and catering operations primarily in New York City, Florida, Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, NV and the gulf coast of Alabama.

Although EBITDA is not a measure of performance or Company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure enhances an overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance as well as providing useful information to the investor because of its historical use by the Company as both a performance measure and measure of liquidity, and the use of EBITDA by virtually all companies in the restaurant sector as a measure of both performance and liquidity. However, investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company's operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, pre-tax income, is included above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212006213/en/\nArk Restaurants Corp.\nRobert Stewart, (212) 206-8800\nbstewart@arkrestaurants.com\nSource: Ark Restaurants Corp.",
