    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he wants to bring the steel industry back to America even if it means applying tariffs to imports from other countries, but the White House said he has not made a final decision on the issue.\n“I want to bring the steel industry back into our country. If that takes tariffs, let it take tariffs, OK? Maybe it will cost a little bit more, but we’ll have jobs,” Trump told a meeting at the White House with state governors.\nShares of U.S. Steel Corp ( X.N ) and AK Steel Holding ( AKS.N ) rose after he made the comments.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has recommended Trump impose curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries, giving Trump a range of options. Trump has until April to make a decision.\nThe White House said on Monday that Trump has not yet made a final decision on the matter.\nReporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis\n ",
