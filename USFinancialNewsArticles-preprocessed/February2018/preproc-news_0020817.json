    "text": "VONORE, Tenn., MCBC Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MCFT), the parent entity of MasterCraft Boat Company, LLC (“MasterCraft”), and Nautic Star, LLC (“NauticStar”), today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights:\nNet sales for the second quarter increased to $78.4 million, up 53.4 percent from $51.1 million in the prior-year period from improvements in the MasterCraft core business and the inclusion of NauticStar. Net sales year-to-date rose to $143.5 million, up from $111.8 million. Second-quarter gross margin decreased 250 basis points to 25.4 percent, from 27.9 percent in the prior-year period as MasterCraft’s standalone margin increase was offset by the inclusion of NauticStar. Year-to-date gross margin decreased 210 basis points. Net income totaled $8.0 million for the 2018 second quarter, an increase of $4.0 million from the prior-year period. Year-to-date net income increased $4.1 million to $15.1 million. Diluted earnings per share increased for the fiscal second quarter by $0.21, to $0.43, up from $0.22 in the prior-year period. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share increased to $0.81, versus $0.59 in fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased to $13.6 million from $9.0 million in the prior-year second quarter. Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA rose to $26.6 million from $22.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 20 basis points to 17.4 percent, from 17.6 percent in the prior-year second quarter period. Adjusted EBITDA margin year-to-date decreased 150 basis points to 18.5 percent, from 20.0 percent. Second-quarter fully diluted pro forma Adjusted net income per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased by $0.16, to $0.42, up from $0.26 in the prior-year period, and year-to-date was up $0.19, to $0.86, versus $0.67. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is expected to add $0.20 per share to full-year fiscal 2018 Adjusted EPS guidance. The company made additional debt payments of $17.0 million during the second quarter enabled by its strong cash generation capability, which is accretive $0.02 per share to full-year fiscal 2018 Adjusted EPS guidance.\nTerry McNew, MCBC Holdings, Inc. President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Top-line sales grew significantly in the second quarter, driven by double-digit gains on the MasterCraft side and the addition of NauticStar. As we further integrate NauticStar, we expect to realize additional efficiencies which will favorably impact margins.”\nSecond-Quarter Results\nNet sales for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, rose 53.4 percent, or $27.3 million to $78.4 million, compared to $51.1 million for the year-ago second quarter. The gain was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar which increased net sales by 39.5 percent, or $20.2 million. The remaining increase of 13.9 percent, or $7.1 million, was attributable to an increase in MasterCraft unit sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases.\nFor the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $5.6 million, or 39.5 percent, to $19.9 million compared to $14.3 million for the prior-year second quarter. The inclusion of NauticStar contributed $3.5 million to gross profit. Growth in MasterCraft unit sales volume, a favorable product mix and price increases, offset by higher material and shipping costs, accounted for the remaining increase. Gross margin decreased to 25.4 percent for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to 27.9 percent for fiscal 2017 second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar’s gross margin which is in the high-teens.\nSaid McNew, “We continue to see solid retail activity and are comfortable with our current inventory levels, because our dealer inventory turns are continuing to improve year-over-year. We remain optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2018 and we’re diligently working with our strong dealer network to maximize their opportunities moving forward.”\nSelling and marketing expense increased $1.3 million, or 50.2 percent, to $3.7 million for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.4 million for the year-earlier period. This increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of NauticStar, which added $0.6 million in selling and marketing expenses, a rise in dealer meeting costs and an increase in promotional activities related to the introduction of the redesigned 2018 MasterCraft XStar.\nGeneral and administrative expense rose by $0.2 million, or 3.7 percent, to $5.0 million for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.8 million for the prior-year period. This increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of NauticStar, which added $0.8 million in general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $0.5 million for legal and advisory fees related to the NauticStar acquisition. Increases in general and administrative expenses due to NauticStar were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease for legal and advisory fees related to Malibu Boats litigation, which was subsequently settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNet income totaled $8.0 million for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, versus $4.0 million for the year-earlier period, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar and reduced tax rates from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income of $7.8 million, or $0.42 per share, on a fully diluted, pro forma weighted average share count of 18.8 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated annual effective tax rate of about 29 percent, which due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is expected to be lowered to about 24 percent for fiscal 2019. This compares with Adjusted net income of $4.9 million, or $0.26 per share, in the prior-year period.\nEBITDA was $12.3 million for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.9 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.4 percent, from 17.6 percent in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 million, versus $9.0 million in the prior-year period. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFiscal Year-to-Date Results\nNet sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, increased 28.3 percent, or $31.7 million, to $143.5 million compared to $111.8 million for the year-earlier period. The gain was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar which increased net sales by 18.1 percent, or $20.2 million. The remaining gain of 10.2 percent, or $11.5 million, was attributable to MasterCraft primarily due to an increase in sales volume, favorable product mix and price increases.\nFor the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $6.0 million, or 18.7 percent, to $38.1 million, compared to $32.1 million for the prior-year period. The inclusion of NauticStar contributed $3.5 million to gross profit. The remaining increase stemmed from gains in MasterCraft unit sales volume and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher material and shipping costs. Gross margin decreased to 26.6 percent for the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, compared to 28.7 percent for the fiscal 2017 year-to-date period. The decrease was primarily due to the inclusion of NauticStar’s gross margin which is in the high-teens.\nSelling and marketing expense increased $1.9 million, or 42.5 percent, to $6.4 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.5 million for the prior-year period. This increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of NauticStar, which added $0.6 million in selling and marketing expenses, a rise in dealer meeting costs and an increase in promotional activities related to the introduction of the redesigned 2018 MasterCraft XStar.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $0.4 million, or 4.7 percent, to $9.3 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.9 million for the fiscal 2017 six months. This increase resulted mainly from the inclusion of NauticStar, which increased general and administrative expenses by $0.8 million, and included a $1.4 million increase in for legal and advisory fees. These were partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million for legal and advisory fees related to Malibu Boats litigation, which was settled during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, net income totaled $15.1 million, versus $11.0 in the fiscal 2017 year-to-date period, driven by the inclusion of NauticStar and reduced tax rates from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income of $16.1 million, or $0.86 per share, for the six-month period, on a fully diluted, pro forma weighted average share count of 18.8 million shares, was computed using the company’s estimated normalized annual effective tax rate of about 29 percent, which due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is expected to be lowered to about 24 percent for fiscal 2019. This compares with Adjusted net income of $12.5 million, or $0.67 per share, in the prior-year period.\nFor the fiscal year-to-date period ended December 31, 2017, EBITDA was $24.1 million, compared to $20.3 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.5 percent, from 20.0 percent in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $26.6 million, from $22.3 million in the prior-year period. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nMarket Milestones\nNauticStar\nIn October 2017, MCBC Holdings acquired NauticStar, a leading manufacturer and distributor of 18- to 28-foot, high-quality bay boats, deck boats and offshore center console boats. With more than 15 years of boat manufacturing experience—including a 200,000 square-foot manufacturing facility—NauticStar has a reputation for reliability, quality and consistency, with a loyal network of dealers and customers including professional and sport fishermen, and recreational and pleasure boating enthusiasts.\nSince acquiring NauticStar, MCBC Holdings has made significant progress leveraging its industry-leading strengths in operational excellence and financial management to further improve NauticStar’s output, quality and margin.\nSaid McNew, “NauticStar has given us a key presence in two of the boating industry’s fastest growing segments. Since bringing their team on board, we have laid out a new production process, increased daily production volume with plans to increase daily count further in our fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we’ve added new NauticStar dealers in North America with a goal of adding 20+ dealer locations over the next 12-18 months. We look forward to continuing their rapid growth.”\nMasterCraft\nRecently, MasterCraft introduced the new XT25, its largest multi-purpose crossover boat. Completing the XT series lineup as its fifth and largest addition, the XT25 welcomes a crew of up to 18 with a traditional bow and new interior layout offering more rear-facing seating than ever before, enhancing socialization and wake action spectating. The XT25’s two new rear-facing seat designs include a standard flip-up rear facing seat that can convert into a bench seat and an optional starboard pull-up, rear-facing seat with a raising backrest that also converts into a bench seat.\nSaid McNew, “We’re very excited to bring the 25-foot XT25 to market, capping the high end of our do-everything XT crossover boat line. This boat offers leading all-around towboat performance and passenger capacity. Our XT series boats continue to set the industry standard in premium features and performance for all towboat activities at a more approachable price. Early dealer and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.”\nOutlook\nConcluded McNew, “Given our strong second-quarter performance, we are very optimistic about prospects for the second half of fiscal 2018. And we remain committed to our five-pronged growth strategy: developing new and innovative products; further penetrating the entry-level and mid-line segment of the performance sport boat category; capturing share from adjacent boating categories; strengthening our dealer network; and driving margin expansion through continuous operational excellence.”\nFor full fiscal year 2018 guidance, MCBC Holdings now expects net sales growth to be in the high 30-percent range including nine months of NauticStar’s projected net sales. Both MasterCraft and NauticStar’s top lines are growing in the high-single to low double digit range compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins for MasterCraft, excluding NauticStar, are expected to grow to the mid-19 percent range from 19.0 percent in 2017. After taking the dilutive effect of the NauticStar acquisition, consolidated EBITDA margins are expected to be in the high 17-percent range. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow in the low- to mid-40 percent range. NauticStar is expected to provide accretion of $0.15 to $0.20 per share during the nine months post acquisition.\nFor the fiscal 2018 third quarter, MCBC Holdings expects net sales growth in the low 50-percent range and Adjusted EBITDA margin to be above 17 percent. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow in the low- to mid-60 percent range.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMCBC Holdings, Inc. will host a live conference call and webcast to discuss fiscal second-quarter results today, February 8, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including fees and expenses related to the company’s follow-on offering, transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of NauticStar, acquisition related inventory step up adjustment and our stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted net income as net income adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including fees and expenses related to the company’s follow-on offering, transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of NauticStar, our stock-based compensation and an adjustment for income tax expense at a normalized annual effective tax rate. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of sales. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP.” Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow for management’s discretionary use. We believe that the inclusion of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts, noteholders and other investors use these non-GAAP financial measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted net income to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP alone measures. We believe Adjusted net income assists our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes non-cash items and items not indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.\nFurthermore, certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release have been provided for comparison purposes only and these non-GAAP financial measures may change in the future based on our calculations and forecasts regarding the interpretation of certain recent changes to U.S. federal income tax law and anticipated impacts on our financial results.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 January 1, 2017 December 31, 2017 January 1, 2017 (Unaudited) (Dollars in thousands) Net income $ 8,009 $ 4,031 $ 15,055 $ 11,014 Income tax expense 1,634 2,496 5,161 6,537 Interest expense 1,139 512 1,630 1,123 Depreciation and amortization 1,478 825 2,210 1,622 EBITDA 12,260 7,864 24,056 20,296 Transaction expense (a) 605 5 1,486 59 Inventory step-up adjustment – acquisition related (b) 501 — 501 — Litigation charge (c) — 944 — 1,653 Stock-based compensation 264 186 528 305 Adjusted EBITDA $ 13,630 $ 8,999 $ 26,571 $ 22,313 Adjusted EBITDA margin (d) 17.4 % 17.6 % 18.5 % 20.0 %\n(a) Represents fees, expenses and integration costs associated with our acquisition of NauticStar and our follow-on offering in the prior-year period.
