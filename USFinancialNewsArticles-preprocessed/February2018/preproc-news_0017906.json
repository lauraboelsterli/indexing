    "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) today reported fourth quarter and full year results.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nU.S. GAAP net sales of $2,586 million, up 14.5% compared with fourth quarter 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the net impact of M&A, net sales were up 10.2% compared with fourth quarter 2016. U.S. GAAP net loss of $(0.70) per basic share. Excluding the $(1.76) per diluted share related to non-comparable items (detailed in the table below), net earnings were $1.07 per diluted share. U.S. GAAP operating income of $209 million. Excluding the $119 million of pretax expenses related to non-comparable items, operating income was $328 million. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, operating income was 12.7% of net sales.\nFull Year Highlights:\nU.S. GAAP net sales of $9,799 million, up 8.0% compared to 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the net impact of M&A, net sales were up 10.3% compared with 2016. U.S. GAAP net earnings of $2.08 per diluted share. Excluding the $(1.80) per diluted share related to non-comparable items (detailed in the table below), net earnings were $3.89 per diluted share. U.S. GAAP operating income of $1,077 million. Excluding the $142 million of pretax expenses related to non-comparable items, operating income was $1,219 million. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, operating income was 12.4% of net sales.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance: The company has reaffirmed its 2018 full year organic growth guidance. Full year net sales are expected to be $10.52 billion - $10.69 billion, implying organic sales growth of 5.0% to 7.0%. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $170 million, due to the appreciation of the Euro and Chinese Yuan. The acquisition of Sevcon will increase sales by approximately $45 million. Net earnings are expected to be within a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share, with the increase in guidance primarily due to a lower tax rate assumption and larger benefit from foreign currencies. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, operating margin is expected to be in the range of 12.6%-12.7%.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance: The company has reaffirmed its 2018 first quarter organic growth guidance. The company expects organic net sales growth of 3.0% to 5.5%, compared with first quarter 2017 net sales of $2.41 billion. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $100 million. The acquisition of Sevcon will increase sales by approximately $15 million. Net earnings are expected to be within a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per diluted share, with the increase in guidance primarily due to a lower tax rate assumption and larger benefit from foreign currencies.\nFinancial Results: Net sales were $2,586 million in fourth quarter 2017, up 14.5% from $2,259 million in fourth quarter 2016. Net loss in the quarter was $(146) million, or $(0.70) per basic share, compared with a net loss of $(293) million, or $(1.39) per basic share, in fourth quarter 2016. Net loss in fourth quarter 2017 included non-comparable items of $(1.76) per diluted share. Net loss in the fourth quarter 2016 included net non-comparable items of $(2.23) per diluted share. These items are listed in a table below, which is provided by the company for comparison with other results and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The impact of foreign currencies increased net sales by approximately $103 million and increased net earnings by approximately $0.03 per diluted share in fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016.\nFull year 2017 net sales were $9,799 million, up 8.0% from $9,071 million in 2016. Full year 2017 net earnings were $440 million, or $2.08 per diluted share, compared with $119 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in 2016. Full year 2017 net earnings included net non-comparable items of $(1.80) per diluted share. Full year 2016 included net non-comparable items of $(2.72) per diluted share. These items are listed in a table below as reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP measures, which are provided by the company for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The impact of foreign currencies increased net sales by approximately $55 million and decreased net earnings by approximately $0.01 per diluted share in 2017 compared with 2016.\nNon-core Emission Product Update: In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company launched an active program to locate a buyer for the non-core pipes and thermostat product lines and initiated all other actions required to complete the plan to sell the non-core product lines. The Company determined that the assets and liabilities of the pipes and thermostat product lines met the held for sale criteria as of December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment expense of $71.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust the net book value of this business to fair value less costs to sell. The Company also recorded restructuring expense of $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily related to professional fees and negotiated commercial costs associated with business divestiture and manufacturing footprint rationalization activities.\nThe company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non-comparable items that impacted its U.S. GAAP net earnings per diluted share:\nNet earnings per diluted share\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\n2017\n**\n2016\n2017\n2016\nU.S. GAAP\n$\n(0.70)\n$\n(1.39)\n$\n2.08\n$\n0.55\nNon-comparable items:\nAsset Impairment and loss on divestiture\n0.25\n0.12\n0.25\n0.48\nRestructuring expense\n0.16\n—\n0.23\n0.10\nMerger and acquisition expense\n0.02\n0.02\n0.05\n0.11\nAsbestos-related charge\n—\n2.07\n—\n2.05\nIntangible asset impairment\n—\n0.04\n—\n0.04\nContract expiration gain\n—\n—\n—\n(0.02)\nTax reform adjustments\n1.29\n—\n1.29\n—\nOther tax adjustments\n0.04\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n(0.04)\nNon – U.S. GAAP\n$\n1.07\n*\n$\n0.85\n*\n$\n3.89\n$\n3.27\n** GAAP EPS based on non-diluted share count of 209.7MM.

This expense reflects (i) the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, (ii) a one-time transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits, net of foreign tax credits, and (iii) the indefinite reinvestment assertion, including the measurement of deferred taxes on foreign unremitted earnings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,180 million in 2017 compared with $1,036 million in 2016. Investments in capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled $560 million in 2017, compared with $501 million in 2016. Balance sheet debt decreased by $31 million and cash increased by $102 million at the end of 2017 compared with the end of 2016. The company's net debt to net capital ratio was 30.0% at the end of 2017 compared with 35.0% at the end of 2016.\nEngine Segment Results: Engine segment net sales were $1,578 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared with $1,387 million in fourth quarter 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, net sales were up 8.4% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes and non-controlling interest (\"Adjusted EBIT\") were $266 million in fourth quarter 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Adjusted EBIT was $258 million, up 2.9% from fourth quarter 2016.\nDrivetrain Segment Results: Drivetrain segment net sales were $1,023 million in 2017 compared with $883 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, and the net impact of M&A, net sales were up 13.1% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusted EBIT was $124 million in fourth quarter 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies, and the net impact of M&A, Adjusted EBIT was $124 million, up 32.6% from fourth quarter 2016.\nRecent Highlights:\nBorgWarner announced the appointment of Frédéric Lissalde to executive vice president and chief operating officer, effective January 1, 2018.
