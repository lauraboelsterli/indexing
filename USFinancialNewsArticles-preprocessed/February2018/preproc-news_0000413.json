Among other large cap names, Fanuc Manufacturing lost 1.3 percent and Fast Retailing lost 1.96 percent by the end of the session.\nSymbol Name Price Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Airlines were also lower on the day, with ANA Holdings closing down 4.06 percent.\nShares of Nomura Holdings finished the session down 2.89 percent, underperforming other financials, after the company announced third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Net income for the quarter rose around 25 percent on year to 88 billion yen ($804.8 million).\nWeakness in the benchmark index came as the country's central bank attempted to stop the rise in Japanese bond yields by offering to purchase an unlimited amount of long-term Japanese government bonds, Reuters reported.\nAcross the Korean Strait, the Kospi fell 1.68 percent to end at 2,525.39 as declines in blue chip tech names drove the index lower. Samsung Electronics lost 4.26 percent, SK Hynix declined 2.96 percent and Samsung SDI fell 4.53 percent.\nDown Under, the S&P/ASX 200 tacked on 0.51 percent to close at 6,121.4. The energy and gold sectors were among the best-performing in the session, climbing 2.42 percent and 1.53 percent, respectively. The heavily-weighted financials sub-index edged up 0.63 percent on the day.\nChina markets take a pause China markets reversed slight declines to close above the flat line after sliding for most of the week.

Meanwhile, the Shenzhen composite finished the session 0.03 percent higher. The blue chip CSI 300 index rose 0.61 percent by the end of the day.\nDespite the gains on Friday, the Shanghai composite has fallen 2.83 percent between Monday's open and Friday's close. Recent declines appeared to be linked to concerns over unconfirmed market rumors about trust companies having to reduce leverage, according to Hao Hong, managing director and head of research at BOCOM International.\nU.S. stocks ended the last session mostly low er following a session of choppy trade, which also saw bond yields climb. On Thursday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond crossed the 3 percent level for the first time since May while the 10-year yield rose as high as 2.792 percent.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.14 percent, or 37.32 points, to close at 26,186.71. Other major indexes eased slightly.\nAhead, markets will be keeping an eye on the release of U.S. nonfarm payrolls numbers due during U.S. hours.\nCurrency watch The dollar extended overnight gains against the yen to trade at 109.81 at 2:57 p.m. HK/SIN.\nThe dollar index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, continued to trade below the 89 handle amid strength in the euro.
