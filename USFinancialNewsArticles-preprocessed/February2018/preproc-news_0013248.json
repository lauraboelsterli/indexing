    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - Engine maker Cummins Inc reported a 21.6 percent rise in quarterly sales on Tuesday, helped by a stronger U.S. economy which is driving demand for large trucks.\nNet loss attributable to Cummins was $274 million, or $1.65 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $378 million, or $2.25 per share, a year earlier.\nThe quarter included $777 million in one-time charges related to tax reform.\nNet sales rose to $5.48 billion from $4.50 billion.
