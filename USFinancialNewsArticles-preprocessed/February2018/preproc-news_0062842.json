    "text": "Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal Published 8 Hours Ago At Mobile World Congress, some smartphone makers were showing off devices that looked very similar to Apple's iPhone X. The phones had their own take on Apple's \"notch\" design and large display. One was priced at $40 while the most expensive was $366. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images \nApple has started a trend with the iPhone X with a number of lookalike phones coming to the market. \nAt Mobile World Congress (MWC), the world's biggest mobile show in Barcelona, Spain, a number of companies showed off their take on the iPhone X, but with substantially lower price tags than Apple's $999 top-end device. \nMany firms were exhibiting their new devices, which share the \"notch\" that is present at the top of the iPhone X. Here's a look at some of the iPhone X challengers. Noa N10 Arjun Kharpal | CNBC Croatian firm Hangar 18 launched its Noa 10 smartphone at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, Spain. \nHangar18 is the Croatian firm behind the Noa N10, a smartphone with a 6.2-inch display that is larger than the 5.8-inch screen on the iPhone X. \nIt has a \"notch\" at the top and the screen takes up a large amount of the front of the device. The smartphone also has a dual camera on the back, like the iPhone X, and a full high-definition screen. \nThe Noa N10 even has a feature to unlock the phone by scanning your face. The company is calling it \"Face ID,\" similar to Apple's FaceID feature on the iPhone X. \nThe N10 runs Google's Android operating system and will be priced at around 300 euros ($366) when it becomes available later this year. Blackview A30 Arjun Kharpal | CNBC The Blackview A30 smartphone is being manufactured by Shenzhen Doke Electronics Co. \nShenzhen Doke Electronics Co. is the firm behind this iPhone X lookalike. The device is not in production yet, but a representative at the firm's booth said it will be later this year. \nThe device on display even had a print-out of the iPhone home screen because the company did not have a prototype ready. \nIt runs Android Go, which is a less data-intensive version of Google's mobile operating system. \nA Shenzhen Doke Electronics representative said the device will cost $40. Doogee V5 Doogee launched its new flagship device at Mobile World Congress 2018 called the Doogee V. \nDoogee is another Chinese smartphone maker taking cues from Apple. \nThe V5 is its flagship offering and sports a \"notch\" at the top of the phone and a 6.2-inch display. \nDoogee has managed to put a fingerprint sensor underneath the screen of the V5, allowing it to have a larger display. It also has wireless charging. \nThe company has not yet announced a price for the device. Leagoo S9 Photographer | CNBC Chinese smartphone maker Leagoo showed off its S9 at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, Spain. x \nAnother phone sporting the \"notch\" design is the Leagoo S9. It's made by Chinese firm Leagoo and sports a 5.85-inch display. \nIt runs Android and costs $125. Wiko View 2 Pro Arjun Kharpal | CNBC The Wiko View 2 Pro on display at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, Spain. \nThe Wiko View 2 Pro is not quite a copy of the iPhone X. It does borrow the \"notch\" design but has its own version, with the notch smaller than Apple's flagship smartphone. \nIt has features including face unlock and dual camera. \nThe Wiko View 2 Pro costs 299 euros ($365). \nApple declined to comment when approached by CNBC to do so.",
