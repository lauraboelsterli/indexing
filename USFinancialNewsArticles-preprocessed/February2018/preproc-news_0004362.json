    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steve Pattyn, a managing director and U.S. equity analyst for Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC, has left the company, a spokesman said in an e-mail on Thursday.\nPattyn, who had a focus on the energy and utilities sector, is now a managing member at Yaupon Capital Management, according to his LinkedIn. He started in February.\nYaupon will be an energy and utilities focused alternative asset management firm set to launch later in 2018, according to a source. It was not immediately clear how much capital it had raised.\nPattyn had been at Och-Ziff for nearly 11 years and was formerly an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n(This version of the story corrects to remove extraneous word from headline.)\nReporting by Catherine Ngai; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
