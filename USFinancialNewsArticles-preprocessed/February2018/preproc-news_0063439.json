The United States wants flaws in what it calls sunset clauses in the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal to be reworked. “There is no sunset clause in the JCPOA,” Araqchi said. “Although the U.S. administration and Trump are talking about sunset clause and that JCPOA is just for 10 years, that is not true,” he said. “Iran’s commitment in the JCPOA not to go for the nuclear weapon is permanent.” Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, writing by Guy Faulconbridge, editing by Costas Pitas",
