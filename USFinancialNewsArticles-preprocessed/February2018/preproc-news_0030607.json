    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nConsolidated revenue of $980 million, up 42 percent versus Q4 '16 Consolidated GAAP earnings of $3.94 per diluted share Consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.10, up 67 percent versus Q4 '16 Agricultural Solutions segment earnings of $189 million, up 48 percent versus Q4 '16 Lithium segment earnings of $44 million, up 107 percent versus Q4 '16 2018 adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60 per diluted share 1\nFMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC ) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. For the year, FMC reported revenue of approximately $2.9 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2016. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $536 million, or $3.99 per diluted share. Full-year adjusted earnings were $2.71 per diluted share, an increase of 41 percent compared to the prior year.\nFor the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $980 million, an increase of 42 percent year- over-year. Excluding revenue related to FMC's recent acquisition, underlying growth was 14 percent. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $3.94 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, or $530 million, which compares to the GAAP earnings of $0.12 per diluted share, or $16 million, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The GAAP figure includes a $727 million gain, net of tax, from the November 2017 sale of FMC Health and Nutrition, partially offset by a provisional income tax charge of $316 million related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.10, 67 percent higher than the prior year quarter.\nPierre Brondeau, FMC president, CEO and chairman said: \"FMC delivered another very strong quarter. In Ag Solutions, our legacy business posted 9 percent revenue growth versus the same quarter last year, and our integration of the DuPont crop protection business is proceeding very well. Our lithium hydroxide expansion in China led to a doubling of Lithium segment earnings year-over-year, and we are moving forward with plans to double our lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina by 2022.\"\nFMC Agricultural Solutions\nFMC Agricultural Solutions reported fourth quarter revenue of $866 million, an increase of 40 percent year-over-year. FMC's legacy Agricultural Solutions grew 9 percent in the quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth in North America, Asia and Europe. The remainder of the revenue growth, or $193 million, was attributable to FMC's recent acquisition. Segment earnings of $189 million increased 48 percent year-over-year and were above the top end of our guidance range.\nSegment revenue for 2017 was approximately $2.5 billion, an 11 percent increase compared to the prior year. FMC's legacy Agricultural Solutions revenue increased 3 percent year-over-year. Full-year segment earnings were $486 million, a 21 percent increase compared to the prior year, and segment earnings margin improved 160 basis points to 19.2 percent.\nAgricultural Solutions full-year revenue for 2018 is forecasted to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.15 billion. The legacy FMC Agricultural Solutions business is expected to increase revenue by 2 to 4 percent, and the acquired business is expected to grow by 6 to 10 percent, which implies underlying growth of approximately 5 percent year-over-year for the combined business. Full-year segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. First quarter segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million. 2\nFMC Lithium\nFMC Lithium reported fourth quarter segment revenue of $113 million, an increase of 60 percent versus the prior-year quarter. Segment earnings more than doubled year-over-year to $44 million in the quarter. Higher volume from FMC's new hydroxide operations in China and higher year-over-year prices were the main contributors to growth.\nSegment revenue for 2017 was $347 million, a 32 percent increase compared to the prior year, while full-year segment earnings were $127 million, an 80 percent increase compared to the prior year. Segment earnings margin improved to 36.5 percent, compared to 26.6 percent in 2016.\nThe outlook for Lithium segment revenue for the full year of 2018 is in the range of $420 million to $460 million, an increase of 27 percent at the mid-point compared to 2017, while the outlook for full-year segment EBITDA is in the range of $180 million to $200 million. This forecast for full-year segment EBITDA represents an increase of nearly 35 percent at the mid-point compared to the prior year. First quarter segment EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million, which, at the mid-point, represents an increase of nearly 80 percent compared to the prior-year quarter. 2\n2018 Outlook\nFMC expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60 for the full year 2018 and $1.45 to $1.59 for the first quarter. 1 FMC continues to expect it will conduct a separate listing of FMC Lithium in the second half of 2018 to create two separate public companies.\nWebcast and Supplemental Information\nThe company will post supplemental information on the web at www.FMC.com, including its 2018 Outlook Statement, definitions of non-GAAP terms and reconciliations of non-GAAP figures to the nearest available GAAP term.\nAbout FMC\nFor more than a century, FMC Corporation has served the global agricultural, industrial and consumer markets with innovative solutions, applications and quality products. On November 1, 2017, FMC acquired a significant portion of DuPont's Crop Protection business. FMC employs approximately 7,000 people throughout the world and operates its businesses in two segments: FMC Agricultural Solutions and FMC Lithium. For more information, visit www.FMC.com.\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Act of 1995: Statements in this news release that are forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors described in FMC Corporation's 2016 Form 10-K and other SEC filings. Such information contained herein represents management's best judgment as of the date hereof based on information currently available. FMC Corporation does not intend to update this information and disclaims any legal obligation to the contrary. Historical information is not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nThis press release contains certain \"non-GAAP financial terms\" which are defined on our website www.fmc.com. In addition, we have also provided on our website at www.fmc.com reconciliations of non-GAAP terms to the most directly comparable GAAP term.\nAlthough we provide forecasts for adjusted earnings per share and adjusted cash from operations (both of which are non-GAAP financial measures), we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain elements of the composition of the GAAP amounts are not predictable, making it impractical for us to forecast. Such elements include, but are not limited to, restructuring, acquisition charges, and discontinued operations and related cash activity. As a result, no GAAP outlook is provided. Please see press release schedules for reasons as to why we will begin to present EBITDA which is a non-GAAP measure. The only difference between segment EBIT and segment EBITDA is depreciation and amortization expense. The forecast for depreciation and amortization for 2018 is $170 million to $180 million of which approximately $145 million is related to FMC Agricultural Solutions and approximately $20 million is related to FMC Lithium.\nFMC CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In Millions, Except Per

Attributable to FMC Stockholders\", and its presentation on a per share basis, provides useful information about the Company's operating results to investors and securities analysts. Adjusted earnings excludes the effects of Corporate special charges, tax-related adjustments and the results of our discontinued operations. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying businesses from period to period.\n(2)\nThe average number of shares outstanding used in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 diluted adjusted after-tax earnings from continuing operations per share computation (Non-GAAP) include 1.7 million and 1.4 million diluted shares, respectively. The number of shares differs from the average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share computations (GAAP) as we had a net loss from continuing operations attributable to FMC stockholders.\n(a)\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017:\nRestructuring and other charges (income) includes an impairment charge to write down certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business as a result of a triggering event associated with the United States' enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was passed in the fourth quarter. The impairment, solely due to tax reform, impacted the fair value and resulted in a charge of $42.1 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) include asset write-offs of approximately $1.7 million and $3.3 million within FMC Lithium and Corporate, respectively. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes $8.3 million of charges for continuing environmental sites treated as a Corporate charge. Amounts also include miscellaneous other charges of $3.7 million.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016:\nRestructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of $27.6 million representing final adjustments to severance, asset write-offs, and other costs associated with the integration of Cheminova within FMC Agricultural Solutions. In the fourth quarter, we also entered into an agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights related to compounds still under development for our FMC Agricultural Solutions businesses. The $13.2 million paid to acquire these rights was expensed as in-process research and development costs. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes $19.4 million of charges for continuing environmental sites treated as a Corporate charge. Amounts also include miscellaneous restructuring charges totaling $1.1 million and other charges of $1.0 million.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017:\nRestructuring and other charges (income) includes an impairment charge to write down certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business as a result of a triggering event for the United States' enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was passed in the fourth quarter. The impairment, solely due to tax reform, impacted the fair value and resulted in a charge of $42.1 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes $7.7 million of costs related to miscellaneous restructuring efforts and asset-write downs within FMC Lithium. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes asset write-offs of approximately $2.2 million and $5.5 million within FMC Agricultural Solutions and Corporate, respectively. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes $4.7 million of exit costs related to the termination of our interest in a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated and part of our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of continuing environmental sites treated as a Corporate charge of $16.6 million. Remaining restructuring and other charges (income) includes net miscellaneous charges of $2.6 million.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2016:\nRestructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of $42.3 million representing final adjustments to severance, asset write-offs, and other costs associated with the integration of Cheminova within FMC Agricultural Solutions. Integration-related costs associated with the integration of Cheminova were completed at the end of 2016. Amount also includes other miscellaneous restructuring costs of $1.1 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes $36.8 million of charges for continuing environmental sites treated as Corporate charges, $13.2 million associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development, and $4.2 million as a result of the Argentina government's action to devalue its currency. These charges were offset by other miscellaneous income of $2.6 million.\n(b)\nOur non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our Adjusted Earnings results noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.\n(c)\nCharges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of acquisition accounting, legal and professional fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the completed acquisitions. Amounts represent the following:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in Millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nAcquisition related charges\nLegal and professional fees (1)\n$\n51.5\n$\n6.6\n$\n130.2\n$\n23.4\nInventory fair value amortization (2)\n20.2\n—\n20.2\n—\nTotal Acquisition-related charges (3)\n$\n71.7\n$\n6.6\n$\n150.4\n$\n23.4\n(1)\nRepresents transaction costs, costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs and integration-related legal and professional third-party fees. These charges are included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).\n(2)\nThese charges are included in \"Costs of sales and services\" on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).\n(3)\nAcquisition-related charges for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 relate to the acquisition of a significant portion of DuPont's Crop Protection business, while charges for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 relate to the integration of Cheminova with FMC Agricultural Solutions, which were completed at the end of 2016.\n(d)\nThe income tax expense (benefit) on Corporate special charges (income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) based on the nature of the non-GAAP performance measure.\n(e)\nThree and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nDiscontinued operations, net of income taxes include, in periods up to its sale, the results of FMC Health and Nutrition as well as provisions, net of recoveries, for environmental liabilities and legal reserves and expenses related to previously discontinued operations. The three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include the divestiture gain of approximately $918 million ($727 million, net of tax), which includes $33 million ($28 million, net of tax) of divestiture related costs, associated with the sale of FMC Health and Nutrition which was completed on November 1, 2017. The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included a $168 million ($148 million, net of tax) impairment charge related to our Omega-3 business which was sold on August 1, 2017.\n(f)\nWe exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead include a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about FMC's operational performance.\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(in Millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTax adjustments:\nImpacts of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1)\n$\n315.9\n$\n—\n$\n315.9\n$\n—\nRevisions to our tax liabilities due to finalization of prior year tax returns\n2.7\n0.7\n1.9\n2.9\nRevisions to valuation allowances of historical deferred tax assets\n(1.9)\n18.5\n(1.9)\n18.9\nForeign currency remeasurement and other discrete items\n(42.2)\n1.0\n(44.2)\n10.6\nTotal tax adjustments\n$\n274.5\n$\n20.2\n$\n271.7\n$\n32.4\n(1)\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which, among other things, reduces the\nfederal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and imposes a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of\nforeign subsidiaries which will be payable over eight years. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company has recognized provisional income\ntax expense of $315.9 million, related to both the remeasurement of the Company's U.S. net deferred tax asset and the deemed\nrepatriation of foreign earnings.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, BEFORE INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES (NON-GAAP) (Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In Millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) (GAAP)\n$\n531.1\n$\n16.4\n$\n538.4\n$\n211.7\nRestructuring and other charges (income)\n59.1\n62.3\n81.4\n95.0\nNon-operating pension and postretirement charges\n30.5\n20.9\n18.2\n23.4\nAcquisition-related charges\n71.7\n6.6\n150.4\n23.4\nDiscontinued operations, net of income taxes\n(779.0)\n(7.0)\n(621.7)\n(81.0)\nInterest expense, net\n27.8\n16.5\n79.1\n62.9\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n263.0\n2.7\n264.1\n50.1\nAdjusted earnings from continuing operations, before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interests (Non-GAAP) (1)\n$\n204.2\n$\n118.4\n$\n509.9\n$\n385.5\n(1) Referred to as Adjusted Operating Profit.\nRECONCILIATION OF CASH PROVIDED (REQUIRED) BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (GAAP) TO ADJUSTED CASH FROM OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In Millions)\n2017\n2016\nCash provided (required) by operating activities (GAAP)\n$\n314.5\n$\n368.9\nTransaction and integration costs related to acquisitions\n78.9\n23.4\nAdjusted cash from operations (Non-GAAP) (1)\n$\n393.4\n$\n392.3\n(1)\nThe Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measure \"Adjusted cash from operations\" provides useful information\nabout the Company's cash flows to investors and securities analysts.
