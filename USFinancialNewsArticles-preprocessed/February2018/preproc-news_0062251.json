    "text": "SILVER SPRING, Md., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RLJ Entertainment, Inc. (\"RLJE\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: RLJE) today announced that its board of directors appointed a special committee of independent directors to consider the February 26, 2018 proposal from AMC Networks to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of RLJE not currently owned by AMC Networks or entities affiliated with Robert L. Johnson, Chairman of RLJE's Board of Directors, for a purchase price of $4.25 per share in cash.\nThe Board has granted the special committee independent authority to evaluate and respond to the proposed transaction. The special committee is composed of RLJE directors Andor (Andy) Laszlo and Scott R. Royster and currently is in the process of engaging an independent legal advisor and an independent financial advisor to assist in its review of the proposed transaction.\nThe special committee has not set a definitive timetable for the completion of its evaluation of the proposal and does not currently intend to announce developments unless and in the event a definitive agreement has been reached.\nThe Company notes that, in order to complete the proposed transaction, AMC Networks will also need to negotiate acceptable terms for the acquisition of its four outstanding series of preferred stock and its outstanding warrants with the holders of those securities.\nThere can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be executed or that the transaction contemplated by the proposal will be approved or consummated.\nAbout RLJ Entertainment, Inc.\nRLJ Entertainment, Inc.
