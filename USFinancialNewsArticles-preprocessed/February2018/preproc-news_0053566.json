Sinclair, 69, has led AB Foods, which also has major sugar, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, for eight years, during which the group has grown strongly. McLintock, 56, is a former chief executive of fund manager M&G. He joined the group as a non-exec director in November. AB Foods, majority owned by the family of Chief Executive George Weston, is due to update on trading on Monday. (Reporting by James Davey, Editing by Paul Sandle)",
