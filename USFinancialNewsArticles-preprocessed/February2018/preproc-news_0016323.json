    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union leaders’ chairman, Donald Tusk, welcomed on Thursday the formation of a new ruling coalition under German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying it was “good news”.\n“Now it is high time to build an inclusive pan-European Grand Coalition for an ambitious budget, wise agreement on migration and a better Eurozone,” Tusk said on Twitter, making a link between German coalition talks and broader EU policies.\n“Perhaps we can also do it within five months,” he added jokingly after Germany took that time to form a new government after national elections.\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ",
