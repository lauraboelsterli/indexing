    "text": "PITTSBURGH, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- L.B. Foster Company (NASDAQ:FSTR), a leading manufacturer and distributor of products and services for transportation and energy infrastructure, today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $0.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and full year 2017 net income of $4.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, both of which included a provisional one-time transition tax expense of $3.3 million on our foreign earnings and provisional tax benefit of $1.5 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nFinancial Highlights\nFourth Quarter\nSales increased by 32.6% from the prior year quarter to $141.3 million. Fourth quarter gross profit margin was 19.7% compared to 17.6% in the prior year. New orders increased by 1.9% from the prior year quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter totaled $11.9 million compared to $6.5 million provided in the prior year. Outstanding debt was reduced by $8.3 million during the quarter. Fourth quarter income tax expense was $3.2 million on pre-tax income of $3.5 million. EBITDA 1 (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for the fourth quarter was $10.4 million, a $7.4 million increase over the prior year.\nFull Year\nSales increased by 10.9% to $536.4 million compared to the prior year. 2017 gross profit margin was 19.2% compared to 18.7% for 2016. New orders for 2017 increased 14.5% from the prior year. An increase in backlog of 13.2% from the prior year to $166.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 totaled $39.4 million compared to $18.4 million provided in the prior year. During 2017, outstanding debt was reduced $29.6 million, or 18.6%. 2017 income tax expense was $3.9 million on pre-tax income of $8.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and asset impairments) was $36.0 million, an increase of 94.0% compared to the prior year.\nFourth Quarter Results\nFourth quarter net sales of $141.3 million increased by $34.8 million, or 32.6%, compared to the prior year quarter due to increases in each of the three segments: Tubular and Energy Services (Tubular) sales increased 88.5%, Rail Products and Services (Rail) sales increased 35.2%, and Construction Products (Construction) sales increased 3.6%.\nGross profit margin was 19.7%, 210 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. Each of the three segments saw increased gross profit margins compared to the prior year. The Tubular segment had the greatest increase of 1,240 basis points, which was primarily supported by our Test and Inspection Services and Protective Coatings businesses. The Construction segment saw a 200 basis point increase, primarily from its Precast Concrete Products division. The Rail segment's gross profit margin increased 40 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily from our North American divisions.\nNet income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $0.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $40.9 million, or a loss of $3.97 per diluted share, last year. 2016 net income was significantly impacted by income tax expense from the valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter, as well as deferred taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings.\nThe Company’s income tax expense for the fourth quarter of $3.2 million was impacted by recent U.S. tax reform. The Company recognized a provisional $3.3 million tax expense related to the one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a provisional $1.5 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the recently enacted 21.0% federal corporate tax rate.\nFourth quarter EBITDA was $10.4 million compared to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelling and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter increased by $0.5 million, or 2.3%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily comprised of personnel-related costs of $1.5 million and was offset by a $1.0 million reduction in insurance reserves. Selling and administrative expenses were reduced 430 basis points to 14.5% of net sales compared to the prior year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the quarter totaled $11.9 million compared to $6.5 million provided in the prior year quarter. This provided the Company with the liquidity to continue to reduce our outstanding debt.\nFourth quarter new orders were $115.5 million, a 1.9% increase from the prior year quarter, due to a 75.8% increase in Tubular. This was partially offset by 15.0% and 5.6% reductions in Rail and Construction, respectively.\nTotal debt decreased by $8.3 million, or 6.0%, in the fourth quarter to $130.0 million as compared to the total debt as of September 30, 2017. This included the payoff of our term loan.\n1 See \"Non-GAAP Disclosures\" at the end of this press release for information regarding the following non-GAAP measures used in this release: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the prior year impairment charge.\nCEO Comments\nBob Bauer, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The Company's 2017 top priority of improving profitability was highlighted with a strong finish in the fourth quarter. Sales growth of 32.6% in the fourth quarter helped drive excellent results, with gross profit increasing 48.6% and EBITDA increasing 250.3% in the quarter over the prior year. This helped us complete a turn-around year when compared to the prior year, with our ending backlog up 13.2%, gross profit margins 50 basis points better, and EBITDA nearly doubled to $36.0 million.\n\"We’re very pleased with the progress toward restoring profitability particularly in the Tubular and Energy Services segment. This segment, with sales growth of 19.9% in 2017, is also benefiting from the modernization programs implemented in the last few years as well as other lean projects. All three reporting segments combined to drive operating cash flow for the year of $39.4 million. The focus on working capital efficiency was instrumental as minimal increase in working capital was needed to fund $52.9 million in sales growth. These results helped strengthen our balance sheet, reducing debt by $29.6 million and exceeding our target of reducing net debt to below $100.0 million. The Company’s Net Debt to EBITDA ratio ended the year at 2.6x.\"\nMr. Bauer added, \"Throughout the year we capitalized on growth opportunities as freight rail and energy markets recovered while we kept a sharp focus on cost control. The Company continues to be well positioned to leverage strengthening markets, deliver new products, and extend our geographic reach. We are continuing to invest in expanding our service and solutions offering, and completed several projects with “new-to-the-market” solutions.”\nFull Year Results\nNet sales for 2017 of $536.4 million increased by $52.9 million, or 10.9%, compared to the prior year period. This was supported by each of the three segments with a 19.9% increase in Tubular, 11.1% increase in Construction, and a 7.1% increase in Rail sales.\nGross profit margin was 19.2%, 50 basis points higher than the prior year period. The increase was driven by the Tubular and Construction segments, partially offset by reductions within the Rail segment and unfavorable LIFO adjustments. Year to date Tubular gross profit margins were favorable in each division within the segment.\nNet income for 2017 was $4.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $141.7 million, or a loss of $13.79 per diluted share, last year. 2016 net income was significantly impacted by asset impairment charges and income tax expense from the valuation allowance as well as deferred taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $36.0 million compared to $18.5 million in 2016, which excludes the 2016 asset impairment charges. Selling and administrative expense decreased by $5.5 million, or 6.3%, compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily comprised of personnel-related costs of $2.8 million, $1.3 million in lower litigation costs related to the Union Pacific Railroad matter, and reduced insurance reserves of $1.1 million. 2017 selling and administrative expense was reduced by 280 basis points to 15.0% of net sales compared to the prior year.\nAmortization expense was $7.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.6 million in the prior year period. The reduction was primarily due to the 2016 impairment of definite-lived intangible assets.\nInterest expense was $8.4 million in 2017, compared to $6.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was attributable to an increase in interest rates.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $39.4 million compared to $18.4 million in the prior year period, a $21.0 million improvement. This provided the Company with the liquidity to continue to reduce our outstanding debt.\nNew orders were $552.2 million for 2017, a 14.5% increase from the prior year period, due to a 53.4% increase in Tubular and a 17.0% increase in Rail, which were partially offset by an 8.0% reduction in Construction orders.\nTotal debt was reduced by $29.6 million, or 18.6%, to $130.0 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to total debt as of December 31, 2016. This included the payoff of our term loan.\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously deferred earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Our 2017 financial results include a provisional tax expense of $3.3 million related to the one-time transition tax, partially offset by a provisional $1.5 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our 2017 U.S. cash tax liability, which included our provisional transition tax amount, will be payable in eight installments, with $0.2 million due in 2018. The Company will continue to refine its calculations during 2018, as additional analysis related to the Act is completed.\nL.B.

The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to investors in order to provide a more complete understanding of the ongoing operations of the Company’s business. Similarly, Adjusted EBITDA displays the performance of the Company without the impact of asset impairments in order to enhance investors' understanding of our day to day operations. In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in the assessment of the use of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis. Additionally, EBITDA is a financial measurement that management and the Board of Directors use in the determination of certain compensation programs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP financial results and should only be considered in conjunction with the Company’s financial information that is presented in accordance with GAAP.
