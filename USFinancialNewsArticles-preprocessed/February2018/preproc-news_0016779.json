    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of Lululemon Athletics Inc. (\"Lululemon\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: LULU). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 9980.\nThe investigation concerns whether Lululemon and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n[Click here to join a class action]\nOn February 5, 2018, Lululemon announced the resignation of its Chief Executive Officer Laurent Potdevin, effective immediately. The Company stated that it \"expects all employees to exemplify the highest levels of integrity and respect for one another, and Mr. Potdevin fell short of these standards of conduct.\" Following this announcement, Lululemon's share price has fallen sharply during intraday trading on February 6, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com .\nCONTACT:\nRobert S.
