    "text": "CHICAGO, FreightCar America, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAIL) today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nFourth quarter revenue of $79.2 million on deliveries of 977 units Fourth quarter net loss of $11.1 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, inclusive of a $2.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, tax expense as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Total cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash increased by $37.7 million to $136.4 million at December 31, 2017 Year-end backlog totaling 2,392 railcars at an aggregate value of approximately $181 million Full-year 2018 delivery outlook forecasted to range between 3,500 and 4,300 railcars Exiting long-term agreement with Navistar at Shoals facility through the purchase of Navistar’s interest; Will become primary tenant and take control of full manufacturing process at Shoals facility ‘Back to Basics’ operational improvement strategy expected to deliver direct cost of goods sold savings of between $3,000 and $4,000 per railcar, excluding commodity price movements, by the end of 2018\n“During the fourth quarter, we continued to see a number of challenges associated with the lower demand environment and inefficiencies across our manufacturing operations, which hampered our quarterly results,” said Jim Meyer, President and Chief Executive Officer. “While 2017 top-line results and deliveries were down year-over-year, our team prudently managed and reduced general and administrative costs, prioritized cash flows and maintained our financial strength, all of which remain critical as we continue to turn around our business. While we do not expect these challenging market conditions to improve in the short term, our focus remains resolute in putting legacy issues behind us, while our markets are still in a cyclical downturn. Our goal and focus now are to achieve operational excellence in every aspect of how we run our business.”\nMeyer continued, “I’ve spent several months getting to know many of our customers and discussing their needs. I am very encouraged that they want more supply chain choices and want FreightCar America to be part of their solutions. Our products and customer-centric focus are highly valued by our customers. At the same time, we recognize that delivering maximum value to our customers requires a lean, best-in-class operational foundation.”\nMeyer concluded, “Therefore, we began executing our ‘Back to Basics’ program, which is designed to transform our operational and manufacturing platforms. There are three main components to this program: (1) simplifying our business structure; (2) developing, training and retaining the right talent across our organization; and (3) implementing best-in-class processes across the business. Collectively, these initiatives will help us to address a number of foundational impediments to our success, lower our cost structure and significantly improve our productivity. While these initiatives will take time to implement, we expect that we can start to take meaningful near-term costs out of the business and are forecasting lowering our direct cost of goods sold by $3,000 to $4,000 per railcar delivered on a run rate basis by the end of 2018.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nConsolidated revenues were $79.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $135.5 million in the same quarter of 2016.\nThe Company delivered 977 railcars in the fourth quarter of 2017, which included 855 new railcars, 47 rebuilt railcars and 75 leased railcars. This compares to 1,364 railcars delivered in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included 1,137 new railcars and 227 rebuilt railcars.\nThe Company had a diversified backlog totaling 2,392 railcars at December 31, 2017, valued at approximately $181 million. Based upon current backlog and inquiry levels, the Company expects to deliver between 3,500 and 4,300 railcars in 2018.\nConsolidated operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.3 million compared to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted operating loss, which excluded a $1.5 million provision for a contingent liability, was $11.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million, which excluded the effect of $0.7 million of restructuring and impairment charges related to the Company’s cost reduction plan, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating (loss) income is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of adjusted operating (loss) income to operating (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the attached supplemental disclosure.\nThe income tax benefit of $2.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $2.5 million tax expense related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.1 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and restricted certificates of deposit were $136.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The $37.7 million increase from December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to reductions in working capital and the receipt of an $11.9 million income tax refund partially offset by the 2017 net loss.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nConsolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were $409.5 million compared to $523.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company delivered 4,427 railcars in 2017, which included 4,305 new railcars, 47 rebuilt railcars and 75 leased railcars. This compares to 5,559 railcars delivered in 2016, which included 5,332 new railcars and 227 rebuilt railcars.\nConsolidated operating loss for 2017 was $31.8 million compared to consolidated operating income of $15.8 million in 2016. Adjusted operating loss, which excluded restructuring and impairment charges, contingency charges related to patent litigation and CEO transition costs, was $24.1 million in 2017. This compared to adjusted operating income of $3.8 million in 2016, which excluded restructuring and impairment charges and the gain on settlement of the retiree benefit plan obligation.\nThe income tax benefit of $8.8 million in 2017 included a $2.5 million tax expense related to a remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet loss in 2017 was $22.6 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared to net income of $12.3 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call & Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 financial results.

Adjusted operating (loss) income is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIn addition, the presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of the financial information by providing a measure that the Company’s management uses internally to evaluate the Company’s baseline performance. Accordingly, when analyzing our operating performance, investors should not consider adjusted operating (loss) income in isolation or as a substitute for operating (loss) income in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of this non-GAAP measure is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of adjusted operating income (loss) to operating (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 (In thousands) Operating (loss) income, as reported $ (13,338 ) $ (3,094 ) $ (18,612 ) $ (31,792 ) $ 15,848 Add: Restructuring and impairment charges 7 730 59 2,212 2,261 Add: Contingency charge 1,450 - 2,850 4,300 - Add: CEO transition costs - - 1,185 1,185 - Less: Gain on settlement of retiree benefit plan obligations, net of plaintiffs’ attorneys fees - - - - (14,306 ) Adjusted operating (loss) income $ (11,881 ) $ (2,364 ) $ (14,518 ) $ (24,095 ) $ 3,803\nINVESTOR & MEDIA CONTACT Matthew S.
