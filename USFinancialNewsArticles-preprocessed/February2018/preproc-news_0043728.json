    "text": "NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tremont Mortgage Trust (Nasdaq: TRMT) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nDavid Blackman, Chief Executive Officer of TRMT, made the following statement:\n“Since completing our initial public offering, we have been active in the market meeting with owners of commercial real estate and intermediaries across the U.S., sourcing potential loan opportunities. During this time, our originations team has evaluated more than 140 prospective financing opportunities with a combined transaction value greater than $3 billion. As a result, we currently have seven outstanding term sheets totaling approximately $186 million and three outstanding loan applications totaling approximately $62 million for loan opportunities where we believe TRMT can be competitive. Unfortunately, we have not closed any investments and we are behind where we expected to be at this time. Because we are a new and relatively small company, we are proceeding cautiously. Nevertheless, we believe we are finding our niche and remain hopeful that we will be able to successfully deploy the capital raised in our IPO in the coming months.”\nResults for 2017:\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017 net loss was $1.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $1.3 million, or $0.85 per diluted share.\nFinancing Activities:\nOn September 18, 2017, TRMT sold 2,500,000 common shares at a price of $20.00 per share in its initial public offering, or IPO. Concurrently with its IPO, TRMT sold an additional 600,000 common shares at a price of $20.00 per share to its manager, Tremont Realty Advisors LLC, in a private placement. The aggregate proceeds to TRMT from these sales were $62.0 million.\nOn February 12, 2018, TRMT announced that its wholly owned subsidiary has entered an agreement for a $100.0 million master repurchase facility with Citibank, N.A., which it may use to leverage its financing transactions. The facility has a three year term and permits advancements of up to 75% of whole loan amounts. Interest on advancements under the facility will be calculated at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a premium of 200 to 250 basis points.\nDividend:\nTRMT plans to declare and pay its first distribution to common shareholders after successfully deploying the capital raised in its IPO and concurrent private placement.\nConference Call:\nAt 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time this morning, Chief Executive Officer, David Blackman, and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Lanois, will host a conference call to discuss TRMT’s 2017 financial results.\nThe conference call telephone number is (877) 270-2148.
