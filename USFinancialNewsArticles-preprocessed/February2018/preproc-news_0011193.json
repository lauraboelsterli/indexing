    "text": "LOS ANGELES, February 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nCannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC Pink: NUGS) today announces it has signed a letter of intent to acquire Pure Applied Sciences and its brand PureOrganix, a line of organic and pure cannabis oils and related accessories. In a short amount of time, PureOrganix's brand showed exciting growth in 2017, capturing a lot of fanfare and praise for their products amongst the cannabis retail environment in Southern California.\nMr. Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic commented, \"The cannabis consumer is increasingly looking for purity in products and this is one of the reasons we are so interested in bringing Pure Applied Sciences into the NUGS fold. The Company thoroughly tests its products and fully conforms to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). They have also created processes to match FDA guidelines for Active Pharmaceuticals Products (API). This is the type of quality product we want within our business portfolio. We are still working out the final details of the transaction, but we passed the LOI stage and look forward to a successful conclusion.\"\nThe successful completion of this acquisition will help Cannabis Strategic Ventures launch a new division of consumer brands. The NUGS management team believes there is a huge opportunity in the industry to carve out and control specific industry niches and to create cannabis consumer brands.\nCannabis Strategic believes expansion into branded products presents significant opportunities for the Company to expand its business model. According to Tom Adams of BSD Analytics, the Cannabis retail market is expected to hit $11 billion in 2018 and $21 billion in 2021. While the Company continues to build its outsourced employment and staffing division, the Company plans to continue pursuing investment opportunities in the areas of real estate, cultivation, extraction, distribution, packaging, dispensary operations, and branded products.\nAbout Cannabis Strategic Ventures\nCannabis Strategic Ventures is based in Los Angeles and is focused on supporting entrepreneurial growth within the fast-growing legal cannabis sector. The Company, recently completed a name and symbol change from Cascade Energy, Inc. Cannabis Strategic Ventures offers outsourced personnel solutions that are tailor-made to match the growth dynamics of cannabis cultivators, manufacturers, dispensaries, and other cannabis marketplace participants.
