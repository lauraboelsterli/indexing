The sales increase was achieved in a period in which European light vehicle production increased 7% and North American light vehicle production decreased 5%, each relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our complete vehicle assembly sales increased 129% in the fourth quarter of 2017 largely reflecting the 2017 launches of the BMW 5-Series and Jaguar E-Pace at our assembly facility in Graz, Austria.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, income from operations before income taxes was $761 million, compared to $646 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable to Magna International Inc. was $556 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $478 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $1.53 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.24 in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase in net income attributable to Magna International Inc. and a 6% decrease in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during 2017.\nAdjusted EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 16% to $809 million, compared to $696 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our Europe and Asia segments each posted higher Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.57 compared to $1.31 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe generated cash from operations of $884 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, before changes in operating assets and liabilities, and $564 million from operating assets and liabilities. Investment activities for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.02 billion, including $750 million in fixed asset additions and a $267 million increase in investments, other assets and intangible assets.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017\nWe posted record sales of $38.95 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 7% from the year ended December 31, 2016. European light vehicle production increased 4% and North American light vehicle production decreased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIncome from operations before income taxes was $3.00 billion, an increase of $219 million. Net income attributable to Magna International Inc. was $2.21 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.90, increases of $175 million and $0.74, respectively, each compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 7% to $3.11 billion in 2017, compared to $2.90 billion for 2016. Our Asia and Rest of World segments each posted higher Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales, compared to 2016.\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $5.96 for 2017 compared to $5.23 for 2016.\nDuring 2017, we generated cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3.56 billion, and invested $232 million in operating assets and liabilities. Investment activities for 2017 were $2.51 billion, including $1.86 billion in fixed asset additions and a $651 million increase in investments, other assets and intangible assets.\nRETURN OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS\nDuring the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, Magna repurchased 6.7 million shares for $366 million and 26.2 million shares for $1.27 billion, respectively. In addition, we paid dividends of $95 million and $400 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOur Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 with respect to our outstanding Common Shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This dividend is payable on March 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018.\n“Our strong earnings growth and cash flow have enabled us to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Our 20% dividend increase, the ninth consecutive annual dividend increase, reflects the confidence that both management and our Board have in Magna’s future.”\n- Vince Galifi, Magna’s Chief Financial Officer\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at\nhttp://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0a6a8639-042a-46d5-9af8-fd23270369bb\n2018 OUTLOOK\nOur 2018 outlook remains unchanged from the outlook provided in our January 16, 2018 press release, except that European light vehicle production units have increased from 22.3 million to 22.4 million units. For further details, refer to the \"2018 Outlook\" section later in this press release.\nREVIEW OF SELECT FOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOther Expense, net\nWe recorded other expense, net of $28 million ($35 million after tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $30 million ($26 million after tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2016. These items had an unfavourable impact of $0.10 and $0.07 on diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For further details, refer to the \"Other Expense, Net\" section later in this press release.\nUS Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"US Tax Reform\"), which (i) reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018; (ii) requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred; and (iii) creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the US Tax Reform. However, we have made provisional estimates and recorded a net $23 million reduction in income tax expense. This included a $61 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances partially offset by an expense of $38 million related to the one-time transition tax. These amounts positively impacted our diluted earnings per share by $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSegment Analysis North America For the three months\nended December 31,\n2017\n2016 Change Vehicle Production Volumes (thousands of units) 4,139 4,358 (219 ) - 5 % Sales External Production $ 4,872 $ 4,878 $ (6 ) — Tooling, Engineering and Other 388 360 28 + 8 % Total Sales 5,260 5,238 22 — Adjusted EBIT $ 506 $ 516 $ (10 ) - 2 % Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales (i) 9.6 % 9.9 % - 0.3 % (i) Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales is calculated as Adjusted EBIT divided by Total Sales. External production sales in North America was relatively unchanged at $4.87 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.88 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 while North American vehicle production volumes decreased 5%. Lower production volumes on certain existing programs were substantially offset by the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016, including the Jeep Compass, Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, Volkswagen Atlas, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, and a $67 million favourable impact due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.\nIn North America, Adjusted EBIT decreased $10 million to $506 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $516 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to customer settlements in the fourth quarter of 2017, higher pre-operating costs incurred at new facilities and reduced earnings on lower production sales partially offset by operational improvements, higher scrap steel recoveries, lower warranty costs, and an $11 million favourable impact due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, each against the U.S. dollar.\nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales decreased 0.3% to 9.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 9.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to customer settlements in the fourth quarter of 2017, higher pre-operating costs incurred at new facilities and reduced earnings on lower production sales partially offset by operational improvements, higher scrap steel recoveries and lower warranty costs.\nEurope For the three months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Volumes (thousands of units) (i) Vehicle Production 5,755.0 5,384.0 371.0 + 7 % Magna Complete Vehicle Assembly 27.3 7.4 19.9 + 269 % Sales External Production $ 2,706 $ 2,204 $ 502 + 23 % Complete Vehicle Assembly 1,007 439 568 + 129 % Tooling, Engineering and Other 593 581 12 + 2 % Total Sales 4,306 3,224 1,082 + 34 % Adjusted EBIT $ 151 $ 71 $ 80 + 113 % Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales 3.5 % 2.2 % + 1.3 % (i) Vehicles produced at our Complete Vehicle Assembly operations are included in Vehicle Production volumes. External production sales in Europe increased 23% or $502 million to $2.71 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.20 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 while European vehicle production volumes increased 7%. The increase in production sales was primarily due to a $199 million favourable impact from the strengthening of foreign currencies, including the euro, Polish Zloty, and Czech Koruna each against the U.S. dollar, and the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016 including the BMW 5-Series, Ford Fiesta, Mercedes-Benz GLC and GLC Coupe and the Land Rover Range Rover Velar. Complete vehicle assembly sales increased $568 million to $1.01 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $439 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to the 2017 launches of the BMW 5-Series and Jaguar E-Pace.\nIn Europe, Adjusted EBIT increased $80 million to $151 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $71 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to margins earned on higher production and complete vehicle assembly sales and lower warranty costs partially offset by operational inefficiencies and launch costs incurred at a body and chassis facility, lower equity income and higher commodity costs.\nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales increased 1.3% to 3.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher production sales at margins higher than our European average and lower warranty costs partially offset by operational inefficiencies and launch costs at a body and chassis facility, lower equity income and higher commodity costs.\nAsia For the three months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Sales External Production $ 644 $ 663 $ (19 ) - 3 % Tooling, Engineering and Other 150 112 38 + 34 % Total Sales 794 775 19 + 2 % Adjusted EBIT $ 139 $ 100 $ 39 + 39 % Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales 17.5 % 12.9 % + 4.6 % External production sales in Asia decreased 3% or $19 million to $644 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $663 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to lower production volumes on certain existing programs partially offset by the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $22 million favourable impact due to the strengthening of foreign currencies, including the Chinese renminbi, against the U.S. dollar.\nIn Asia, Adjusted EBIT increased $39 million to $139 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $100 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher equity income, partially offset by reduced earnings due to lower production sales. The higher equity income related to higher net income at a certain equity investment as a result of an increase in sales partially offset by higher pre-operating costs incurred relating to a new venture.\nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales increased 4.6% to 17.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 12.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher equity income partially offset by an increase in tooling sales as a proportion of total sales, which have a higher material and labour content than our Asia average.\nRest of World For the three months ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change Sales External Production $ 153 $ 133 $ 20 + 15 % Tooling, Engineering and Other 7 11 (4 ) - 36 % Total Sales 160 144 16 + 11 % Adjusted EBIT $ (3 ) $ 4 $ (7 ) — External production sales in Rest of World increased 15% or $20 million to $153 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $133 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. External production sales were higher primarily due to net customer price increases subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn Rest of World, Adjusted EBIT decreased $7 million to a loss of $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to income of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to operational inefficiencies at certain manufacturing facilities partially offset by net customer price increases subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nLight Vehicle Production (Units) North America 17.4 million Europe\n22.4 million Segment Sales Body Exteriors & Structures $16.6 - $17.4 billion Power & Vision $11.8 - $12.4 billion Seating Systems $5.3 - $5.7 billion Complete Vehicles $6.0 - $6.4 billion Total Sales $39.3 - $41.5 billion Adjusted EBIT Margin (2) 7.9% - 8.2% Equity Income (included in EBIT) $335 - $375 million Interest Expense, net Approximately $90 million Income Tax Rate (3) Approximately 22-23% Net income attributable to Magna $2.3 - $2.5 billion Capital Spending Approximately $1.8 billion (2) Adjusted EBIT Margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBIT to Total Sales.\n(3) The Income Tax Rate has been calculated using Adjusted EBIT and is based on current tax legislation.\nIn this 2018 outlook, we have assumed:\n2018 light vehicle production volumes (as set out above); no material unannounced acquisitions or divestitures; and foreign exchange rates for the most common currencies in which we conduct business relative to our U.S. dollar reporting currency were: 1 Canadian dollar equals U.S. dollars 0.780 1 euro equals U.S. dollars 1.170\nThese foreign exchange rates are unchanged from our previous 2018 outlook dated January 16, 2018.\nCertain of the forward-looking financial measures above are provided on a Non-GAAP basis.

SUPPLEMENTAL DATA [Unaudited] [All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unless otherwise noted] Segmented Information The Company's chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes [\"Adjusted EBIT\"] as the measure of segment profit or loss, since management believes Adjusted EBIT is the most appropriate measure of operational profitability or loss for its reporting segments. Adjusted EBIT is calculated by taking net income and adding back income taxes, interest expense, net, and other expense, net.

SUPPLEMENTAL DATA [Unaudited] [All amounts in U.S. dollars and all tabular amounts in millions unless otherwise noted] Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release contains references to the Non-GAAP financial measures reconciled below. We believe the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. In particular, management believes that Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted diluted earnings per share, are useful measures in assessing the Company’s financial performance by excluding certain items that are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance. Management also believes that these measures are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's results of operations, as they provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBIT: Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 572 $ 496 $ 2,255 $ 2,074 Add: Interest expense, net 20 20 70 88 Other expense, net 28 30 39 30 Income taxes 189 150 744 706 Adjusted EBIT $ 809 $ 696 $ 3,108 $ 2,898 The following table reconciles Net income attributable to Magna International Inc. to Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share: Three months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income attributable to Magna International Inc. $ 556 $ 478 $ 2,206 $ 2,031 Add: Other expense, net 28 30 39 30 Tax effect of other expense, net 7 (4 ) 7 (4 ) US tax reform (23 ) — (23 ) — Adjusted net income attributable to Magna International Inc. $ 568 $ 504 $ 2,229 $ 2,057 Diluted weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period: 362.3 385.0 373.9 393.2 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.57 $ 1.31 $ 5.96 $ 5.23 This press release together with our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position and our Interim Financial Statements are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.magna.com/investors and filed electronically through the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) which can be accessed at www.sedar.com as well as on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR), which can be accessed at www.sec.gov .\nWe will hold a conference call for interested analysts and shareholders to discuss our fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 results on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. EST.
