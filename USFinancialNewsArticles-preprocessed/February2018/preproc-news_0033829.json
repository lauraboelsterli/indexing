    "text": "(Adds background, analyst and CEO comment)\nBy Sumeet Gaikwad\nFeb 14 (Reuters) - Biotherapeutics company CSL Ltd reported a 35 percent rise in its first-half profit on Wednesday due to robust demand for its vaccines in the United States, and upgraded its earnings guidance for the fiscal year.\nIts stock surged as much as 6 percent to hit a record high after the results.\nNet profit after tax was $1.1 billion, the company said, compared with $805.5 million a year ago.\nCSL also upgraded its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance to about $1.55 billion-$1.60 billion from an earlier forecast of $1.48 billion-$1.55 billion.\n“It looks like there is a relatively early severe flu season in the U.S. and that is going to drive sales for them,” said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut.\nSales of the company’s Seqirus division grew 26 percent at constant currency rates, largely driven by increased sales of seasonal influenza vaccines.\nRevenue from the company’s primary Behring division grew 8 percent with sales of immunoglobin products rising in the period as some competitors experienced supply constraints.\n“An uneven profit profile for CSL is expected for the first and second half results, due to the seasonality of the influenza business and the timing of expenses – particularly research and development,” CEO Paul Perreault said in a statement.
