Six crude grades can be delivered on the INE, including five from the Middle East.\nTwo further storage sites are owned by Sinopec, in Shandong and Zhejiang, another by Sinochem in Zhoushan. The remaining two sites are in Qingdao, in Shandong, and in Yangshan in Zhejiang.\nThe three back-up warehouses included one owned by China National Offshore Oil Corp in Yantai, Shandong, as well as another site in Dalian and one in Yingkou, also in Liaoning.\nAfter years of delays, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced last week that China’s oil futures contract would start trading on March 26.\nIn a separate statement, the INE named four firms that had been approved to inspect the crude delivered into the bonded warehouses.\nThe companies are China Certification & Inspection Group Inspection Co Ltd., SGS-CSTC Standards Technical Services Co Ltd, Shanghai Orient Intertek Testing Services Co Ltd and the Technical Center for Industrial Product and Raw Material Inspection and Testing at the Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
