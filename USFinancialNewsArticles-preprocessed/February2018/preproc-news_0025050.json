    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning! Lara O’Reilly is taking a much-deserved vacation, so I’ll be your temporary tour guide through the worlds of media and marketing. Our first destination: Pyeongchang, South Korea, where the Olympic Games are underway. NBCUniversal announced Thursday that the company surpassed $900 million in national ad sales, setting a Winter Games record. But it remains to be seen whether viewership of the Games will keep pace with expectations, as cord-cutting continues to eat into televised audiences.\nAlgorithm and Blues It’s tough out there for Instagram influencers. Imagine spending months or years developing a following with exquisitely lit selfies and photos of food, only to have it suddenly yanked away by an algorithm shift. That’s what’s happening, according to social media stars and companies interviewed by Business Insider . They blame Instagram for reducing their reach on the platform, but a representative for the company said it hasn’t made any changes that would affect the reach of any particular kind of account. The news comes weeks after Instagram-parent Facebook announced its decision to reduce the number of posts from publishers that appear in its news feed. The upshot of all these changes? Social media giveth, social media taketh away.\nI Want My MTV (Streamed) Viacom on Thursday became the latest media company to jump aboard the streaming bandwagon by announcing plans to launch an ad-supported service later this year. The service, which will go live by September , will feature thousands of hours of Viacom programming, WSJ’s Keach Hagey reports. Viacom had been plotting for it by holding back some content from online-video providers like Hulu. Several questions about the service remain. Will users need a cable TV login to access it? Will it consist entirely of reruns? And how would the service fare if the potential merger with CBS goes through?\nLondon Calling In the wake of the 2016 election cycle, tech giants Google and Facebook faced criticism for failing to extinguish propaganda aimed at influencing voters. That scrutiny doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon — in fact, it’s gone international. On Thursday, representatives from the U.K. House of Commons select committee visited Washington to grill representatives from Google, Facebook and Twitter about the spread of misinformation on their platforms, Bloomberg reports. They urged the companies to prevent fake news from spreading online, intimating government regulation might be a potential fix. This public chastening comes in the wake of proposed legislation from U.S. lawmakers that would regulate political ads on social media, requiring companies to maintain a public repository of paid political advertising on their sites.\nThe Platform Bet Many publishers have been ramping up distribution through social-media companies like YouTube, Facebook and Snapchat, publishing more content directly through those platforms instead of via their sites. Is it working? A report released Thursday by Digital Content Next shows that revenue from “platform publishing” is on the rise, with 37% year-over-year growth in the first half of 2017. But it isn’t becoming a larger share of the overall revenue mix for publishers, despite all their efforts in this area. And many of the programs are cost-intensive and tough to scale. In other words, the jury is still out on whether platform publishing will prove a smart long-term investment.\nBest of the Rest Facebook is testing a “downvote” button for flagging comments. [ TechCrunch ]\nEarly details about Disney’s streaming service are beginning to trickle out. It initially will launch in the U.S. and won’t include R-rated movies or Marvel content. [ Deadline ]\nNew York Times Co. reported solid growth in the fourth quarter, driven by digital subscriptions, beating Wall Street’s expectations. [ WSJ ]\nWall Street Journal-parent News Corp’s growth was boosted by its digital real estate unit as results beat expectations. [ WSJ ]\nPublishers are hoping to pry loose some of Netflix’s $8 billion budget for original content.
