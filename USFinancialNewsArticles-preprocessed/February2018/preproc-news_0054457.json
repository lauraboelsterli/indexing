    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, Feb 23 (Reuters) - South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers said on Friday that its members had not been paid on time at the Optimum coal mine, which is owned by the Gupta family, and would not return to work at the operation which has started business rescue proceedings.\n“The guys were not paid and they want a meeting with the CEO because they are concerned about the business rescue proceedings which they were not informed about,” NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu said.\nIndia’s Bank of Baroda, which counts the Gupta family’s operations as clients, has pulled the plug on its South African business.\nThe Gupta‘s, who are Zuma’s business associates, have been accused of using their political connections to win state contracts and influence cabinet appointments. Zuma and the Gupta brothers deny wrongdoing. (Reporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by James Macharia)\n ",
