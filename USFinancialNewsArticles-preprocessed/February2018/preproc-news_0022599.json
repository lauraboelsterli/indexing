Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.5 million, compared with a net loss of $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.0 million, compared with a $9.3 million non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 (see the accompanying table for reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures).\nTotal revenue for the full year 2017 was $101.9 million, a decrease of 2% from $104.4 million for 2016. Net loss for the full year 2017 was $60.5 million, compared with a net loss of $76.0 million for 2016. Non-GAAP net loss for 2017 was $30.2 million, compared with a $41.6 million non-GAAP net loss for 2016.\n“The year 2017 was transformative for Fluidigm, representing a period of significant change across every aspect of our business and positioning the company for a return to sustainable growth,” said Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO. “We achieved double-digit operating expense reductions for the year, forged innovative partnerships with industry and academia, and added vital cash to our balance sheet for financial flexibility. In addition, our fourth quarter results marked year-over-year and sequential revenue growth.\n“In our proteomics business, we launched our Hyperion™ Imaging System, enabling groundbreaking oncology and cancer immunotherapy research and representing further evolution of mass cytometry as the premier tool to explore the human immune system. We posted strong year-over-year revenue growth for mass cytometry as the pace of significant research based on this technology increased, evidenced by a growing body of more than 400 publications—120 new publications in 2017 alone—in areas ranging from pharmacogenomics to autoimmune diseases,” said Linthwaite. “In our high-throughput genomics business, we forged partnerships for development of new content and workflow solutions and continued our strategic focus on high-value customers.\n“Throughout 2017, we built a foundation for taking our technologies in mass cytometry and microfluidic genomics to larger markets, more users, and expanded applications. In 2018, we expect to grow and develop these businesses while continuing to deliver on our financial commitments, strengthening our balance sheet, and improving the customer experience.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Performance\nTotal revenue of $27.7 million by category:\nInstrument revenue increased 6% to $11.3 million from $10.7 million in the prior year period due to increased revenue from mass cytometry and high-throughput genomics instruments, partially offset by decreased revenue from single-cell genomics instruments. Consumables revenue increased 14% to $11.7 million from $10.3 million in the prior year period with growth in both high-throughput genomics and mass cytometry consumables, partially offset by decreased revenue from single-cell genomics consumables. Service revenue grew 15% to $4.7 million from $4.1 million in the prior year period, an increase primarily related to our mass cytometry business.\nProduct revenue of $23.0 million by market:\nGenomics product revenue was $12.3 million in the current quarter compared to $12.4 million in the year ago period, mainly due to decreases in revenue from single-cell products. Mass cytometry product revenue increased 26% to $10.8 million from $8.6 million in the prior year period, driven both by increased sales of instruments and by increased consumables sales.\nTotal revenue by geographic area:\nGeographic Area Revenue by\nGeography Year-over-Year\nChange % of Total\nRevenue United States $11.2 million (15 %) 40 % Europe $9.5 million 41 % 34 % Asia-Pacific $6.3 million 29 % 23 % Other $.7 million 108 % 3 % Product margin:\nGAAP product margin was 48.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 52.1% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP product margin was 63.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 69.6% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP product margin excludes the effects of amortization of developed technology, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense (see the accompanying table for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP product margins).\nThe year-over-year decrease in product margins was primarily due to increased genomics unit product costs from lower production volumes. The decrease in GAAP product margin was partially offset by fixed amortization of developed technology over higher revenues.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2017:\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017, were $63.1 million, including $3 million received under a litigation settlement in the fourth quarter. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, 2017, were $62.4 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $59.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Performance\nTotal revenue of $101.9 million by category:\nInstrument revenue of $42.5 million decreased 9% from $46.8 million in 2016, primarily due to lower genomics instrument sales, partially offset by growth in mass cytometry sales. Consumables revenue of $41.9 million decreased 1% from $42.2 million in 2016, primarily due to decreased genomics consumables sales, partially offset by continued strength in mass cytometry. Service revenue of $17.3 million increased 14% from $15.2 million in 2016, mainly due to increased service contracts.\nProduct revenue of $84.4 million by market:\nGenomics product revenue of $44.8 million decreased 26% from $60.3 million in 2016, primarily due to reduced revenue from single-cell genomics products. Mass cytometry product revenue of $39.6 million increased 38% from $28.7 million in 2016 driven by increased revenue from both instruments and consumables.\nTotal revenue by geographic area:\nGeographic Area Revenue by\nGeography Year-over-Year\nChange % of Total\nRevenue United States $45.8 million (13 %) 45 % Europe $32.6 million 10 % 32 % Asia-Pacific $20.0 million 8 % 20 % Other $3.5 million (3 %) 3 % Approximate active installed base at year-end:\nActive Installed Base 2017 Access Array™ and Juno™ 245 Biomark™/Biomark HD and EP1™ 560 C1™ 305 Mass Cytometry 200 Total Instruments 1,310 The active installed base excludes instruments: (i) sold over six quarters ago and (ii) for which customers have not purchased consumables in the last six quarters. As a reference, the total installed base was approximately 1,340 at the end of 2016.\n2017 Operational Highlights and Progress on Strategic Priorities\nFoster Innovation and Partnerships\nThe company signed a multiyear agreement with Ascendas Genomics to support development of molecular diagnostics in China. Ascendas Genomics is developing and commercializing systems and assays using microfluidic technologies included in the Fluidigm Biomark HD and Juno systems. Fluidigm entered into a distribution agreement with the University of Zurich to offer histoCAT™ software for multiparameter tissue analysis. The company obtained the rights to globally distribute histoCAT in conjunction with the Hyperion Imaging System. The software enables the identification of unique cellular social networks across a range of disease states. Fluidigm introduced the Advanta™ Immuno-Oncology Gene Expression Assay, a qPCR panel set that enables profiling of genes important in tumor immunobiology for translational research. Designed for use with the Biomark HD system, this focused panel set was optimized with input from leading academic research institutions and biopharma companies. Fluidigm and Baylor Genetics entered into a licensing agreement to offer a next-generation sequencing library prep assay enabling efficient sequencing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene using the Juno automated microfluidic system. A major academic research entity completed an agreement with Fluidigm to be the first Mass Cytometry Center of Excellence. The center of excellence initiative is intended to develop and share suspension mass cytometry expertise. Under this initiative, researchers will work with Fluidigm to expand and refine training in mass cytometry operations and techniques as well as develop new content.\nIncrease Operational Efficiency and Reduce Costs\nIn 2017, Fluidigm focused on right-sizing its work force, facilities consolidation, vendor negotiation, and other operating expense reduction programs. For the full year 2017, operating expenses decreased by $21.3 million or 16% on a GAAP basis, and decreased $17.7 million or 15% on a non-GAAP basis, compared with 2016.\nImprove Financial Discipline and Manage Cash Balance\nIn August 2017, we completed an “at-the-market” equity offering for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $28.8 million. Our total cash inflow in the fourth quarter was $0.8 million, including $3 million received under a litigation settlement.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance\nTotal revenue of $ 24 million to $27 million. GAAP operating expenses of $27 million to $28 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $24 million to $25 million, excluding stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $2.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Total cash outflow of $12 million to $13 million, including annual incentive compensation payments and a half-yearly interest payment on our convertible debt.\nProjected annualized consumables pull-through for 2018\nProjected Annualized Pull-Through Per Active Instrument/Year Access Array and Juno $22,000 to $27,000 Biomark/Biomark HD and EP1 $38,000 to $42,000 C1 $8,000 to $12,000 Mass Cytometry $60,000 to $65,000 Conference Call Information\nFluidigm will host a conference call at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) today, February 8, to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and operational updates.

The conference call will also be archived on the Fluidigm Investors page at http://investors.fluidigm.com/ .\nStatement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nFluidigm has presented certain financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, as well as projected for the first quarter of 2018. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, taken in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain non-cash and other expenses that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare the company’s performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans and to benchmark the company’s performance externally against competitors. Our estimates of forward-looking non-GAAP operating expenses exclude estimates for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, and amortization; loss on disposal of property and equipment; future changes relating to developed and acquired technologies; other intangible assets; and income taxes, among other items, certain of which are presented in the table accompanying our earnings release. The time and amount of certain material items needed to estimate non-GAAP financial measures are inherently unpredictable or outside of our control. Material changes to any of these items could have a significant effect on guidance and future GAAP results. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of the company’s operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Fluidigm encourages investors to carefully consider its results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand its business. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP operating results are presented in the accompanying tables of this release.\nUse of\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others, statements regarding expectations for growth and development in Fluidigm’s business lines, meeting financial commitments, strengthening Fluidigm’s balance sheet, improving customer experiences, expectations for the benefits of commercial agreements, cash flow expectations and cash management plans, and projected revenues, expenses, and cash flows for the first quarter of 2018.
