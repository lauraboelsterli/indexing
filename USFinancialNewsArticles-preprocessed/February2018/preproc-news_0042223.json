    "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition coalition said on Wednesday it would not be able to participate in a “fraudulent, illegitimate” presidential election on April 22 due to unfair conditions created by President Nicolas Maduro’s government. \nThe decision leaves Maduro, 55, on track as favorite for re-election but is likely to fuel widespread international condemnation of democratic shortcomings in the socialist-ruled OPEC nation. \nReporting by Corina Pons and Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Angus Berwick and Bill Trott\n ",
