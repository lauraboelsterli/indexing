All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this press release, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.\nForward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although we believe that we have been reasonable in our expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or that known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to differences in our future results include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rates and currency exchange fluctuations; our ability to acquire new customers; our ability to sustain and/or manage our growth, including the expansion of our Wayfair Delivery Network; our ability to increase our net revenue per active customer; and our ability to build and maintain strong brands. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the Company’s subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Wayfair’s unaudited consolidated and condensed financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this earnings release and the accompanying tables and the related earnings conference call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total net revenue (\"Adjusted EBITDA Margin\"), free cash flow and non-GAAP net loss and diluted net loss per share. Wayfair uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Wayfair’s ongoing operational performance. Wayfair has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in this earnings release.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated as loss before depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation and related taxes, interest and other income and expense, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and non-recurring items. Wayfair has included Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in this earnings release because they are key measures used by its management and its board of directors to evaluate its operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation and related taxes, excludes an item that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Investors should, however, understand that equity-based compensation will be a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Accordingly, Wayfair believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less net cash used to purchase property and equipment and site and software development costs. Wayfair believes free cash flow is an important indicator of Wayfair’s business performance, as it measures the amount of cash it generates. Accordingly, Wayfair believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management.\nNon-GAAP diluted net loss per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as GAAP net loss plus equity-based compensation and related taxes, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and non-recurring items divided by weighted average shares. Wayfair believes that adding back equity-based compensation expense and related taxes and (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and non-recurring items as adjustments to its GAAP diluted net loss before calculating per share amounts for all periods presented provides a more meaningful comparison between our operating results from period to period.\nWayfair does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Wayfair may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies, including other companies in its industry.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree months ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (72,771 ) $ (43,956 ) $ (244,614 ) $ (194,375 ) Depreciation and amortization (1) 24,432 17,044 87,020 55,572 Equity based compensation and related taxes 22,087 14,688 72,626 51,953 Interest expense (income), net 5,576 97 9,433 (694 ) Other (income) expense, net (358 ) 48 (758 ) (1,756 ) (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (185 ) 53 486 608 Other (1) — — 8,774 — Adjusted EBITDA $ (21,219 ) $ (12,026 ) $ (67,033 ) $ (88,692 ) Net revenue $ 1,439,016 $ 984,559 $ 4,720,895 $ 3,380,360 Adjusted EBITDA Margin (1.5 )% (1.2 )% (1.4 )% (2.6 )% (1) We recorded $9.6 million of one-time charges in the year ended December 31, 2017 in \"Selling, operations, technology, general and administrative\" in the consolidated and condensed statements of operations related to a warehouse we vacated in July 2017.
