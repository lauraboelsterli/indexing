We expect the new 6.6250% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 to lower our cash interest expense by $3,562,500 per annum; Provision for income taxes was reduced by $436,000 or $0.10 per diluted share resulting from the revaluation of its deferred tax liabilities resulting from the effects of tax reform; Net income was $ 2,263,000, as compared to $6,756,000 for the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016; and Earnings per diluted share was $0.54 per share, as compared to $1.61 per share for the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016.\nThe Company reported the following:\nLicense royalties increased to $17,393,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017, as compared to $15,602,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016. During the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017, total royalties earned under the John Morrell & Co., agreement from the sale of hot dogs, increased 11.5% to $15,853,000, as compared to $14,214,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016. In the Branded Product Program, featuring the sale of Nathan's hot dogs to the foodservice industry, sales increased by 14.4% to $50,741,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017, as compared to sales of $44,349,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016. During the period, the volume of hot dogs sold increased 10.9% and our average selling price increased by approximately 3.2%. Income from operations from the Branded Product Program declined by approximately $448,000 for the fiscal 2018 period as compared to the fiscal 2017 period, as a result of a significant increase in the cost of beef during May, June and July 2017. During this three month period, income from operations from the Branded Products Program declined by $1,343,000 as a direct result of the increase in the cost of beef, while income from operations increased by $895,000 during the remainder of the fiscal period. Sales from Company-operated restaurants were $12,898,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017, compared to $13,449,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016. Sales were impacted by unfavorable weather conditions during the fiscal 2018 period, especially at our two locations in Coney Island that depend on beach traffic. Revenues from franchise operations were $3,575,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017, compared to $3,752,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016. Total royalties were $3,293,000 in the fiscal 2018 period as compared to $3,386,000 in the fiscal 2017 period. Total franchise fee income was $282,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017 compared to $366,000 during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 25, 2016. Thirty-five new franchised outlets opened during the thirty-nine weeks ended December 24, 2017, including 13 international locations, and 17 Branded Menu Program outlets. Nathan's recognized excess tax benefits of $194,000 and $659,000 during the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 periods, respectively, as a result of the tax benefits associated with stock compensation. The impact of the tax benefits reduced Nathan's tax rate by 6.7% and 6.1%, respectively, and increased earnings per diluted share by $0.05 and $0.16, during the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 periods, respectively. On November 1, 2017, Nathan's issued $150.0 million 6.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 to fund the November 16, 2017 redemption of its $135.0 million 10.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2020. Nathan's incurred a loss on debt extinguishment associated with the refinancing of $8,872,000. The Company also incurred additional interest expense of approximately $562,500 from the time the 2025 Notes closed until the time the 2020 Notes were redeemed. The Company expects to reduce its future cash annual interest expense by $3,562,500 per annum. On November 1, 2017, the Board of Directors declared the $5.00 per share special cash dividend that was paid on January 4, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 22, 2017.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information:\nIn addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"), the Company has provided EBITDA excluding (i) interest expense; (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. The Company has also provided Adjusted EBITDA excluding (i) loss on debt extinguishment and (ii) stock-based compensation that the Company believes will impact the comparability of its results of operations.\nThe Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors to assist in assessing and understanding the Company's operating performance and underlying trends in the Company's business because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are (i) among the measures used by management in evaluating performance and (ii) are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under US GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity in conformity with US GAAP. Additionally, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other companies. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-US GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with US GAAP.\nAbout Nathan's Famous\nNathan's is a Russell 2000 Company that currently distributes its products in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and thirteen foreign countries through its restaurant system, foodservice sales programs and product licensing activities.
