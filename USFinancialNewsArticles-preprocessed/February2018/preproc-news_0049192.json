    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unravel Data , the industry's only Application Performance Management (APM) platform designed for Big Data, today announced it has hired a Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations. Luke Roquet joins Unravel from Hortonworks, where he served as a Regional Vice President of Sales. Roquet will draw on years of industry experience to help enterprises bolster their Big Data deployments by leveraging APM to reduce complexity and making it easier for organizations to benefit from the technology.\nLuke Roquet, VP of Worldwide Field Operations, Unravel Data\n“My experience at Hortonworks has made one thing clear: Big Data is disruptive and transformational. The new business opportunities are endless. However, organizations are in need of significant help in simplifying ongoing management of applications and systems in order to accelerate their time to market,” said Luke Roquet, VP of Worldwide Field Operations, Unravel Data. “Unravel is unique in their use of APM to solve this problem. I was struck by how simple yet strong their platform is and how quickly value can be realized. Unravel solves the majority of the challenges I’ve been seeing firsthand the past five years with organizations struggling to run applications effectively to unlock and realize the promised value of Big Data.”\nRoquet will help Unravel expand its reach across the globe. The company’s current customers include healthcare providers such as Kaiser Permanente, some of the world’s largest financial institutions, and data-driven technology companies such as Autodesk, YP.com and Leidos. He will build that momentum with a focus on expanding go-to market efforts in North America as well as increasing the company’s emphasis in Europe.\n“Menlo Ventures has seen the potential in Unravel from the beginning, and we’ve witnessed the opportunity for APM for Big Data grow tremendously since the company’s launch,” said Venky Ganesan, Managing Director, Menlo Ventures. “The landscape has changed rapidly over the past couple years, and major organizations are investing heavily in Big Data. But they need a platform like Unravel to see the returns that they expect from those investments. The addition of Luke as head of sales will enable Unravel to accelerate distribution of its technology to a larger market.”\n“We’re thrilled to bring Luke on board. Coming from a blue chip Big Data company, he is intimately familiar with the complexity that enterprises in this area face,” said Kunal Agarwal, CEO, Unravel Data. “At Unravel, our goal is to help organizations bridge the Big Data skills gap so they can benefit from Big Data’s insights without having to bring in a team of experts to do it all for them. Luke has been helping customers realize the potential of Big Data for years, so he’s a natural fit for us.”\nUnravel recently announced $15 million in Series B funding, bringing their total funding to $23 million.\nAbout Unravel Data\nUnravel Data provides the only Application Performance Management (APM) solution for Big Data.
