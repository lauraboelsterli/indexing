    "text": "MEDFORD, N.Y., Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chembio Diagnostics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CEMI) (“Chembio”), a leader in point-of-care diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, announced today the pricing of its previously announced underwritten registered public offering of 1,783,760 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $6.75 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million. The net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before estimated expenses of the offering payable by Chembio, are expected to be approximately $11.2 million. All shares of common stock to be sold in the offering will be offered by Chembio. The offering is expected to close on or about February 13, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nChembio intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for business expansion and working capital, including product development, operational expansion or improvements, such as new automated equipment and a facilities update, clinical trials and other related activities, and sales and marketing.\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering.\nChembio also announced that it is terminating the At-The-Market (ATM) offering that it announced on June 27, 2017. Chembio has not issued any shares pursuant to the ATM.\nA shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-210003) relating to the shares of common stock to be issued in the offering was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in 2016 and is effective. In addition to this shelf registration statement, a preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus relating to the offering were filed with the SEC on February 8, 2018 and are available on the SEC’s website located at www.sec.gov . Electronic copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus may be obtained by contacting Craig-Hallum Capital Group, 222 South Ninth Street, Suite 350, Minneapolis, MN 55402, by telephone at 612-334-6300 or by email at prospectus@chlm.com .
