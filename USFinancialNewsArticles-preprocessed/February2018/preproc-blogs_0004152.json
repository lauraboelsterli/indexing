    "text": "\nGoPro shares plummeted after the company reported quarterly results that missed analysts' expectations on Thursday. \nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Adjusted loss per share: 30 cents vs. 11 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $334.8 million vs. $340.1 million expected according to Thomson Reuters \nThat revenue figure came in below the $340 million the company forecast in early January when lowered its guidance. At the time, GoPro said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of about $340 million. \nOn Thursday, GoPro shares initially plunged as much as 11 percent in after-hours trade. The stock has since rebounded, but is still trading about 5 percent below its closing price. \nIn January, GoPro also announced it would layoff at least 250 employees and exit the drone market amid intense competition and a \"hostile regulatory environment.\" The company also said CEO Nick Woodman would reduce his cash compensation to $1 for 2018. \nSources told CNBC in January that GoPro had hired J.P. Morgan Chase to explore a potential sale . Woodman has said that while the company is planning on staying independent, GoPro would consider a sale or partnership with another company. \nOn Wednesday, GoPro unveiled a $4.99 monthly subscription service that would allow customers to replace cameras, \"no questions asked.\" The company said that the cost would be about 20 percent of the camera's original price. \nThe service includes unlimited photo storage, 35 hours of cloud video storage, 20 percent off GoPro accessories and premium support. GoPro said new customers will be offered a 30-day free trial of GoPro Plus, which the company plans to roll out more broadly later this year. \nâ€” CNBC's Todd Haselton, Alex Sherman and Sara Salinas contributed to this report. \nThis is breaking news.
