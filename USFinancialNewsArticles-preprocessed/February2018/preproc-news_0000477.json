    "text": "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Key results include:\nFor the fourth quarter, total revenues decreased 3 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016 to $5.8 billion. For the full year, total revenues decreased 1 percent to $22.8 billion. GAAP loss per share of $5.89 for the fourth quarter and GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.69 for the full year include a $6.1 billion charge related to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP EPS were flat in the fourth quarter at $2.89. Non-GAAP EPS increased 8 percent for the full year to $12.58, driven by higher operating margins and interest income and a lower share count. Free cash flow for the full year grew 9 percent to $10.5 billion, driven by higher operating income and favorable changes in working capital. At year end, cash and investments totaled $41.7 billion. The Company expects to increase investments to drive additional volume-driven growth of novel medicines in large patient populations. These plans include a new U.S. manufacturing plant. Cash returned to shareholders totaled $6.5 billion in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases. The Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $10 billion of share repurchases. This authorization is in addition to the existing $4.4 billion in share repurchase authorization as of Dec. 31, 2017. 2018 total revenues guidance of $21.8-$22.8 billion; EPS guidance of $11.18-$12.36 on a GAAP basis and $12.60-$13.70 on a non-GAAP basis.\n\"With strong volume-driven growth for our recently launched products and a promising new product pipeline, we are well positioned for future growth,\" said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer. \"We expect several developments to provide an additional boost for these products, most notably the recent inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data in the Repatha ® (evolocumab) prescribing information.\"\n$Millions, except EPS and percentages\nQ4'17\nQ4'16\nYOY Δ\nFY '17\nFY '16\nYOY Δ\nTotal Revenues\n$ 5,802\n$ 5,965\n(3%)\n$ 22,849\n$ 22,991\n(1%)\nGAAP Operating Income\n$ 2,245\n$ 2,485\n(10%)\n$ 9,973\n$ 9,794\n2%\nGAAP Net (Loss) Income\n$ (4,264)\n$ 1,935\n*\n$ 1,979\n$ 7,722\n(74%)\nGAAP (Loss) Earnings Per Share\n$ (5.89)\n$ 2.59\n*\n$ 2.69\n$ 10.24\n(74%)\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\n$ 2,555\n$ 2,859\n(11%)\n$ 11,658\n$ 11,446\n2%\nNon-GAAP Net Income\n$ 2,104\n$ 2,160\n(3%)\n$ 9,246\n$ 8,785\n5%\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$ 2.89\n$ 2.89\n0%\n$ 12.58\n$ 11.65\n8%\n* Change in excess of 100%\nReferences in this release to \"non-GAAP\" measures, measures presented \"on a non-GAAP basis\" and to \"free cash flow\" (computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow) refer to non-GAAP financial measures.

Cost of Sales margin was unfavorable by 0.2 percentage points in the fourth quarter driven primarily by expenses related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs, offset partially by lower amortization of intangible assets and royalties. For the full year, Cost of Sales margin improved 0.3 percentage points driven primarily by lower amortization of intangible assets, lower royalties and favorable manufacturing costs, offset partially by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs. Research & Development (R&D) expenses decreased 3 percent for the fourth quarter and 7 percent for the full year driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs and lower external business development expenses. Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter due to investments in product launches and marketed product support, offset partially by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments. For the full year, SG&A expenses decreased 4 percent due to the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments, offset partially by investments in product launches and marketed product support. Other expenses increased for the full year due primarily to net charges related to the Company's decision to discontinue internal development of AMG 899 in Q3 2017. Operating Margin decreased by 3.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 40.3 percent, and improved by 1.1 percentage points for the full year to 45.8 percent. Tax Rate increased in the fourth quarter and full year due to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.\nOn a non-GAAP basis:\nTotal Operating Expenses increased 5 percent in the fourth quarter and decreased 3 percent for the full year, with all expense categories reflecting savings from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Cost of Sales margin was unfavorable by 1.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter driven primarily by expenses related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs, offset partially by lower royalties. For the full year, Cost of Sales margin was unfavorable by 0.2 percentage points driven primarily by expenses related to Hurricane Maria, unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs, offset partially by lower royalties and favorable manufacturing costs. R&D expenses decreased 3 percent for the fourth quarter and 7 percent for the full year driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs and lower external business development expenses. SG&A expenses increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter due to investments in product launches and marketed product support, offset partially by the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments. For the full year, SG&A expenses decreased 2 percent due to the expiration of ENBREL residual royalty payments, offset partially by investments in product launches and marketed product support. Operating Margin decreased by 4.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 45.9 percent, and improved by 1.2 percentage points for the full year to 53.5 percent. Tax Rate for the fourth quarter decreased 2.1 percentage points due primarily to favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings. The full year tax rate decreased 0.8 percentage points driven by changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset partially by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments.\n$Millions, except percentages\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nQ4'17\nQ4'16\nYOY Δ\nQ4'17\nQ4'16\nYOY Δ\nCost of Sales\n$1,059\n$1,067\n(1%)\n$816\n$753\n8%\n% of product sales\n19.0%\n18.8%\n0.2 pts.\n14.7%\n13.3%\n1.4 pts.\nResearch & Development\n$1,043\n$1,078\n(3%)\n$1,025\n$1,056\n(3%)\n% of product sales\n18.7%\n19.0%\n(0.3) pts.\n18.4%\n18.6%\n(0.2) pts.\nSelling, General & Administrative\n$1,427\n$1,323\n8%\n$1,406\n$1,297\n8%\n% of product sales\n25.6%\n23.4%\n2.2 pts.\n25.2%\n22.9%\n2.3 pts.\nOther\n$28\n$12\n*\n$0\n$0\nNM\nTOTAL Operating Expenses\n$3,557\n$3,480\n2%\n$3,247\n$3,106\n5%\nOperating Margin\noperating income as a % of product sales\n40.3%\n43.9%\n(3.6) pts.\n45.9%\n50.5%\n(4.6) pts.\nTax Rate\n292.6%\n15.2%\n277.4 pts.\n16.6%\n18.7%\n(2.1) pts.\n* Change in excess of 100%\nNM: Not Meaningful\npts: percentage points\n$Millions, except percentages\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nFY'17\nFY'16\nYOY Δ\nFY'17\nFY'16\nYOY Δ\nCost of Sales\n$4,069\n$4,162\n(2%)\n$2,943\n$2,913\n1%\n% of product sales\n18.7%\n19.0%\n(0.3) pts.\n13.5%\n13.3%\n0.2 pts.\nResearch & Development\n$3,562\n$3,840\n(7%)\n$3,482\n$3,755\n(7%)\n% of product sales\n16.3%\n17.5%\n(1.2) pts.\n16.0%\n17.2%\n(1.2) pts.\nSelling, General & Administrative\n$4,870\n$5,062\n(4%)\n$4,766\n$4,877\n(2%)\n% of product sales\n22.3%\n23.1%\n(0.8) pts.\n21.9%\n22.3%\n(0.4) pts.\nOther\n$375\n$133\n*\n$0\n$0\nNM\nTOTAL Operating Expenses\n$12,876\n$13,197\n(2%)\n$11,191\n$11,545\n(3%)\nOperating Margin\noperating income as a % of product sales\n45.8%\n44.7%\n1.1 pts.\n53.5%\n52.3%\n1.2 pts.\nTax Rate\n79.4%\n15.7%\n63.7 pts.\n18.0%\n18.8%\n(0.8) pts.\n* Change in excess of 100%\nNM: Not Meaningful\npts: percentage points\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nThe Company generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company generated $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the full year versus $9.6 billion in 2016 driven by higher operating income and favorable changes in working capital. The Company's first quarter 2018 dividend of $1.32 per share declared on Dec. 12, 2017, will be paid on March 8, 2018, to all stockholders of record as of Feb. 15, 2018. This represents a 15 percent increase from that paid in each of the previous four quarters. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $0.8 billion. For the full year, the Company repurchased 18.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $3.1 billion. In January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional $10 billion of share repurchases. This authorization is in addition to the existing $4.4 billion in share repurchase authorization as of Dec. 31, 2017.\n$Billions, except shares\nQ4'17\nQ4'16\nYOY Δ\nFY'17\nFY'16\nYOY Δ\nOperating Cash Flow\n$3.0\n$3.1\n($0.1)\n$11.2\n$10.4\n$0.8\nCapital Expenditures\n0.2\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.7\n0.7\n(0.1)\nFree Cash Flow\n2.9\n2.9\n0.0\n10.5\n9.6\n0.9\nDividends Paid\n0.8\n0.7\n0.1\n3.4\n3.0\n0.4\nShare Repurchase\n0.8\n1.0\n(0.2)\n3.1\n3.0\n0.1\nAvg.

This investment includes committing up to $300 million to build a new manufacturing plant in the U.S. The new facility will employ Amgen's proven next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities, and manufacture products for the U.S. and export markets. Next-generation biomanufacturing requires less time and capital investment to build than a traditional biomanufacturing plant and is less costly to operate, with less environmental impact. The construction and validation work is expected to add 220 jobs to the local economy. In addition, Amgen expects this new facility to employ up to 300 highly skilled full-time employees. Amgen expects to finalize the exact location in the second quarter. The Company is also increasing the size of the Amgen Ventures fund, providing up to $300 million of growth capital for early-stage, innovative biotechnology companies in the U.S.\n2018 Guidance\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects:\nTotal revenues in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. On a GAAP basis, EPS in the range of $11.18 to $12.36 and a tax rate in the range of 13 percent to 14 percent. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS in the range of $12.60 to $13.70 and a tax rate in the range of 14 percent to 15 percent. Capital expenditures to be approximately $750 million.\nFourth Quarter Product and Pipeline Update\nKey development milestones:\nClinical Program\nIndication\nProjected Milestone\nKYPROLIS\nRelapsed or refractory multiple myeloma\nEU regulatory review (ENDEAVOR OS data)\nRegulatory reviews (ASPIRE OS data)\nBLINCYTO\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia\nEU regulatory review (TOWER OS data)\nRegulatory reviews (MRD-positive)\nXGEVA\nPrevention of SREs in multiple myeloma\nEU regulatory review\nProlia\nGlucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis\nU.S. regulatory review\nEVENITY™(romosozumab)\nPostmenopausal osteoporosis\nU.S. regulatory resubmission\nEU regulatory review\nAimovig™ (erenumab)\nMigraine prevention\nU.S. regulatory review\nABP 710\n(biosimilar infliximab)\nOncology\nPhase 3 data\nABP 980\n(biosimilar trastuzumab)\nOncology\nRegulatory reviews\nOS = overall survival; MRD = minimal residual disease; SRE = skeletal-related event\nThe Company provided the following updates on selected product and pipeline programs:\nRepatha\nRepatha is the first and only PCSK9 inhibitor approved to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to include data from the Phase 3 Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study in the prescribing information (PI).

In addition, management has presented its full year 2018 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and other impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform, from the related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarters and full years of 2017 and 2016. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company's ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company's liquidity.\nThe Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Amgen\nAmgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed , including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.\nAmgen Inc.\nConsolidated

amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the adjustment also included a $73 million charge resulting from the reacquisition of Prolia ® , XGEVA ® and Vectibix ® license agreements in certain markets from Glaxo Group Limited.\n(c)\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustments related primarily to severance expenses associated with our restructuring initiative. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the adjustments related primarily to asset-related charges associated with our site closures.\n(d)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment included net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899.\n(e)\nThe tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, were 31.6% and 31.9%, respectively, compared with 30.2% and 31.8% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.\n(f)\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustments related primarily to the impact of U.S. Corporate tax reform, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the adjustments related to certain acquisition items and prior period items excluded from GAAP earnings.\n(g)\nDuring periods of net loss, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share as the anti-dilutive effect of potential common shares is disregarded.\nAmgen Inc.\nReconciliations of Cash Flows\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 3,012\n$ 3,100\n$ 11,177\n$ 10,354\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(78)\n(1,222)\n(4,024)\n(8,658)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(2,134)\n(2,122)\n(6,594)\n(2,599)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n800\n(244)\n559\n(903)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n3,000\n3,485\n3,241\n4,144\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$ 3,800\n$ 3,241\n$ 3,800\n$ 3,241\nThree months ended\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 3,012\n$ 3,100\n$ 11,177\n$ 10,354\nCapital expenditures\n(153)\n(227)\n(664)\n(738)\nFree cash flow\n$ 2,859\n$ 2,873\n$ 10,513\n$ 9,616\nReconciliation of GAAP EPS Guidance to Non-GAAP\nEPS Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nGAAP diluted EPS guidance\n$ 11.18\n-\n$ 12.36\nKnown adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP*:\nAcquisition-related expenses\n(a)\n1.31\nRestructuring charges\n0.03\n-\n0.11\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS guidance\n$ 12.60\n-\n$ 13.70\n*\nThe known adjustments are presented net of their related tax impact which amount to approximately $0.40 per share, in the aggregate\n(a)\nThe adjustments relate primarily to non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations\nOur GAAP diluted EPS guidance does not include the effect of non-GAAP adjustments triggered by events that may occur subsequent to this press release such as acquisitions, asset impairments, litigation and changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration\nReconciliation of GAAP Tax Rate Guidance to Non-GAAP\nTax Rate Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\n2018\nGAAP tax rate guidance\n13.0%\n-\n14.0%\nTax rate effect of known adjustments discussed above\n1.0%\nNon-GAAP tax rate guidance\n14.0%\n-\n15.0%\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\nTrish Hawkins, 805-447-5631 (media)\nArvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amgen-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300592305.html\nSOURCE Amgen",
