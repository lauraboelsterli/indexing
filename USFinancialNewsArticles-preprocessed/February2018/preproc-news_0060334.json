Ocwen generated Revenue of $1.2 billion and Cash Flows from Operating Activities of $412 million for the full year of 2017, and ended the year with $260 million of cash.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Ocwen reported a net loss of $(45.3) million, or $(0.34) per share.\n“2017 was another challenging year for Ocwen and our industry. However, we continued to make progress on a number of fronts, reducing our year over year loss by $70.9 million and helping over 45,000 struggling families retain their home through affordable loan modifications. We are also in an improved cash and liquidity position following the closing of our amended agreements with New Residential Investment Corp. in January 2018,” commented Ron Faris, President and CEO of Ocwen. Mr. Faris continued, “Our servicing business continued to perform well despite the challenges posed by continued portfolio runoff and posted its sixth consecutive quarter of pre-tax income.\"\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results\nPre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $(45.3) million. Pre-tax results for the quarter were impacted by a number of significant items, the largest of which was $(49.8) million in litigation and regulatory settlement-related expenses. Excluding these settlement-related expenses and other adjusting items that largely offset, the Company had an adjusted pre-tax income of $4.0 million.\nThe Servicing business segment recorded $28.6 million of pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year 2017, the Servicing business recorded $46.7 million of pre-tax income, an increase of $43.3 million over 2016.\nThe Lending segment recorded $2.6 million of pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2017, a $10.2 million improvement over the prior quarter, driven by $(6.8) million in restructuring costs in the prior quarter and higher gains in the reverse lending business as a result of increased origination volume and improved margins. For the full year 2017, the Lending business recorded a pre-tax loss of $(4.4) million, a decrease of $4.6 million versus 2016. The 2017 loss in Lending was driven by our Forward Lending business, which had a pre-tax loss of $(28.4) million inclusive of the restructuring costs, which was partially offset by $24.0 million of pre-tax income in our Reverse Lending business.\nAdditional Business Highlights\nIn 2017, Ocwen completed 45,682 loan modifications with HAMP modifications accounting for 27.9% of the total. Note that the HAMP program ended on December 31, 2016, but modifications in process at that time were permitted to close after the deadline. Delinquencies decreased from 9.4% at September 30, 2017 to 9.3% at December 31, 2017, primarily driven by ongoing consumer assistance efforts. The constant pre-payment rate (“CPR”) marginally decreased from 14.7% in the third quarter of 2017 to 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the prime CPR was 17.3%, and the non-prime CPR was 12.7%. For the full year 2017, Ocwen originated forward and reverse mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance (UPB) of $2.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. The decrease in forward mortgage originations compared to prior year was driven by our decision to exit the unprofitable Correspondent and Wholesale businesses. Our reverse mortgage portfolio ended the year with an estimated $101.5 million in undiscounted future gains from future draws on existing loans. Neither the anticipated future gains nor future funding liability are included in the Company’s financial statements. We announced the exit of our Automotive Capital Services business in January 2018 and the exit is expected to be completed during the first half of 2018.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nOcwen will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 as well as other recent events.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to discussions and analysis of our financial condition. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide an alternative way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructive. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, Ocwen's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Other companies may use non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar titles that are calculated differently to our non-GAAP financial measures. As a result, comparability may be limited. For a full reconciliation of adjusted pre-tax income to GAAP pre-tax income, please see slides 33 and 38 of the Company’s 2017 earnings presentation, which may be found in the “Shareholder Relations” section of the Company’s website at www.Ocwen.com .\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nInvestors: Media: Stephen Swett John Lovallo Dan Rene T: (203) 614-0141 T: (917) 612-8419 T: (202) 973-1325 E: shareholderrelations@ocwen.com E: jlovallo@levick.com E: drene@levick.com\nResidential Servicing Statistics\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAt or for the Three Months Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 June 30, 2017 March 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Total unpaid principal balance of loans and REO serviced $ 179,352,554 $ 187,468,318 $ 194,798,424 $ 202,369,014 $ 209,092,130 Non-performing loans and REO serviced as a % of total UPB (1) 9.3 % 9.4 % 9.6 % 10.7 % 11.2 % Prepayment speed (average CPR) (2) (3) 14.4 % 14.7 % 15.0 % 14.0 % 15.1 % (1) Performing loans include those loans that are less than 90 days past due and those loans for which borrowers are making scheduled payments under loan modification, forbearance or bankruptcy plans.
