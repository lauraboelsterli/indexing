    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission cleared on Monday a 70-million-euro ($86.4 million) scheme in Germany to support electric buses and charging infrastructure, saying it was in line with EU state-aid rules.\nThe scheme, which will run until the end of 2021, will help public transport operators by covering the additional costs for electric and hybrid buses and installing the necessary charging infrastructure.\n“The Commission concluded that the contribution to EU environmental goals of the scheme outweighs any potential distortion of competition brought about by the public financing,” the EU’s competition regulator said in a statement.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ",
