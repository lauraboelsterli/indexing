    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:UEPS) (JSE:NT1) today released results for the second quarter fiscal 2018.\nQ2 2018 Revenue of $148 million, 2% lower in USD;\nQ2 2018 FEPS of $0.39, including a $0.02 adverse impact for provisioning for South African loan book expansion;\nInternational revenue from Masterpayment and Transact24, grew 37% in USD compared to Q2 2017.\nSummary Financial Metrics\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 2016 % change\nin USD % change\nin ZAR (All figures in USD ‘000s except per share data) Revenue 148,416 151,433 (2%) (4%) GAAP net income 9,622 18,641 (48%) (49%) Fundamental net income (1) 22,405 22,648 (1%) (4%) GAAP earnings per share ($) 0.17 0.35 (52%) (53%) Fundamental earnings per share ($) (1) 0.39 0.43 (9%) (11%) Fully-diluted shares outstanding (‘000’s) 56,807 52,643 8% Average period USD/ ZAR exchange rate 13.67 13.94 (2%) Six months ended December 31, 2017 2016 % change\nin USD % change\nin ZAR (All figures in USD ‘000s except per share data) Revenue 300,974 307,066 (2%) (6%) GAAP net income 29,105 43,273 (33%) (36%) Fundamental net income (1) 46,875 48,392 (3%) (8%) GAAP earnings per share ($) 0.51 0.81 (37%) (40%) Fundamental earnings per share ($) (1) 0.83 0.91 (9%) (14%) Fully-diluted shares outstanding (‘000’s) 56,812 53,282 7% Average period USD/ ZAR exchange rate 13.41 14.03 (4%)\n(1) Fundamental net income and earnings per share are non-GAAP measures and are described below under “Use of Non-GAAP Measures—Fundamental net income and fundamental earnings per share.” See Attachment B for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to fundamental net income and earnings per share.\nFactors impacting comparability of our Q2 2018 and Q2 2017 results\nEarnings and FEPS dilution impact from issue of additional shares of common stock: Our Q2 2018 fundamental earnings per share was impacted by the issuance of five million shares of our common stock in February 2017; Favorable impact from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against South African Rand: The U.S. dollar depreciated by 2% against the ZAR and 6% against the KRW during Q2 2018, which positively impacted our reported results; Growth in insurance and lending businesses: Volume growth and operating efficiencies in our insurance and lending businesses during Q2 2018 resulted in an improved contribution to our financial inclusion revenue and operating income. The significant growth in our South African lending book during December 2017 resulted in a substantial increase in the allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable, in accordance with our policy of providing for doubtful finance loans receivable at the time that a loan is originated; Ongoing contributions from EasyPay Everywhere: EPE revenue and operating income growth was driven primarily by ongoing EPE adoption as we further expanded our customer base utilizing our ATM infrastructure; Higher revenue from Masterpayment and new cryptocurrency processing customer: Masterpayment contributed higher revenues as a result of an increase in processing activities, particularly related to its cryptocurrency processing for Bitstamp launched in December 2017, as well as from its working capital financing and supply chain solutions; Winding down of Mastertrading business and $7.8 million allowance for credit losses: We have determined to exit Masterpayment’s Mastertrading business following a re-evaluation of its operating performance and ongoing viability. During Q2 2018, we recorded an allowance for credit losses related to doubtful working capital finance receivables of $7.8 million. A valuation allowance has been provided for any potential tax benefit from this event as it is unlikely that this amount would be utilized for taxation purposes; Regulatory changes in South Korea pertaining to fees on card transactions: The regulations governing the fees that may be charged on card transactions have adversely impacted our revenues and operating income in South Korea; Lower net interest income resulting from investments in Cell C, DNI and Bank Frick: Interest income was $1.8 million lower as a result of cash utilized to purchase minority stakes in Cell C, DNI and Bank Frick, while interest expense increased due to the South African lending facility we obtained in August 2017 to partially fund our 15% investment in Cell C; and Lower prepaid sales and ad hoc terminal sales: The number of transacting users purchasing prepaid products through our mobile channel decreased due to security features introduced in fiscal 2017. In addition, we had fewer ad hoc terminal sales.\n“There have been a number of exciting developments at Net1 over the past few months. The establishment of a blockchain department at Bank Frick accelerates our ability to reposition our core UEPS solution at the forefront of offline and biometric blockchain technology. Meanwhile our financial inclusion initiatives in South Africa are starting to bear fruit with an acceleration of our EPE offering, continuing realization of certain synergies with Cell C and DNI, and the beta development of our new mobile banking product,” said Herman Kotzé, CEO of Net1. “We achieved all this despite considerable time and effort spent on restructuring of the group, closure of certain business lines, and addressing some of the challenges in South Africa,” he added.\n“To reiterate from last quarter, we expect the funding of our Cell C and DNI investments to be dilutive to our fiscal 2018 fundamental earnings, partially offset by DNI’s equity-accounted earnings, but to be accretive on a combined basis from fiscal 2019. We therefore anticipate our fundamental earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to remain at least $1.61. Our guidance assumes no significant disruption in any of our key business units, a constant currency base of ZAR 13.62/$1, a share count of 56.6 million shares, and a tax rate of between 34%-36%. For clarity, our guidance as always is on a constant currency basis and does not reflect the recent strengthening of the South African rand,” he concluded.\nMastertrading - Exit from Working Capital Financing and Supply Chain Solutions Business\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we re-evaluated the operating performance and ongoing viability of Masterpayment’s working capital financing and supply chain solutions offering and have determined to exit this portion of its business. While we believe we could scale this offering in the medium to long-term by focusing on customers and industries outside our initial target market, this standalone offering does not fit the International Payments Group strategy of providing payment solutions and working capital to small and medium-sized merchants. In order to focus on our stated international strategy, we have decided to wind-down the traditional working capital finance book issued to non-payment solutions customers. The working capital finance book comprises European and U.S. component of $35.8 million and $7.8 million; respectively. In January 2018, we entered into an arrangement with Bank Frick under which it purchased the European book from us at face value. We have created an allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable of $7.8 million related to the U.S. book as repayments have not been received as scheduled and we have not yet been able to negotiate a reasonable settlement plan with them.\nSupplemental Presentation for Q2 2018 Results\nA supplemental presentation for Q2 2018 will be posted to the Investor Relations page of our website – ir.net1.com one hour prior to our earnings call on Friday, February 9, 2018.\nResults of Operations by Segment and Liquidity\nOur operating metrics will be updated and posted on our website ( www.net1.com ).\nSouth African transaction processing\nSegment revenue was $64.1 million in Q2 2018, up 7% compared with Q2 2017 in USD, and 5% higher on a constant currency basis. The increase in segment revenue was primarily due to higher EPE transaction revenue as a result of increased usage of our ATMs, increased inter-segment transaction processing activities and a modest increase in the number of social welfare grants distributed. Operating income and margin decreased primarily due to an increase in inter-segment charges, the impact of annual salary increases granted to our South African employees in October 2017 and increases in goods and services purchased from third parties. These decreases were partially offset by the aforementioned increases in segment revenue. Our operating income margin for Q2 2018 and 2017 was 21% and 26%, respectively.\nInternational transaction processing\nSegment revenue of $44.2 million was slightly higher during Q2 2018 compared with Q2 2017, primarily due to ongoing impact of regulatory changes in South Korea on KSNET’s revenue, largely offset by increased contributions from Masterpayment. Operating income and margin during Q2 2018 was lower due to an allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivable of $7.8 million, a decrease in revenue at KSNET and losses incurred by all other major contributors to the segment.\nOperating income and margin for Q2 2017 was positively impacted by a refund of approximately $0.8 million that had been paid several years ago in connection with industry-wide litigation that has now been finalized. Operating (loss) income margin for Q2 2018 and 2017 was (11%) and 9%, respectively. Excluding the Mastertrading allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables, segment operating income and margin were $2.8 million and 6% respectively.\nFinancial inclusion and applied technologies\nSegment revenue was $54.1 million in Q2 2018, down 9% compared with Q2 2017 in USD and down 10% on a constant currency basis. Financial inclusion and applied technologies revenue decreased primarily due to fewer prepaid airtime and other value added services sales, as well as lower ad hoc terminal sales, partially offset by increased volumes in our insurance businesses, and an increase in inter-segment revenues. Operating income was also impacted by these factors as well as an increase in the allowance for doubtful finance loans receivable resulting from a commensurate increase in our lending book in the last lending cycle of calendar 2017.\nOperating income margin for the Financial inclusion and applied technologies segment was 24% during each of Q2 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was impacted by fewer low margin prepaid product sales, improved revenues from our insurance businesses and an increase in inter-segment revenues, offset by fewer ad hoc terminal and annual salary increases granted to our South African employees and the increase in the allowance for credit losses.\nCorporate/eliminations\nOur corporate expenses have decreased primarily due to lower transaction-related expenditures, a $0.5 million gain related to the sale of XeoHealth, and lower executive compensation, which was partially offset by a modest increases in U.S. dollar denominated goods and services purchased from third parties and directors’ fees.\nCash flow and liquidity\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $64.9 million and comprised mainly KRW-denominated balances of KRW 28.1 billion ($24.4 million), ZAR-denominated balances of ZAR 272.0 million ($22.0 million), U.S. dollar-denominated balances of $11.4 million, and other currency deposits, primarily euros, of $7.1 million, all amounts translated at exchange rates applicable as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in our cash balances from June 30, 2017, was primarily due to our investments in DNI, Bank Frick, Cell C and a $9 million listed note, scheduled repayments of our South African long-term debt, unscheduled repayment of Korean debt in full, growth in our South African lending book, and capital expenditures, which was partially offset by cash generated by most of our core businesses.\nExcluding the impact of interest received, interest paid under our Korean and South Africa debt and taxes, the decrease in operating cash flow relates primarily to the expansion of our South African lending book and weaker trading activity during fiscal 2018 compared to 2017, offset partially by the receipt of certain working capital loans outstanding. Capital expenditures for Q2 2018 and 2017 were $2.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and have decreased primarily due to the acquisition of fewer payment processing terminals in South Korea. We paid approximately $40.9 million for a 30% interest in Bank Frick and $9.0 million for a 7.625% interest in a listed note. Finally, we made an unscheduled $16.6 million repayment to settle our outstanding South Korean debt facility in full, made a scheduled South African debt facility payment of $14.3 million (ZAR 187.5 million) and repaid $11.4 million of our overdraft facilities.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nUS securities laws require that when we publish any non-GAAP measures, we disclose the reason for using the non-GAAP measure and provide reconciliation to the directly comparable GAAP measure. The presentation of fundamental net income and fundamental earnings per share and headline earnings per share are non-GAAP measures.\nFundamental net income and fundamental earnings per share\nFundamental net income and earnings per share is GAAP net income and earnings per share adjusted for (1) the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (net of deferred taxes), (2) stock-based compensation charges (reversals) and (3) unusual non-recurring items, including the amortization of South African and Korean debt facility fees and costs related to acquisitions and transactions consummated or ultimately not pursued. Fundamental net income and earnings per share for Q2 2018 also excluded non-recurring allowance for doubtful working capital finance receivables, the amortization of intangibles assets (net of deferred taxes) related to equity accounted investments, a gain realized on the sale of XeoHealth and the impact of changes in tax laws in the U.S. Management believes that the fundamental net income and earnings per share metric enhances its own evaluation, as well as an investor’s understanding, of our financial performance. Attachment B presents the reconciliation between GAAP and fundamental net income and earnings per share.\nWe provide earnings guidance only on a non-GAAP basis and do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking fundamental earnings per share guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material.\nHeadline earnings per share (“HEPS”)\nThe inclusion of HEPS in this press release is a requirement of our listing on the JSE. HEPS basic and diluted is calculated using net income which has been determined based on GAAP. Accordingly, this may differ to the headline earnings per share calculation of other companies listed on the JSE as these companies may report their financial results under a different financial reporting framework, including but not limited to, International Financial Reporting Standards.\nHEPS basic and diluted is calculated as GAAP net income adjusted for the (profit) loss on sale of property, plant and equipment. Attachment C presents the reconciliation between our net income used to calculate earnings per share basic and diluted and HEPS basic and diluted and the calculation of the denominator for headline diluted earnings per share.\nConference Call\nWe will host a conference call to review Q2 2018 results on February 9, 2018, at 8:00 Eastern Time.
