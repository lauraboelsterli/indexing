    "text": "The White House said Monday it is worried about the U.S. stock market sell-off.\n\"We're always concerned when the market loses any value, but we're also confident in the economy's fundamentals,\" an official said in a statement to CNBC.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 400 points Monday afternoon, and the S&P 500 traded more than 1 percent lower, extending last week's plunge.\nOn Air Force One in the afternoon, traveling with the president to Ohio, White House spokesman Raj Shah said \"markets do fluctuate. Short-term we all know that.\" He added the \"fundamentals of the economy are strong,\" referencing evidence of wage growth and unemployment numbers at their lowest in nearly two decades.\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the strong stock market performance since his election win and has yet to deal with a significant market pullback. The Dow is up more than 30 percent since the election.\nâ€” With reporting by CNBC's Eamon Javers .",
