J.

Stout, President and Chief Executive Officer of J. Alexander's, said: \"We appreciate the level of shareholder engagement that we experienced in connection with the proposed transaction. Approximately 90% of the outstanding shares were voted by our shareholders. In particular, we are grateful for the support we received, including from some of our largest shareholders. Further, the safeguards that our board put in place with respect to the transactions, and the requirement of the separate vote of the disinterested shareholders, served their intended purpose, allowing the disinterested shareholders to have the final decision.\"\nStout continued: “While we are disappointed that shareholders did not approve this transaction, we are confident in our overall strategy, our strong culture and our ability to deliver value to shareholders. Looking forward, we remain focused on growing our business, strengthening our competitive position and enhancing our current restaurant concepts.\n“We are also enthusiastic about executing on our organic growth strategies within our current concepts, including an additional J. Alexander’s restaurant that will open in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and a new Stoney River restaurant in Troy, Michigan, both of which will open later this year.”\nJ.
