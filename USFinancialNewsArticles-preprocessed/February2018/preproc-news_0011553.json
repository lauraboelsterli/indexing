    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) (\"Qualcomm\" or the \"Company\") today confirmed that it has received a revised, non-binding, unsolicited proposal from Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ: AVGO) to acquire all outstanding shares of Qualcomm for $60.00 per share in cash and $22.00 per share in Broadcom stock.\nConsistent with its fiduciary duties, the Qualcomm Board of Directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, will review the revised proposal to determine the course of action it believes is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Qualcomm will have no further comment on the proposal until its Board of Directors has completed its review.\nOn November 13, 2017, Qualcomm's Board of Directors unanimously rejected Broadcom's non-binding, unsolicited proposal to acquire Qualcomm for per share consideration of $60.00 in cash and $10.00 in Broadcom stock. After a comprehensive review, conducted in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Board concluded that Broadcom's proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and comes with significant regulatory uncertainty, and therefore is not in the best interests of Qualcomm stockholders.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Evercore and Centerview Partners are acting as financial advisors to Qualcomm. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) are acting as legal advisors to Qualcomm.\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.
