(NASDAQ: TWOU), a global leader in digital education, today announced it has hired Katie Race Brin as its new chief privacy officer (CPO). Brin most recently served as CPO for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\"Katie is one of the nation's most respected privacy professionals and I'm ecstatic to add such a highly-skilled, experienced executive to our rock star team at 2U,\" said 2U CEO and Co-Founder Christopher \"Chip\" Paucek. \"2U has always taken privacy seriously and Katie's expertise will only enhance our ability to navigate an increasingly complex and changing global privacy landscape.\"\n\"Implementing robust privacy and security safeguards is important for any organization but particularly for a company like 2U, where the trust of its partners and their students is paramount,\" said Brin. \"2U clearly places a priority on privacy and protecting personal information. I look forward to working with my new colleagues, and our university partners and other stakeholders, to ensure the company continues to uphold the highest privacy standards as laws and regulations evolve and its business grows internationally.\"\nAs CPO for the FTC, Brin reported to the Chairman and provided counsel to FTC senior leadership on a wide range of privacy-related issues. In that role, she managed the FTC's internal privacy program, which included overseeing agency compliance with federal privacy laws, as well as developing and ensuring adherence to internal policies and procedures that protect the privacy of agency information. Brin also served as the senior agency official for privacy and coordinated the FTC's Breach Notification Response Team.\nIn addition, Brin worked closely with the White House, and other senior federal privacy officials, as a member of the Executive Committee of the Federal Privacy Council, helping to formulate policies, guidance, and requirements regarding privacy and protection of personal information across the federal government.\nBefore becoming the FTC's CPO, Brin served as senior advisor to the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection on technology and policy issues. Prior to that, she spent seven years as an attorney in the FTC's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, bringing groundbreaking cases in the area of privacy and data security. She also worked in private practice at WilmerHale in Washington, D.C. and completed federal clerkships with Judge Thomas Platt in the Eastern District of New York and with Judge William Bassler in the District of New Jersey.\nBrin earned her B.A. with honors from the University of Michigan and a J.D. with a Certificate in Law and Technology from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law.\nAbout 2U, Inc.
