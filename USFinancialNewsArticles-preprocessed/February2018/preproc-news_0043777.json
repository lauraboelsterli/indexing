    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LSC Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LKSD) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n4Q 2017 Highlights:\nNet sales of $999 million compared to $919 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 GAAP net loss of $58 million, or $1.68 per diluted share compared to net income of $9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016 Non-GAAP net income of $17 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $15 million, or $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, or 8.5% of net sales, compared to $80 million, or 8.7% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities of $147 million compared to $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Non-GAAP free cash flow of $138 million compared to $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2016\n“We are very pleased with our free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, and despite continued challenging industry conditions, we delivered increases in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share,” said Thomas J. Quinlan III, LSC Communications’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “As we enter 2018, we are confident that LSC Communications is well positioned to further differentiate its industry-leading customer solutions and continue to deliver a solid balance sheet, strong cash flow and improved earnings.”\nNet Sales\nFourth quarter net sales were $999 million, up $80 million, or 8.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. After adjusting for acquisitions, changes in foreign exchange rates, and pass-through paper sales, organic net sales decreased 4.6% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The organic decrease in net sales was due to lower volume and price declines in the Print segment and price declines in the Office Products segment.\nGAAP Net Income\nFourth quarter 2017 net loss was $58 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected $24 million of one-time provisional tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will be further detailed in the 2017 Form 10-K, as well as the impact from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. The fourth quarter 2017 net loss included after tax charges of $75 million and fourth quarter 2016 net income included after- tax charges of $6 million, both of which are excluded from the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Additional details regarding the amount and nature of these adjustments and other items are included in the attached schedules.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $85 million, or 8.5% of net sales, compared to $80 million, or 8.7% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to on-going productivity and cost control initiatives, as well as the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by volume declines, product mix and price pressure in the Print segment and price pressure in the Office Products segment.\nNon-GAAP net income totaled $17 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to non-GAAP net income of $15 million, or $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income are presented in the attached schedules.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company provides the following full-year guidance for 2018:\nGuidance\nNet sales $3.8 to $3.9 billion Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (1) $320 to $360 million Depreciation and amortization $135 to $145 million Interest expense $72 to $76 million Non-GAAP effective tax rate 25% to 29% Capital expenditures $65 to $75 million Free cash flow (2) $120 to $160 million Diluted share count (3) Approximately 35 million (1) Consistent with historical guidance and presentation, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA includes net pension income. Beginning in 2018, Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07 requires companies to disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit cost from other components of net benefit cost and present the service cost component with other employee compensation costs. All other components of net benefit cost will need to be presented outside of income from operations. As a result, the Company expects to reclassify approximately $49 million, $46 million and $45 million of net pension income for years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, out of income from operations to a line item outside of income from operations, resulting in no impact to net income or non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. (2) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (3) This guidance assumes no shares are repurchased under the authorization available to the Company described below Certain components of the guidance given in the table above are provided on a non-GAAP basis only, without providing a reconciliation to guidance provided on a GAAP basis. Information is presented in this manner, consistent with SEC rules, because the preparation of such a reconciliation could not be accomplished without \"unreasonable efforts.\" The Company does not have access to certain information that would be necessary to provide such a reconciliation, including non-recurring items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, restructuring charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, acquisition-related expenses, gains or losses on investments and business disposals, losses on debt extinguishment and other similar gains or losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company does not believe that excluding such items is likely to be significant to an assessment of the Company's ongoing operations, given that such excluded items are not indicators of business performance.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\nOn February 15, 2018 the Company’s Board of Directors approved an initial share repurchase authorization of up to $20 million of common stock under which the Company may buy back LSC Communications’ shares at its discretion from February 15, 2018 through August 15, 2019. The Company expects to fund the repurchases, if any, from a combination of cash on hand, cash flow and borrowings under its credit facility. Shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions and/or in privately negotiated transactions at the company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The company may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases of common stock under this authorization at any time or periodically without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased will be held as treasury shares. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price and other conditions.\nConference Call\nLSC Communications will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its fourth-quarter results today, Thursday, February 22, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and free cash flow, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, provide useful information about the Company’s operating results and liquidity and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and free cash flow allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company’s core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and free cash flow, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company’s business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures, taxation positions or regimes, restructuring, impairment and other charges and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales, the Company believes that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income can provide useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. By adjusting for the level of capital investment in operations, the Company believes that free cash flow can provide useful additional basis for understanding the Company’s ability to generate cash after capital investment and provides a comparison to peers with differing capital intensity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may contain \" \" Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Given the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value in the impairment test performed as of September 30, 2017, combined with the fact that management’s assessment of the fair value did not materially change since that date, an additional charge of $18 million was recorded. This amount represents all of the goodwill arising from an acquisition made during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and additional amounts related to acquisitions completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2017. (b) The Company recorded charges of $8 million for the impairment of certain acquired indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets, including $3 million in the Office Products segment and $5 million in the book reporting unit, which is part of the Print segment. The impairment of the indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue to be derived from those tradenames. (c) The machinery and equipment net charges of $7 million were recorded in the Company’s magazines, catalogs and retail inserts reporting unit, which is included in the Print segment. The impairment was primarily due to volume declines. (d) For the three months ended December 31, 2017, employee-related termination costs resulted from three facility closures in the Print segment and other organizational changes. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, employee-related termination costs resulted from the expected closure of one facility in the first quarter of 2017 in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations. (e) For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, other restructuring charges included other facility closure costs. (f) Other charges related to the Company's multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations unrelated to facility closures. (2) Separation-related expenses: The three months ended December 31, 2016 included pre-tax charges of $4 million ($2 million after-tax) for one-time transaction costs associated with becoming a standalone company. (3) Acquisition-related expenses: The three months ended December 31, 2017 included pre-tax charges of $2 million ($1 million-after tax) for legal, accounting and other expenses associated with completed and contemplated acquisitions. (4) Purchase accounting adjustments: The three months ended December 31, 2017 included a pre-tax benefit of $2 million ($2 million after-tax benefit) as a result of purchase accounting inventory step-up adjustments and any gains associated with acquisitions. (5) Loss on debt extinguishment: The three months ended included pre-tax charges of $3 million ($2 million after-tax) for the recognition of a loss related to a partial debt extinguishment. (6) Income tax adjustments: The three months ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") that consisted of $16 million provisional expense for the one-time transition tax and a net provisional expense of $8 million for the remeasurement of deferred taxes associated with the reduced U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Note: The income tax impact is calculated using the tax rate in effect for the non-GAAP adjustments. LSC Communications, Inc.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed an additional acquisition that became part of the magazines, catalogs and retail inserts reporting unit. Given the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value in the impairment test performed as of September 30, 2017, combined with the fact that management’s assessment of the fair value did not materially change since that date, an additional charge of $18 million was recorded in the period ended December 31, 2017.

(d) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, employee-related termination costs resulted from four facility closures in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain business units. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, employee-related termination costs resulted from one facility closure in the Print segment, the expected closure of another facility in the first quarter of 2017 in the Print segment and the reorganization of certain operations. (e) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the charges primarily resulted from the exit from certain operations and facilities, as well as charges as a result of a terminated supplier contract. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, other restructuring charges included other facility closure costs. (f) Other charges related to the Company's multi-employer pension plan withdrawal obligations unrelated to facility closures. (2) Separation-related expenses: The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included pre-tax charges of $4 million ($3 million after-tax) for one-time transaction costs associated with becoming a standalone company, compared to pre-tax charges of $5 million ($3 million after-tax) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. (3) Acquisition-related expenses: The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included pre-tax charges of $5 million ($3 million-after tax) for legal, accounting and other expenses associated with completed and contemplated acquisitions. (4) Purchase accounting adjustments: The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included a pre-tax benefit of $1 million ($1 million after-tax benefit) as a result of purchase accounting inventory step-up adjustments and any gains associated with acquisitions. (5) Loss on debt extinguishment: The twelve months ended included pre-tax charges of $3 million ($2 million after-tax) for the recognition of a loss related to a partial debt extinguishment. (6) Income tax adjustments: The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included the impact of the Tax Act that consisted of $16 million provision expense for the one-time transition tax and a net provisional expense of $8 million for the remeasurement of deferred taxes associated with the reduced U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
