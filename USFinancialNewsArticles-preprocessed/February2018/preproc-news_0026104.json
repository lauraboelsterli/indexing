    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 5:41 AM / in 13 minutes Gunbattles, airstrikes in Sinai as Egyptian forces hit militants Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian security forces killed 12 Islamist militants in gun battles and arrested 92 suspects, while airstrikes destroyed dozens of militant targets in Sinai, the army said in a statement carried on state television on Monday. \nBased on army statements, around 28 militants have been killed since Friday in the latest offensive to crush insurgents blamed for a string of attacks. The latest statement said airstrikes had hit at least 60 militant targets. \nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is seeking re-election in March, ordered the armed forces in November to defeat militants within three months after an attack on a mosque killed more than 300 people, the deadliest such incident in the Arab worldâ€™s most populous country. \nThe insurgency poses the greatest challenge to the government in a country that is both the most populous in the Arab World and a main regional ally of the United States. \nSisi was elected for his first term in 2014 after the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following mass protests against his rule.
