Digital Marketing revenues 5 : revenues increased by +18% to €175 million in 2017 compared with 2016, thanks to an acceleration of the Group’s innovative offerings, including websites (Premium and Privilege websites) and AdWords (Booster Contact offering). Digital Marketing revenues 5 accounted for 23% of total revenues 5 in 2017.\nPrint & Voice revenues 5 , which amounted to €120 million in 2017 were down by -27% compared with 2016, as customers and users continued to migrate to digital offerings. This business accounted for 16% of total revenues 5 in 2017.\n5 Referring to continued activities\n6 Average Revenue Per Advertiser\n7 Average number of customers for the considered period who subscribed to an Internet product\nIncluding divested activities, the Group’s consolidated revenues amounted to €765 million, representing a decrease of -6% compared with 2016.\nRecurring net external expenses 8 amounted to -€192 million, and were down -7% in 2017 compared with 2016, which reflects cost reductions primarily attributable to communication expenses, reduced production costs of our Print & Voice activities and controlled commercial costs.\nRecurring personnel expenses 8 amounted to - €367 million , and increased by +1% in 2017 compared with 2016.\nIn millions of euros FY 2017 FY 2016 Change Internet recurring EBITDA 8 170 188 -9% EBITDA / revenue margin 27% 29% -3pts Print & Voice recurring EBITDA 8 26 43 -41% EBITDA / revenue margin 21% 27% -5pts Recurring EBITDA from continued activities 196 231 -15% EBITDA / revenue margin 26% 29% -3pts Contribution from non recurring items 8 (13) (5) +167% EBITDA from continued activities 183 226 -19% EBITDA / CA 24% 28% -4pts EBITDA from divested activities (3) (2) +26% Consolidated EBITDA 180 224 -20% EBITDA / CA 24% 28% -4pts Recurring EBITDA 8 amounted to €196 million in 2017, representing a decrease of -15% compared with 2016, as the decline in revenues (-6%) was partially offset by an expense reduction (-2%).\nThe recurring EBITDA 8 -to-revenue ratio 8 reached 26% in 2017, a decrease of -3 points compared with 2016.\nNon recurring items impacting EBITDA 8 amounted to -€13 million of euros and included -€8 million of euros of personnel expenses for non replaced departures and -€2 million of euros for the 2017 charge of the 2016 retention plan.\nIncluding non recurring items, EBITDA from continued activities amounted to €183 million of euros in 2017.\nWith the EBITDA from divested activities which amounted to -€3 million of euros, consolidated EBITDA amounts to €180 million of euros.\n8 Referring to continued activities\nII.

The 2017 interest expenses were only payable for the period between 15 March and 31 December 2017, in accordance with the terms negotiated in the financial restructuring.\nThe corporate income tax expenses 9 amounted to -€44 million in 2017, an increase of +1% compared with 2016, which is due to the increase in pre-tax income 9 .\nRecurring net income 9 amounted to €60 million in 2017, up +4% compared with 2016.\nGroup net income 9 amounted to €329 million in 2017 , an increase of €275 million, which was primarily due to the non-cash net gain from debt restructuring, as a result of the difference between the book value of the debt converted into equity instruments and the fair value of those instruments. Excluding the financial gain from debt restructuring (€266 million, i.e. €278 million net of tax), the income from the Group’s continued activities would be €51 million, or a decrease of -6%. Including divested activities, the Group’s consolidated net income was €336 million in 2017.\nNet financial debt 10 amounted to €332 million as of 31 December 2017, compared with €1,097 million as of 31 December 2016. Financial leverage 11 amounted to 4.7 x as of 31 December 2016 and to 1.7 x as of 31 December 2017. The financial restructuring carried out in the first quarter of 2017 enabled the Group to reduce its gross debt by two thirds and to strenghten its shareholders’ equity.\nThe Group’s free cash flow 9 was -€23 million in 2017, or a decrease of €57 million compared with 2016, mainly due to the €32 million of 2016 interest expenses paid in early 2017 and related to the debt prior to the financial restructuring, and a higher corporate tax income paid of €32 million. The latter is related to a tax adjustment of the R&D tax credit (“Crédit Impôt Recherche”) on prior years for €6 million and the reimbursement of a tax receivable of €16 million in 2016.\nIncluding the contribution from divested activities , the Group’s consolidated free cash flow amounted to -€26 million in 2017.\n9 Referring to continued activities\n10 Net financial debt corresponds to total financial debt minus net cash and cash equivalents\n11 Financial leverage calculated in accordance with the terms of the bond documentation\nThe Group had a net cash position of €86 million as of 31 December 2017 12 .\nIII.
