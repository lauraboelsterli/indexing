    "text": "GALVESTON, Texas, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American National Insurance Company (Nasdaq:ANAT) announced fourth quarter net income of $344.6 million or $12.78 per diluted share, a $284.8 million increase from net income for the same period of 2016 of $59.8 million or $2.22 per diluted share. The increase in fourth quarter net income includes a provisional $206.4 million benefit resulting from the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). This impact from Tax Reform is currently an estimate and may be adjusted, possibly materially, due to additional calculations and/or further tax guidance. Excluding the impact from Tax Reform, net income for the fourth quarter was $138.2 million, an increase of $78.4 million from the same period of 2016. Book value per diluted share increased to $194.61 at December 31, 2017 from $172.51 at December 31, 2016.\nExcluding the impact of Tax Reform, fourth quarter after-tax operating income, which excludes realized investment earnings, increased to $81.8 million or $3.03 per diluted share compared to $46.3 million or $1.72 per diluted share for the same period of 2016. Including the impact of Tax Reform, fourth quarter after-tax operating income was $288.2 million or $10.69 per diluted share. Earnings from Life and Property and Casualty segments increased significantly compared to the same period of 2016.\nAfter-tax realized investment earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $56.4 million or $2.09 per diluted share compared to $13.5 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the same period in 2016 due to sales of equity securities and certain real estate holdings in favorable market conditions. Realized investment earnings are comprised of realized investment gains, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and income (loss) from non-controlling interests.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $493.7 million, a $312.7 million increase from $181.0 million for 2016. Aside from the estimated $206.4 million benefit resulting from Tax Reform, income for 2017 benefitted from increased earnings in all insurance segments.\nExcluding the impact of Tax Reform, after-tax operating income for 2017, which excludes realized investment earnings, was $173.6 million or $6.43 per diluted share, an increase of $46.9 million from $126.7 million or $4.70 per diluted share from 2016. Including the impact of Tax Reform, after-tax operating income for 2017 was $380.0 million or $14.09 per diluted share.\nAfter-tax realized investment earnings for 2017 were $113.7 million or $4.22 per diluted share compared to $54.3 million or $2.01 per diluted share for 2016, primarily due to increased sales of equity securities and certain real estate holdings. Stockholders’ equity totaled $5.3 billion at December 31, 2017, a 12.8% increase from December 31, 2016.\n2017 Highlights:\n2017 net income increased $106.2 million, or 58.7% over the prior year period, excluding the provisional tax benefit Total 2017 premiums and other revenues, at $3.4 billion, increased $183.0 million, or 5.7%, over 2016 2017 after-tax operating income increased $46.9 million, or 37.0% over the prior year, excluding the provisional tax benefit Total life sales for 2017 increased $15.8 million, a 15.3% increase over 2016 Property & casualty net written premiums for 2017 increased by $131.1 million, or 10.2%, over prior year Total life insurance in force increased 7.8% over year-end 2016 to reach $103.1 billion at December 31, 2017\nAmerican National Insurance Company\nCOMPARATIVE OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nCompiled on a GAAP basis ( Preliminary & Unaudited )* Quarters Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues $ 924,360,000 $ 839,391,000 $ 3,411,000,000 $ 3,227,951,000 After-tax earnings: Operating income ** $ 288,161,000 $ 46,257,000 $ 379,983,000 $ 126,676,000 Realized investment earnings ** 56,422,000 13,516,000 113,668,000 54,327,000 Net income $ 344,583,000 $ 59,773,000 $ 493,651,000 $ 181,003,000 Per diluted share earnings: Operating income ** $ 10.69 $ 1.72 $ 14.09 $ 4.70 Realized investment earnings ** 2.09 0.50 4.22 2.01 Net income $ 12.78 $ 2.22 $ 18.31 $ 6.71 Weighted average number of diluted shares upon which computations are based 26,968,634 26,968,521 26,960,695 26,967,072 As of December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Book value per diluted share $ 194.61 $ 172.51 * Results are preliminary and unaudited.
