    "text": "EditorsNote: updates Davis’ rebound total in second graf\nAnthony Davis scored 53 points as the New Orleans Pelicans won their sixth consecutive game, defeating the Phoenix Suns 125-116 on Monday night in the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.\nDavis added 18 rebounds and five blocks as the Pelicans came back from a 17-point first-half deficit a day after overcoming an 18-point second-half deficit to win in overtime at Milwaukee.\nNew Orleans made 31 of 40 free throws, including 21 of 26 by Davis, as the Suns’ three tallest players -- Dragan Bender, Marquese Chriss and Alex Len -- all fouled out while trying to guard Davis. The Suns made 25 of 32 free throws.\nJrue Holiday added 20 points, Emeka Okafor scored 14 points and Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to score 10 for the Pelicans.\nDevin Booker led the Suns with 40 points. He added 10 rebounds and seven assists. TJ Warren scored 23, Josh Jackson had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Elfrid Payton scored 16.\nIt was the fifth time in the past seven games that Davis scored at least 38 points.\nThe Suns led by seven at halftime, but Davis and Holiday led a Pelicans charge to start the third quarter. Davis scored eight and Holiday scored seven during a 17-9 run that gave New Orleans its first lead since the opening minutes at 75-74.\nThe lead changed hands six times before two free throws by Okafor and a 3-pointer by Mirotic gave the Pelicans an 86-80 edge.\nThe home team took its biggest lead of the quarter at 91-82 on a 3-pointer by Ian Clark before taking a 96-89 lead after three quarters.\nPhoenix trimmed the deficit to six, but Davis scored seven points as New Orleans took a 105-95 lead.\nJackson scored six points as the Suns closed within 109-107, and they got within two three more times.\nDarius Miller was fouled while making a 3-pointer and missed the free throw, but the Pelicans got the offensive rebound and Holiday scored on a drive for a 121-114 lead with 1:48 left.\nBooker scored 14 points as the Suns shot 53.8 percent and took a 36-26 lead after one quarter.\nPhoenix extended its lead to 52-35 when Jackson made two free throws.\nDavis scored 11 points as the Pelicans finished with a 23-13 run to cut the Suns’ lead to 65-58 at halftime.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
