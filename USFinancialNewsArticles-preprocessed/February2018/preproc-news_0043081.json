    "text": "SUMMIT, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) today announced that the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\"HSR\") with respect to the previously announced tender offer by Celgene’s wholly owned subsidiary, Blue Magpie Corporation, for all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:JUNO) for $87.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less required withholding taxes, and subsequent merger of Blue Magpie with Juno, expired at 11:59 p.m. ET on February 20, 2018. The expiration of the HSR waiting period satisfies one of the conditions to the closing of the pending acquisition, which remains subject to other customary closing conditions. Celgene expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe tender offer is scheduled to expire at midnight ET on March 2, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated.\nAbout Celgene\nCelgene Corporation, headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the words \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"intends,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"will,\" \"outlook\" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current plans, estimates, assumptions and projections, and speak only as of the date they are made. Celgene undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events, except as otherwise required by law. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Company, including the following: (a) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (b) the inability to complete the transaction due to the failure to satisfy conditions to the transaction; (c) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations; (d) difficulties or unanticipated expenses in connection with integrating Juno into Celgene; (e) the risk that the acquisition does not perform as planned; and (f) potential difficulties in employee retention following the closing of the transaction. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of the impact of a number of factors, many of which are discussed in more detail in the public reports of the Company filed with the SEC.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221005656/en/\nInvestors:\n908-673-9628\ninvestors@celgene.com\nor\nMedia:\n908-673-2275\nmedia@celgene.com\nSource: Celgene Corporation",
