    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 5:58 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Dutch parliament recognises 1915 Armenian massacre as genocide Reuters Staff 1 Min Read THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch parliament on Thursday passed a motion recognising as genocide the massacre of as many as 1.5 million Armenians in 1915. The move, passed with the support of all major parties, risks further straining diplomatic relations between The Hague and Ankara, which have been tense since the Dutch barred a Turkish minister from campaigning in the Netherlands last year. Nearly a dozen other EU countries have passed similar resolutions. Turkey denies that the killings, which took place at the height of World War One, constitute genocide.
