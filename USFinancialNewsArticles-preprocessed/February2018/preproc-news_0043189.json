Luna is a classically trained and gifted filmmaker with a passion for esports,” said Whinston. “That combination of experience, skills, and passion allows us to work together as a team to push the boundaries of the content that an individual team can produce in esports, and to continue to raise the bar of what our fans can expect from Immortals and the Los Angeles Valiant.”\nJ.M.R. Luna is an experienced filmmaker with credits in directing, producing, cinematography, and screenwriting, and is an active member of the Producers Guild of America. In 2014, J.M.R. Luna produced and directed the motion picture, “Tell” staring Milo Ventimiglia and Jason Lee distributed by MGM/Orion in the United States and Netflix abroad. A lifelong gamer, J.M.R. Luna joined esports organization Evil Geniuses (formerly owned by Twitch.tv), where he led Evil Geniuses’ content and production team, creating and producing premium episodic content including, Life of a Genius.\n“J.M.R. Luna is a storyteller,” said Ari Segal. “When we thought about the gaps we want to fill in the esports content universe, we quickly zeroed in on using content to tell deep, meaningful stories about our players, teamwork, and the life and lifestyle of an esports player or organization. We needed a true storyteller to accomplish that goal, and that’s why we recruited and hired J.M.R. Luna.”\nJ.M.R. Luna added, “What most excited me about joining Immortals is that the management team and Board of Directors have taken all the necessary steps to assemble a talented group of people and pair that with an incredible vision to do something groundbreaking and bigger than anyone has done before in esports. I bought into this vision immediately, and knew I needed to be part of it.”\nAbout Immortals\nFounded in 2015 with unprecedented dedication to fan support and player well-being, Immortals, the Los Angeles based, North American esports organization, endeavors to create a long-lasting community of professional gamers, aspiring players, and passionate fans, all united by our commitment to camaraderie and competitive excellence.
