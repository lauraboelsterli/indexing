    "text": "Company gains alignment to proceed on Subpart H accelerated approval pathway for sparsentan in FSGS; Study start-up activities ongoing to initiate Phase 3 pivotal trial in second quarter of 2018\nClinical development of sparsentan in IgAN and CNSA-001 in PKU expected to initiate in 2018\nRevenue increased 16 percent to $155 million during 2017\nSAN DIEGO, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Retrophin, Inc. (NASDAQ:RTRX) today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and provided a corporate update.\nThe Company recently obtained regulatory feedback on its Phase 3 protocol for sparsentan in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS); the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has concurred that the Company’s protocol and statistical modeling support proceeding with the planned Phase 3 pivotal trial that is designed for a Subpart H accelerated approval pathway In January 2018, the Company entered into a joint development arrangement to evaluate CNSA-001 for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU); results from a planned Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in PKU are expected to be available in early 2019 Net product sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $42.2 million, compared to $37.3 million for the same period in 2016 Net product sales for the full year 2017 were $154.9 million, compared to $133.6 million for the same period in 2016 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as of December 31, 2017, totaled $300.6 million The Company expects full year 2018 net product sales to be in the range of $170.0 to $180.0 million\n“2017 was an important year of execution for Retrophin, marked by meaningful progress across our clinical development efforts, as well as continued strong commercial and operational performance,” said Stephen Aselage, chief executive officer of Retrophin. “We are also very pleased with our recent communications with the FDA regarding our sparsentan program for FSGS, for which we have reached alignment to pursue Subpart H accelerated approval with our planned Phase 3 trial. With four programs advancing in the clinic, 2018 is poised to be an exceptional year during which we expect to drive significant value for patients and shareholders alike.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet product sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $42.2 million, compared to $37.3 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, net product sales were $154.9 million, compared to $133.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in net product sales is attributable to growth across the Company’s commercial products: Chenodal ® , Cholbam ® and Thiola ® . The Company expects full year 2018 net product sales to be in the range of $170.0 to $180.0 million.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $19.6 million, compared to $20.1 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, R&D expenses were $78.2 million, compared to $70.8 million for the same period in 2016. The difference is largely attributable to support of non-clinical and clinical efforts related to fosmetpantotenate and sparsentan. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, R&D expenses were $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $17.6 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, non-GAAP adjusted R&D expenses were $68.9 million, compared to $60.0 million in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $26.7 million, compared to $26.2 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, SG&A expenses were $101.3 million, compared to $91.9 million for the same period in 2016. The difference is largely attributable to an increase in headcount as a result of the Company’s commercial and operational growth, as well as marketing initiatives to support its commercial portfolio. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $18.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $17.5 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, non-GAAP adjusted SG&A expenses were $65.9 million, compared to $57.5 million in 2016.\nTotal other income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.1 million, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, total other expense was $4.6 million, compared to other income of $0.6 million for the same period in 2016. The differences are largely attributable to adjustments in the fair value of derivative instruments due to changes in the Company’s stock price.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.6 million, or $0.45 per basic share, compared to $8.6 million, or $0.23 per basic share for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, net loss was $59.7 million, or $1.54 per basic share, compared to $47.9 million, or $1.29 per basic share, for the same period in 2016. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.9 million, or $0.07 per basic share, compared to $0.1 million, or $0.00 per basic share for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, non-GAAP net income was $10.2 million, or $0.26 per basic share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.12 per basic share, for the same period in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $300.6 million.\nProgram Updates\nFosmetpantotenate\nThe Company continues to enroll patients in the Phase 3 FORT Study, an international, registrational clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of fosmetpantotenate in approximately 82 patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) aged 6 to 65 years. The primary endpoint in the study is the change from baseline in the Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration Activities of Daily Living (PKAN-ADL) scale, through 24 weeks of treatment. After completing the 24-week treatment period, all patients will be eligible to receive fosmetpantotenate as part of an open-label extension. The FORT Study is expected to be registration-enabling in the U.S. and Europe, and is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement, which indicates concurrence by the FDA that the design of the trial can adequately support the filing of a New Drug Application (NDA). Enrollment in the study is expected to complete around year-end 2018.\nFour PKAN patients receiving fosmetpantotenate for more than three years under physician-initiated treatment outside of the U.S. continue to receive therapy and remain stable.\nSparsentan\nFollowing an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, the Company announced plans to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of sparsentan in FSGS. The study is designed to include an interim analysis of proteinuria to serve as the basis for an NDA filing for Subpart H accelerated approval of sparsentan. The confirmatory endpoint of the study is expected to compare changes from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which is widely regarded as the best overall measure of kidney function. The Company submitted its Phase 3 protocol to the Agency for review, and in late February 2018, the FDA communicated concurrence that the protocol design and statistical modeling completed by the Company were sufficient to support proceeding with the trial on the Subpart H accelerated approval pathway. Study start-up activities continue in anticipation of initiating the pivotal trial in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company is also advancing the development of sparsentan in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a rare, immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis characterized by proteinuria and variable rates of progressive renal failure. Regulatory interactions in the U.S. and Europe are underway in preparation for initiating a clinical trial in IgAN during the second half of 2018.\nCNSA-001\nIn January 2018, the Company announced a strategic collaboration with Censa Pharmaceuticals to advance CNSA-001 for the treatment of PKU. CNSA-001 is an orally bioavailable proprietary form of sepiapterin, a natural precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) that is converted by an endogenous enzymatic pathway to BH4. CNSA-001 is currently being evaluated in a single ascending dose (SAD) study, and a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in PKU is expected to commence in mid-2018, with results expected to be available in early 2019.\nThiola\nIn 2018, the Company expects an NDA to be filed for its new formulation of Thiola for the treatment of cystinuria.\nConference Call Information\nRetrophin and webcast today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss development updates as well as fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful in understanding its past financial performance and potential future results. They are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Retrophin’s management regularly uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate its business and make operating decisions. In addition, Retrophin believes that the use of these non-GAAP measures enhances the ability of investors to compare its results from period to period and allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the Company uses in making operating decisions.\nInvestors should note that these non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that these non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. In addition, from time to time in the future the Company may exclude other items, or cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded, for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; because of the non-standardized definitions, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company in this press release and the accompanying tables may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by the Company’s competitors and other companies.\nAs used in this press release, (i) the historical non-GAAP net income (loss) measures exclude from GAAP net income (loss), as applicable, revaluation of acquisition related contingent consideration, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, change in fair value of derivative instruments; income tax benefit; (ii) the historical non-GAAP SG&A expense measures exclude from GAAP SG&A expenses, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense; (iii) the historical non-GAAP R&D expense measures exclude from GAAP R&D expenses, as applicable, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization expense.\nAbout Retrophin\nRetrophin is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare diseases.
