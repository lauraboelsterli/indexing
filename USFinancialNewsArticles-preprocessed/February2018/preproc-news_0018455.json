Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: julien.ponthus.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net \nMORNING CALL: EUROPE TO OPEN IN THE RED AFTER NEW WALL STREET SELL-OFF (0615 GMT) \nGood morning and welcome to Live Markets. \nEuropean bourses are expected to open in the red this morning after Wall Street’s fresh new sell-off. The bottom of the slide remains elusive but this current trend sure seems to be threatening to throw the market’s bull run off course. \nSpreadbetters are calling the DAX 23 points lower, the CAC 40 down 8 points, and the FTSE down 40 points. \nConsidering that U.S. stocks plunged around 4 percent on Thursday, this looks, so far, like a limited reaction from our side of the pond. . \n(Julien Ponthus)",
