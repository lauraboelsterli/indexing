(\"the Company\" or \"Novan\") (NASDAQ:NOVN) today announced that Eugene Sun, M.D., has been appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors, effective February 16, 2018.\nExecutive Chairman of Novan’s Board of Directors, Robert Ingram, commented on Dr. Sun’s appointment to the Board by stating, “Eugene’s depth of experience in translational medicine and drug development stands out against any global comparison.” Mr. Ingram added that, “Novan is most fortunate to have someone of Eugene’s pedigree on our Board.”\n“The opportunity to join Novan’s Board, at this time, is a great honor and something that I am genuinely excited about,” commented Dr. Sun. He added, “The underlying science offers a broad array of therapeutic options and I look forward to working with the Company to capture the fullest extent of those opportunities.”\nWith the addition of Dr. Sun, Novan’s Board formed a Research and Development Committee, chaired by Dr. Sun and comprised of members of the Board in consultation with the Company’s Executive Management Team. This Committee will assist the Board in evolving and overseeing the strategic direction and medical applications of Novan’s proprietary nitric oxide-based technology.\nDr. Sun served as the Chief Executive Officer for Melinta Therapeutics from 2015 to 2017 and as its Executive Vice President from 2013 to 2015. Prior to joining Melinta, Dr. Sun held senior positions at Abbott Laboratories, most recently as Corporate Vice President, Global Pharmaceutical Clinical Development. During his 17-year tenure at Abbott, Dr. Sun led the development and worldwide regulatory approval of the landmark human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor Kaletra® and oversaw the development and approval of multiple indications for Humira®.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Dr. Sun served on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee, a panel of independent infectious disease experts. After earning an undergraduate degree from Harvard University and a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, Dr. Sun completed an internship and residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. During his fellowship, Dr. Sun received a National Research Service Award and a Physician Scientist Award from the National Institutes of Health.\nAbout Novan\nNovan, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on leveraging nitric oxide’s natural antiviral and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat dermatological and oncovirus-mediated diseases.
