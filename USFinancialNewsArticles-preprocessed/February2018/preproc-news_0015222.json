    "text": "TORONTO, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Thomson Reuters (TSX/NYSE: TRI) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. As already announced on January 30, 2018, the company achieved its full-year 2017 Outlook (as updated in August).\n\"Our 2017 fourth-quarter and full-year results show continued progress in key areas,\" said Jim Smith, president and chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters. \"Moving forward, we remain extremely excited about the future prospects for F&R through our strategic partnership with Blackstone, and our renewed focus to accelerate growth in the core businesses of Thomson Reuters. Our ability to capitalize on opportunities at the intersection of regulation and commerce has never been stronger.\"\nConsolidated Financial Highlights - Three Months Ended December 31\n(Millions of U.S. dollars, except for adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings per share (EPS))\n(unaudited)\n2016 Excluding Q4 2016 Severance\nCharges (2)\nIFRS Financial Measures (1)\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2016\nChange\nChange at\nConstant\nCurrency\nRevenues\n$2,944\n$2,860\n3%\nOperating profit\n$445\n$294\n51%\nDiluted EPS (includes discontinued operations (3) )\n$0.81\n$3.03\n-73%\nCash flow from operations (includes discontinued operations (3) )\n$755\n$998\n-24%\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures (1)\nRevenues\n$2,944\n$2,860\n3%\n$2,860\n3%\n1%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$874\n$635\n38%\n$847\n3%\n1%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n29.7%\n22.2%\n750bp\n29.6%\n10bp\n10bp\nAdjusted EPS\n$0.60\n$0.31\n94%\n$0.60\n0%\n-5%\nFree cash flow (includes discontinued operations (3) )\n$506\n$755\n-33%\n$794\n-36%\nRevenues increased 3% due to higher recurring revenues and a positive impact from foreign currency.\nAt constant currency, revenues increased 1%.\nOperating profit increased 51%, primarily because the prior year included $212 million of severance charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 38% to $874 million and the margin increased 750 basis points to 29.7% from 22.2%. Excluding the severance charges from the prior-year period, adjusted EBITDA increased 3% and the margin increased 10 basis points.\nDiluted EPS , which includes discontinued operations, decreased 73% to $0.81, primarily because the prior-year period included a $2.0 billion gain on the sale of the IP & Science business. The current-year period reflected $304 million of tax benefits from the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nAdjusted EPS , which excludes the gain and tax benefit, among other items, was $0.60 compared to $0.31 per share in the prior-year period. Excluding the severance charges in the prior-year period, adjusted EPS was unchanged. Currency had a $0.03 favorable impact.\nCash flow from operations decreased 24%, as the prior-year period benefited from a $200 million tax benefit related to a $500 million pension contribution made in the first quarter of 2017.\nFree cash flow decreased 33% to $506 million reflecting the same factor.\n(1)\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the company uses certain non-IFRS financial measures as supplemental indicators of its operating performance and financial position. These and other non-IFRS financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable IFRS measures in the tables appended to this news release.\n(2)\nResults exclude the impact of $212 million of fourth-quarter 2016 charges from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Free cash flow excludes 2016 cash payments of $39 million associated with these charges. Refer to the tables appended to this news release for a reconciliation of 2016 adjusted EBITDA, the related margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow including and excluding the charges.\n(3)\nDiscontinued operations are comprised solely of our Intellectual Property & Science business (IP & Science), which was sold in October 2016.\nHighlights by Business Unit – Three Months Ended December 31\n(Millions of U.S. dollars, except for adjusted EBITDA margins)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n2017\n2016\nTotal\nForeign Currency\nConstant Currency\nRevenues\nFinancial & Risk\n$1,551\n$1,508\n3%\n2%\n1%\nLegal\n881\n864\n2%\n1%\n1%\nTax & Accounting\n443\n416\n6%\n0%\n6%\nCorporate & Other (Reuters News)\n75\n77\n-3%\n2%\n-5%\nEliminations\n(6)\n(5)\nRevenues\n$2,944\n$2,860\n3%\n2%\n1%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFinancial & Risk\n$481\n$289\n66%\n0%\n66%\nLegal\n314\n296\n6%\n1%\n5%\nTax & Accounting\n156\n131\n19%\n-1%\n20%\nCorporate & Other (includes Reuters News)\n(77)\n(81)\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$874\n$635\n38%\n2%\n36%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\nFinancial & Risk\n31.0%\n19.2%\n1180bp\n-30bp\n1210bp\nLegal\n35.6%\n34.3%\n130bp\n0bp\n130bp\nTax & Accounting\n35.2%\n31.5%\n370bp\n-40bp\n410bp\nCorporate & Other (includes Reuters News)\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n29.7%\n22.2%\n750bp\n-10bp\n760bp\nExcluding 2016 Severance Charges from Prior-Year Period Amounts and Margins\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFinancial & Risk\n$481\n$456\n5%\n2%\n3%\nLegal\n314\n322\n-2%\n1%\n-3%\nTax & Accounting\n156\n149\n5%\n0%\n5%\nCorporate & Other (includes Reuters News)\n(77)\n(80)\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$874\n$847\n3%\n2%\n1%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\nFinancial & Risk\n31.0%\n30.2%\n80bp\n0bp\n80bp\nLegal\n35.6%\n37.3%\n-170bp\n-20bp\n-150bp\nTax & Accounting\n35.2%\n35.8%\n-60bp\n-40bp\n-20bp\nCorporate & Other (includes Reuters News)\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n29.7%\n29.6%\n10bp\n0bp\n10bp\nn/a – not applicable\nUnless otherwise noted, all revenue growth comparisons by business unit in this news release are at constant currency (or exclude the impact of foreign currency) as Thomson Reuters believes this provides the best basis to measure their performance .\nFinancial & Risk\nRevenues increased 1% to $1.6 billion. Organic revenues were unchanged and acquisitions contributed 1%.\nRevenues by type: Recurring revenues were unchanged (77% of total) Transactions revenues grew 7% (16% of total) Growth was due to increased revenue from Tradeweb and contributions from acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of lower foreign exchange trading revenues. Recoveries revenues decreased 6% (7% of total)\nRevenues by geography: Revenues were up 2% in the Americas, unchanged in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and down 1% in Asia Pacific.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 66% to $481 million and the margin increased to 31.0% from 19.2%. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of severance charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn constant currency and excluding the severance charges from the prior-year period, adjusted EBITDA was up 3% and the margin increased 80 basis points, driven by savings from the company's simplification initiatives.\nNet sales were positive in the quarter.\nLegal\nRevenues increased 1% to $881 million.\nRecurring revenues grew 3% (75% of total) US Print revenues declined 7% (14% of total) Transactions revenues declined 1% (11% of total)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $314 million and the margin increased to 35.6% from 34.3% due to the impact of the severance charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn constant currency and excluding the severance charges from the prior-year period, adjusted EBITDA declined 3% and the margin decreased by 150 basis points.\nTax & Accounting\nRevenues increased 6% to $443 million.\nRecurring revenues grew 5% (88% of total) Transactions revenues grew 11% (12% of total)\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $156 million and the margin increased to 35.2% from 31.5%, primarily due to the impact of severance charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn constant currency and excluding the severance charges from the prior-year period, adjusted EBITDA was up 5% and the margin decreased 20 basis points.\nCorporate & Other (Including Reuters News)\nReuters News revenues were $75 million, down 5%.\nCorporate & Other costs at the adjusted EBITDA level were $77 million compared to $81 million in the prior-year period.

Higher revenues and lower operating expenses, reflecting the company's ongoing simplification initiatives, also contributed, despite the unfavorable impact of fair value adjustments associated with foreign currency derivatives embedded in certain customer contracts.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 16% to $3.4 billion and the margin increased to 30.3% from 26.5%.\nExcluding the severance charges from the prior year, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% and the margin increased 190 basis points.\nDiluted EPS , which includes discontinued operations, decreased 53% to $1.94 primarily because the prior year included a $2.0 billion gain on the sale of the IP & Science business.

Excluding the charges from the prior year, adjusted EPS increased 21%, or $0.44 per share, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Currency had a $0.03 favorable impact.\nCash flow from operations declined 32%, primarily due to a $500 million pension contribution in January 2017, $103 million of higher payments related to 2016 severance charges, the loss of cash flows from the IP & Science business, which was sold in October 2016 ($140 million year on year reduction), and higher tax payments.\nFree cash flow decreased 49% to $1.0 billion reflecting similar factors as noted above.\n(1)\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with IFRS, the company uses certain non-IFRS financial measures as supplemental indicators of its operating performance and financial position.

As part of the transaction, Thomson Reuters has agreed to sell a 55% majority stake in Financial & Risk and will retain a 45% interest in the business. The transaction values the Financial & Risk business at approximately $20 billion. Thomson Reuters will receive approximately $17 billion in gross proceeds at closing (subject to purchase price adjustments). Thomson Reuters will maintain full ownership of its Legal, Tax & Accounting and the Reuters News businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year and is subject to specified regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\nFinancial & Risk will be classified as a discontinued operation for 2018 reporting purposes.\nDividend\nOn January 30, 2018, Thomson Reuters announced that its board of directors approved maintaining its dividend at $1.38 per common share. A quarterly dividend of $0.345 per share is payable on March 15, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of February 22, 2018.\nNote on 2018 Business Outlook\nAs announced on January 30, 2018, Thomson Reuters plans to provide a 2018 Business Outlook when it reports first-quarter results in early May as a result of the company's recently signed agreement to form a strategic partnership for Financial & Risk with Blackstone, and the related allocation of costs that will need to be made between Thomson Reuters and the proposed new partnership.\nThomson Reuters\nThomson Reuters is the world's leading source of news and information for professional markets.

For more information, visit www.thomsonreuters.com .\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThomson Reuters prepares its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nThis news release includes certain non-IFRS financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and the related margin (other than at the business unit or segment level), free cash flow, adjusted EPS, and selected measures excluding the impact of foreign currency and the impact of the fourth quarter 2016 severance charges. Thomson Reuters uses these non-IFRS financial measures as supplemental indicators of its operating performance and financial position. These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures used by other companies, and should not be viewed as alternatives to measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable IFRS measures in the appended tables. The term \"organic\" refers to Thomson Reuters existing businesses before the impact of acquisitions.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, MATERIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND MATERIAL RISKS\nCertain statements in this news release, including, but not limited to, Mr. Smith's comments and statements regarding the proposed strategic partnership with Blackstone involving the Financial & Risk business, are forward-looking. As a result, forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations. There is no assurance that a transaction involving all or part of the Financial & Risk business will be completed or that the events described in any other forward-looking statement will materialize. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which reflect expectations only as of the date of this news release. Except as may be required by applicable law, Thomson Reuters disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nSome of the material risk factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, changes in the general economy; actions of competitors; failure to develop new products, services, applications and functionalities to meet customers' needs, attract new customers and retain existing ones, or expand into new geographic markets and identify areas of higher growth; fraudulent or unpermitted data access or other cyber-security or privacy breaches; failures or disruptions of telecommunications, data centers, network systems or the Internet; increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources; failure to meet the challenges involved in operating globally; failure to maintain a high renewal rate for recurring, subscription-based services; dependency on third parties for data, information and other services; changes to law and regulations; tax matters, including changes to tax laws, regulations and treaties; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates; failure to adapt to organizational changes and effectively implement strategic initiatives; failure to attract, motivate and retain high quality management and key employees; failure to protect the brands and reputation of Thomson Reuters; inadequate protection of intellectual property rights; threat of legal actions and claims; failure to derive fully the anticipated benefits from existing or future acquisitions, joint ventures, investments or dispositions; risk of antitrust/competition-related claims or investigations; impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets; downgrading of credit ratings and adverse conditions in the credit markets; the effect of factors outside of the control of Thomson Reuters on funding obligations in respect of pension and post-retirement benefit arrangements; and actions or potential actions that could be taken by the company's principal shareholder, The Woodbridge Company Limited. These and other factors are discussed in materials that Thomson Reuters from time to time files with, or furnishes to, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Thomson Reuters annual and quarterly reports are also available in the \"Investor Relations\" section of www.thomsonreuters.com .\nAs previously announced, the company will not webcast a discussion of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results today because it pre-released expectations for its results and hosted a conference call on January 30, 2018 after it announced that the company had signed a definitive agreement to enter into a strategic partnership with Blackstone involving its Financial & Risk business.

operations before tax expense or benefit, net interest expense, other finance costs or income, depreciation, amortization of software and other identifiable intangible assets, Thomson Reuters share of post-tax (earnings) losses in equity method investments, other operating gains and losses, certain asset impairment charges, fair value adjustments and corporate related items. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is comprised of adjusted EBITDA for its business units and Corporate & Other. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenues. Thomson Reuters uses adjusted EBITDA because it provides a consistent basis to evaluate operating profitability and performance trends by excluding items that the Company does not consider to be controllable activities for this purpose. Adjusted EBITDA also represents a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors as a valuation metric. Additionally, this measure is used by Thomson Reuters and investors to assess a company's ability to incur and service debt.\n(2)\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted EPS include dividends declared on preference shares but exclude the post-tax impacts of fair value adjustments, amortization of other identifiable intangible assets, other operating gains and losses, certain asset impairment charges, other finance costs or income, Thomson Reuters share of post-tax (earnings) losses in equity method investments, discontinued operations and other items affecting comparability. Thomson Reuters calculates the post-tax amount of each item excluded from adjusted earnings based on the specific tax rules and tax rates associated with the nature and jurisdiction of each item. Adjusted EPS is calculated using diluted weighted-average shares and does not represent actual earnings or loss per share attributable to shareholders. Thomson Reuters uses adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS as they provide a more comparable basis to analyze earnings and they are also measures commonly used by shareholders to measure the company's performance.\n(3)\nAdjustment to reflect income taxes based on estimated full-year effective tax rate. Earnings or losses for interim periods under IFRS reflect income taxes based on the estimated effective tax rates of each of the jurisdictions in which Thomson Reuters operates. The non-IFRS adjustment reallocates estimated full-year income taxes between interim periods, but has no effect on full-year income taxes.\n(4)\nThe changes in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and the related margins, and adjusted earnings per share before currency (at constant currency or excluding the effects of currency) are determined by converting the current and prior-year period's local currency equivalent using the same exchange rates.\n(5)\nFree cash flow (includes free cash flow from continuing and discontinued operations) is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, and other investing activities less capital expenditures, dividends paid on the company's preference shares, and dividends paid to non-controlling interests. Thomson Reuters uses free cash flow as it helps assess the company's ability, over the long term, to create value for its shareholders as it represents cash available to repay debt, pay common dividends and fund share repurchases and new acquisitions.\nSupplemental\nThomson Reuters Corporation\nDepreciation and Amortization of Computer Software by Business Segment\n(millions of U.S. dollars)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nFinancial & Risk\n$147\n$150\n$581\n$585\nLegal\n64\n61\n247\n248\nTax & Accounting\n36\n45\n131\n131\nCorporate & Other (includes Reuters News)\n7\n11\n36\n60\nTotal depreciation and amortization of computer software\n$254\n$267\n$995\n$1,024\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thomson-reuters-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300595718.html\nSOURCE Thomson Reuters",
