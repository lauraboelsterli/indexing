Please refer to the definitions in the Company’s Management Discussion & Analysis.\nBradford Cooke, CEO, commented, “Overall, we worked hard in 2017 to turn a year of challenges into a year of opportunities. I am pleased to report strong growth in net earnings in 2017, up 148% to $9.7 million or $0.08 per share, notwithstanding slightly lower revenues compared to 2016. In addition, our financial performance in the Q4, 2017 was up across all metrics compared to Q4, 2016. We reduced our operating costs during the year and expect to continue that trend into 2018.\n“After a tough start to the year in the first quarter, Endeavour posted three consecutive quarters of improved production, making the fourth quarter our best of the year. Ore grades and throughput both improved in the second half. In 2017, silver equivalent production met the low end of our original guidance and the high end of our revised guidance, despite overcoming operational challenges at the Guanacevi mine.\n“A new productivity optimization program was launched at Guanaceví last month and additional operational improvements are planned this year at Bolañitos and El Cubo. As we advance our development projects and continue optimizing our existing mines, we look forward to delivering one of the best growth profiles in the silver mining sector.”\nFinancial Results (Consolidated Statement of Operations appended below)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated revenue totaling $150.5 million (2016 - $156.8 million). During the year, the Company sold 4,892,855 oz silver and 51,460 oz gold at realized prices of $17.24 and $1,285 per oz respectively, compared to sales of 5,152,031 oz silver and 55,851 oz gold at realized prices of $16.84 and $1,253 per oz respectively in 2016.\nAfter cost of sales of $122.0 million (2016 - $117.9 million), mine operating earnings amounted to $28.5 million (2016 - $38.9 million) from mining and milling operations in Mexico.\nExcluding depreciation and depletion of $16.6 million (2016 - $13.9 million), stock-based compensation of $0.2 million (2016- $0.1 million) and the non-cash portion of the inventory write of $0.1 million (2016- Nil) mine operating cash flow before taxes was $45.4 million (2016 – $52.9 million) in 2017. Operating earnings were $7.7 million (2016 – $19.2 million) after exploration expenditures of $12.9 million (2016 – $10.4 million) and general and administrative expense of $7.9 million (2016 – $9.3 million).\nNet earnings were $9.7 million ($0.08 per share) compared to earnings of $3.9 million ($0.03 per share) in 2016. Earnings significantly improved as El Cubo generated taxable profits offset by historical tax losses. Current income tax expense decreased to $4.6 million (2016 – $7.8 million), while deferred income tax recognized a $6.4 million recovery (2016 – expense of $0.7 million).\nCash cost, all-in sustaining cost and direct operating cost were all slightly higher than the revised guidance due the lower than planned mine output. The higher realized gold price was offset by the appreciation of the Mexican peso.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss these results will be held today, Monday, February 26 at 10am PST (1pm EST).
