    "text": "Shares of LendingTree plunged close to 8 percent after the online lending exchange reported quarterly earnings that came in 6 cents shy of Wall Street expectations. \nLending Tree reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of 84 cents on revenue of $161 million. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting EPS of 90 cents on revenue of $150.2 million.\nThe company also reiterated its 2018 forecast, which may have disappointed some investors expecting a brighter outlook similar to other lenders, who are benefiting from rising interest rates and the tax cut. \n\"Maybe there is some sense that they didn't raise guidance, which might be a little disappointing for people who thought they might,\" said Kerry Rice, senior analyst at Needham. \"They've had a great run.\" \nThe company also saw a significant uptick in expenses year over year, mostly from marketing spending. \nIt was the worst one-day decline for the stock since August 2015. \n\"They are a generally conservative company so there is probably an upside to those numbers (guidance),\" said Rice. \"I look at the weakness as a buying opportunity.\"",
