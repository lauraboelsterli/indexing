The SEMI Foundation produces SEMI High Tech U (HTU), a three-day interactive program that encourages high school students to pursue academic paths that emphasize science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and to expose them to high technology careers such as semiconductor manufacturing.\nThe Nordson Corporation Foundation sponsored its first HTU program February 12 – 15, 2018 at the Nordson facility in Carlsbad, California. This was one of the first HTU events to be held in Southern California. Forty high school students from five local high schools, including Carlsbad, Sage Creek, San Marcos, Rancho Buena Vista, and Mission Hills, attended the program, where they learned from industry instructors and visited the UC San Diego campus for a look at college life. The Nordson Corporation Foundation is dedicated to improving the quality of life in its communities by improving educational outcomes that enable individuals to become self-sufficient, active participants in the community.\nStockunas has a long history of engaging and supporting STEM activities and the workforce development pipeline. Stockunas sponsored SEMI High Tech U at Air Products in Pennsylvania where he had previously worked for 30 years. In 2013, he joined Nordson Corporation, and has helped facilitate the company’s sponsorship of SEMI High Tech U in 2018.\n“I have been a long-time supporter of the SEMI Foundation’s High Tech U program, which helps students make the connection between familiar electronic products and future career choices in high tech,” said Joe Stockunas. “I look forward to working with the Board to help drive new initiatives to support young people and strengthen the industry workforce.”\nPhoto at: https://adobe.ly/2C6t7Nz\nAbout Nordson Corporation\nNordson Corporation engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems that dispense, apply and control adhesives , coatings , polymers , sealants , biomaterials , and other fluids , test and inspect for quality , and treat and cure surfaces , and are supported by application expertise and direct global sales and service.
