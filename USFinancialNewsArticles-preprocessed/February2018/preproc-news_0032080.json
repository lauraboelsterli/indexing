    "text": "CHICAGO, February 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nTrackunit A/S , has appointed Jeff Cohen as President of Trackunit Inc., reinforcing its progress into the North American market. Mr. Cohen joins Trackunit after a seven-year tenure at Telogis (now Verizon Telematics), where he was responsible for the global growth of the Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) sector.\nAs President, Mr. Cohen will lead the strategic growth initiatives, working closely with CEO Jorgen Raguse and other members of the Executive team. Mr. Cohen's experience will be leveraged to partner with large OEM & Strategic customer accounts, and develop internal teams and processes to expand on the foundational success in the OHV space that the company has had in Europe.\n\"The Industrial IoT space is unique in its requirements, and Trackunit has done a terrific job focusing on the customer now with an eye towards the future ,\" Cohen remarks. \"It's incredible to see a company so actively engaged in solving the right problems for multiple machine asset classes. I look forward to driving this initiative forward and going further down the asset value stack to things like tools, parts, etc.\"\nJorgen Raguse, CEO at Trackunit, commenting on the appointment, said. \"Jeff's past role and successful exits, combined with his industry leadership and experience in our target market is the ideal fit. He knows and understands our customers, and has already been instrumental in executing two new OEM partnerships in a very short period of time. Our target market is less than 5-7% penetrated with telematics, and even less when focusing on the operator and their mobile work. Jeff is working closely with us to expand that message globally, and his experience specifically in this marketplace will allow us to leverage our leading position in Europe in North America.\"\nMr. Cohen is an entrepreneur at heart, growing multiple mobile technology companies before joining Telogis. He graduated from Duke University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and received his Master of Business Administration from NYU's Stern School of Business.\nPlease click here to download a high-resolution image of Jeff Cohen , President, Trackunit Inc., North America\nAbout Trackunit\nTrackunit is among the world's leading companies in the Industrial Internet of Things with a focus on innovative solutions to players within the Construction, Equipment Rental and Material Handling industries.
