    "text": "POMPANO BEACH, Fla., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GoooGreen, Inc., (OTCPK: GOOO) announced the company, with board approval, has signed a letter of intent, subject to finalization of due diligence, to acquire Visita Skin Care products. GoooGreen’s proposed new Visita division will begin operating a cosmetic and skin care entity with the intent of converting it into a wholly owned subsidiary under the GoooGreen umbrella. Closing is expected to be concluded within 120 days. The company is in the selection process of a production and fulfillment facility for Visita’s cosmetics and skin care product line.\nBrief Description:\nVisita developed and hold the formulation rights to a Skin Treatment Lotion and Cleanser for persons affected by skin conditions: psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, eczema and pruritus. The markets for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are large. Atopic dermatitis is a type of eczema, an inflammatory pruritus, chronically relapsing, non-contagious skin disorder. Together these two diseases affect as much as 20% of the population. The company believes the Visita product line will enhance shareholder value. The company’s initial due diligence research indicates this product line is consumer desirable for the compounds imbedded in the products appear to have chemical properties that are: (1) effective, (2) have little or no side effects, (3) can be used on younger patients, (4) can be used for longer periods of time, and (5) are cost efficient.\nThe company will be updating shareholders with ongoing updates and details as appropriate. Further information about the Vista acquisition is expected to be announced over the next months.\nSafe Harbor Provision\nThis news release includes forward-looking statements, including with respect to the future level of business for the parties.
