An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n“We were very pleased with our year-over-year revenue growth of 33% in the fourth quarter of 2017, which capped off a successful year for ForeScout. Our strong fourth quarter results were driven by balanced traction across our business and supported by strong execution from our sales team,” said Criss Harms, Chief Financial Officer of ForeScout. “We continued to see improving leverage in our business as non-GAAP gross margins and operating margins improved nicely year-over-year. These were driven by the ongoing shift to customers buying more of our software products, improvements in sales productivity as our team becomes more tenured, and continued effective expense management. Finally, ongoing improvements in cash management translated to free cash flow margin improvement of 3,300 basis points for the full year 2017.\"\nFourth Quarter Business Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, ForeScout:\nPriced and closed its Initial Public Offering, raising gross proceeds of $133.6 million, including the full exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option.\nFormed a strategic alliance with CrowdStrike to deliver advanced endpoint and network threat protection.

The guidance below assumes revenue recognition under ASC 605.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, ForeScout expects:\nRevenue of $53.5 million to $56.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24 percent at the midpoint.\nNon-GAAP operating loss of ($16.4) to ($15.6) million\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of ($0.46) to ($0.44) using approximately 37.7 million basic and diluted shares outstanding\nFor the full year of 2018, ForeScout expects:\nRevenue of $260 million to $270 million, representing year-over-year growth of 20 percent at the midpoint.\nNon-GAAP operating loss of ($43) to ($39) million\nNon-GAAP net loss per share of ($1.21) to ($1.13) using approximately 38.2 million basic and diluted shares outstanding\nGuidance for non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share excludes stock-based compensation expense. We have not reconciled non-GAAP operating loss guidance to GAAP operating loss, nor have we reconciled non-GAAP net loss per share to GAAP net loss per share, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of these items, which could be significant. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Information\nForeScout will host a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time.

These involve risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these These risks and uncertainties include risks associated with: the evolution of the cyberthreat landscape facing enterprises in the United States and other countries; developments and trends in the domestic and international markets for network security products; our expectations concerning the productivity of our expanding sales force as our sales representatives become more seasoned; our plans to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase our annual revenue; future acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary companies, services or technologies; fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other operating measures; increasing competition; our ability to recruit and retain our employees; general economic, market and business conditions; the number of shares of our common stock outstanding; and the risks described in the other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the risks described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 7, 2017, and which should be read in conjunction with our financial results and , and is available on the SEC filings section of the Investor Relations page of our website at https://investors.forescout.com/ . All in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made except as required by applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nForeScout has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). ForeScout uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing ForeScout’s financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with ForeScout’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of ForeScout’s historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit. ForeScout defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit plus stock-based compensation expense. ForeScout considers non-GAAP gross profit to be a useful metric for management and investors as a more accurate comparison to our peer companies and a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods due to the impact of differences in valuation assumptions and varying award types associated with stock-based compensation expense.\nNon-GAAP Operating Loss. ForeScout defines non-GAAP operating loss as operating loss excluding stock-based compensation expense.\nNon-GAAP Net Loss Per Share. ForeScout defines non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding stock-based compensation expense, expense associated with changes in the fair value of preferred stock warrants, and the value of the dividend of common stock issued to certain of our stockholders in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock. ForeScout defines non-GAAP net loss per share as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted average shares outstanding.\nFree Cash Flow. ForeScout defines free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. ForeScout defines free cash flow margin as free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. ForeScout considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin to be profitability and liquidity measures that provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet.\nFORESCOUT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited, in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $
