    "text": "February 8, 2018 / 9:18 PM / in 13 minutes Qualcomm rejects Broadcom's revised buyout offer Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) said on Thursday its board had unanimously rejected Broadcom Ltd’s ( AVGO.O ) revised $121 billion buyout offer. \nThe board has determined that Broadcom’s proposal “materially undervalues” Qualcomm and falls short of the firm regulatory commitment it would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction, the company said. \nQualcomm also said it has offered to meet with Broadcom to see if it can address the serious deficiencies in value and certainty in its proposal. \nBroadcom on Monday increased its offer to buy Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share.
