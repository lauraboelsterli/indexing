    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 9:10 AM / in an hour Turkey detains 48 suspected Islamic State members: Anadolu Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police have detained 48 suspected Islamic State members who were preparing to launch an attack, state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday. \nPolice raided six addresses in three districts of Istanbul, and detained 31 foreign nationals, Anadolu said. \nOfficers seized digital material and documents during the operation, Anadolu said. \nSeventeen more who were also preparing to launch an attack were detained in raids across the capital Ankara, Anadolu said. \nIt did not give details on when the operations were carried out. \nTurkey has been a partner in the U.S-led coalition against Islamic State fighters. \nTurkish police stepped up operations against Islamic State suspects at the end of last year before the first anniversary of a New Year gun attack on a nightclub in Istanbul in which 39 people were killed. \nIslamic State claimed responsibility for that shooting, one of a series of attacks believed to have been carried out by the jihadists in Turkey in recent years.
