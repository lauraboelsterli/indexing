    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 11:26 AM / in 37 minutes Malaysia's George Kent joins European bid for Singapore rail link Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nKUALA LUMPUR, Feb 12 (Reuters) - George Kent (Malaysia) Bhd has joined a consortium with European firms to bid for the construction and maintenance of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail link. \nThe project, valued at about $17 billion by analysts, is the biggest undertaken by Malaysia and Singapore in recent years, with a decision on the tender expected by the year-end. \nGeorge Kent said on Monday it will work with Siemens AG , Alstom SA, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane SpA and Porr AG on a joint tender offer encompassing engineering, procurement and construction (EPC), and operations and maintenance (O&M). \nGeorge Kent said in a statement the consortium will combine European technology and project experience with the Malaysian construction firm’s local knowledge. \nThe consortium faces competition from around Asia. Companies from China, whose influence is growing in the region, are vying for the project, but there will also be bids from Japanese firms, as well as South Korean companies. \nChina Railway Corporation would lead a consortium of Chinese companies, while Japan’s JR East would head another including Sumitomo Corporation, Hitachi Ltd, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and NEC Corp, Reuters reported last month. \nSouth Korea’s consortium would include Hyundai Rotem Co and Hyundai Engineering and Construction. \nMalaysia and Singapore are jointly tendering the work, with the tender due to close on June 29.
