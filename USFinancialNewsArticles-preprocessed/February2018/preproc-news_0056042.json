    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, said Friday that while bonds yields seem to “make sense” at current levels, he has a “low conviction feeling” that they could breakout to the upside, representing a “clear and present danger.”\nGundlach, on CNBC television, said commodities are the best place to be during late-stage economic cycles, which the United States is in at the moment.
