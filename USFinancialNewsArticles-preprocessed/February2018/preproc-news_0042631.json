    "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Magenta Therapeutics , a biotechnology company developing therapeutics to improve and extend the use of curative bone marrow transplant for more patients, today announced that it has strengthened its clinical development team with the appointment of John Davis, MD, MPH, as chief medical officer.\n“At Magenta we have ambitious goals to change the lives of many patients through the potentially curative power of bone marrow transplantation,” said Jason Gardner, D.Phil., chief executive officer, president and co-founder, Magenta Therapeutics. “As a clinical stage company, we are delighted to welcome John, a very seasoned physician-scientist, to our team. John’s rich experience in immunology and drug development will be crucial as we move our programs forward.”\nDr. Davis joins Magenta from Pfizer, where he was Senior Vice President and Head of Early Clinical Development. Prior to Pfizer, Dr. Davis served as Vice President and Global Therapeutic Area Head of Immunology at Baxalta and as Senior Group Director and Head of the Inflammation and Cardiovascular/Metabolism Group in the Early Clinical Development Group at Genentech. Dr. Davis spent nearly 10 years on faculty at The University of California San Francisco leading clinical research in autoimmune diseases, and he is Professor of Clinical Medicine. He continues to see patients, teach, and serve as volunteer faculty at the Boston VA Medical Center. Dr. Davis earned an MD from the University of Maryland where he graduated summa cum laude. Dr. Davis trained in Internal Medicine and Rheumatology at The University of California San Francisco. He continued training in clinical research and rheumatology at The National Institutes of Health NIAMS Intramural Program. He holds an MPH in Epidemiology from the University of California Berkley, and an MS in Anatomical Science from the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\nAbout Bone Marrow Transplant\nHealthy bone marrow stem cells and the blood cells they create are crucial for survival, but certain diseases can affect the bone marrow, interfering with its ability to function properly. A bone marrow transplant is a process to replace unhealthy bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow transplant can save the lives of patients with blood cancers and genetic diseases and is a potential cure for patients with severe refractory autoimmune diseases. However, the high risks, toxic side effects and complexity of the procedure currently prevent many patients from being able to benefit.\nAbout Magenta Therapeutics\nMagenta Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing therapeutics to revolutionize bone marrow transplant for patients with autoimmune diseases, blood cancers and genetic diseases. By creating a platform focused on critical areas of unmet need, Magenta Therapeutics is pioneering an integrated approach to extend the curative power of bone marrow transplant to more patients, by making the process more effective, safer, and easier. Founded by internationally recognized leaders in bone marrow transplant medicine, Magenta Therapeutics was launched in 2016 by Third Rock Ventures and Atlas Venture and is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
