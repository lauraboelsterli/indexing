    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Zimmerman, the agency known for its retail expertise, announced the hiring of key account personnel given their recent McDonald's client win. Back in September, the agency participated in the National co-op review that consolidated the work from 58 to 7 agencies. The agency emerged as the winner of more co-ops than any other agency.\nThe hires include Carol Koepke, who will take on the role of SVP, Account Director, reporting to Scott Thaler, Chief Integration Officer and a veteran of the agency. Carol brings 20+ years of marketing experience focused on QSR and retail brands, including many years with McDonald's Corporation. She will be responsible for orchestrating the overall implementation of new strategies to fuel the growth of close to 4,500 restaurants that conform the 18 co-ops in 64 DMAs. New hires also include Mark Carlson, who joins as Creative Director after spending nearly two decades at McDonald's Corporation.\n\"Building the right team for McDonald's takes a special DNA chemistry. By blending Zimmerman talent, driven to challenge convention, with new talent that knows how to maintain momentum for one of the largest and successful QSR systems in the world, we create twice the talent, twice as fast and with twice the impact,\" said Michael Goldberg, CEO of Zimmerman Advertising.\nZimmerman has also hired many leaders to drive growth to individual co-ops across the country under the leadership of Thaler and Koepke. These include: Cindy Peterman, a QSR specialist with more than 25 years of experience including McDonald's and Burger King; Linda Burgess, a 25-year veteran of McDonald's; Simone Marsalis, a 20+ year pro in the QSR sector, including brands like KFC, Taco Bell and McDonald's; Stephen Barry, an accomplished leader with years of experience handling McDonald's accounts; Krystal Sheeran, an account director who has been creating McDonald's brand advocates for the last eight years; and Jason Richoux, who has spent most of his career working for the McDonald's brand, both on the corporate and co-op sides.\nJordan Zimmerman, Founder and Chairman of the agency, said, \"Working with the McDonald's brand has been one of my dream accounts since I started my career and I can honestly say thatâ€¦ I'm loving it! Their great brand deserves the great growth trajectory that Zimmerman will never stop working toward.\"\nThese hires follow a string of over 75 new positions to support the growth of existing accounts like Nissan, for adding on their national brand work; and new accounts like Virgin Mobile, Gabe's and others.\nAbout Zimmerman Advertising\nZimmerman Advertising, an Omnicom Group company, is the leading integrated, retail agency in the country.
