    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. What do you make of the new Snapchat design so far? More than 1 million people are so furious about it, they’ve signed a Change.org petition demanding Snap reverse the update. On Wednesday, Snap responded , essentially saying, we hear you, but no. Snap wrote that while the redesign “has felt uncomfortable for many,” the goal was to make it easier to connect with “the people you care about the most.” Snap added that it will soon introduce tabs to make it easier to find specific stories and allow users to customize the app further.\nAlgorithm and Blues For months, social media platforms have been promising to do better. They’ve pledged to hire more content moderators, to tackle fake news, to focus on trusted information sources and meaningful interactions. Then along comes another example where they come unstuck. On Wednesday, in the wake of last week’s tragic school shooting in Parkland, Fla., both YouTube and Facebook’s “trending” sections were promoting conspiracy videos suggesting one of the survivors of the attack was a paid actor, Business Insider reports. YouTube said that the conspiracy video appearing at the top of the trending section was a mistake and that it was removed for violating its policies. As for other conspiracy videos surfacing in its search results, YouTube said it’s been making improvements but in some circumstances “these changes are not working quickly enough.” Facebook, meanwhile, said it would take down the hoax content. The fact this keeps happening in the aftermath of major news events isn’t very reassuring to marketers.\n—Keep Up With the Trends—\nThe Outline’s Josh Topolsky underscores the issue: “Social media in its current state is built on the premise that popularity— virality—is the core signal of value in its marketplace. ” Clearly, “trending” modules drive engagement with popular content, but time and time again, they also seem to present the biggest problems as their high-profile placement can legitimize misinformation, encouraging people to spread it even further. Perhaps it’s time for social media platforms to wean themselves off the “trending” drug. Why not experiment with doing away with trending sections—for a week, for a month—assess the impact and report back on the findings? Who would be sad to see them gone?\nBooking dot Yeah Priceline could very easily have become one of the victims of the dot-com bubble bursting, consigned to the internet 1.0 graveyard. But in the early 2000s, Priceline made two acquisitions—Active Hotels and Bookings B.V.—merged the companies to become Booking.com, and turned around its entire business. Now Priceline Group is changing its name to Booking Holdings , Fortune reports. “Priceline” is still the more recognizable of its brands in the U.S., but Booking.com is the company’s biggest business, famed internationally for its “Booking dot com, Booking dot yeah” ad campaigns. The name change better emphasizes its largest business and reflects the idea that all its services comprise a booking component. For advertising nuts, Priceline—now Booking Holdings—is always an interesting company to watch because it spends gobs of money on advertising and its earnings calls provide insights on which media is working. In the third quarter alone, the company spent $1.2 billion on performance advertising and $112 million on brand ads.\nA Tale of Two Halves It was a roller-coaster day for media observers Wednesday. First up, Vox said it was laying off around 50 employees , having come to the realization that native social video initiatives won’t be “viable audience or revenue growth drivers.” The announcement followed Facebook’s recent algorithm announcement that has seen it deprioritizing news content in the feed. Unlike some of its peers, some of whom have also recently had layoffs, Vox Media met its revenue target of about $160 million for 2017, although it was slightly unprofitable for the year, CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports. In a memo, Vox Media Chief Executive Jim Bankoff said that in 2018, the company would get “even more disciplined about maintaining a course of financial growth and strength.” Later Wednesday, the Atlantic said it plans to add as many as 100 employees, most of those in the newsroom . The hiring spree comes six months after Emerson Collective, the organization run by philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, took a majority stake in the Atlantic. A lot of media companies could do with a wealthy benefactor right now—no wonder BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith and Ms. Powell Jobs have reportedly been in discussions about Emerson investing in BuzzFeed News.\nCome Together, Right Now Last year, NBCUniversal’s ad sales chief, Linda Yaccarino, brought together top-level advertising and media executives in a “ State of the Industry Forum ,” designed to tackle the biggest issues plaguing the industry. But, as CMO Today’s Alexandra Bruell reported at the time, the event “largely served to illuminate the industry’s many challenges, generating more questions than answers.” Now Fox Networks Group is giving the idea a shot . Variety reports Fox plans to hold a one-day, off-the-record meeting of the media and advertising elite at the 20th Century Fox studio next Thursday to again look at solving problems, such as agreeing upon a universal measurement metric for online video. Will it shift the needle? Amol Sharma, WSJ media and marketing editor, tweeted some advice : “My suggestion to make these things useful: start the debate by laying specific proposals on the table, rather than just freestyle complaints.” (Reminder: Fox Networks parent 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.)\nBest of the rest Brands including AT&T and Bayer are experimenting with blockchain-based solutions to bring more transparency to digital advertising trading. [ AdExchanger ]\nSnapchat reportedly plans to double the amount of video shows it releases this year to around 80. [ Digiday ]\nGoogle has a new product called “Auto Ads” that allows publishers to place a piece of code into their pages to let its AdSense system use machine learning to select the best ads to display and where on the page to place them. [ Ad Age ]\nTalk shows are in vogue, thanks to the growth of streaming TV and podcasting. [ WSJ ]\nGerman media giant ProSiebenSat.1 has appointed Max Cronze, the former chief executive of British technology company Dyson, as its new CEO, effective June 1. [ Variety ]\nRoku’s shares plummeted in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company provided a weak sales forecast for its first quarter. But the maker of streaming media devices did beat estimates for its fourth quarter, posting $188.3 million in revenue, versus the $182.5 million analysts predicted. [ WSJ ]\nPandora also reported fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday. While total revenue grew 7% to $395 million, ad revenue fell 5% to $297.7 million as the number of active users declined.
