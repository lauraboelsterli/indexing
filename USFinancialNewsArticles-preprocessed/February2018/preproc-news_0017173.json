    "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Secureworks ® (NASDAQ: SCWX), a leading global cybersecurity company that keeps organizations safe in a digitally connected world, announced today that Geoff Haydon, longtime RSA and EMC executive, joined Secureworks’ executive leadership team as Chief Revenue Officer to lead the company’s global go-to-market strategy.\nHaydon has many years of experience in driving business growth in the competitive market for information security solutions. Most recently, he served as the CEO of Canadian-based IT security solutions provider Absolute Software Corporation. In this capacity, Haydon spearheaded the transformation and expansion of Absolute Software into one of the world's leading providers of enterprise endpoint and information security.\nPrior to joining Absolute Software, Haydon spent 18 years with RSA and EMC; having most recently worked as EMC’s Chief Operating Officer for the Asia-Pacific region. While Haydon served as RSA’s Vice President for the Americas and for the APJ region, the company saw significant increases in its revenues and global market share. Haydon’s other roles included serving as Executive Director of EMC’s Global Commercial “go-to-market strategy” and working for EMC in numerous other enterprise sales leadership roles.\n“I am excited Geoff is joining the team as our Chief Revenue Officer,” said Michael R. Cote, Secureworks CEO and President. “His many years of successfully leading large sales organizations and in working in the global security industry, as well as the wealth of knowledge he has gained from his operating and general manager roles is a tremendous addition to our team.

This exceptional combination will substantially strengthen our sales, marketing and go-to-market capabilities and enhance our security offerings to ensure we continue delivering differentiated value to our global clients for years to come.”\n“ Enterprises are struggling under immense security and regulatory pressures as they compete in today's increasingly vulnerable, digitally-connected business environment,” said Geoff Haydon. “As one of the largest and most trusted cybersecurity solutions providers, Secureworks is uniquely positioned to help these organizations succeed.
