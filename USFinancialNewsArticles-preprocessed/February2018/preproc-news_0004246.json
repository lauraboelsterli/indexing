    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 12:32 PM / in an hour Baxter International's quarterly profit beats estimates Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Hospital product maker Baxter International Inc ( BAX.N ) reported fourth-quarter earnings above Wall Street estimates, helped by strong demand for its surgical and renal products. \nThe company forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.72 and $2.80. Analysts on average were expecting profit of $2.72 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nSales in its medical products business — which includes intravenous fluid systems, dialysis, biosurgery and some specialty pharmaceuticals such as anesthesia and nutrition — rose 4.6 percent to $1.71 billion in the quarter. \nIts renal products business grew 5.3 percent to $1.07 billion. \nBaxter posted net loss of $71 million, or 13 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec 31, compared with a profit of $243 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. \nThe company took a tax charge of $354 million due to the changes in the U.S. tax law. \nExcluding the charge, the company earned 64 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 59 cents. \nNet sales rose about 5 percent to $2.77 billion and was in line with the analysts’ expectations.
