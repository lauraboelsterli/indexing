The issue of low defence spending in Europe has long been an irritant in Washington. But Russia’s military modernisation, Islamist militancy and electronic warfare on computer networks have underscored Europe’s heavy reliance on the United States.\nAccording to NATO data, Britain, Greece, Romania and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania meet, or are close to, the 2 percent goal, while France and Turkey are among those countries set to reach it soon.\nOne area of tension lies in the language of the NATO spending pledge of 2014. Allies committed to “move towards” 2 percent, while Trump now says 2 percent is the “bare minimum.”\nTrump has also set an example by proposing a $1.7 billion increase in military expenditure in Europe for 2019, as the United States leads NATO efforts to deter Russia.\nBut U.S. officials have also sown confusion about their support for a new defence pact to coordinate European Union defence policy and allow countries to club together to buy arms.\nWheelbarger warned that “we don’t want to see EU efforts pulling requirements or activity away from NATO and into the EU.” The U.S. envoy to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, said there were concerns that U.S. defence companies would be shut out.\n“We do not want this to be a protectionist vehicle for the EU,” she said of the proposed pact.
