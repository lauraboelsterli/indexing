Our strategic categories – Skin Care and Wellness sets and routines – served as significant drivers of growth and price mix development, with further results achieved by the efficiency measures in manufacturing and supply chain”\n* Proposes total dividend of 2.60 EUR/share vs. Reuters survey mean forecast 1.55 EUR\n* Oriflame’s products, which are sold by direct-selling agents, range from make-up and skincare products to accessories and food additives\n* Shares are up 13 pct over 12 months but down 4 pct YTD ($1 = 0.8024 euros) (Reporting By Anna Ringstrom, Editing by Helena Soderpalm)\n ",
