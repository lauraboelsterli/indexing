    "text": "Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Monday as rising bond yields continued to fuel the selloff in equities and hints of inflation pickup triggered concerns that the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates more quickly.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 282.86 points, or 1.11 percent, to 25,238.1. The S&P 500 lost 26.05 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,736.08. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 74.99 points, or 1.04 percent, to 7,165.96. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal;Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n ",
