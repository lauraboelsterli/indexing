    "text": "Feb 7 (Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer by assets, reported a 7.6 percent increase in quarterly operating profit on Wednesday, helped by higher policy fees in its annuities business.\nPrudential’s adjusted operating profit was $1.17 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $1.09 billion, or $2.46 per share, in the year-earlier period.\nAdjusted operating income from the company’s individual annuities business rose 28 percent to $541 million.
