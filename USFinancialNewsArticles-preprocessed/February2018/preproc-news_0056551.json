    "text": "(Adds detail, Quote: )\nJOHANNESBURG, Feb 26 (Reuters) - South African poultry producer RCL Foods said its first-half profit jumped 55 percent on the back of improved earnings in the chicken business unit.\nDiluted headline earning per share (HEPS) rose 55 percent to 73.4 cents for the six months to the end of December compared with 47.4 cents in the previous reporting period. This was in line with what the company had flagged to the market.\nHEPS is the main profit gauge in South Africa which strips out certain one-off items.\nRCL said a decline in feed input costs and higher chicken prices following lower levels of unprotected imports and the impact of avian influenza on supply boosted trading conditions in the poultry market.\n“Headline earnings for the period ended December 2017 increased 56.9 percent to 644.7 million rand largely due to an improved result in the chicken business unit,” the firm said in a statement\nHowever, RCL said a recovery in production volumes in its sugar business as drought conditions abated was offset by lower industry prices due to the impact of higher import volumes during the period.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the unit fell 27 percent to 210.7 million rand compared to the previous reporting period.\nRCL declared an interim dividend of 15 cents per share, up 50 percent from the year-ago period.
