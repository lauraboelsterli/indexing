    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Shells hit a camp for internally displaced Syrians near the Syrian-Turkey border on Tuesday, killing at least one person, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.\nThe shells which hit the camp at Atmeh village, in rebel-held Idlib province, were fired from the Kurdish-held Afrin region just to its north, according to the Observatory and an Atmeh resident, who put the death toll at three.\nFighting is raging in Afrin between the Kurdish YPG militia and Turkish forces that launched a major offensive against the area last month.\nThe YPG said in a statement posted on its social media networks that Turkey was behind the attack and that accusations that the YPG had carried it out were lies.\nWriting by Lisa Barrington; Additional reporting by Suleiman al-Khalidi in Amman; Editing by Tom Perry and Alison Williams\n ",
