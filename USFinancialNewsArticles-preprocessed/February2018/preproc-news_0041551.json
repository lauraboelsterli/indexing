Statscan revised Novemberâ€™s gain to 3.8 percent, the biggest advance since the 5.0 percent leap seen in July 2009.\nSales edged down 0.3 percent to C$55.52 billion ($44.42 billion) on declines in 11 of 21 industries, representing 57 percent of the manufacturing sector. Volumes fell by 0.1 percent.\nSales in the petroleum and coal product industry fell 4.1 percent after five consecutive month-on-month increases while food industry sales dropped by 2.6 percent on weakness in the meat product and dairy product industries.\nNew orders were up by 0.3 percent while unfilled orders fell by 0.7 percent, the second monthly drop in a row, on lower demand in the aerospace products and parts industry.\n($1=$1.25 Canadian)\nReporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
