    "text": "LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A Scottish judge will decide early next week whether to refer a case questioning if Britain alone can change its mind about leaving the European Union to the European Court of Justice, a spokesman for Scotland’s Court of Session said on Friday.\nThe decision will be announced on Monday or Tuesday, the spokesman said.\nThe case, brought by a group of pro-EU lawmakers, is aimed at giving Britain the possibility of staying in the world’s biggest trading bloc once it is known what Brexit actually means for the economy and politics.
