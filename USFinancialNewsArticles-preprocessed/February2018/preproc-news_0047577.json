    "text": "RIGA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Latvia’s Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that allegations against the central bank governor could be part of a disinformation campaign aimed at damaging trust in the government and influencing elections due in October.\n“Regarding the previous day’s events in banking sector and the detention of Ilmars Rimsevics, head of the central bank of Latvia, there is a high probability that (a) massive information operation from outside is (being) conducted,” the Ministry of Defence said in a statement published in English.\nIt said the campaign was “identical in structure and execution to information operations which were observed in France, Germany and the USA before elections”.
