    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Airbus’ new sales chief has set his sights on winning more than two new customers for the slow-selling A330neo this year, as he seeks to improve the European company’s position in the market for long-haul jets.\nIn his first interview since joining Airbus from Rolls-Royce last month, Eric Schulz said sales must accelerate for both the A330neo and the larger A350-1000 in the next two to three years, while demand remained buoyant for the mid-sized A350-900.\nFlight test results from the A330neo, an upgraded version of Airbus’s most-sold wide-body jet that is due to enter service this summer, are encouraging, Schulz told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow.
