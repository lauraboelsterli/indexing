Are you crazy?\"\nFor example, if you put on your resume that you're excellent at collaborating, says Drexler, an interviewer will likely ask, \"What made you so good at collaborating?\" or, \"Give me an example of a time you had to collaborate with others?\"\nThe same logic goes for more technical skills, he says. If your resume notes that you're proficient at PowerPoint, a hiring manager may ask, \"How often did you use it in your last role?\" or \"What type of information did you present?\" or, \"In what situations did you utilize PowerPoint?\"\n\"Make sure you can back up whatever's on your resume or take it off.\" -Barry Drexler, interview coach Although Drexler says that follow-up questions about skills cause applicants to struggle the most, he also says people find it difficult to answer simple questions about their resume. For example, he says new grads sometimes can't answer the question: \"Why did you choose your major?\"\nDrexler says a common response is, \"Um, I don't know,\" or applicants will pause to think it over.\n\"I'm like, are you really thinking about your major now during the interview?\" he says. \"Don't be thinking about something during the interview that you should know the answer [to].\"\nThe final section of your resume that you should know in and out is the description of your previous roles, says the interview coach. For example, if your resume says that you exceeded revenue targets at your prior job, an interviewer will ask for specifics: \"What were the numbers when you got there? What was your target goal? What did you do to exceed that goal? How long did it take?\"\nTo properly prep for these types of follow-up questions Drexler says that you don't have to memorize your answers. He says to follow a simple three-step approach :\nFirst, explain the situation. Example: \"When I joined my previous company, the revenue figures were 4 percent, which was below the market starting point.\"\nSecond, explain your action : Example: \"Over the course of a year, I implemented these specific marketing strategies to implement change.\"\nFinally, discuss your results : Example: \"After a year, our revenue figures increased by 10 percent, and I exceeded our targets by this specified amount.\"\nBy following the above steps, Drexler says you can avoid the common interview pitfall.\n\"You can't imagine how many times [this] happens,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"So don't say it if you can't support it.\"\nLike this story?
