    "text": "By Sarah Gray January 31, 2018 \nStargazers in the U.S. who got up early on Jan. 31 were treated to either a partial or total “super blue blood moon” lunar eclipse. \nThe full moon— in fact a supermoon and a blue moon —passed into Earth’s shadow or umbra, blocking the sun’s light, and making the surface of the moon appear a blood-red hue. \nThe rare sight was visible in some form across the United States, and in Canada, Australia, across Asia, and in parts of Europe. Here are some stunning photos of the event, from New York to San Francisco to Turkey. \nIn the U.S., the eclipse was best seen in the Western half of the country. Here are some shots from California and Nevada.
