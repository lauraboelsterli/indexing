    "text": "CHATSWORTH, Calif., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provision Holding, Inc. (OTCQB:PVHO) today announced financial and operational results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Highlights:\nAppointed Retail Industry Veteran Vince Burke to Board of Directors as an Independent Member Appointed Coinstar Chief Revenue Officer Thien Truong to Board of Directors as an Independent Member Initiated delivery and installation of proprietary 3D holographic display and point-of-sale (POS) coupon platforms into Coinstar’s Exchange™ kiosks\n“During the quarter, Provision made important progress towards fulfilling its mission of becoming a commercially focused organization that can build long-term shareholder value,” commented Mark Leonard, Provision’s Chief Executive Officer. “We were excited to expand our Board with the additions of Vince Burke and Thien Truong, who bring decades of invaluable retail industry expertise, and have already begun to contribute to Provision’s execution on its broad commercial strategy. The Provision platform is attracting considerable collaboration interest across multiple retail channels, and we are confident in our prospects to deliver on these opportunities.”\nCurt Thornton, Provision’s Chairman and Chief Operating Officer added, “In December 2017, we achieved a significant corporate milestone with our initial installations of Provision’s proprietary 3D “toppers” onto kiosks in the Coinstar network. As of mid-February 2018, the Company has shipped a total of 82 toppers to grocery retailer Giant Eagle, located in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and has installed 62 toppers in these stores.”\n“The pace of the initial deployment was slower than our prior projections in order to fine tune the process for the broader rollout,” continued Mr. Thornton. “We are pleased with the rate of delivery and installation we have seen over the first quarter, and expect to see a firm and controlled rollout throughout the year, supported by our committed partners.”\nMr. Leonard concluded, “We remain encouraged by the robust interest among potential advertisers, and continue to anticipate installing up to 4,000 units across the Coinstar network during calendar 2018, building commensurate and meaningful advertising revenues over the course of the year, in step with the expanded scale of our commercial footprint.”\nThree Month Financial Results for the Period Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company did not record any revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,473,191 for the same period in 2016. The decrease in revenue was related to a decrease in revenues from related party sales from the placement of 3D Savings Center kiosks into retail stores.\nGross loss was $237,246 in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared with a gross loss of $311,765 in the same period in 2016. The Company reported a net loss of $1.81 million, or $0.01 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $1.88 million, or $0.02 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nFor a more complete review of the Company’s results, copies of Provision Holdings Form 10-Q and its financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 may be found on the Company’s website.\nTo be added to the Provision email distribution list, please e-mail PVHO@kcsa.com with PVHO in the subject line.\nAbout Provision Interactive Technologies, Inc.\nProvision Interactive Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Provision Holding, Inc.
