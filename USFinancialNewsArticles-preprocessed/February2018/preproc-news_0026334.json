Slideshow (6 Images) \nRennesâ€™ Khazri made the most of a defensive blunder by Marcelo and beat Anthony Lopes from close range to put the visitors ahead on six minutes. \nLyon dominated possession but Nabil Fekir was being closely monitored by the opposition defence. \nThe French international forward came close to levelling, however, with 15 minutes from time when his long-range effort shaved the post. \nBut Rennes doubled their tally three minutes into stoppage time when Lea Siliki was alert to finish after Lopes had parried his first shot back into his path.
