Joby Aviation raised $100 million in a series B round of funding to develop its air taxis, which are small, electric passenger planes that can take off and land vertically. Among investors in the start-up were corporate backers Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures and JetBlue Technology Ventures, with AME Cloud Ventures, 8VC and Capricorn Investment Group (and early SpaceX investor). The company is facing competition from Airbus-incubated Vahana, Uber Elevate, Boeing and others who are betting some people would rather take to the skies than drive through traffic. \nTyson Foods' venture arm has invested an undisclosed sum into Memphis Meats , the companies announced on Monday. The start-up, led by cardiologist turned CEO Uma Valeti, is on a quest to provide the world with protein that looks, tastes and cooks exactly like meat, but can be grown from cells in a lab, no livestock or farmland required.\nSource: Halo Neuroscience Investors are pouring $13 million in series B funding into Halo Neuroscience , a wearables and brain science company. Halo's headsets and software help athletes, dancers and musicians train their muscles and minds before a big event. TPG Growth led the new round joined by Lux Capital, JAZZ Ventuere Partners and Xfund. The company tested its Halo Sport devices with professional athletes including Olympians and NFL players.\nKleiner Perkins, Greylock and Index Ventures are among investors in a $25 million round for design software venture Figma . The company was founded by college dropouts who were part of Peter Thiel's controversial fellowship program in 2012. Figma is used to make collaboration easier among disparate teams working on any app prototype or digital interface. \nFunds & firms Source: Coursera Andrew Ng, Coursera chairman.

Limited partners in his fund included: NEA, Sequoia, Greylock Partners and the SoftBank Group. \nScience , a start-up incubator in Santa Monica, California closed its first venture fund at $75 million, according to an SEC filing. The incubator helped to launch consumer companies like Urban Remedy, DogVacay (now merged with Rover), and Dollar Shave Club. Unilever acquired Dollar Shave Club in a deal valued at $1 billion in 2016.",
