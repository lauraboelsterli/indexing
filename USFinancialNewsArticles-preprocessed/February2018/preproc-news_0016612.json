    "text": "President Donald Trump has shrunk the size of an office created by President Barack Obama to speed up federal technology, a new report says. \nKnown as 18F, the unit within the General Services Administration has fewer than half the 300 workers it had 18 months ago, according to Fedscoop , a website that tracks tech news in government.\nThe reported 18F attrition rate during the government's last fiscal year, which ended in September, outpaced that of the federal payroll as a whole, other figures show.\nAccording to a report last month from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the federal government employed 2.088 million workers on Sept. 30, 2017, down slightly from 2.097 million a year earlier.\nObama created 18F after website problems slowed initial sign-ups for the Affordable Care Act. The office was tasked with getting government departments to adopt more user-friendly technologies.\nSince then, though, other efforts have sprung up outside of government to help improve American's access to online services.\nOne, called Code for America, has implemented technology-improvement projects that it says have reduced the average time to fill out applications for some federal and state services.\nRead the full report on the GSA's 18F office here.",
