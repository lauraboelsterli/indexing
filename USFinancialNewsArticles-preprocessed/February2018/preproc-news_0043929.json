For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Cheniere Partners Holdings reported net income of $118.5 million, or $0.51 per common share, compared to net income of $17.8 million, or $0.08 per common share, during the corresponding period in 2016. Results include the distribution received from our limited partner interests in Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”), a publicly traded limited partnership (NYSE American: CQP).\nThe increases in net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, were driven by increased equity income from our investment in Cheniere Partners primarily as a result of distributions paid to our subordinated units, an increase in common units held by us subsequent to the conversion of Class B units into common units on August 2, 2017, and an increase in quarterly distributions per unit received from Cheniere Partners.\nOur only business consists of owning Cheniere Partners common units and subordinated units representing an aggregate approximately 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners as of December 31, 2017.\n2018 Full Year Dividend Guidance\n2018 Dividend per Share $ 2.05 - $ 2.25 SPL Project Update\nSPL Project Liquefaction Train Trains 1-3 Train 4 Train 5 Train 6 Project Status Operational Operational Under Construction Permitted Expected Substantial Completion Complete Complete 1H 2019 — Expected DFCD (1) Window Start\nComplete 1H 2018 2H 2019 — (1) Date of First Commercial Delivery\nThrough Cheniere Partners, we are developing up to six natural gas liquefaction Trains (“Trains”) at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities (the “SPL Project”).

Cheniere Partners Holdings’ only business consists of owning Cheniere Partners units and, accordingly, its results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the performance of Cheniere Partners.

Cheniere Partners plans to construct up to six natural gas liquefaction Trains, which are in various stages of development, construction, and operations. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place. Each liquefaction train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Cheniere Partners also owns and operates regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal and the Creole Trail Pipeline, which interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate pipelines.\nFor additional information, please refer to the Cheniere Partners Holdings website at www.cheniere.com and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain statements that may include “forward-looking statements.” All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts or conditions, included herein are “forward-looking statements.” Included among “forward-looking statements” are, among other things, (i) statements regarding Cheniere Partners’ and Cheniere Partners Holdings’ business strategy, plans and objectives, including the development, construction and operation of liquefaction facilities, (ii) statements regarding expectations regarding regulatory authorizations and approvals, (iii) statements expressing beliefs and expectations regarding the development of Cheniere Partners’ LNG terminal and liquefaction business, (iv) statements regarding the business operations and prospects of third parties, (v) statements regarding potential financing arrangements, and (vi) statements regarding future discussions and entry into contracts.
