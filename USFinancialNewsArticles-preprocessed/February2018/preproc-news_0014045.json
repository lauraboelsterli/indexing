    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Latest on the court fight between Google spin-off Waymo and Uber (all times local):\n12:45 p.m.\nThe leader of Google's self-driving car spinoff Waymo says one of the company's former top engineers became \"an enemy\" after he left to found a startup that he later sold to Uber.\nWaymo CEO John Krafcik expressed his disdain for former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski Monday during court testimony. His company sued Uber almost a year ago, alleging that Uber is building a fleet of self-driving cars with technology that Levandowski stole from Waymo.\nUber bought Levandowski's startup, Otto, and appointed him the head of its self-driving car division a few months after Levandowski left Google in January 2016.\nKrafcik testified that he continued to text with Levandowski after he left Google because \"he had gone from someone I had considered a friend to someone I considered an enemy. I needed to understand what he was doing.\"\nLevandowski is expected to testify later in the trial.\n11:15 a.m.\nLawyers for Google spin-off Waymo are depicting Uber as a conniving company that relied on stolen trade secrets to catch up in the race to build self-driving cars. Uber's attorneys are brushing off the allegations as trumped-up claims designed to thwart a rival.\nThe dueling arguments were presented Monday in the opening statements of a high-profile court fight between the two companies.\nWaymo sued Uber nearly a year ago, charging it with building a fleet of self-driving cars with technology stolen by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, who joined Uber in 2016.\nWaymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven likens Uber and its former CEO, Travis Kalanick, to Rosie Ruiz, a runner who cheated to win the women's Boston Marathon in 1980.\nUber lawyer William Carmody highlights internal documents showing that Google hoped to use its self-driving cars to lure business away from Uber.\n11 a.m. Sunday\nA Google-bred pioneer in self-driving cars and Uber's beleaguered ride-hailing service are colliding in a courtroom showdown revolving around allegations of deceit, betrayal, espionage and a high-tech heist that tore apart one-time allies.\nThe trial opening Monday in San Francisco federal court comes nearly a year after Google spin-off Waymo accused Uber of ripping off its self-driving car technology after paying $680 million for a startup run by a former Google engineer.\nGoogle was also an early investor in Uber, a relationship that later soured. Google's parent company Alphabet also owns Waymo.\nThe courtroom drama features an intriguing cast of characters, including former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Google co-founder Larry Page.\nThe civil case already triggered an ongoing criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
