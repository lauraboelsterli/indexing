    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Business Wire, the corporate news release distributor owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, on Friday said it had fended off a cyberattack designed to disable it, and that its system was now “stable.”\nThe announcement came three days after Business Wire said it had been facing a “directed and persistent” denial of service attack since Jan. 31.\nIn Friday’s statement, Business Wire Chief Operating Officer Richard DeLeo said the company had “successfully mitigated the malicious attempts to render our website unavailable.” He also said there was no evidence client information was compromised.
