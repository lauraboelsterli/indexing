    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- National Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:NHLD) (“National” or the “Company”), a leading full service independent brokerage, investment banking, trading and asset management firm providing diverse services including tax preparation, today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2018 first quarter.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights:\nRevenue of $50.1 million, versus $44.6 million for the fiscal first quarter 2017.\nInvestment banking continued to produce excellent results, generating $14.6 million of revenue, versus $9.7 million in the prior year quarter.\nInvestment advisory and commissions revenues improved by $1.9 and $1.1 million respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA declined to $.6 million from a strong $2.1 million in the prior year quarter, on significant infrastructure investment.\nA loss before other expense and income taxes of $.2 million versus comparative profit of $1.6 million in the prior year quarter, again due to infrastructure spending.\nPre-tax loss of $5.8 million includes a non-operating, non-taxable loss of $5.6 million due to a change in the fair value of the firm’s warrant liability. The warrants were issued in early 2017, as part of the previously announced tender offer closing.\nThe current quarter net loss of $8.0 million includes the non-operating, non-taxable $5.6 million loss from the fair value warrant liability change mentioned above, along with a $2.2 million write-off of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the U.S. Federal Corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective in 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents of $31.2 million and no debt as of December 31, 2017 versus $27.9 million as of September 30, 2017.\nEquity of $31.1 million as of December 31, 2017 was impacted by the change in the fair value of warrants outstanding and the write-off of the deferred tax assets noted above.\nManagement Commentary\nMichael Mullen, Chief Executive Officer of National Holdings Corporation stated, “As we continue to advance our company and strive towards a more streamlined business model, it is fantastic to see continued revenue growth quarter over quarter. The team’s hard work is truly paying off as we have seen positive growth in many of our businesses, especially increased revenue in our investment banking and investment advisory divisions.” Mr. Mullen continued, “Most recently we announced the successful completion of a $75,000,000 private placement and debt refinancing for Marrone Bio Innovations. This deal marks a major step forward for our Agribusiness and expands our institutional investor reach in the agriculture market. We are working towards additional value creation in each sector of our business and are extremely pleased with the progress seen thus far.”\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Financial Results\nNational reported first quarter 2018 revenue of $50.1 million, up $5.5 million or 12% over the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Total expenses increased $7.3 million or 17% to $50.3 million in the quarter.\nRevenue\nOur major revenue categories produced very strong results in the current quarter. The majority of the revenue increase in Q1 2018 was recorded in investment banking, which increased to $14.6 million in the quarter, up $4.9 million, or 50%, on an increasingly diverse mix of business.\nCommissions and related revenue increased 3% to $27.9 million. Continuing favorable equity markets and increasing interest in fixed income opportunities drove revenue higher in the quarter.\nInvestment advisory revenue increased $1.9 million, to $5.3 million, up 58% in the current quarter. Increased focus on this segment of our business combined with high asset values produced a very significant current quarter. Our assets under management continue to grow, adding to our percentage of recurring revenue.\nNet dealer inventory gains declined to $.9 million in the current quarter from $2.5 million in the prior year. The uncertainty in fixed income markets due to the new tax reform laws weighed on trading opportunities during the quarter. In addition, a $1.1 million mark down of the firm’s warrant portfolio was recorded during the current quarter.\nTax preparation and accounting revenue declined to $.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, versus $.9 million during the same period in the prior year.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses increased to $50.3 million in the current fiscal quarter, up $7.3 million (17%) over the comparative quarter in fiscal 2017. Variable compensation expenses directly associated with overall revenue generation, and technology and enterprise risk management spending contributed to the majority of the increase.\nCommissions, compensation and fees increased $6.3 million to $43.6 million in the current quarter. The increase in investment banking, commissions, and investment advisory revenue, and therefore compensation expense, contributed to the majority of the increase. As we have previously noted, planned infrastructure spending in technology development and enterprise risk management professionals and the related Incremental employee benefits contributed to the increase.\nOther administrative expenses increased $.6 million, due to higher provisions for potential arbitration settlements and insurance costs.\nLicensing and registration increased $.2 million, and professional fees increased $.1 million, mainly due to software licensing and technology consultants in the current quarter.\nEarnings\nThe loss before other expense and income taxes totaled $.2 million versus income of $1.6 million in the prior year quarter. The loss before income taxes, which includes the change in the fair value of the firm’s warrant liability, totaled $5.8 million, versus income of $5.7 million in the prior year quarter. The change in the fair value of the firm’s warrant liability is a market based adjustment that negatively impacted earnings in the current quarter as noted, however positively impacted earnings in the prior year quarter by $4.1 million.\nThe impact of the re-valuation of the firm’s warrant liability is a non-operating, non-taxable earnings adjustment and should be viewed as such.\nThe net loss for the current quarter totaled $8.0 million, versus income of $5.1 million in the prior year quarter. In addition to the warrant liability adjustment noted above, a write-off of $2.2 million of the firm’s deferred tax asset was recorded due to the change in the U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax rate to 21%.\nThe net loss per share, both basic and fully diluted, was $.65 in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, versus net income per share of $.41 in the comparable 2017 quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased to $.6 million in the current quarter, from $2.1 million in prior year quarter.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, National had $31.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, versus $27.9 million as of September 30, 2017. The Company's balance sheet remains debt free.\nAbout National Holdings Corporation\nNational Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:NHLD) is a full-service investment banking and asset management firm that, through its affiliates, provides a range of services, including independent retail brokerage and advisory services, investment banking, institutional sales and trading, equity research, financial planning, market making, tax preparation and insurance, to corporations, institutions, high net-worth and retail investors.
