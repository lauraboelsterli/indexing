    "text": "MACHESNEY PARK, Ill., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Urgent care software solutions company Practice Velocity is growing, adding two new leaders to its core leadership team of urgent care experts. Practice Velocity is pleased to announce that Jaimie Kowalski has joined the company as vice president of marketing, and Joshua Porter has joined the company as vice president of business development.\nAbout Jaimie Kowalski\nJaimie Kowalski is not a typical marketer, and that is exactly why Practice Velocity's leadership team chose her to lead the marketing team at Practice Velocity as the new vice president of marketing. Unlike traditional marketers, Kowalski is never satisfied with the way things have \"always been done.\" She looks for innovative ways to use new technology and data sources to reach the right people at the right time with messages they actually want to get.\nKowalski brings 20 years of marketing experience to Practice Velocity's marketing team, including marketing leadership roles for Zurich, Chase, Sears Holdings and UniCarriers Americas. She has also held marketing roles at United Paramount Network, Fox Network and Leo Burnett. She earned her bachelor's degree in marketing management from Columbia College and her executive MBA from Lake Forest Graduate School of Management.\nAs vice president of marketing for Practice Velocity, Kowalski will lead the high-level strategy for the company's branding, planning, execution and analytics. She plans to use her strong business sense and love for data and analytics to ensure the marketing team's efforts drive positive returns for the company.\n\"Practice Velocity already has a strong marketing team,\" says Kowalski. \"I hope to build off that foundation by instilling strategic planning into everything we do to ensure marketing connects to quantifiable business goals, analytics and optimization.\"\nBesides the opportunity to lead such a strong team of marketers, Kowalski says the most exciting part about starting her new role is joining Practice Velocity's unique company culture. \"I am very excited about joining a truly different culture,\" says Kowalski. \"Advertising and marketing can be such a cutthroat industry, but the leadership team at Practice Velocity spends a great deal of time and money fostering a culture that breathes positive energy and teamwork. It's truly a great place to work.\"\nAbout Joshua Porter\nJoshua Porter isn't your everyday \"slap you on the back\" salesman. He's a natural born communicator who's skilled at showing his customers just how a product or service can help them improve their businesses. Those communication skills will be a valuable asset in his new role as vice president of business development for Practice Velocity.\nPorter's background is in communications, market analysis and health care delivery in various outpatient service lines, and he brings 20 years of health care sales experience to Practice Velocity. Over the last decade, he sold electronic medical records and revenue cycle management software in both the hospital and ambulatory markets. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from the University of Dubuque and a Master of Arts in Mass Communication from The University of Iowa.\nAs vice president of business development, Porter will focus his efforts on outside sales opportunities with larger urgent care group chains, joint ventures and hospital affiliated urgent cares. Porter will sell Practice Velocity's service line of urgent care-specific solutions, including the company's top-ranked EMR VelociDocâ„¢, PVM practice management software and the company's full range of revenue cycle management services.\n\"I'm really excited to give Practice Velocity that next-level presence in the market,\" says Porter. \"The company has already attracted some larger clients, and now it's up to me to build on that momentum and boost the strategic growth pattern that the company has had.\"\nAlthough Porter believes Practice Velocity has a great product to sell, it's actually the people behind the product that makes Porter truly excited about joining the company.\n\"The culture at Practice Velocity was very attractive to me,\" says Porter. \"There's a lot of excitement in that building, and I picked up on that vibe when I went there to interview. Everyone seems excited and committed to what they're doing, and the office has this Silicon Valley vibe. It's obviously a great product, and when you combine that with great people who work there, it makes that an exciting place to want to work.\"\nAbout Practice Velocity\nPractice Velocity provides a full scope of industry-leading medical software and services designed to improve efficiency, support delivery of quality care, and maximize revenue for urgent care centers, occupational medicine clinics, primary care physicians and outpatient specialty providers. More than 800 urgent care clinics in all 50 states have used Practice Velocity's products and services to improve performance and build successful businesses.
