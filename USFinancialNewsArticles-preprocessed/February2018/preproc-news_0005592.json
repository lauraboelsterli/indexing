Results are calculated using the “sell-in” method of revenue recognition on sales to distributors, reflecting the company’s adoption of ASC 606 effective January 1, 2017. Prior-year results have been recast as if ASC 606 had been in effect for those periods.\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter were $108.2 million, a decrease of three percent from the prior quarter and an increase of six percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the quarter was $16.9 million or $0.57 per share, compared to net income of $0.54 per diluted share in the prior quarter and net income of $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth-quarter loss includes a net charge of $37.5 million resulting from the 2017 tax legislation. Cash flow from operations was $27.4 million for the quarter.\nIn addition to its GAAP results, the company provided certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, the tax effects of these items, and the fourth-quarter charge resulting from the 2017 tax legislation. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $22.7 million or $0.74 per diluted share, compared with $0.78 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full year, net revenues were $431.8 million, an increase of 11 percent from the prior year. GAAP net income, which includes the impact of the tax charge, was $27.6 million or $0.90 per diluted share compared to $1.65 per diluted share for the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $86.6 million or $2.84 per diluted share compared to $2.53 per diluted share for the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $82.0 million for the full year.\nCommented Balu Balakrishnan, president and CEO of Power Integrations: “We are pleased to report double-digit growth in annual revenues and non-GAAP earnings again in 2017. Revenues from the industrial market grew 20 percent for the year, while the consumer category grew more than 15 percent driven by appliance applications. Together, these two end-markets accounted for more than 70 percent of our sales in 2017.\n“While demand has moderated of late, particularly in the handset and appliance markets, we expect continued growth in 2018 and beyond, driven by trends such as energy efficiency, clean energy, IoT, faster charging, the switch to battery-powered motors for tools and transportation, and the mass adoption of convenience and comfort appliances in emerging markets. These trends are driving demand for increasingly innovative power-conversion technologies, and we are especially well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.”\nAdditional Highlights\nPower Integrations paid a dividend of $0.14 per share on December 29, 2017. A dividend of $0.16 per share is scheduled to be paid on March 30, 2018, to stockholders of record as of February 28, 2018. Power Integrations repurchased approximately 33,000 shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter, and had $44.4 million remaining on its repurchase authorization at year-end. The company’s board of directors has subsequently increased the repurchase authorization by a further $30 million. Power Integrations was issued eight U.S. patents during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Outlook\nThe company issued the following forecast for the first quarter of 2018:\nRevenues are expected to be $103 million plus or minus $3 million. GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 50.3 percent; non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 51.5 percent. (The difference between the expected GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins is composed of approximately 0.9 percentage points from amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and 0.3 percentage points from stock-based compensation.) GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $41 million and $41.5 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $34 million and $34.5 million. (Non-GAAP expenses are expected to exclude approximately $6.5 million of stock-based compensation and $0.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.)\nConference Call Today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time\nPower Integrations management will hold a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. Members of the investment community can join the call by dialing 1-647-689-4187. The call will also be available on the investor section of the company's website, http://investors.power.com .\nAbout Power Integrations\nPower Integrations, Inc. is a leading innovator in semiconductor technologies for high-voltage power conversion. The company’s products are key building blocks in the clean-power ecosystem, enabling the generation of renewable energy as well as the efficient transmission and consumption of power in applications ranging from milliwatts to megawatts. For more information please visit www.power.com .\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the company's consolidated financial statements, which are presented according to GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information that excludes stock-based compensation expenses recorded under ASC 718-10, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (including in-place lease intangible assets), the tax effects of these items, and a charge related to the 2017 tax legislation. The company uses these measures in its financial and operational decision-making and, with respect to one measure, in setting performance targets for compensation purposes. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures offer important analytical tools to help investors understand its operating results, and to facilitate comparability with the results of companies that provide similar measures. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. For example, stock-based compensation is an important component of the company’s compensation mix, and will continue to result in significant expenses in the company’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future, but is not reflected in the non-GAAP measures. Also, other companies, including companies in Power Integrations’ industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are attached to this press release.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe statements in this press release regarding the company’s forecast for its first-quarter financial performance and continued growth in 2018 and beyond are forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations and beliefs. These forward-looking statements are based on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, actual projected or implied by these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in global macroeconomic conditions, which may impact the level of demand for the company’s products; potential changes and shifts in customer demand away from end products that utilize the company's integrated circuits to end products that do not incorporate the company's products; the effects of competition, which may cause the company’s revenues to decrease or cause the company to decrease its selling prices for its products; the outcome and cost of patent litigation, which may affect sales of the company’s products or could result in higher expenses and charges than currently expected; unforeseen costs and expenses; and unfavorable fluctuations in component costs or operating expenses resulting from changes in commodity prices and/or exchange rates. In addition, new product introductions and design wins are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the marketplace, including product development delays and defects and market acceptance of the new products. These and other risk factors that may cause actual results to differ are more fully explained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 8, 2017. The company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nPower Integrations and the Power Integrations logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Power Integrations, Inc.\nPOWER INTEGRATIONS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in thousands, except per-share amounts)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 NET REVENUES $ 108,249 $ 111,255 $ 102,436 $ 431,755 $ 389,668 COST OF REVENUES 54,221 55,542 52,360 218,091 197,477 GROSS PROFIT 54,028 55,713 50,076 213,664 192,191 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 17,180 17,340 15,766 68,501 62,310 Sales and marketing 12,743 12,254 11,941 49,237 45,535 General and administrative 9,127 9,546 8,257 36,142 33,029 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 513 514 584 2,147 2,443 Total operating expenses 39,563 39,654 36,548 156,027 143,317 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS 14,465 16,059 13,528 57,637 48,874 Other income, net 796 895 299 2,662 1,078 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 15,261 16,954 13,827 60,299 49,952 PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES 32,159 448 (476 ) 32,690 1,054 NET INCOME (LOSS) $ (16,898 ) $ 16,506 $ 14,303 $ 27,609 $ 48,898 EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE: Basic $ (0.57 ) $ 0.55 $ 0.49 $ 0.93 $ 1.69 Diluted $ (0.57 ) $ 0.54 $ 0.48 $ 0.90 $ 1.65 SHARES USED IN PER-SHARE CALCULATION: Basic 29,759 29,759 29,196 29,674 28,925 Diluted 29,759 30,614 29,914 30,545 29,619 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Stock-based compensation expenses included in: Cost of revenues $ 436 $ 391 $ 417 $ 1,321 $ 1,148 Research and development 2,338 2,173 1,966 8,496 7,309 Sales and marketing 1,470 1,441 1,260 5,197 4,489 General and administrative 2,611 2,521 2,025 9,663 7,939 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 6,855 $ 6,526 $ 5,668 $ 24,677 $ 20,885 Cost of revenues includes: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets $ 939 $ 939 $ 939 $ 3,756 $ 3,785 General & administrative expenses include: Patent-litigation expenses $ 1,914 $ 2,302 $ 2,150 $ 7,839 $ 6,861 Other income, net includes: Amortization of in-place lease intangible assets $ -
