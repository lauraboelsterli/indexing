Analysts at Citi had forecast an interim profit of A$500 million.\nThe company raised its half-year dividend to 54 cents a share from 41 cents a year ago.\nAGL said it expects underlying profit for the year to June to land in the middle of its forecast range of A$940 million and A$1.04 billion, in line with analysts’ consensus forecast for a profit of A$1.02 billion.\nSome investors who had bet the company would upgrade its forecast sent its shares down as much as 4.3 percent to a 14-month low in early trade. The shares last traded down 1.9 percent in a broader market down 0.4 percent.\nWholesale power prices doubled last summer to nearly A$250 a megawatt hour (MWh) in some states, as gas prices for generation soared, but have now dropped to between A$75 and A$150 per MWh. Redman said they are consolidating around that level now.\n“What we wouldn’t expect is a big jump up in wholesale prices going forward,” he said in an interview.\nAGL is looking to fill a looming gas supply shortfall in southeast Australia and break the grip of the market’s major gas suppliers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and BHP Billiton .\n“There is a queue at our door a mile long both from suppliers of gas and suppliers of equipment that see us as a great counterparty and want to work with us,” Redman said.\n“We continue to find that that business case is building.”\nHe said there is money to be made playing the arbitrage between weak LNG prices in the northern hemisphere summer which coincides with Australia’s winter, when gas prices are high.\n$1 = 1.2789 Australian dollars Reporting by Sumeet Gaikwad in Bengaluru; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Richard Pullin\n ",
