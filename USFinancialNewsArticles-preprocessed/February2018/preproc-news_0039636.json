    "text": " 21 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Freestyle skiing - Abramenko wins aerials gold after tense final Jack Tarrant 1 Min Read PYEONGCHANG,   Oleksandr Abramenko won Olympic freestyle skiing gold for Ukraine in the men’s aerials competition on Sunday. China’s Jia Zongyang took home the silver medal, while Olympic Athlete from Russia Ilia Burov secured the bronze. The final consisted of three rounds, with the three lowest-scoring athletes being eliminated at each stage. The highest score from the final round won gold. Once the field was reduced to the final six, the tension was palpable as each athlete took their final jump. Abramenko raised the bar, scoring 128.51 to lead going into the final three jumps. He still led as Jia took to the hill on the last jump of the final. The Sochi bronze medallist landed his jump but could not usurp the Ukrainian, scoring 128.05 to take silver. The result meant Belarus did not have a man on the aerials podium for the first time since its Olympic debut in 1994. Editing by Clare Fallon",
