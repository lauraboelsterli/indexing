    "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - The value of Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, will fluctuate by 900 billion crowns and more, its CEO said on Tuesday, as the fund relies less on income from Norway’s oil production and more on the value of stock markets.\n“We have to expect significant swings in coming years ... We have to expect value swings of more than 900 billion crowns ($114.93 billion),” Yngve Slyngstad told a news conference.\nReporting by Gwladys Fouche and Alister Doyle, editing by Terje Solsvik\n ",
