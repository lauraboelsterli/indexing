    "text": "Full Year Total Revenue Grows 31% Year over Year\nFourth Quarter Average Revenue Per Subscriber Grows 31% Year over Year\nSAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MINDBODY, Inc. (NASDAQ:MB), the leading technology platform for the wellness services industry, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year .\n“This was the most successful year in MINDBODY history,” said Rick Stollmeyer, co-founder and chief executive officer of MINDBODY. “Throughout 2017, our platform delivered strong growth in total sessions booked, payments volume, and direct consumer engagement. We also saw rapid expansion of promoted introductory offer purchases and impressive early adoption of dynamic pricing in Q4. These results all point to the growing momentum of our transaction-enabled marketplace, which focuses on adding the right customers to our platform and promoting their offerings to an ever larger consumer audience. In the year ahead, we will leverage this momentum and the acquisition of FitMetrix to further engage with the best customers and accelerate consumer adoption. Our purpose is connecting the world to wellness, and we intend to help more people live healthier, happier lives than ever before.”\n“The fourth quarter underscored the ongoing success of our refined growth strategy, with consistent revenue growth, record ARPS growth and the best margins in our history,” said Brett White, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. “Our excellent unit economics and improving operating leverage enabled us to deliver positive non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and the full year, while still investing substantially in product and growth.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $49.7 million, a 30% increase year over year.

Subscription and services revenue for the full year of 2017 was $109.2 million, a 32% increase year over year.

Appointed Mark Baker as Chief Revenue Officer of MINDBODY. Baker will focus on aligning the customer facing teams and building sales strategies and structures that contribute to the company’s growth. Baker will report directly to MINDBODY President Mike Mansbach, and will oversee global sales, customer support and business development. Named to Deloitte’s 2017 Technology Fast 500 for the sixth time.\nFourth Quarter Key Metrics\nWe regularly review the following key metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, make strategic business decisions and assess working capital needs.\nAs of and for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 2016 YoY Subscribers (end of period) 58,584 60,385 (3 )% Average monthly revenue per subscriber $ 278 $ 212 31 % Payments volume (in billions) $ 2.1 $ 1.7 23 % Dollar-based net expansion rate (end of period) 107 % 108 % 1 A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nOutlook\nOn January 1, 2018, MINDBODY adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, using the modified retrospective method. The guidance below is provided utilizing ASC 606.\nFor the first quarter and full year 2018, MINDBODY expects to report:\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 in the range of $53.0 million to $54.5 million, representing 26% to 29% growth over the first quarter of 2017. Revenue for the full year of 2018 in the range of $230.0 million to $236.0 million, representing 26% to 29% growth over the full year of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 in the range of $1.3 million to $2.3 million and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of approximately 50.1 million shares. Non-GAAP net income for the full year of 2018 in the range of $9.0 million to $13.0 million and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the full year of approximately 50.6 million shares.\nThe outlook for non-GAAP net income excludes estimates for, among others, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis because we do not provide guidance on GAAP net loss, primarily as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by MINDBODY’s future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of MINDBODY’s Class A common stock, all of which is difficult to predict and is subject to constant change. The actual amount of these expenses during 2018 will have a significant impact on MINDBODY’s future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.\nQuarterly Conference Call and Related Information\nMINDBODY will discuss its quarterly results today at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET)\nDial in : To access the call, please dial (844) 494-0191, or outside the U.S. (508) 637-5581, with Conference ID# 2857818 at least five minutes prior to the 1:30 p.m. PT start time.

We disclose the following historical non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in understanding and evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our GAAP financial results. We have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss before stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, provision for income taxes, and other expense, net, which consisted of interest income (expense), net, and other income (expense), net.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Adjusted EBITDA has a number of limitations, including the following: (1) although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation, or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (3) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balance attributable to common stockholders adjusted for: (1) stock-based compensation expense and (2) amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP net income per share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net loss per share, is calculated as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding. These non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations, including the following: these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in MINDBODY’s business; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may exclude different non-recurring items in their calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations:\nNicole Gunderson\nIR@mindbodyonline.com\n888-782-7155\nMedia Contact:\nJennifer Saxon\njennifer.saxon@mindbodyonline.com\n805-419-2839\nMINDBODY, INC.
