    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 1:27 PM / Updated an hour ago Macron still backs pan-EU parliament lists despite Strasbourg setback Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will continue to push for the creation of transnational lists for European parliament elections in years to come, despite the assembly in Strasbourg voting on Wednesday against the proposal for the 2019 election. \n“France will continue to defend this idea in months and years to come because it would contribute to strengthening European democracy by creating debates on European challenges and not strictly national ones during EU elections,” Macron’s office said in a statement. \nThe European parliament was voting on the reallocation of Britain’s 73 seats after Brexit. Macron had proposed in a speech in Athens in September that some of these seats should go to Europe-wide constituencies instead of national ones as is the case currently.
