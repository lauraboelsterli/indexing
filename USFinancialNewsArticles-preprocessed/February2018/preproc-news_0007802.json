Drugmaker Dermapharm plans to list on Feb. 9.\nThe placement will comprise 7 million new shares from a capital increase and 13.35 million shares from fund holdings by ActivumSG Capital Management at a price of 21.50 to 25.50 euros each, the company said on Friday.\nUp to 3.05 million shares from ActivumSG have also been earmarked for over-allotments.\nThat will give the company a market capitalisation of between 795 million euros and 943 million euros, Instone said.\nDeutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are organising the flotation with the help of Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Unicredit.\nInstone was formed by a merger of peer GRK and Formart, part of German builder Hochtief, which specialist real estate investor Activum bought in 2014 for about 300 million euros.
