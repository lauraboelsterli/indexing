    "text": "EMERYVILLE, Calif., Amyris, Inc. (Nasdaq:AMRS) will report financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 after market close on Thursday, March 15, 2018. The company noted that it has completed fiscal 2017 above expectations and expects to report anticipated unaudited full-year revenue above the high end of the company’s prior anticipated annual revenue outlook of $130-132 million and with gross margin to significantly exceed the stated 2017 target of above 50 percent for the company.
