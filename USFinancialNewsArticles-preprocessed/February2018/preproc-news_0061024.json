(NASDAQ:PCRX) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 and its outlook for 2018.\n“2017 was a year of solid progress and set the stage for an important year ahead,” said Dave Stack, chairman and chief executive officer of Pacira. “EXPAREL has now been used in over 3.5 million patients across the United States and continues to grow. We remain steadfast in our mission to provide a non-opioid option to as many patients as possible, including defining the next steps for the expanded nerve block indication through our pending sNDA. Our strategic partnership with Johnson & Johnson continues to drive EXPAREL use within the orthopedic setting. In addition, we are advancing key collaborations to support best-practice opioid minimization strategies. Finally, our education and awareness campaigns are bearing fruit as more and more key stakeholders including patients, physicians, medical societies and advocacy organizations are recognizing and appreciating the benefits of non-opioid postsurgical pain control.”\nHighlights and Recent Events\nCollaboration with The University of Tennessee Medical Center and CQ-Insights to minimize opioid use after hernia surgery. In February 2018, The University of Tennessee Medical Center and Pacira announced a continuous quality improvement (CQI) project designed to develop low-or no-opioid postsurgical pain management pathways for patients undergoing one of the most common surgical procedures, hernia surgery.\nFDA’s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee did not support approval of the EXPAREL sNDA for nerve block. In February 2018, the FDA’s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee’s (AADPAC) reviewed the company’s supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, seeking expansion of the EXPAREL label to include administration via nerve block for prolonged regional analgesia. The AADPAC voted six to four against approval of the expanded indication. The committee’s feedback will be considered for the FDA in its review of the sNDA. The FDA’s Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for completion of its review is April 6, 2018.\nPartnership with WellStar Health Systems to minimize opioid use and standardize outcomes across surgical procedures. In January 2018, WellStar Health System, the largest health system in Georgia, and Pacira announced a joint commitment to address opioid use and dependence following surgery. Through a comprehensive opioid minimization strategy, the organizations will work together to educate hospital clinicians and administrators about the burden of postsurgical opioids; develop enhanced recovery protocols to reduce use in key surgical procedures; and standardize the rollout of these protocols across WellStar’s 11 hospitals.\nPromotions of Scott Braunstein, MD, to Chief Operating Officer and Richard Scranton, MD, to Chief Scientific Officer. In December 2017, Scott Braunstein, MD, was named Chief Operating Officer and Richard Scranton, MD, was named Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Braunstein is overseeing the company’s commercial and medical affairs functions while continuing to manage strategy and corporate development. As Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Scranton is directing the company’s clinical research while continuing to lead scientific communications, market access, and health outcomes research and analytics for EXPAREL.\nCollaboration with Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative to minimize opioid exposure for postsurgical patients. In December 2017, the Illinois Surgical Quality Improvement Collaborative, a nationally recognized partnership of 56 Illinois hospitals, and Pacira announced an initiative to jointly develop programs and resources that will support best practice pain management prescribing for surgical patients throughout the state of Illinois. The focus of the initiative is to develop and provide intensive, interactive educational tools for hospitals in order to improve adherence to evidence-based best practices for perioperative pain management.\nCollaboration with Cancer Treatment Centers of America® to educate physicians and patients about responsible opioid use. In November 2017, Cancer Treatment Centers of America, a national network of five hospitals and Pacira announced a new collaboration dedicated to reducing the risk of opioid dependence among cancer patients. The goal of the Opioid Risk Reduction Initiative—an education effort focused on responsible use and increased awareness of opioid alternatives—is to improve the cancer patient experience through expanded pain management options.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nEXPAREL net product sales were $78.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 10% increase over the $71.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal revenues were $79.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an 8% increase over the $72.9 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal operating expenses were $70.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $75.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP net income was $4.6 million, or $0.11 per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a GAAP net loss of $4.0 million, or $0.11 per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $16.0 million, or $0.39 per share (basic) and $0.38 per share (diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to non-GAAP net income of $3.6 million, or $0.10 per share (basic) and $0.09 per share (diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPacira had 40.6 million basic weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPacira had 41.6 million diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Results\nEXPAREL net product sales were $282.9 million in 2017, a 6% increase over the $265.8 million reported in 2016.\nTotal revenues were $286.6 million in 2017, a 4% increase over the $276.4 million reported in 2016.\nTotal operating expenses were $311.6 million in 2017, compared to $308.4 million in 2016.\nGAAP net loss was $42.6 million, or $1.07 per share (basic and diluted) in 2017, compared to a GAAP net loss of $37.9 million, or $1.02 per share (basic and diluted) in 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income was $8.6 million, or $0.22 per share (basic) and $0.21 per share (diluted), in 2017, compared to non-GAAP net income of $25.2 million, or $0.68 per share (basic) and $0.62 per share (diluted), in 2016.\nPacira ended 2017 with cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments (“cash”) of $371.4 million.\nPacira had 39.8 million basic weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in 2017.\nFor non-GAAP measures, Pacira had 41.4 million diluted weighted average shares of common stock outstanding in 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nPacira announces its full year 2018 financial guidance as follows.

Pacira management uses these measures to better analyze its financial results, estimate its future cost of goods sold, gross margins, R&D expense and SG&A expense outlook for 2018 and to help make managerial decisions. In management’s opinion, these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements by providing greater transparency into the operating performance at Pacira and the company’s future outlook. Such measures should not be deemed to be an alternative to GAAP requirements or a measure of liquidity for Pacira. Non-GAAP measures are also unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP disclosures released by other companies. See the tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP 2018 financial guidance for gross margins, R&D expense and SG&A expense.\nAbout Pacira\nPacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PCRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing and improving postsurgical outcomes for acute care practitioners and their patients. The company’s flagship product, EXPAREL ® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), is redefining pain management after surgery as an opioid-free alternative indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. EXPAREL utilizes DepoFoam ® , a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over a desired period of time. To learn more about Pacira, including the corporate mission to reduce overreliance on opioids, visit www.pacira.com .\nAbout EXPAREL ®\nEXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is currently indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam ® , a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a 45 percent decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at www.EXPAREL.com .\nImportant Safety Information\nEXPAREL is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) following EXPAREL administration were nausea, constipation, and vomiting. EXPAREL is not recommended to be used in the following patient population: patients <18 years old and/or pregnant patients. Because amide-type local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, are metabolized by the liver, EXPAREL should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease. Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally, are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations. EXPAREL is not recommended for the following types or routes of administration: epidural, intrathecal, regional nerve blocks, or intravascular or intra-articular use. Non-bupivacaine-based local anesthetics, including lidocaine, may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from EXPAREL if administered together locally. The administration of EXPAREL may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of 20 minutes or more. Formulations of bupivacaine other than EXPAREL should not be administered within 96 hours following administration of EXPAREL. Central Nervous System (CNS) Reactions: There have been reports of adverse neurologic reactions with the use of local anesthetics. These include persistent anesthesia and paresthesias. CNS reactions are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Cardiovascular System Reactions: Toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conductivity and excitability which may lead to dysrhythmias sometimes leading to death. Allergic Reactions: Allergic-type reactions (eg, anaphylaxis and angioedema) are rare and may occur as a result of hypersensitivity to the local anesthetic or to other formulation ingredients. Chondrolysis: There have been reports of chondrolysis (mostly in the shoulder joint) following intra-articular infusion of local anesthetics, which is an unapproved use.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements in this press release about the company’s future expectations, plans, outlook and prospects, and other statements containing the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
