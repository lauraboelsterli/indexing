    "text": "BONN, Germany, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom forecast that core earnings and cash flow would grow in 2018 as Chief Executive Tim Hoettges, just handed a contract extension, invests in ultra-fast broadband and lays the ground for fifth-generation mobile services.\nEuropeâ€™s largest mobile operator said on Thursday it expected adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to grow by 4 percent this year to 23.2 billion euros ($28.5 billion).\nFree cash flow was forecast to rise by 12 percent to 6.2 billion euros.\nReporting fourth-quarter results, Telekom said that adjusted EBITDA fell by 4.7 percent to 5.02 billion euros - shy of average expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts.
