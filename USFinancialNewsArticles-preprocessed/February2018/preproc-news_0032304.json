    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 12:16 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Royal joyride - Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan wedding day carriage tour Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle will celebrate their wedding day with members of the public by taking a carriage ride through the English town of Windsor, the prince’s office at Kensington Palace said on Monday. \nQueen Elizabeth’s grandson, fifth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, who stars in the U.S. TV legal drama “Suits”, announced their engagement last year and their marriage is to take place on May 19 in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. \nShortly after a midday wedding ceremony, the couple will make their first public appearance as husband and wife in a roughly two mile carriage procession. \n“They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day,” Kensington Palace said in a statement, setting out new details of the wedding day. Britain's Prince Harry whispers to Meghan Markle as they watch a performance by a Welsh choir in the banqueting hall during a visit to Cardiff Castle in Cardiff, Britain, January 18, 2018. REUTERS/Ben Birchall/Pool/File Photo \nThe route will finish with a ride up the long, broad 17th century parkland avenue that leads to Windsor Castle, home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years. \nTheir exchange of wedding vows will be officiated by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion. The wedding service itself will be conducted by Dean of Windsor, David Conner. Slideshow (6 Images) \nThe wedding is likely to attract huge attention around the world, as did the marriage of Harry’s elder brother William to Kate Middleton in 2011, which was watched by an estimated two billion people. \nKensington palace said Harry and Markle would join guests at a reception inside Windsor Castle after the procession. Harry’s father, Prince Charles, would later host an evening reception for close friends and family. \nMarkle, who is a divorcee, met Harry in July 2016 after they were introduced through a mutual friend, with both knowing little about the other. After just two dates, the couple decided to go on holiday together to Botswana. Reporting by William James; Editing by Gareth Jones",
