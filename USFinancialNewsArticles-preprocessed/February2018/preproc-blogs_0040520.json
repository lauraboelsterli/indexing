    "text": "Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz., sat down to talk to CNBC's John Harwood on an array of issues. Here, the retiring conservative lawmaker discusses how the White House, specifically chief of staff John Kelly , handled the Rob Porter domestic abuse scandal.\nJOHN HARWOOD: What do you conclude from the Rob Porter situation about the competence and character of this White House?\nSEN. JEFF FLAKE: Well, I think it was handled extremely poorly. Some of them have admitted that â€” others, not so much. But it was handled poorly. And there's a problem long term if we have dozens of people acting on interim security clearances, viewing classified material, handling classified material and getting those briefings. It's not a good situation. I've already written to the administration, asking for answers on a few things.\nHARWOOD: Do you think the president needs a new chief of staff?\nFLAKE: That's his choice to make.\nHARWOOD: But what's your view?\nFLAKE: I don't think he was well served on this issue. On other issues, he's been better served. I've had disagreements with the chief of staff.\nHARWOOD: So do you think this is something he could get past and be effective?\nFLAKE: I don't know. We'll see, but probably. I mean, this is a tough job. Anybody who has a chief of staff job in this White House has got his work cut out for him, or her work cut out for her.",
