I‘m absolutely clear that EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay,” May said in parliament. “It’s going to be a digital system, it’ll be streamlined, it’ll be user friendly, and it will ensure that this is as simple and as easy a process for people as we can provide.” Reporting By Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Alisair Smout",
