The S&P 500 gained 13.44 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,744.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.82 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,281.25.\nBoth the S&P 500 and Dow indexes have gained 4.8 percent in the past four sessions, putting the S&P on track for its best week since January 2013 and the Dow’s best since November 2016.\nThe Nasdaq’s 6 percent gain since Monday has set it on course for its strongest week since December 2011.\nInvestors are trying to determine whether the market is in an overdue correction or the beginning of something worse, Arone said.\n“It looks like this week they’re comfortable about uncertainty and the risks that are associated with it and stocks are moving higher based on fundamentals,” he said.\nBorrowing costs across the euro area fell, though the prospect of higher inflation and a move toward tighter monetary policy from major central banks weighed on sentiment across world bond markets.\nShort-dated bond yields in Germany, the euro zone’s benchmark bond issuer, have risen by about 7 basis points this week and are set for their biggest weekly rise in eight weeks.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 9/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8604 percent.\nThe dollar rose on the day but remained on track to record its biggest weekly loss in nine months, as negative sentiment offset any support the greenback could take from higher Treasury yields.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.36 percent, with the euro down 0.5 percent to $1.2442. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04 percent versus the greenback at 106.09 per dollar.\nOil prices rose slightly, as the rebound in the global equities market and the dollar’s recent weakness supported their recovery from last week’s slide.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery rose 47 cents at $61.81 a barrel. Brent rose 75 cents to $65.08.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ",
