    "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Scali Rasmussen attorney Monica J. Baumann will be inducted to the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Law Foundation , a regional support organization led by high-profile leaders in the legal community. Baumann will attend her first meeting as a board member and be inducted to her two-year term when the board convenes in March.\n\"It's a fantastic opportunity to give back to the community and develop greater connections in the legal community,\" said Baumann, a litigator and adviser with extensive experience in the automotive industry and in consumer environmental litigation, including Proposition 65 issues.\nThe SLF, is a charitable 501c(3) organization separate from and independent of the Sacramento County Bar Association. The group provides grants to organizations that improve the administration of justice, enhance public confidence in the legal profession, cultivate understanding of and respect for the rule of law, and support law-related public services.\nBefore joining Scali Rasmussen, Baumann was the California New Car Dealers Association's (CNCDA) Director of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, overseeing cutting-edge, industry-affecting litigation, assisting in the preparation and presentation of new legislation affecting auto dealers in California and overseeing CNCDA dealer manuals. She spearheaded the first ever CNCDA Employment Law Manual and presented numerous educational compliance seminars to auto dealers.\nBaumann also achieved much success advising and defending clients in a wide array of environmental compliance matters, including Proposition 65 , labeling issues, and product liability, at the Sacramento office of international law firm Greenberg Traurig.\nFor more information, visit ScaliRasmussen.com .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scali-rasmussens-monica-baumann-named-to-sacramento-law-foundation-300596309.html\nSOURCE Scali Rasmussen",
