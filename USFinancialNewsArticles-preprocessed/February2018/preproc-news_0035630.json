    "text": "ROSEMONT, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE: USFD), one of the largest foodservice distributors in the United States, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal case volume increased 1.9%; independent restaurant case volume increased 7.1% Net sales increased 5.6% to $6.0 billion Gross profit of $1.1 billion increased 4.6% Operating income increased $66 million to $182 million Net income of $256 million increased $179 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.4% to $290 million Diluted EPS of $1.15; Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.44\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights\nTotal case volume increased 2.9%, independent restaurant case volume increased 5.2% Net sales increased 5.4% to $24.1 billion Gross profit of $4.2 billion increased 4.1% Operating income increased $160 million to $574 million Net income of $444 million increased $234 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.8% to $1.1 billion Diluted EPS of $1.97; Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.38\nCEO Perspective\n“We had a strong year and delivered on our commitments to expand Gross profit dollars and grow Adjusted EBITDA,” said Chairman and CEO Pietro Satriano. “Through the continued execution of our Great Food. Made Easy. strategy, we increased sales with our targeted customers, including accelerating quarterly volume growth with Independent Restaurants. In 2018, we will continue to leverage our innovative products, industry-leading technology and value-added services to drive profitable growth.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal case volume increased 1.9% from the prior year, of which 0.9% was organic growth, and independent restaurant case volume increased 7.1%, of which 5.2% was organic growth. The increase in total case volume was driven by strong growth with targeted independent restaurant, healthcare and hospitality customers, partially offset by the planned exit of select national chain customers.\nNet sales of $6.0 billion increased 5.6% from the prior year, driven by total case volume growth, product mix changes, and year-over-year inflation mainly in produce, beef, dairy and grocery categories. Sales from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 increased Net sales by approximately 1.7%.\nGross profit of $1.1 billion increased $47 million or 4.6% from the prior year, driven by higher case volumes and margin expansion initiatives, partially offset by higher inbound freight costs related to increases in freight market pricing. Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was 17.9%. Adjusted Gross profit was $1.1 billion, a 3.9% increase from prior year, driven by higher case volumes and margin expansion initiatives. Adjusted Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was 17.9%.\nOperating expenses were $892 million, a decrease of 2.1% from the prior year. Consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2017, operating expenses benefitted from lower restructuring costs, lower depreciation and amortization expense due to the full amortization of an intangible asset, and ongoing efforts to reduce operating expenses. These benefits were partially offset by incremental expenses related to higher case volumes and wage costs. Adjusted Operating expenses for the quarter were $784 million, a 2.1% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by higher case volumes.\nOperating income was $182 million, a $66 million increase from the prior year.\nNet income for the quarter was $256 million, up $179 million from $77 million in the prior year, as a result of the volume, Gross profit and Operating expense factors discussed above as well as benefits from recent U.S. federal income tax legislation. The recent passage of U.S. tax reform legislation resulted in an overall net tax benefit of $118 million in the quarter, which is inclusive of a $173 million non-cash benefit resulting from a favorable adjustment to our deferred income tax liability due to tax reform legislation. Adjusted EBITDA of $290 million increased $25 million, or 9.4% compared to prior year. Diluted EPS was $1.15 and Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.44.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFor the fiscal year, total case volume increased 2.9%, of which 1.7% was organic growth, and independent restaurant case volume increased 5.2%, of which 3.7% was organic growth. The increase in total case volume reflects strong growth with independent restaurant, healthcare and hospitality customers.\nNet sales of $24.1 billion increased 5.4% from the prior year, primarily driven by higher case volumes, product mix changes and year-over-year inflation in several center of the plate categories as well as produce and grocery. Sales from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 increased Net sales by approximately 1.6%.\nGross profit of $4.2 billion increased $165 million or 4.1% from the prior year, driven by higher case volumes, favorable customer mix, and margin expansion initiatives, which were partially offset by the adverse year-over-year LIFO reserve changes. Gross profit as a percentage of Net sales was 17.5%. Adjusted Gross profit was $4.2 billion, a 4.9% increase from the prior year, driven by higher case volumes and margin expansion initiatives. Adjusted Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 17.5%.\nOperating expenses were $3.6 billion, an increase of 0.1% from the prior year. Operating expenses for the year benefitted from lower restructuring costs, lower depreciation and amortization expense due to the full amortization of an intangible asset and ongoing efforts to reduce operating expenses. These benefits were partially offset by incremental expenses related to higher case volumes and wage costs. Adjusted Operating expenses for the year were $3.2 billion, a 3.7% increase from the prior year, primarily driven by higher case volumes.\nOperating income was $574 million, a $160 million increase from the prior year.\nNet income for the year was $444 million, up $234 million from $210 million in the prior year, driven by improved business results, lower interest expense and the volume, Gross profit, Operating expense and deferred income tax factors discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion increased $86 million, or 8.8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $1.97 and Adjusted Diluted EPS was $1.38.\nCash Flow and Capital Transactions\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year was $748 million, an increase of $192 million from the prior year related to the increase in Operating income which was driven by improved business performance and reduced Interest expense. Cash capital expenditures for the year totaled $221 million, an increase of $57 million from prior year, due to the timing of payments made for assets acquired late in the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased capital spending, as planned.\nIn December the company purchased and retired 10 million shares of common stock from its former private equity sponsors as part of the final secondary offering of the company’s common stock. The $280 million repurchase price was funded primarily with borrowings under the company’s secured asset based revolving credit facility.\nNet Debt at the end of the year was $3.6 billion, a decrease of $13 million versus the end of the prior year. The ratio of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 3.4x at the end of the year, down from 3.8x at the end of the prior year.\nOutlook for Fiscal Year 2018\nFor fiscal year 2018 the company expects total case volume growth of 1-2%, Net sales growth of 3-4%, Adjusted EBITDA growth of 6-8% and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.00-$2.10. For Q1 fiscal 2018, we expect year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA growth to be approximately 100 basis points below the low end of the range, primarily due to poor weather conditions and timing of the New Year’s holiday. Adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to sequentially accelerate through the fiscal year. The company is also raising its mid-term target for Adjusted EBITDA growth from 7-10% to 8-10%.\nThe company expects fiscal year 2018 Interest expense to be approximately $175-$180 million. Cash capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $250-$260 million, and fleet capital leases are expected to be approximately $80 million. Depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal year 2018 are expected to be approximately $340-$350 million. The company’s adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 is estimated to be approximately 25-26%.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nUS Foods fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings call will be broadcast live via the internet on February 15, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CST.

Forward-looking statements include information concerning our liquidity and our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “project,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “seek,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “forecasts,” “mission,” “strive,” “more,” “goal,” or similar expressions. The statements are based on assumptions that we have made, based on our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we think are appropriate. We believe these judgments are reasonable. However, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this release. Such risks, uncertainties, and other important factors include, among others: our ability to remain profitable during times of cost inflation/deflation, commodity volatility, and other factors; industry competition and our ability to successfully compete; our reliance on third-party suppliers, including the impact of any interruption of supplies or increases in product costs; risks related to our indebtedness, including our substantial amount of debt, our ability to incur substantially more debt, and increases in interest rates; restrictions and limitations placed on us by agreements and instruments governing our debt; any change in our relationships with group purchasing organizations; any change in our relationships with long-term customers; our ability to increase sales to independent restaurant customers; our ability to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions; our ability to achieve the benefits that we expect from our cost savings initiatives; shortages of fuel and increases or volatility in fuel costs; any declines in the consumption of food prepared away from home, including as a result of changes in the economy or other factors affecting consumer confidence; liability claims related to products we distribute; our ability to maintain a good reputation; costs and risks associated with labor relations and the availability of qualified labor; changes in industry pricing practices; changes in competitors’ cost structures; our ability to retain customers not obligated by long-term contracts to continue purchasing products from us; environmental, health and safety costs; costs and risks associated with government laws and regulations, including related to environmental, health, safety, food safety, transportation, labor and employment, and changes in existing laws or regulations; technology disruptions and our ability to implement new technologies; costs and risks associated with a potential cybersecurity incident; our ability to manage future expenses and liabilities associated with our retirement benefits and pension plans; disruptions to our business caused by extreme weather conditions; costs and risks associated with litigation; changes in consumer eating habits; costs and risks associated with our intellectual property protections; and risks associated with potential infringements of the intellectual property of others.\nFor a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 28, 2017. All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this release speak only as of the date of this release. We undertake no obligation, other than as may be required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Comparisons of results between current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends, or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe provide Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Operating expenses, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as supplemental measures to GAAP measures regarding our operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use Adjusted Gross profit and Adjusted Operating expenses to focus on period-over-period changes in our business and believe this information is helpful to investors. Adjusted Gross profit is Gross profit adjusted to remove the impact of the LIFO inventory reserve changes and hurricane related inventory losses and relief donations. Adjusted Operating expenses are Operating expenses adjusted to exclude amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance, as well other items noted in our debt agreements.\nWe believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include Restructuring benefits and charges, tangible asset impairments, Loss on extinguishment of debt, Sponsor fees, Share-based compensation expense, Pension settlements, the non-cash impacts of LIFO reserve adjustments, Business transformation costs (costs associated with the redesign of systems and processes), and other items as specified in our debt agreements.\nWe use Net Debt to review the liquidity of our operations. Net Debt is defined as total debt net of restricted cash held on deposit in accordance with our credit agreements, and total Cash and cash equivalents remaining on the balance sheet as of December 30, 2017. We believe that Net Debt is a useful financial metric to assess our ability to pursue business opportunities and investments. Net Debt is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Cash Flows Provided by Operations or Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities.\nWe believe that Adjusted Net income is a useful measure of operating performance for both management and investors because it excludes items that are not reflective of our core operating performance and provides an additional view of our operating performance including depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and Income taxes on a consistent basis from period to period. Adjusted Net income is Net income (loss) excluding such items as Restructuring benefits and charges, tangible asset impairments, Loss on extinguishment of debt, Sponsor fees, Share-based compensation expense, Pension settlements, the non-cash impacts of LIFO reserve adjustments, Business transformation costs (costs associated with the redesign of systems and processes), and other items, and adjusted for the tax effect of the exclusions and discrete tax items. We believe that Adjusted Net income is used by investors, analysts, and other interested parties to facilitate period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity as to how factors and trends impact our operating performance.\nWe use Adjusted Diluted EPS, which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, Diluted Earnings per Share, by excluding the same items excluded in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is useful to investors because the measurement excludes amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. We also believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share is useful to investors because these metrics are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in our industry.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors as they assist in highlighting trends, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (d) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures, and (e) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also used in connection with certain covenants and restricted activities under our debt agreements. We also believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\nWe are not providing a reconciliation of our full fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Diluted EPS outlook because we are not able to accurately estimate all of the adjustments on a forward-looking basis and such items could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results as a result of their variability.\nWe caution readers that our definitions of Adjusted Gross profit, Adjusted Operating expense, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Debt, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies. Not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by presenting the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nUS FOODS HOLDING CORP.

Applicable discrete tax items include changes in tax laws or rates, changes related to prior year unrecognized tax benefits, discrete changes in valuation allowances, excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The tax effect of pre-tax items excluded from Adjusted Net income is computed using a statutory tax rate after considering the impact of permanent differences and valuation allowances. We released the valuation allowance against federal and certain state net deferred tax assets in 2016. We were required to reflect the portion of the valuation allowance release related to the 2016 ordinary income in the estimated annual effective tax rate and the portion of the valuation allowance release related to future years’ income discretely.

NM - Not Meaningful (1) Consists of fees paid to the Sponsors for consulting and management advisory services. On June 1, 2016, the consulting agreements with each of the Sponsors were terminated for an aggregate termination fee of $31 million. (2) Consists primarily of facility related closing costs, including severance and related costs, tangible asset impairment charges and gains on sale, organizational realignment costs and estimated multiemployer pension withdrawal liabilities and settlements. (3) Share-based compensation expense for vesting of stock awards and employee share purchase plan. (4) Represents the non-cash impact of LIFO reserve adjustments. (5) Includes fees paid to debt holders, third party costs, the write off of certain pre-existing unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized issue premium, an early redemption premium, and the loss on our September 2016 CMBS Fixed Facility defeasance. (6) Consists of settlement charges resulting from lump-sum payments to retirees and former employees participating in several Company-sponsored pension plans. (7) Consists primarily of costs related to significant process and systems redesign across multiple functions. (8) Other includes gains, losses or charges as specified under our debt agreements. (9) Represents our income tax benefit adjusted for the tax effect of pre-tax items excluded from Adjusted Net income and the removal of applicable discrete tax items. Applicable discrete tax items include changes in tax laws or rates, changes related to prior year unrecognized tax benefits, discrete changes in valuation allowances, excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The tax effect of pre-tax items excluded from Adjusted Net income is computed using a statutory tax rate after considering the impact of permanent differences and valuation allowances. We released the valuation allowance against federal and certain state net deferred tax assets in 2016. We were required to reflect the portion of the valuation allowance release related to the 2016 ordinary income in the estimated annual effective tax rate and the portion of the valuation allowance release related to future years’ income discretely. We maintained a valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expected to expire unutilized as a result of insufficient forecasted taxable income in the carryforward period, or the utilization of which are subject to limitation.
