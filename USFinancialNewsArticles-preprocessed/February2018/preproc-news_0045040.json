    "text": "SEOUL, Feb 22 (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s household debt grew by the slowest annual pace in almost three years at the end of the fourth quarter, pressured by a series of government measures to curb excessive borrowing.\nThe outstanding amount of home loans and other debt owed by South Korean households at the end of December rose 8.1 percent from a year earlier to 1,450.9 trillion won ($1.34 trillion), preliminary data from the Bank of Korea showed on Thursday.\nThat was below a 9.5 percent gain in the third quarter and the slowest since a 7.4 percent rise in the first quarter of 2015.\nSouth Korea announced in October that it will tighten mortgage rules for owners of multiple homes to put a brake on binge borrowing, amid concerns growing household debt could leave the economy exposed to a crash.\nIn August, the government also had implemented the toughest rules yet to cool housing prices, including new curbs on mortgages and increased capital gains taxes for owners of multiple homes.\nOn a quarterly basis, the debt expanded 2.3 percent in the October-December period after gaining 2.3 percent in the previous three-month period, the data showed.
