    "text": "LONDON, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Corporation plc (NYSE: NE, the Company) today reported a net loss attributable to the Company for the three months (fourth quarter) of $25 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, on revenues of $330 million. The results included net favorable items totaling $47 million, or $0.19 per diluted share as follows:\nPayments totaling $38 million accounted for in contract drilling services revenues. The payments included $25 million ($12 million, or $0.05 per diluted share after noncontrolling interests) resulting from the recovery of certain contractual cost increases for the drillship Noble Bully II, which is owned by a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell and the final payment of $13 million, ($9 million net of tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), received under the 2013 Noble Jim Day contract dispute settlement. Non-cash gains totaling $121 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, resulting from a recalculation of deferred taxes following significant U.S. tax law changes and internal reorganization steps. A non-cash charge totaling $122 million ($95 million net of tax, or $0.39 per diluted share), relating to the impairment of certain rigs and capital spares.\nExcluding the impact of these items, the net loss attributable to Noble Corporation plc for 2017 would have been $72 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on revenues of $292 million.\nJulie J. Robertson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Noble Corporation plc, stated, \"Our fourth quarter results demonstrated the consistent achievement of the key factors that ensure safe and efficient execution on behalf of our customers. The results reflected a year that was outstanding in many respects, even though industry challenges continued to affect results. Of note, we posted the best safety record in the history of our Company while reducing total downtime across our fleet to just over three percent, also a record.\"\nFor the twelve months , Noble Corporation plc reported a net loss attributable to the Company of $517 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, on revenues of $1.2 billion. Results for the year included net unfavorable items totaling $237 million, or $0.97 per diluted share. Excluding these items, the Company would have reported a net loss attributable to Noble Corporation of $280 million, or $1.14 per diluted share.\nContinuing, Ms. Robertson noted, \"I am proud of our numerous accomplishments in 2017. I believe these noteworthy operational achievements, together with the late-2017 negotiation of a new credit facility and the recent completion of a $750 million Senior Notes issue and tender offer, reinforce our long history of strong operational execution and sound financial strategy. They serve to strengthen Noble's competitive posture as we enter 2018.\"\nA Non-GAAP supporting schedule is included with the statements and schedules attached to this press release and can also be found at www.noblecorp.com . It provides a reconciliation for revenues, net income (loss), income tax and diluted earnings per share for the periods fourth quarter 2017, fourth quarter of 2016 and full years 2017 and 2016.\nContract drilling services revenues for 2017 totaled $321 million, which included the previously-noted payments totaling $38 million relating to the Noble Bully II and Noble Jim Day. Excluding those payments, contract drilling services revenues in the fourth quarter would have been $283 million, compared to $260 in the third quarter. The nine percent improvement was due primarily to higher revenues from the floating rig fleet. These items were partially offset by a modest decline in fleet operating days.\nContract drilling services costs in the fourth quarter totaled $153 million compared to $165 million in the previous quarter, or $151 million excluding a $14 million charge resulting from damage to two cold-stacked semisubmersibles during Hurricane Harvey. Excluding the third quarter charge, the modest increase in contract drilling services costs was driven largely by higher costs on the drillships Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Bob Douglas following the commencement of contracts. These costs were partially offset by fewer operating days in the jackup fleet, following the completion of contracts on the Noble Mick O'Brien and Noble Houston Colbert.\nLiquidity Position and Balance Sheet\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company entered into a new, five-year unsecured credit facility with total borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion and a maturity of January 2023. In addition, the Company retained an incremental $300 million in capacity under its previous credit facility for total borrowing capacity of $1.8 billion until January 2020. Combined with cash and cash equivalents of $663 million, the Company's proforma total liquidity (cash and equivalents plus available borrowing capacity under credit facilities) at December 31, 2017, was $2.5 billion.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2017 was $4.0 billion compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2016. During January 2018, Noble issued $750 million aggregate principle amount of 7.875% senior unsecured guaranteed notes due 2026. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $737 million and existing cash on the balance sheet were used to pay the purchase price and accrued interest, along with fees and expenses, in a concurrent tender offer to purchase $750 million of Senior Notes due 2018 through 2024.\nOperating Highlights\nUtilization in the Company's floating rig fleet, consisting of eight drillships and six semisubmersibles, improved to 41 percent compared to 39 percent in the previous quarter of 2017. The improvement was due primarily to an increase in operating days on the Noble Bob Douglas following the commencement in November of a contract in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Average daily revenues per floating rig in the fourth quarter grew to $358,500, or $287,000 excluding the previously-noted payments for the Noble Bully II and Noble Jim Day. The adjusted average daily revenues for the fourth quarter compared to $253,300 in the previous quarter, with the increase driven substantially by the Noble Globetrotter II, which in September commenced a contract in the Black Sea while continuing to collect a special idle dayrate as defined by a previously-reported contract amendment with our customer.\nUtilization in the Company's 14 jackups was 76 percent compared to 81 percent in the preceding quarter. The completion of contracts during the quarter on the Noble Mick O'Brien and Noble Houston Colbert contributed to the lower utilization level while these events were partially offset by the commencement in September of a contract for the Noble Tom Prosser offshore Australia. Average daily revenues per jackup rig in the fourth quarter improved to $134,400 compared to $127,200 in the previous quarter, driven largely by the commencement of operations on the Noble Regina Allen offshore Eastern Canada.\nOutlook\nMs. Robertson's comments assumed a confident tone following four years of industry contraction. She stated, \"The steady rise in crude oil prices since June 2017 and significant progress to date by our customers in reducing offshore project costs are, in part responsible for a growing number of offshore opportunities as project planning intensifies and new programs commence. Although the market for offshore rigs remains highly competitive, we are confident that a demonstrated preference by customers for premium, high-specification jackups and floating rigs with highly qualified crews will continue, leading to improving opportunities across our premium fleet in 2018.\"\nAbout Noble Corporation plc\nNoble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry.

reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for the Company have been provided for meaningful comparisons between current results and prior operating periods. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In order to fully assess the financial operating results, management believes that the results of operations, adjusted to exclude the following items, which are included in the Company's press release issued on February 21, 2018, and discussed in the related conference call on February 22, 2018, are appropriate measures of the continuing and normal operations of the Company:\n(i)\nIn the second and third quarter of 2017, a discrete tax item;\n(ii)\nIn the second quarter of 2017, the Noble Max Smithwrite-off of receivables;\n(iii)\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Noble Danny Adkins and Noble Jim Day related cost damage; and\n(iv)\nIn 2017, the Noble Jim Day and Noble Bully II special payments received.\nThese non-GAAP adjusted measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, contract drilling revenue, contract drilling cost, contract drilling margin, average daily revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see the following Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations for a complete description of the adjustments.\nNOBLE CORPORATION PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nReconciliation of total revenue\nThree Months Ended,\nTwelve Months Ended,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal revenue\n$ 329,585\n$ 410,156\n$ 1,236,915\n$ 2,302,065\nAdjustments\nNoble Tom Prosser-cancellation agreement\n-\n(16,375)\n-\n(16,375)\nNoble Jim Day-Marathon Settlement\n(12,709)\n-\n(12,709)\n-\nNoble Bully II-Shell escalation Provision\n(25,326)\n-\n(25,326)\n-\nCancellations with Freeport:\nContractual items\n-\n-\n-\n(379,143)\nTermination date valuation of contingent payments\n-\n-\n-\n(13,900)\nTotal Adjustments\n(38,035)\n(16,375)\n(38,035)\n(409,418)\nAdjusted total revenue\n$ 291,550\n$ 393,781\n$ 1,198,880\n$ 1,892,647\nReconciliation of Income tax provision\nThree Months Ended,\nTwelve Months Ended,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIncome tax provision\n$ 167,960\n$ 149,473\n$ (42,629)\n$ 109,156\nAdjustments\nNoble Tom Prosser-cancellation agreement\n-\n334\n-\n334\nNoble Danny Adkins and Noble Jim Day rig damages\n-\n-\n(4,845)\n-\nNoble Jim Day-Marathon Settlement\n4,003\n-\n4,003\n-\nNoble Bully II-Shell escalation Provision\n380\n-\n380\n-\nCancellations with Freeport:\nContractual items\n-\n-\n-\n32,035\nTermination date valuation of contingent payments\n-\n-\n-\n1,211\nLoss on impairment\n(26,819)\n(144,103)\n(26,819)\n(145,551)\nDebt retirement\n-\n(762)\n-\n202\nDiscrete tax items\n(120,821)\n(8,472)\n139,264\n(13,985)\nTotal Adjustments\n(143,257)\n(153,003)\n111,983\n(125,754)\nAdjusted income tax provision\n$ 24,703\n$ (3,530)\n$ 69,354\n$ (16,598)\nReconciliation of net loss attributable to Noble Corporation plc\nThree Months Ended,\nTwelve Months Ended,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet loss attributable to Noble Corporation plc\n$ (24,675)\n$ (1,302,850)\n$ (516,511)\n$ (929,580)\nAdjustments\nNoble Tom Prosser-cancellation agreement, net of tax\n-\n(16,041)\n-\n(16,041)\nNoble Max Smith-write-off of receivables\n-\n-\n14,419\n-\nNoble Danny Adkins and Noble Jim Day rig damages\n-\n-\n9,425\n-\nNoble Jim Day-Marathon Settlement\n(8,706)\n-\n(8,706)\n-\nNoble Bully II-Shell escalation Provision\n(12,473)\n-\n(12,473)\n-\nCancellations with Freeport, net of tax:\nContractual items\n-\n-\n-\n(335,578)\nTermination date valuation of contingent payments\n-\n-\n-\n(12,689)\nLoss on impairment, net of tax\n94,820\n1,298,030\n94,820\n1,313,198\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net of tax\n-\n(7,510)\n-\n(17,612)\nDiscrete tax items\n(120,821)\n(8,472)\n139,264\n(13,985)\nTotal Adjustments\n(47,180)\n1,266,007\n236,749\n917,293\nAdjusted net loss attributable to Noble Corporation plc\n$ (71,855)\n$ (36,843)\n$ (279,762)\n$ (12,287)\nReconciliation of diluted EPS attributable to Noble Corporation plc\nThree Months Ended,\nTwelve Months Ended,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nUnadjusted diluted EPS attributable to Noble Corporation plc\n$ (0.10)\n$ (5.36)\n$ (2.11)\n$ (3.82)\nAdjustments\nNoble Tom Prosser-cancellation agreement\n-\n(0.07)\n-\n(0.07)\nNoble Max Smith-write-off of receivables\n-\n-\n0.06\n-\nNoble Danny Adkins and Noble Jim Day rig damages\n-\n-\n0.04\n-\nNoble Jim Day-Marathon Settlement\n(0.04)\n-\n(0.04)\n-\nNoble Bully II-Shell escalation Provision\n(0.05)\n-\n(0.05)\n-\nCancellations with Freeport, net of tax:\nContractual items\n-\n-\n-\n(1.38)\nTermination date valuation of contingent payments\n-\n-\n-\n(0.05)\nLoss on impairment, net of tax\n0.39\n5.34\n0.39\n5.40\nGain on extinguishment of debt, net of tax\n-\n(0.03)\n-\n(0.07)\nDiscrete tax items\n(0.49)\n(0.03)\n0.57\n(0.06)\nTotal Adjustments\n(0.19)\n5.21\n0.97\n3.77\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$ (0.29)\n$ (0.15)\n$ (1.14)\n$ (0.05)\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noble-corporation-plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300602276.html\nSOURCE Noble Corporation",
