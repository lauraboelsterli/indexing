    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 2:17 PM / in 8 minutes Deals of the day-Mergers and acquisitions Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nFeb 9 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1415 GMT on Friday: \n** Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O warned on Friday it could lose two large clients if it accepted chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s AVGO.O revised $121 billion buyout offer and said it saw “no next step” for regulatory approval of any deal. \n** French carmaker and Peugeot-owner PSA has agreed to buy a controlling stake in Chinese automotive spare parts distributor Jian Xin, with PSA looking to improve its performance in the lucrative Chinese market. \n** Spanish engineering and renewable energy company Acciona and Britain’s Contour Global are in talks about a possible deal for the Spanish company’s solar power plants, the companies said separately. \n** British business travel company Hogg Robinson Group said American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) made a recommended offer for the company and that it agreed to sell its payments technology business, Fraedom, to Visa Inc. \n** Daily Mirror publisher Trinity Mirror scooped up titles including the Daily Express, Daily Star and OK! magazine for 127 million pounds ($177 million) in the biggest shake up of Britain’s cut-throat newspaper industry in decades. \n** Investment firm Kinnevik said it will do all in its power to see the deal between Tele2 and Com Hem through, after proposing a raised dividend for 2017. \n** Bank of China (BOC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) are among suitors looking at a potential purchase of German transport finance lender DVB Bank, three sources familiar with the matter say. \n** L‘Oreal signaled its readiness to buy Nestle’s 23 percent stake in the world’s biggest cosmetics firm, which along with strong results lifted the French company’s shares. \n** British engineering group GKN could allow investors more time to decide on a hostile takeover offer by turnaround specialist Melrose, because the U.S., which is a big customer, has a say in whether any deal can proceed.
