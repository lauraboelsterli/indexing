The following products are subject to recall:\n30-lb. boxes with six 5-lb. clear bags containing “GOLD KIST FARMS, Fully Cooked Whole Grain Home-Style Breaded Chicken Patties,” with a case code of 72491050xx and a product code of 665400. The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-20728” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to institutions nationwide.\nThe problem was discovered after the firm received a customer complaint on Feb. 13, 2018. Pilgrim's Pride distributed the product to institutions, including schools. Although the product was sold through the USDA commodity program, the introduction of the foreign material was due to an equipment failure at the facility.\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.\nCustomers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls .\nConsumers with questions about the recall can contact James Brown, consumer relations manager at Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., at 1-800-321-1470. Media with questions about the recall can contact Cameron Bruett, head of media relations at Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., at (970) 506-7801.\nConsumers with food safety questions can \"Ask Karen,\" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov .
