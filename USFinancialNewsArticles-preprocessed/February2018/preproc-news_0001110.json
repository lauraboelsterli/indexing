    "text": "Q4 Revenues Up 9%; Full-Year Earnings Up 3% Despite Large One-Time, Non-Cash TCJA Charge\nST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cass Information Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CASS) , the nation's leading provider of transportation, energy, telecom and waste invoice payment and information services, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings.\nThose results (detailed in the table below) are skewed by a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense of $1.8 million triggered by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA ) on December 22, 2017. While the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate negatively impacted 2017 earnings, the rate reduction is projected to significantly boost after-tax earnings in the future.\nThe table that follows presents key 2017 fourth quarter and full-year performance metrics. Net Income and Diluted EPS (earnings per share) show comparative entries that reflect the impact of the TCJA one-time non-cash charge. None of the other metrics were impacted by the charge.\n4 th Quarter YTD 2017 2016 %\nChange\n2017 2016 %\nChange\nTransportation Invoice Volume 9.0 million 8.6 million 4.6 35.5 million 34.3 million 3.5 Transportation Dollar Volume $6.5 billion $5.7 billion 15.2 $24.8 billion $22.8 billion 8.9 Facility Expense Transaction Volume* 7.2 million 6.6 million 9.6 27.7 million 23.5 million 17.5 Facility Expense Dollar Volume* $3.1 billion $3.0 billion 3.8 $12.8 billion $11.9 billion 7.4 Revenues $35.0 million $32.2 million 8.9 $135.3 million $125.5 million 7.8 Net Income $5.3 million $6.4 million (17.0) $25.0 million $24.3 million 2.7 Net Income (excluding TCJA charge) $7.2 million** $6.4 million 11.4 $26.8 million** $24.3 million 10.2 Diluted EPS $.43 $.52 (17.3) $2.01 $1.96 2.6 Diluted EPS (excluding TCJA charge) $.58** $.52 11.5 $2.16** $1.96 10.2\n*Includes Energy, Telecom and Waste\n**Non-GAAP\n2017 Q4 Revenue Up 9%\nCass posted a healthy 9% increase in revenue in the fourth quarter as it continued to grow its customer base, expanded new revenue-generating services and benefited from an improving interest rate environment. The company continued to foster service innovation with investment in new technology and infrastructure.\nHighlighting fourth quarter performance was a 15% increase in transportation dollar volume. Against the backdrop of a strengthening global economy, increased carrier and fuel prices combined with higher volume from current accounts to produce the notable result. Transportation invoice volume was also up 5% for the period.\nFacility-related (electricity, gas, waste, and telecom expense management) transactions increased 10% due to new customer wins and increased volume from current accounts. Facility expense dollar volume grew by 4% for the period.\nConsolidated operating expenses were up $2.2 million (9%) due mainly to on-going strategic investment in the technology and staff required to win and support new business.\n“We are delighted that 2017 proved to be another record-setting year for Cass, despite our need to absorb the significant accounting charge generated by federal tax reform legislation,” stated Eric H. Brunngraber , Cass chairman and chief executive officer. “Excluding that charge, Cass achieved a 10.2%* increase in net income and earnings per share for 2017.”\n*Non-GAAP\nCash Dividend Declared\nOn January 30, 2018, the company’s board of directors declared a first quarter dividend of $.24 per share payable March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record March 5, 2018. Cass has continuously paid regularly scheduled cash dividends since 1934. Additionally, Cass has returned more than $22 million to shareholders over the past three years through its share repurchase program.\n“The positive impact on future earnings from tax reform combined with our strong balance sheet and sound operating performance leave our board of directors upbeat about what the future holds for Cass,” Brunngraber commented.\nAbout Cass Information Systems\nCass Information Systems, Inc. is a leading provider of integrated information and payment management solutions.
