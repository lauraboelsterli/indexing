    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea—For its historic Olympic debut on Saturday, the unified Korean women’s ice-hockey team was given a 8-0 drubbing by its much stronger Swiss opponents.\nBut you wouldn’t know it by reading the North Korean press’ take on the game, which portrayed the match as a shining example of what the two Koreas can accomplish when they are united in ethnic fraternity, and urged on by the coordinated applause of cheerleaders.\n ",
