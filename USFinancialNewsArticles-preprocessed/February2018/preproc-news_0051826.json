    "text": "BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel confirmed on Sunday that she would promote Jens Spahn, a prominent critic from within her conservative party, to the cabinet, provided a coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) goes ahead.\nShe also said, as expected, that long-standing ally Peter Altmaier would take over the economy ministry and that Ursula von der Leyen would remain in her post as defence minister.\nMerkel has agreed a coalition deal between her conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD), but the parties have to approve the deal before she can count on a fourth term. It is far from certain whether SPD members will back it. (Reporting by Madeline Chambers, Editing by William Maclean)\n ",
