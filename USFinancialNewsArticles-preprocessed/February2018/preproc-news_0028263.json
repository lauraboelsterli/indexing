    "text": "– All 2017 Key Milestones Achieved, Including First U.S. Product Approval from Agios’ Discovery Platform and NDA Submission for Second Product Candidate, Ivosidenib, for\nIDH1m R/R AML –\n– 2018 Priorities Focus on Expanding Clinical and Research Programs to Drive Long-Term Value –\n– 2017 Year-End Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities was $568M; January Follow-on Offering of $516M Extends Cash Runway Through at Least the End of 2020 –\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat cancer and rare genetic diseases, today reported business highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, Agios highlighted select 2018 corporate milestones and data presentations for its clinical development programs.\n“2017 was an extraordinary year for Agios with the U.S. approval of IDHIFA ® , our first internally discovered and developed drug, the NDA submission for our wholly owned medicine ivosidenib and our sixth IND submission since the company’s inception,” said David Schenkein, M.D., chief executive officer at Agios. “It was a data-rich year where we set the stage for building long-term value across our cancer and rare disease portfolios. Execution in 2018 will be equally critical as we ready our organization for the potential approval and launch of ivosidenib, initiate our pivotal program for AG-348 in pyruvate kinase deficiency and advance our robust discovery portfolio.”\nKEY UPCOMING MILESTONES\nThe company plans to achieve the following key milestones in 2018:\nCancer:\nPotential approval and commercialization of ivosidenib in the United States for relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation in the third quarter of 2018. Potential submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for ivosidenib for IDH1m R/R AML in the fourth quarter of 2018. Support, in conjunction with Celgene, the initiation of an intergroup sponsored, global, registration-enabling Phase 3 trial combining ivosidenib or enasidenib with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy in frontline AML patients with an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation in the fourth quarter of 2018. Initiate a perioperative 'window' trial with ivosidenib and AG-881 in low-grade glioma in the first quarter of 2018 to further investigate their effects on brain tumor tissue. Initiate a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial for AG-270, a first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted tumors in the first quarter of 2018.\nRare Genetic Diseases:\nInitiate two global pivotal trials for AG-348 in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency in the first half of 2018: ACTIVATE-T: A single arm trial of approximately 20 regularly transfused patients is expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2018. ACTIVATE: A placebo-controlled trial of approximately 80 patients who do not receive regular transfusions is expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2018. Initiate a global registry, known as PEAK, for adult and pediatric patients with PK deficiency in the first quarter of 2018. Initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept trial of AG-348 in thalassemia in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nResearch:\nSubmit an investigational new drug (IND) application for our newest development candidate, an inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nANTICIPATED KEY 2018 DATA PRESENTATIONS\nUpdated data from the expansion phase of the ongoing Phase 1 study of ivosidenib in IDH1m R/R AML has been submitted to the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Updated data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 combination trial of enasidenib or ivosidenib with VIDAZA ® in patients with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH2 or IDH1 mutation ineligible for intensive chemotherapy has been submitted to ASCO. First clinical data from the Phase 1 study of AG-881 in advanced IDHm positive solid tumors, including glioma, has been submitted to ASCO. Updated data from the ongoing Phase 1 combination trial of enasidenib or ivosidenib with standard-of-care intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH2 or IDH1 mutation to be submitted to the 2018 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS & RECENT PROGRESS\nCompleted an underwritten public offering in January of 8,152,986 shares of common stock at the offering price of $67.00 per share, resulting in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $516.2 million. Submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ivosidenib for the treatment of patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation. Received FDA clearance of an IND application for AG-270, a MAT2A inhibitor, for the treatment of MTAP-deleted tumors. Presented new and updated data from the IDH and PKR programs at the 2017 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition (ASH): First data from the expansion phase of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of ivosidenib in IDH1m R/R AML and advanced hematologic malignancies First data from the ongoing Phase 1 combination trial of ivosidenib or enasidenib with standard-of-care intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation First data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 combination trial of ivosidenib or enasidenib with VIDAZA ® in patients with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation ineligible for intensive chemotherapy Updated data from the AG-348 Phase 2 DRIVE PK study in PK deficiency Appointed Jacqualyn “Jackie” Fouse, Ph.D., former president and chief financial officer of Celgene, to Agios’ board of directors. Presented updated data from the glioma expansion cohort of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of ivosidenib in advanced IDH1m positive solid tumors at the 2017 Society for NeuroOncology Annual Meeting.\nFULL YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 were $567.8 million, compared to $573.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash was driven by expenditures to fund operations of $306.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. These expenditures were offset by an increase in cash driven by net proceeds of $270.2 million from the April follow on offering, $17.0 million of cost reimbursements under our collaboration agreements with Celgene and $14.2 million received from employee stock transactions.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43.0 million, which includes $41.1 million of collaboration revenue and $1.9 million of royalty revenue from net sales of IDHIFA ® . Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $69.9 million, which included a $25.0 million milestone payment related to the initiation of the Phase 3 IDHENTIFY trial with IDHIFA ® under the 2010 Agreement.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $292.7 million, including $30.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $220.2 million, including $25.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in R&D expense was primarily attributable to the ivosidenib program, including manufacturing and regulatory activities to prepare the NDA submission, start-up costs for the Phase 3 AGILE clinical trial, and on-going site activation and patient enrollment of the Phase 3 ClarIDHy clinical trial. R&D expense also increased compared to the prior year due to IND enabling activities for AG-270.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $71.1 million, including $17.0 million of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $50.7 million, including $16.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in G&A expense was primarily attributable to an increase of $21.1 million to support our growing commercial organization for the launch of IDHIFA ® and the potential launch of ivosidenib in 2018.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $314.7 million, compared to a net loss of $198.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCASH GUIDANCE\nIn January, Agios completed an underwritten public offering of 8,152,986 shares of common stock, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 1,063,433 shares, at the offering price of $67.00 per share, resulting in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $516.2 million.\nThe company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017, together with the net proceeds from the recent financing, anticipated product and royalty revenue, anticipated interest income, and anticipated expense reimbursements, but excluding any additional program-specific milestone payments, will enable the company to fund its anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2020.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nAgios will host a conference call and live webcast with slides today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and recent business activities.
