    "text": " 01 a.m. ET Share \nIEX, seeking to challenge NYSE and Nasdaq for listings, was expecting to bring on Wynn Resorts Getty Images \nBy Alexander Osipovich \nThe sexual-misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn could impact a company that has little to do with casinos: IEX Group Inc., a startup stock exchange that is looking to shake up the business of U.S. corporate listings. \nWynn Resorts WYNN, +1.18% , the casino mogul’s company, is the only firm that has publicly expressed an interest in listing on IEX , the heroes of Michael Lewis’s 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys.” IEX is in the final stages of preparing to launch a listings business that would compete with the   and Nasdaq Inc. NDAQ, +0.57% for corporate issuers. \nWynn -- the founder, chairman and chief executive of the casino company -- is an investor in IEX and a vocal supporter of its crusade against aggressive high-speed trading strategies. He told a business conference in 2014 that he wanted to list Wynn Resorts on IEX, although his representatives have since said he is just “considering” whether to make the switch. \nWynn Resorts, a member of the S&P 500, is listed on Nasdaq. IEX had expected the casino operator to be among the initial batch of companies to switch to the new exchange, people familiar with IEX’s listings effort said. \nIEX declined to comment. The startup hasn’t revealed who the other companies might be or how many of them it believes there are.",
