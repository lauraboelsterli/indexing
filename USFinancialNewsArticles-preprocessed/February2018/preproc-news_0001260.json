    "text": "KYOTO, Japan--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kyocera Corporation (NYSE:KYO)(TOKYO:6971) today announced its consolidated third-quarter financial results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. Results are summarized below, both as an aggregation of Kyocera’s first three fiscal quarters (the “period,” i.e., nine months), and as the third quarter alone (the “quarter,” i.e., three months), ended Dec. 31, 2017. Complete details are available at: https://global.kyocera.com/ir/\nConsolidated Financial Highlights: Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017\nUnit: Millions (except percentages and per-share amounts) Nine Months Ended December 31, 2016\n(FY17)\nin JPY\n2017\n(FY18)\nin JPY\nIncrease 2017\n(FY18)\nin USD\n2017\n(FY18)\nin EUR\nAmount\nin JPY\n% Net sales: 1,014,628 1,145,016 130,388 12.9 10,133 8,482 Profit from operations: 67,102 108,984 41,882 62.4 964 807 Income before income taxes: 98,706 144,864 46,158 46.8 1,282 1,073 Net income attributable to\nKyocera Corporation's\nshareholders:\n70,852 90,267 19,415 27.4 799 669 Diluted earnings per share\nattributable to Kyocera\nCorporation's shareholders:\n192.88 245.49 -\n-\n2.17 1.82 Note on exchange rates: U.S. dollar (USD) and euro (EUR) conversions are provided above as a convenience to the reader, based on the rates of USD1 = JPY113 and EUR1 = JPY135, rounded to the nearest unit (as of December 29, 2017) Summary\nDuring this nine-month period, robust demand for information and telecommunications equipment, automobiles, and industrial machinery fueled a significant increase in the company’s revenue from electronic devices and automotive/industrial components. Revenue in the document solutions business increased as well, following new product launches and related sales promotions. Additionally, merger and acquisitions made a further contribution to the company’s business expansion.\nAs a result, the company attained record nine-month sales of JPY1,145,016 (USD10,133) million, an increase of JPY130,388 (USD1,154) million, or 12.9%, over the same period of the prior year. Most profit metrics showed significant increases as well, due mainly to stronger sales and successful cost reduction measures. Profit from operations increased 62.4%, to JPY108,984 (USD964) million; and income before income taxes increased 46.8%, to JPY144,864 (USD1,282) million. Net income attributable to Kyocera Corporation's shareholders increased 27.4%, to JPY90,267 (USD799) million, despite third-quarter expenses at U.S. subsidiaries including AVX Corporation, primarily resulting from tax law revisions in the U.S., which amounted to a decrease of approximately JPY11,000 (USD97) million.\nAverage exchange rates for the nine months reflected the Japanese yen’s weakening against the U.S. dollar by approximately 4.7%, to JPY112, and against the euro by approximately 9.3%, to JPY129, as compared with the same period of the prior year. As a result, net sales and income before income taxes increased by approximately JPY39 billion (USD345 million) and JPY13 billion (USD115 million), respectively, as compared with the prior-year period.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights: Third Quarter\nUnit: Millions (except percentages) Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\n(FY17-Q3)\nin JPY\n2017\n(FY18-Q3)\nin JPY\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n2017\n(FY18-Q3)\nin USD\n2017\n(FY18-Q3)\nin EUR\nAmount\nin JPY\n% Net sales: 361,385 406,671 45,286 12.5 3,599 3,012 Profit from operations: 33,317 39,479 6,162 18.5 349 292 Income before income taxes: 50,128 57,024 6,896 13.8 505 422 Net income attributable to\nKyocera Corporation's\nshareholders:\n34,699 28,880 (5,819) (16.8) 256 214 (See note above regarding exchange rates.)\nExpectations for the Full Fiscal Year\nFor the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, Kyocera makes no change to the forecasts for net sales, profit from operations, or income before income taxes that it announced on October 30, 2017, since its business results are generally in line with those projections. However, net income attributable to Kyocera Corporation's shareholders has been revised as shown below, in reflection of the aforementioned expenses related to U.S. tax law revisions.\nRegarding average exchange rates for the full fiscal year, Kyocera’s October 30, 2017 forecast of JPY111 against the U.S. dollar remains unchanged, while Kyocera’s forecast of JPY128 against the euro has been revised to JPY130 , marking depreciation of JPY2 (1.6%).\nConsolidated Forecast: Year Ending March 31, 2018\nUnit: Yen in millions (except percentages, per-share amounts and exchange rates) Fiscal 2017\nResults\nFiscal 2018\nForecast\nAnnounced on\nOctober 30,\n2017\nFiscal 2018\nForecast\nAnnounced on\nFebruary 1,\n2018\nIncrease\n(%) to\nFiscal 2017\nResults\nNet sales: 1,422,754 1,560,000 1,560,000 9.6 Profit from operations: 104,542 135,000 135,000 29.1 Income before income taxes: 137,849 170,000 170,000 23.3 Net income attributable to\nKyocera Corporation's\nshareholders:\n103,843 119,000 108,000 4.0 Diluted earnings per share\nattributable to Kyocera\nCorporation's shareholders:\n282.62 323.62 * 293.71 ** - Average USD exchange rate: 108 111 111 - Average EUR exchange rate: 119 128 130 - *Forecast of “Diluted earnings per share attributable to Kyocera Corporation's shareholders” is based on the diluted average number of shares outstanding during the six months ended September 30, 2017. **Forecast of “Diluted earnings per share attributable to Kyocera Corporation's shareholders” is based on the diluted average number of shares outstanding during the nine months ended December 31, 2017.
