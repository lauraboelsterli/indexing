Human Rights Council on Tuesday, adding that ethnic cleansing had taken place in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. “For true democracy to flourish, fundamental freedoms such as freedom of the press must be respected. That is why Canada is gravely concerned by the imprisonment of two Reuters journalists who dared to report on the crimes in Rakhine state,” she said.
