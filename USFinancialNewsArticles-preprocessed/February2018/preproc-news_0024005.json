    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 1:18 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Russian businessman says U.S. 'oligarch list' may cause companies problems with banks Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian businessman Andrei Melnichenko, who controls Russia-focused fertiliser producer Eurochem, said on Friday Russian companies could experience problems in the future in dealings with banks because of the U.S. government’s “oligarch list.” \nAsked by reporters at a business forum if he saw an impact from the list’s publication on banks’ dealings with Russian clients, Melnichenko said: “For now we don’t see that.” \nBut asked if he expected such difficulties in the future, he said: “It’s unpredictable. Probably, there will be some difficulties.” \nA representative for Melnichenko later said he was referring to the impact on Russian business in general. Melnichenko was among dozens of Russian billionaires, officials and heads of state companies included on the U.S. list. \nThe list was drafted by the U.S. Treasury Department in line with a sanctions package signed into law last year, but Washington said inclusion on the list did not imply people named were, or would be in the future, subject to any restrictions.
