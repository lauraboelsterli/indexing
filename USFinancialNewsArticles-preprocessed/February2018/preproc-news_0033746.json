An accelerating global economy has been pushing cargo aircraft away from the fertile East African nation in search of more profitable business. The WSJ’s Matina Stevis-Gridneff reports that has created a capacity crunch for goods headed out of Nairobi, leading to higher prices and lower profits for exporters looking to tap into one of the flower industry’s signature sales periods. Flower-filled freighters are standard for the season, but Kenya’s exporters and freight operators say the business is facing new urgency as tough shipping economics take a toll on trade out of Africa. Kenya has become a global powerhouse in perishables production—its No. 3 in the world in rose exports—but weak demand in the region means aircraft have little cargo to bring in. The economics are heartbreaking: they need to keep the flowers fresh, but that leaves profits wilting.\nNordstrom Inc. is trying to build and buy its way out of the retail industry’s slump. The company is opening stores while its competitors are closing theirs and is testing new strategies that seek to blend a physical presence with online fulfillment, part of what the WSJ’s Suzanne Kapner writes is a series of bold but risky actions to respond to changes in retailing. Department stores are fighting uphill to retain shoppers who are migrating to the web and spending more on dining, travel and other experiences. Nordstrom says it holds a different place in the market, fewer stores and a more nimble supply chain it can adapt to shifting consumer buying patterns. One new store in California, for instance, carries samples of brands that can only be ordered online. That makes it easier to manage inventory even if it adds distribution costs—a kind of hybrid approach more retailers are trying as they seek the best in both the physical and online worlds.\nThe U.S. retail rebound may be hitting a wall. Retail and food-services sales declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in January from the prior month, the WSJ’s Ben Leubsdorf reports, a disappointing start to the year that comes as domestic freight operators say demand to move goods to stores, factories and distribution centers remains strong . Sales were still up 3.6% from a year ago, but the monthly pullback was the largest in 11 months and big surge during the holidays isn’t necessarily a springboard to accelerating growth. One key measure of retail supply chain efficiency, the inventory-to-sales ratio, ticked up in December after hearing down for the previous three months. Still, department store sales rose 0.8% from December to January even as sales remained flat at nonstore retailers—mostly online business. The household spending that is the main engine of the U.S. economy may still be humming, even if it’s taking a pause after the holidays.\nGOVERNMENT & REGULATION Flower shipments at Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, two days before Valentine’s Day. Photo: Adriane Ohanesian for The Wall Street Journal The Trump administration’s infrastructure plan has states and local governments looking at whether they can raise funds through recycling. The idea isn’t for traditional recycling but sales of existing roads to raise money for new bridges, highways and other projects, a system known as asset recycling that the WSJ’s Cezary Podkul writes raises important questions for policy makers and companies anxious to see upgrades in transportation infrastructure. Under the White House plan, the federal government would set up a pot of money to pay state and local governments when they privatize or lease existing assets to investors. That could create a pipeline of new deals for firms like infrastructure fund manager Macquarie, but it also could raise tensions with road users including truckers who oppose adding tolls to existing highways. Macquarie estimates governments could earn up to $1.25 trillion from privatizing their infrastructure assets, but the plan’s backers first must sell lawmakers and their constituents on the idea.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ If we were flying iPhones, we’d just leave them to one side for a week The rose starts dying the minute it’s cut.
