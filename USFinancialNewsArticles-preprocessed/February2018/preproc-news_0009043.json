(NASDAQ: CEVA), the leading licensor of signal processing platforms and artificial intelligence processors for smarter, connected devices, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $21.6 million, an increase of 2% compared to $21.2 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 licensing and related revenue was $9.0 million, an increase of 9% when compared to $8.3 million reported for the same quarter a year ago. Royalty revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.6 million, a decline of 2% when compared to $12.9 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGideon Wertheizer, Chief Executive Officer of CEVA, stated: \"Our fourth quarter results marked a strong finish to the year, with thirteen licensing agreements concluded and a sequential increase in royalties. Notably, we signed a development agreement with a large automotive manufacturer for the next generation of our NeuPro AI processor targeting level 4 and 5 autonomous driving systems.\"\nMr. Wertheizer continued: \"2017 was an outstanding year for CEVA, with record financial and business achievements, reflecting our traction in the smart and connected universe. Our licensing business continues to thrive, with forty-five agreements concluded, resulting in 35% licensing revenue growth. We entered into strategic engagements with multiple top tier players in 5G infrastructure, artificial intelligence and computer vision, all of which bode well for future royalty growth. We also further strengthened our technology leadership in a number of key growth areas with the introduction of new products, among which are: CEVA-XC12, the most advanced DSP for infrastructure and networking applications; Dragonfly, a complete end-to-end solution for narrowband IoT; NeuPro, the first self-contained processor architecture for AI at the edge; ClearVox, a complete front-end voice processing software suite for voice-enabled devices and AI assistants, and Bluetooth 5 dual mode, the key enabling technology for the proliferation of wireless headsets, hearables and earbuds. Our royalty revenue also reached an all-time high, growing 9% year-over-year, with close to 1.2 billion CEVA-powered devices shipped by our customers. Looking ahead, we will continue to relentlessly expand our customer base and market presence, leveraging our unique specialization and holistic product strategy to lower market entry barriers for complex technologies.\"\nDuring the quarter, CEVA completed 13 license agreements.
