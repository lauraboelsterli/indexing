Additionally, Ponder will serve on Payroc’s board of managers. Because both companies have long-standing brand recognition in the merchant processing industry, they will continue to operate as separate companies and brands, while leveraging unique strengths to create competitive advantage for referral partners, sales agents and merchants. Payroc executives bring depth and experience to Integrity’s leadership team. James Oberman will assume the chief executive position. Matthew Austin, Payroc chief operating officer, will fill the same role for Integrity. Aaron Johnson, Payroc chief risk officer, also will serve in that capacity for Integrity.\n“Integrity’s proven commitment to service combined with in-house, end-to-end processing and settlement capabilities are uniquely differentiated,” said Adam Oberman, president of Payroc. “The companies have the remarkable ability to serve traditional merchants, but also the customized requirements of the rapidly growing, technology-driven integrated software vendor (ISV) payments marketplace.”\n“We are pleased to join forces with Payroc, which will uniquely leverage and enhance the proprietary processing platform Integrity has worked so hard to build,” said Integrity’s Ponder. “Not only are we adding the talent and experience of the Payroc team, but also our combined financial resources significantly enhance our capabilities to better service clients.”\nAbout Payroc, LLC\nPayroc, headquartered in the Tinley Park suburb of Chicago, drives commerce for its merchants with anytime, anywhere payment solutions.
