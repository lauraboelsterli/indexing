    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, A hearing in the case of Russian curler Alexander Krushelnitsky, who tested positive for the banned substance meldonium, was yet to be scheduled, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Wednesday.\n“If the parties want a hearing, it will be fixed before the end of the week,” CAS told Reuters in an e-mail.\nKrushelnitsky, who won bronze in Pyeongchang with his wife in mixed doubles curling, has denied taking banned substances.\nThe Russian Olympic delegation in Pyeongchang has launched an investigation into the case and said on Tuesday it could not explain how meldonium, a drug that can aid in endurance, had made its way into Krushelnitsky’s body.\nRussian authorities have come to Krushelnitsky’s defense, with Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov saying he could not have taken the drug deliberately.\nDmitry Svishchev, the president of the Russian curling federation, has told Reuters the drug could have been slipped into Krushelnitsky’s food or drink.\nThe doping case has come at a delicate time for Russia, which has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies.\nIts athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral athletes, and Russia had been hoping that a clean record at the Games would enable it to return to full Olympic status.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber in Pyeongchang and Moscow bureau; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ",
