The Company also reported operating income of $80 million, adjusted OIBDA of $178 million, and free cash flow of $140 million in the quarter, while paying down $113 million of corporate debt.\nNet income and basic EPS include a one-time income tax benefit of $165 million reflecting the impact of the lower U.S. income tax rate under the new tax laws on our net deferred tax liabilities.\n\"Our strong performance in the quarter, with robust contributions from our Motion Picture Group and Starz, keeps us on track for our fiscal year expectations,\" said Lionsgate Chief Executive Officer Jon Feltheimer. \"With this financial strength, we're pleased to announce that our Board has approved the resumption of our quarterly cash dividend, returning value to our shareholders as we continue to grow our Company. Despite a disruptive operating environment, the quarter shows our success in creating premium content that cuts through the clutter of a crowded marketplace and our ability to supply it to a diverse array of media companies.\"\nRevenue in the quarter of $1.14 billion increased 52% from $752 million in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to Lionsgate shareholders of $193 million, or basic EPS of $0.92 per share, compared to a net loss of $31 million, or basic loss of $0.19 per share, in the prior year quarter. Adjusted OIBDA of $178 million and operating income of $80 million in the quarter compared to adjusted OIBDA of $86 million and operating loss of $7 million in the prior year quarter, respectively.\nThe Company announced that it has resumed its quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per each class of common shares payable on May 1, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Results\nWith Lionsgate's acquisition of Starz, fiscal 2018 third quarter results are not directly comparable to prior reporting periods, so the following quarterly segment results will be discussed as compared to the prior year quarter on a combined pro forma basis.\nThe Media Networks segment revenues increased 6% to $382.9 million driven by higher over-the-top (OTT) revenue growth and revenues from worldwide digital media licensing arrangements, offset in part by subscriber losses at certain MVPD's. Ratings for Starz original series grew for the third year in a row. Segment profits increased 6% in the quarter to $128.3 million.\nMotion Picture segment revenues increased 14% to $539.1 million due to the strong domestic theatrical box office performance of the breakout hit Wonder and the continued strong international performances of La La Land and American Assassin. Segment profits of $54.3 million compared to $55.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nTelevision Production segment revenues of $227.3 million compared to $231.0 million in the prior year quarter. Television production revenue was comparable to the prior year quarter as increased revenues from deliveries of television series were partially offset by a decrease in syndicated licensing revenues. Segment profits of $22.7 million compared to $27.5 million in the prior year quarter.\nLionsgate's backlog, or already contracted future revenue on the licensing of film and television product not yet recorded, was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017.\nLionsgate senior management will hold its analyst and investor conference call to discuss its fiscal 2018 third quarter financial results at 5:00 PM ET/2:00 PM PT this afternoon, February 8. Interested parties may listen to the live webcast by visiting the events page on the Lionsgate corporate website or via https://services.choruscall.com/links/lgf180208ldOgQ2Fz.html .

As a result of the Starz Merger, beginning December 8, 2016, the Motion Pictures segment includes Starz's third-party distribution business.\nTelevision Production consists of the development, production and worldwide distribution of television productions including television series, television movies and mini-series, and non-fiction programming.\nMedia Networks (which was not a reportable segment prior to the quarter ended December 31, 2016) consists of (i) Starz Networks, which includes the licensing of premium subscription video programming to U.S. multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunication companies, and online video providers, and on an over-the-top (\"OTT\") basis (ii) Content and Other, which includes the licensing of the Media Networks' original series programming to digital media platforms, international television networks, home entertainment and other ancillary markets and (iii) Streaming Services, which represents the Lionsgate legacy start-up direct to consumer streaming services on its subscription video-on-demand (\"SVOD\") platforms which were moved under the Media Networks segment in connection with the Starz Merger.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company's reportable segments enter into transactions with one another. The most common types of intersegment transactions include licensing motion pictures or television programming from the Motion Pictures and Television Production segments to the Media Networks segment. In addition, intersegment transactions include distribution fees charged to the Media Networks segment by the Television Production segment for the distribution of Media Networks' original series programming in ancillary markets.

(the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") that are not all financial measures defined by generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\nAdjusted OIBDA: Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) before adjusted depreciation and amortization (\"OIBDA\"), adjusted for adjusted share-based compensation (\"adjusted SBC\"), purchase accounting and related adjustments, and restructuring and other costs.\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our consolidated statement of operations, less the depreciation and amortization related to the amortization of purchase accounting and related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Starz and Pilgrim Media Group. Accordingly, the full impact of the purchase accounting is included in the adjustment for \"purchase accounting and related adjustments\", described below. Adjusted share-based compensation represents share-based compensation excluding immediately vested stock awards granted as part of the Company's annual bonus program issued in lieu of cash bonuses (which are, when granted, included in segment or corporate general and administrative expense), and excluding the impact of the acceleration of certain vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements, which are included in restructuring and other expenses, when applicable. Restructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and related costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable. Purchase accounting and related adjustments represent the amortization of non-cash fair value adjustments to certain assets acquired in the acquisition of Starz, Pilgrim Media Group and Good Universe.\nAdjusted OIBDA is calculated similar to how the Company defines segment profit and manages and evaluates its segment operations. Segment profit also excludes corporate general and administrative expense.\nFree Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus or minus the net increase or decrease in production loans. The adjustment for the production loans is made because the GAAP based cash flows from operations reflects a non-cash reduction of cash flows for the cost of films and television programs associated with production loans prior to the time the Company actually pays for the film or television program. The Company believes that it is more meaningful to reflect the impact of the payment for these films and television programs in its free cash flow when the payments are actually made.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders: Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders, adjusted for share-based compensation, purchase accounting and related adjustments, restructuring and other items, loss on extinguishment of debt, and unusual gains or losses, net of the tax effect of the adjustments at the applicable blended statutory rate and net of the impact of the adjustments on non-controlling interest.\nAdjusted Basic and Diluted EPS : Adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share is defined as adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but is adjusted for the effects of securities that are diluted based on the level of adjusted net income (loss), similar to GAAP.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)\nThese measures are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the SEC and are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, among other measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our business. We believe these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and cash flows before non-operating items. Adjusted OIBDA is considered an important measure of the Company's performance because this measure eliminates amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Free Cash Flow is considered an important measure of the Company's liquidity because it provides information about the ability of the Company to reduce net corporate debt, make strategic investments, dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders and Adjusted EPS are considered important measures of the Company's business operations as, similar to Adjusted OIBDA, these measures eliminate amounts that, in management's opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses.\nThese non-GAAP measures are commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. However, not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner and the measures as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items.\nA general limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of operating income, cash flow, net income (loss), or earnings (loss) per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the adjusted metrics utilized to their corresponding GAAP metrics are provided below.\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CORP.\nRECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\nTO ADJUSTED OIBDA\nThe following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating income (loss) to the non-GAAP measure, Adjusted OIBDA:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Amounts in millions)\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n80.2\n$\n(7.4)\n$\n200.3\n$\n(87.6)\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization (1)\n9.8\n4.8\n29.2\n13.1\nRestructuring and other (2)\n21.4\n54.0\n35.8\n72.4\nAdjusted share-based compensation expense (3)\n24.2\n21.5\n71.6\n50.0\nPurchase accounting and related adjustments (4)\n42.0\n12.9\n130.8\n24.7\nAdjusted OIBDA\n$\n177.6\n$\n85.8\n$\n467.7\n$\n72.6\n(1)\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization represents depreciation and amortization as presented on our consolidated statements of income less the depreciation and amortization related to the non-cash fair value adjustments to property and equipment and intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Starz and Pilgrim Media Group which are included in the purchase accounting and related adjustments line item above, as shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Amounts in millions)\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n39.7\n$\n13.2\n$\n119.0\n$\n23.1\nLess: Amount included in purchase accounting and related adjustments\n(29.9)\n(8.4)\n(89.8)\n(10.0)\nAdjusted depreciation and amortization\n$\n9.8\n$\n4.8\n$\n29.2\n$\n13.1\n(2)\nRestructuring and other includes restructuring and severance costs, certain transaction and related costs, and certain unusual items, when applicable, as shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Amounts in millions)\nRestructuring and other:\nSeverance (a)\nCash\n$\n9.1\n$\n21.6\n$\n10.1\n$\n23.6\nAccelerated vesting on equity awards\n2.9\n—\n2.9\n2.4\nTotal severance costs\n12.0\n21.6\n13.0\n26.0\nTransaction and related costs (b)\n1.0\n32.4\n14.4\n46.4\nDevelopment expense (c)\n8.4\n—\n8.4\n—\n$\n21.4\n$\n54.0\n$\n35.8\n$\n72.4\n(a)\nSeverance costs in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 were primarily related to the restructuring of the Motion Pictures business in connection with the acquisition of Good Universe and additional workforce reductions in connection with the Starz Merger.
