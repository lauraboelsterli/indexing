    "text": "BURLINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CIRCOR International, Inc. (NYSE: CIR), a leading provider of flow control solutions and other highly engineered products for the Energy, Aerospace & Defense and Industrial markets, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nQ4 Orders of $217 million; up 32% organically Q4 Revenue of $206 million, up 4% organically Q4 GAAP loss per share of $(0.32) Q4 Adjusted EPS of $0.57 Acquisition of Colfax Fluid Handling complete; integration underway Company suspends quarterly dividend to prioritize debt reduction\n“We capped a solid year in 2017 with strong orders growth, and improving revenue and earnings,” said Scott Buckhout, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Energy segment orders increased 37% organically in the fourth quarter, led by our Distributed Valves and Refinery Valves business units. In Advanced Flow Solutions, robust Aerospace demand contributed to a 25% increase in organic orders in the segment.”\nThe Fluid Handling business, which was acquired from Colfax Corporation on December 11, 2017, also contributed favorably to the results, generating $36.5 million in sales and $5.5 million in segment operating income.\n“Since completing the Fluid Handling acquisition in December, we’ve put a full-time, global integration team in place and started executing our plan to reduce combined costs, consolidate systems and processes, and drive growth synergies,” Buckhout said. “We begin 2018 well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in a diversified range of favorable end markets.\n“Going forward, we will continue to focus on creating long-term value for our shareholders by investing in growth, executing a seamless integration of Fluid Handling, and reducing our leverage,” concluded Buckhout.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nThe Tax Cuts & Jobs Act did not have a significant impact on the fourth-quarter 2017 results given the Company’s net deferred tax position. Additional analysis regarding the realization of foreign tax credit carryover is in process and will be completed mid-2018.\nDividends\nAs part of its capital deployment strategy, the Company has suspended its quarterly cash dividend of $0.0375 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Suspension of this nominal dividend on common stock will allow the Company to redirect the funds to repay debt.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Guidance\nThe Company will provide guidance for the first quarter of 2018 during the conference call later today.\nSelected Consolidated Results (unaudited)\n($ millions except EPS) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change FY 2017 FY 2016 Change Revenue $ 205.6 $ 158.2 47.3 $ 661.7 $ 590.3 71.4 GAAP Operating Income (Loss) $ (5.1)\n$ (3.4) (1.6) $ 20.6 $ 10.9 9.7 Adjusted Operating Income 1 $ 18.7 $ 11.0 7.7 $ 51.7 $ 42.4 9.3 GAAP Operating Margin (2.5)%\n(2.2)% (30) bps 3.1% 1.8% 130 bps Adjusted Operating Margin 1 9.1% 6.9% 220 bps 7.8% 7.2% 60 bps GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share (Diluted) $ (0.32) $ (0.12) (0.20) $ 0.70 $ 0.61 0.09 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Diluted) 1 $ 0.57 $ 0.48 0.09 $ 1.71 $ 1.99 (0.28) Operating Cash Flow $ 7.6 $ 20.4 (12.8) $ 9.6 $ 59.4 (49.8) Free Cash Flow 2 $ 1.5 $ 17.0 (15.5) $ (4.0) $ 46.4 (50.4) Orders $ 216.5 $ 142.3 74.2 $ 701.6 $ 525.7 175.9 Segment Results (unaudited)\n($ millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change FY 2017 FY 2016 Change Energy Revenue $ 92.2 $ 89.0 3.2 $ 347.6 $ 322.0 25.5 Segment Operating Income $ 7.6 $ 9.3 (1.7) $ 30.7 $ 34.6 (3.9) Segment Operating Margin 8.3% 10.4% (210) bps 8.8% 10.7% (190) bps Orders $ 118.7 $ 85.2 33.5 $ 389.4 $ 270.5 118.9 Advanced Flow Solutions Revenue $ 76.8 $ 69.2 7.6 $ 277.6 $ 268.2 9.4 Segment Operating Income $ 11.4 $ 8.9 2.5 $ 37.2 $ 33.5 3.7 Segment Operating Margin 14.8% 12.9% 190 bps 13.4% 12.5% 90 bps Orders $ 73.5 $ 57.1 16.4 $ 287.9 $ 255.2 32.7 Fluid Handling 3 Revenue $ 36.5 $ -- -- $ 36.5 $ -- -- Segment Operating Income $ 5.5 $ -- -- $ 5.5 $ -- -- Segment Operating Margin 15.0% -- -- 15.0% -- -- Orders $ 24.3 $ -- -- $ 24.3 $ -- -- 1.\nConsolidated and Segment Results for Q4 2017 exclude special and restructuring charges and non-cash acquisition-related intangible and inventory step-up amortization, totaling $23.7 million (pre-tax). This net charge includes (i) $9.2 million charge for non-cash acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, including the amortization of a step-up in fair value of inventories; (ii) $8.9 million in transaction fees associated with the acquisition of the Colfax Fluid Handling business; (iii) $2.4 million for settlement of a legal matter; (iv) $1.8 million write-off for deferred financing fees associated with the prior debt agreement; and (v) $1.4 million related to previously announced restructuring actions. Consolidated and Segment Results for Q4 2016 exclude special and restructuring charges, totaling $14.4 million. These charges include (i)$5.6 million for non-cash acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, including the amortization of a step-up in fair value of inventories; (ii) $4.5 million related to a non-cash charge associated with a lump sum distribution paid to terminated and vested participants in CIRCOR’s pension plan; (iii) $2.3 million related to the exit of the California machine shop and the Brazil facility, as well as the suspension of manufacturing operations in China; (iv) $1.0 million related to other restructuring programs across the Energy Segment; and (v) $1.0 million related to professional fees incurred for completed acquisitions.\n2.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by subtracting GAAP capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, from GAAP Operating Cash Flow.\n3.\nFluid Handling results reflect the period from December 11, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Prior period comparisons are not meaningful.\nConference Call Information\nCIRCOR International will hold a conference call to review its financial results today, February 28, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. ET. To listen to the conference call and view the accompanying presentation slides, visit “ Webcasts & Presentations ” in the “ Investors ” portion of the CIRCOR website. The call also can be accessed by dialing (877) 407-5790 or (201) 689-8328. The webcast will be archived for one year on the Company’s website.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted operating income, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per share (diluted), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in our financial and operating decision making because we believe they better reflect our ongoing business and allow for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. These non-GAAP financial measures also allow investors and others to compare the Company’s current financial results with the Company’s past financial results in a consistent manner. For example:\nWe exclude costs and tax effects associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We believe that the costs related to these restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs. We exclude certain acquisition-related costs, including significant transaction costs and amortization of inventory and fixed-asset step-ups and the related tax effects. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs. We exclude the expense and tax effects associated with the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives up to 25 years. Exclusion of the non-cash amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We also exclude certain gains/losses and related tax effects, which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, and that we believe are not indicative of our normal operating gains and losses. For example, we exclude gains/losses from items such as the sale of a business, significant litigation-related matters and lump-sum pension plan settlements.\nCIRCOR’s management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring the Company’s operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. We use such measures when publicly providing our business outlook, assessing future earnings potential, evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions and in our financial and operating decision-making process, including for compensation purposes.\nInvestors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in this news release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27 A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
