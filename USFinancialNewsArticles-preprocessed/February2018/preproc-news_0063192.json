    "text": "3 COMMENTS BERLIN—German authorities said on Wednesday they were investigating a security breach of the government’s highly protected computer network.\nThe country’s intelligence agencies were examining attacks on more than one government ministry, the interior ministry said, adding that the affected departments had been informed and that the attack had been isolated and brought under control.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the German news agency DPA reported that German security services had discovered a breach of the government’s IT network in December and traced it back to state-sponsored Russian hackers. The interior ministry declined to comment on the DPA report.\nGerman companies have been the target of sustained attacks by state-sponsored hackers , mainly believed to be Chinese. In 2015, the Bundestag, parliament’s lower house, suffered a extensive breach, leading to the theft of several gigabytes of data by what German security officials believe were Russian cyberthieves.\nHackers believed to be part of the Russia-linked APT28 group sought to infiltrate the computer systems of several German political parties in 2016, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said in 2016.\nRussian officials have rejected accusations of involvement in either attack.\nWhile there was widespread speculation that embarrassing emails or information harvested in those attacks could be leaked to damage the reputation of German officials ahead of the 2017 federal election, no such leaking took place.\nIntelligence officials have said the intense media focus on the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in the U.S. have deterred leaks of the German information and emails.\nUntil now, there had been no known examples of a successful attack on the heavily guarded network of the German federal government, known as IVBB, which is used by ministries and federal security agencies. The interior ministry didn’t specify which of the government’s several highly protected networks was affected.\nFederal government workers are only allowed to use dedicated and highly secured mobile devices to access the network. They are limited in the number of websites they can access from work and generally barred from using USB devices that can carry computer viruses.\nHackers could easily have penetrated low-security networks at government departments that have connections to the wider internet, said Sandro Gaycken, a German cyberwarfare expert and director of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization cyberdefense program, adding that those networks were unlikely to hold sensitive information.\n“They would have needed extra magic or help from an insider to gain access to top-secret information,” Mr. Gaycken said.\nWrite to William Wilkes at william.wilkes@wsj.com",
