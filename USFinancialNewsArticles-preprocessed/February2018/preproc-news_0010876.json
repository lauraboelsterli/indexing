    "text": "By Emily Price February 2, 2018 \nYes, you‚Äôve probably seen more than a few plates of nachos in your day, but have you seen Italian nachos? \nThis week Olive Garden introduced the best new addition to its menu since unlimited breadsticks: Italian Nachos. \nThe culinary delicacy is technically called ‚Äú loaded pasta chips ‚Äù and is made with fried lasagna noodles that are then layered with Italian cheeses and meat sauce and then topped with cherry peppers and Alfredo sauce. We've got a better idea: Loaded Pasta Chips. üòâ pic.twitter.com/1Fg6hcckRh \n‚Äî Olive Garden (@olivegarden) February 2, 2018 \n\nIn addition to being pretty unique, it‚Äôs also affordable. A dish of the carb-loaded appetite will just set you back $8.99. It‚Äôs available on the menu at least through the summer, although if it takes off in popularity we certainly might see it become a staple on the chain‚Äôs menu right beside those endless pasta bowls . \nIf you do decide to try a plate, you‚Äôll probably want to bring a friend with you to share the snack. According to the restaurant‚Äôs menu , one plate of the chips clocks in at 1,520 calories. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
