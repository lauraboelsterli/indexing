    "text": "Feb 26 (Reuters) - Apple Inc is preparing to release three new smartphones later this year, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the products.\nThe trio will include the largest ever iPhone, an upgraded handset the same size as the current iPhone X and a less expensive model with some of the flagship phoneâ€™s key features.\nThe iPhone maker is already running production tests with suppliers and is expected to announce the new phones this fall. However, the plans could still change, the report said. ( bloom.bg/2HNO4wg )\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
