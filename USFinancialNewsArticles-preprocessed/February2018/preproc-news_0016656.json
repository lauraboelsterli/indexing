    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The American Society for Deaf Children (ASDC), the oldest national non-profit organization providing resources to parents of deaf children, announced today that its board of directors has selected Rachel de Azevedo Coleman as the organization's Executive Director.\n\"We are thrilled to have Rachel as our Executive Director,\" said Board President Avonne Brooker-Rutowski. \"We are confident that Rachel's experience raising a deaf child and giving her child access to both English and American Sign Language (ASL), her history of taking action to better her daughter's life, and her passion for her work will bring ASDC to the next level.\"\n\"Rachel has gained a deep understanding of the importance in empowering parents to communicate and connect with their Deaf children through ASL,\" continued Mrs. Brooker-Rutowski. \"Together we will advance our mission by empowering families with deaf children to reach their highest potential.\"\nThe selection of Coleman caps a six month nationwide search by the board for someone to lead with vision and direction.\n\"ASDC has been a resource for me since 1997 and I am honored to lead its growth,\" said Mrs. Coleman. \"I know the challenges parents raising deaf children face. It's a daunting task to not only raise a child, but learn a new language, and incorporate a visual language system throughout your home and life. I have spent my career developing solutions for families like mine and I am eager to apply these skills at ASDC.\"\nAfter learning that her 14 month old daughter was profoundly deaf, Coleman was told not to have high expectations for her child. Coleman refused to accept that answer and for the past 20 years has been influential in creating a world where, through sign language, children can communicate their needs and be understood.\nColeman is the Emmy Award nominated host, and co-creator of \"Signing Time!\", the public television show and DVD series that teaches basic ASL vocabulary to families in a fun and musical way. The series has been broadcast to millions of viewers through PBS stations, Netflix, Nick Jr., and m ysigningtime.com .\nColeman's production companies, Azevedo Studios and SKYVIBE, will continue to create educational, value based children's programming such as Rachel & the Treeschoolers and FuntasticTV. The SKYVIBE network garnered 1.8 Billion views in the last 12 months on YouTube.\nIn 2015 Coleman launched m ydeafchild.org providing an online ASL curriculum, free of charge, to parents living in the U.S., raising deaf children ages 36 months and under. To date she has raised more than $1.5 Million dollars to produce curriculum and content for families raising deaf children.\nAmerican Society for Deaf Children (ASDC)\nAmerican Society for Deaf Children is the oldest national non-profit organization founded by and governed by parents of children who are deaf. ASDC was founded in 1967 as a parent-helping-parent organization.\nFor the past 50 years ASDC has provided support, encouragement, and information to families raising children who are deaf. The 26th Annual Family Conference takes place June 21-23, 2018 in Salt Lake City, Utah and features keynote presenters Roberta \"Bobbi\" Cordano, President of Gallaudet University and Nyle DiMarco, winner of \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"America's Next Top Model.\"\nFor more information visit deafchildren.org .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-society-for-deaf-children-announces-signing-times-rachel-coleman-as-executive-director-300595597.html\nSOURCE American Society for Deaf Children",
