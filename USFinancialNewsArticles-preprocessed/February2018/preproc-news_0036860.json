    "text": "18.2% year-over-year increase in home care revenue\nNEW PRAGUE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Electromed, Inc. (“Electromed” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:ELMD), a leader in innovative airway clearance technologies, today announced financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (“Q2 FY 2018”).\nQ2 FY 2018 Highlights\nNet revenue increased 9.6% to $7.0 million from $6.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016 (“Q2 FY 2017”), driven by an 18.2% year-over-year increase in home care revenue. Gross profit rose 13.4% to $5.6 million from $4.9 million in Q2 FY 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.2% to $4.8 million, from $4.1 million in Q2 FY 2017, primarily reflecting the hiring of new employees to support revenue growth initiatives. Operating income grew 5.6% to $770,000, from $729,000 in Q2 FY 2017. Net income equaled $349,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $444,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, in Q2 FY 2017. Net income for Q2 FY 2018 included a non-recurring discrete deferred tax expense of $160,000 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”). On a go-forward basis, the Tax Act reduces the statutory corporate federal tax rate from 34% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and is estimated to benefit the Company’s after-tax net income by approximately 13% beginning in fiscal 2018, as well as positively impact earnings per share and cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.2 million, compared to $1.3 million in Q2 FY 2017. Field sales employees grew to 43 at the end of Q2 FY 2018 from 35 at the end of Q2 FY 2017.\nKathleen Skarvan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Electromed, commented, “We grew home care revenue by 18.2% year-over-year while increasing investments in marketing and sales initiatives to address the large and underpenetrated bronchiectasis market. We also significantly grew the footprint of clinics using our innovative SmartVest Connect™ wireless connectivity solution and continue to receive positive feedback from physicians and patients on its intuitive design. SmartVest’s® patient therapy monitoring, ease-of-use and comfort, combined with our dedication to customer service, underpin Electromed’s continued progress this quarter.”\nMs. Skarvan continued, “Having completed most of our direct sales expansion for the fiscal year, with the number of field sales employees up more than 20% compared to the end of Q2 FY 2017, our near-term growth strategies are focused on improving sales force productivity, amplifying our direct-to-patient marketing and expanding the body of clinical evidence supporting SmartVest® benefits for bronchiectasis patients. We continue to manage the business for long-term growth, while remaining focused on profitability and positive cash flow short term. Year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 is estimated to be in line with fiscal 2017 growth levels. We remain confident in the growth opportunity for SmartVest® and excited about our direction, as we strive to improve quality of life and outcomes for an expanding number of patients with compromised pulmonary function.”\nQ2 FY 2018 Review\nNet revenue increased 9.6% to $7.0 million in Q2 FY 2018 from $6.4 million in Q2 FY 2017, driven by higher home care revenue. Home care revenue rose 18.2% to $6.5 million in Q2 FY 2018 from $5.5 million in Q2 FY 2017. This increase was primarily due to growth in approvals as a result of continued improvements in the Company’s reimbursement operations, which led to a greater referral to approval percentage as compared to the prior year.\nGross profit increased 13.4% to $5.6 million, or 80.0% of net revenue, in Q2 FY 2018 from $4.9 million, or 77.3% of net revenue, in Q2 FY 2017. The increase in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in home care revenue.\nOperating expenses, which include selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses as well as research and development (“R&D”) expenses, totaled $4.8 million, or 69.0% of net revenue, in Q2 FY 2018 compared with $4.2 million, or 65.9% of net revenue, in the same period of the prior year. SG&A expenses increased 16.2% to $4.8 million in Q2 FY 2018 from $4.1 million in Q2 FY 2017, primarily due to additional employees in sales, annual salary increases, higher share-based equity compensation expense, and additional sales incentives on higher revenue accruals. R&D expenses totaled $57,000 in Q2 FY 2018 compared to $101,000 in Q2 FY 2017.\nOperating income increased 5.6% to $770,000 in Q2 FY 2018, from $729,000 in Q2 FY 2017, reflecting higher gross profit partially offset by higher SG&A expense.\nNet income before income tax expense totaled $765,000 in Q2 FY 2018, compared to $714,000 in Q2 FY 2017.\nNet income equaled $349,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, in Q2 FY 2018, compared to $444,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, in Q2 FY 2017. In Q2 FY 2018, income tax expense totaled $416,000, compared to $270,000 in the same period of the prior year.\nIncome tax expense during Q2 FY 2018 included a discrete deferred tax expense of $160,000 as a result of re-measuring certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future under the Tax Act that was enacted by the U.S. Government on December 22, 2017. On a go forward basis, the Act reduces the statutory corporate federal tax rate from 34% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and is estimated to benefit the Company’s after-tax net income, earnings per share and cash flow by approximately 13% beginning in 2018.\nYear-to-Date FY 2018 Summary\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2017, revenue grew 12.2% to $13.4 million from $11.9 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, driven by a 17.4% increase in home care revenue. Gross margins were 78.7%, compared to 77.7% in the prior fiscal year, while net income was approximately $470,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to approximately $635,000, or $0.08 per diluted share in fiscal 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nElectromed’s balance sheet at December 31, 2017 included cash of $6.8 million, current maturities of long-term debt of $1.1 million, working capital of $15.5 million, and shareholders’ equity of $19.9 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on February 14, 2018 at 8:00 am CT (9:00 am ET) to discuss Q2 FY 2018 financial results and other matters.\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing:\n(877) 407-9753 (Domestic) (201) 493-6739 (International)\nThe conference call will also be accessible via the following link:\nhttp://www.investorcalendar.com/event/23177 .\nFor those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, an online webcast replay will be available in the Investor Relations section of Electromed’s web site at: http://www.smartvest.com/electromed/investor-relations/ .\nAbout Electromed, Inc.\nElectromed, Inc. manufactures, markets, and sells products that provide airway clearance therapy, including the SmartVest ® Airway Clearance System, to patients with compromised pulmonary function.
