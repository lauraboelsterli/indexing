It accused the producer of \"repeatedly and persistently\" sexually harassing female workers in violation of state law.\nThe attorney general's office said the lawsuit was filed partly due to reports of the movie company's imminent sale to an investment group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet. She was the chief administrator of the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama.\nWeinstein has repeatedly denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex.\nHis New York attorney released a statement saying many of the allegations against his client are \"without merit.\"",
