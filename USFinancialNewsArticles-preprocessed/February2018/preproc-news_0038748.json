    "text": "Qualcomm slammed Broadcom 's reduced buyout offer Wednesday, saying the adjusted $79-per-share price \"has made an inadequate offer even worse.\" \nBroadcom lowered its bid to buy the company Wednesday in response to a possible Qualcomm tie-up with NXP Semiconductors . \n\"Broadcom is well aware there is no 'reduction of value by $4.10 per share' because the transaction could not be completed at $110.00 per share,\" Qualcomm said in a statement. \n\"The Qualcomm Board is committed to maximizing value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether that be through executing its growth strategy or selling the company. Broadcom's revised $79.00 per share proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm, fails to take into account the strategic and financial benefits of acquiring NXP, and continues to face a long and highly uncertain path to regulatory approvals,\" the company said. \nBroadcom earlier this month upped its offer to $82 a share, or roughly $121 billion, from the initial bid of $105 billion. Wednesday's offer rounds out to approximately $117 billion. \nAny of those price tags would make a merger the most expensive in tech history, but Qualcomm and lead director Tom Horton have said it's \"just not even close to what the value of the company is.\"",
