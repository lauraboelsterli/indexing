    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Main Street Capital Corporation (NYSE: MAIN) (\"Main Street\") is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors declared regular monthly cash dividends of $0.19 per share for each of April, May and June 2018. These monthly dividends, which will be payable pursuant to the table below, total $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2018, which is consistent with the regular monthly dividends declared for the first quarter of 2018 and represents a 2.7% increase from the regular monthly dividends paid for the second quarter of 2017. Since its October 2007 initial public offering, Main Street has periodically increased the amount of its regular monthly dividends paid per share, and has never reduced its regular monthly dividend amount per share. Including all dividends declared to date, Main Street will have paid $22.53 per share in cumulative cash dividends since its October 2007 initial public offering at $15.00 per share.\nSummary of Second Quarter 2018 Regular Monthly Dividends\nDeclared\nEx-Dividend\nDate\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nAmount Per\nShare\n2/20/2018\n3/20/2018\n3/21/2018\n4/16/2018\n$0.19\n2/20/2018\n4/19/2018\n4/20/2018\n5/15/2018\n$0.19\n2/20/2018\n5/18/2018\n5/21/2018\n6/15/2018\n$0.19\nTotal for Second Quarter 2018:\n$0.57\nThe final determination of the tax attributes for dividends each year are made after the close of the tax year. The final tax attributes for 2018 dividends are currently expected to include ordinary taxable income, capital gains and qualified dividends.\nMain Street maintains a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its registered stockholders who hold their shares with Main Street's transfer agent and registrar, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or certain brokerage firms that have elected to participate in the DRIP. Under the DRIP, if Main Street declares a dividend, registered stockholders (and stockholders holding shares through participating brokerage firms) who have not \"opted out\" of the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of Main Street common stock.\nABOUT MAIN STREET CAPITAL CORPORATION\nMain Street ( www.mainstcapital.com ) is a principal investment firm that primarily provides long-term debt and equity capital to lower middle market companies and debt capital to middle market companies.
