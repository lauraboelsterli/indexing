The district includes all or parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. * Farm income declined from the year-ago quarter. * Value of quality farmland rose 5 percent from a year earlier, while ranchland and pastureland values jumped nearly 15 percent. * Cash rents increased 3.9 percent for quality farmland, and 10.1 percent for ranchland or pastureland, from a year earlier. * Of bankers surveyed, more expect cash rents to decline in the first quarter of 2018.
