    "text": "(Recasts with level of devaluation; adds details)\nCARACAS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Venezuelaâ€™s central bank on Monday announced a devaluation of more than 99 percent of its official exchange rate with a new foreign exchange platform.\nThe central bank said the first auction of its new DICOM system yielded an exchange rate of 30,987.5 bolivars per euro, equivalent to around 25,000 per dollar.\nThat is a devaluation of 86.6 percent with respect to the previous DICOM rate and 99.6 percent from the subsidized rate of 10 bolivars per dollar, which was eliminated last week. ( goo.gl/TRuF2Z )\nThe new rate is still dwarfed by the black market rate for greenbacks, currently at 228,000 bolivars per dollar according to website DolarToday, which is used as a reference.\nVenezuela is undergoing a major crisis, with quadruple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine. Economists consistently describe the 15-year-old currency control system as the principal obstacle to functioning commerce and industry.\n1 eur = 1.24 dollars Reporting by Caracas newsroom; Writing by Brian Ellsworth and Girish Gupta; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ",
