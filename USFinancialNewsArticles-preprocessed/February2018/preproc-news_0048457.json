    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, UT , Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Investview Corporation (INVU) filed its third quarter financials for the period ending December 31st, 2017 while seeing a significant increase in January 2018 billings generating positive cash flow for the first time.\nInvestview and its wholly owned subsidiary Wealth Generators reported a net loss of just over $7.1 million-dollars for the 3-month period ending December 31st, 2017. This certainly does not appear to be the type of news one broadcasts through a press release, but we believe the story behind the numbers is important to share as $6.7 million dollars or approximately 92% of that loss can be attributed to stock issuances. This generated a net loss of approximately $402k for the period down from a loss of over $1M for the prior quarter.\nThese stock issuances are through agreements we have entered that bring additional talent, revenue and products to the company and many are structured to award additional shares based upon revenue growth to the company. This expense is designed to initiate growth and cash flow.\nThe acquisition of Wealth Generators by Investview Inc. was done to accomplish three goals: 1) arrange for proper company financing, 2) use equity (shares) to acquire additional assets and 3) establish a higher level of transparency through public reporting requirements.\nYou could say we took our objectives very seriously as we increased our authorized shares, made a series of strategic partnerships, settled or converted outstanding debt while working to increase our revenue.\nIn January of 2018 we issued a press release announcing an unaudited estimated increase in gross revenues of 38% (Press Release February 5th, 2018) http://ow.ly/B4zR30iseGw . While we did increase our gross billings by 38% for the prior quarter, what was even more impressive was that our cash flow turned positive for the first time in January of 2018.\nWilliam Kosoff, Acting CFO stated, “Having been with the parent company Investview Inc. since 2005 and tirelessly waiting to achieve positive cash flow, I find the accomplishments over the last nine months very impressive and even more reassuring are the positive financial indicators we are beginning to see. We first look for revenue growth, followed by a reduction in losses, then positive cash flow which should ultimately bring us to positive earnings.”\nAbout Wealth Generators\nWealth Generators provides financial technology, education, and research to individuals to enable them to “Find, Grow, and Keep” their money.
