(NASDAQ: SWKS) an innovator of high performance analog semiconductors connecting people, places and things, today reported first fiscal quarter results for the period ending December 29, 2017. Revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $1.052 billion, up 7 percent sequentially and 15 percent year-over-year, exceeding consensus estimates.\nOn a GAAP basis, operating income for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 was $383.5 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.38, which includes $1.49 per share of one-time, tax-related expenses due to recently enacted tax legislation in the United States. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $414.0 million with record non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.00, up 24 percent year-over-year and $0.09 better than consensus estimates.\n“Skyworks exceeded $1 billion in quarterly revenue and achieved $2.00 per share in non-GAAP diluted EPS in Q1 FY18 driven by strong global demand for our wireless communications engines,” said Liam K. Griffin, president and chief executive officer of Skyworks. “As connectivity performance requirements intensify, Skyworks is leveraging our mixed signal expertise, scale and customer relationships to power the mobile economy and capitalize on several strategic growth catalysts. Our system solutions are enabling everything from industrial robotics to drones, autonomous vehicles, wireless infrastructure, home security systems and virtual assistants. Further, with the recent launch of our breakthrough Sky5™ platform, Skyworks is well positioned to accelerate 5G deployments and, ultimately, to extend our competitive advantage.”\nFirst Quarter Business Highlights\nRamped ZigBee® and Bluetooth® devices for Nest’s portfolio of residential alarms Delivered connectivity solutions for Google Home Max wireless speakers Shipped AEC-Q100 grade modules to leading European auto manufacturers Designed into Sylvania’s smart light bulbs for the connected home Launched LTE-Cat 1 engines across Amazon’s Kindle Oasis e-readers Supported NetGear’s Orbi Wi-Fi system for outdoor mesh networks Enabled Comcast’s DOCSIS 3.1 broadband routers Deployed LTE-A telematics modems for next generation OnStar® applications Unveiled SkyOne® WiFi portfolio of highly integrated wireless networking engines Leveraged SkyOne® and SkyBlue™ across ZTE and HTC mobile phones Secured massive MIMO design wins with leading infrastructure provider for China Powered Motorola, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi flagship smartphone launches with suite of SkyLiTE™, Wi-Fi and switching solutions Partnered with XY Findables to enable innovative tracking devices\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook and Shareholder Cash Return Plan\nWe provide earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis because certain information necessary to reconcile such guidance to GAAP is difficult to estimate and dependent on future events outside of our control.

At the midpoint of approximately $910 million in revenue, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be up 10 percent year-over-year to $1.60. Additionally, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion stock repurchase program reflecting confidence in our business model and outlook. Our plans for sustained above market growth and strong cash generation, coupled with the benefits from the recently passed U.S. tax reform act, are enabling us to increase our targeted cash return rate to shareholders from the prior 40-50 percent range to 60-75 percent of free cash flow going forward.”\nDividend Payment\nSkyworks’ Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.32 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on March 15, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 22, 2018.\nSkyworks' First Fiscal Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nSkyworks will host a conference call with analysts to discuss its first fiscal quarter 2018 results and business outlook today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.

As set forth in the “Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” table found above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods, compare our operating performance against peer companies and determine payments under certain compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-recurring expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make forecasts.\nWe provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We also believe that providing non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows investors to assess the extent to which our ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. We further believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share allows investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of intangibles, restructuring-related charges, litigation settlement gains, losses and expenses, and certain tax items which may not occur in each period presented and which may represent non-cash items unrelated to our ongoing operations. We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures.\nWe calculate non-GAAP gross profit by excluding from GAAP gross profit, share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. We calculate non-GAAP operating income by excluding from GAAP operating income, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of intangibles, restructuring-related charges, and litigation settlement gains, losses and expenses. We calculate non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share by excluding from GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of intangibles, restructuring-related charges, litigation settlement gains, losses and expenses, and certain tax items. We exclude the items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below:\nShare-Based Compensation - because (1) the total amount of expense is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred, (2) it is an expense based upon a valuation methodology premised on assumptions that vary over time, and (3) the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies due to factors that can be outside of the control of such companies.\nAcquisition-Related Expenses - including such items as, when applicable, amortization of acquired intangible assets, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, acquisition-related professional fees, deemed compensation expenses and interest expense on seller-financed debt, because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges does not accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nRestructuring-Related Charges - because, to the extent such charges impact a period presented, we believe that they have no direct correlation to our future business operations and including such charges does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nLitigation Settlement Gains, Losses and Expenses - including gains, losses and expenses related to the resolution of other-than-ordinary-course threatened and actually filed lawsuits and other-than-ordinary-course contractual disputes, because (1) they are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) such litigation has been infrequent in nature, (3) such gains, losses and expenses are generally not directly controlled by management, (4) we believe such gains, losses and expenses do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized and (5) the amount of such gains or losses and expenses can vary significantly between companies and make comparisons less reliable.\nCertain Income Tax Items - including certain deferred tax charges and benefits that do not result in a current tax payment or tax refund and other adjustments, including but not limited to, items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies because different companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nOur earnings release contains forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of our 2018 fiscal year (“Q2 2018”). We provide this non-GAAP measure to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide it to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking estimate of Q2 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share to a forward-looking estimate of Q2 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 2018 (other than estimated share-based compensation expense of $0.12 to $0.16 per diluted share, certain tax items of ($0.01) to ($0.05) per diluted share and estimated amortization of intangibles of $0.01 to $0.05 per diluted share) is difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated litigation settlement gains, losses and expenses and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. We believe the probable significance of these unknown items, in the aggregate, to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.05 in quarterly earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.\n[a] These charges represent expense recognized in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation, Stock Compensation. For the three months ended December 29, 2017, approximately $4.1 million, $11.2 million and $10.5 million were included in cost of goods sold, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. For the three months ended December 30, 2016, approximately $3.8 million, $8.3 million and $9.5 million were included in cost of goods sold, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. [b] The acquisition-related expenses recognized during the three months ended December 29, 2017, include a $0.7 million charge to general and administrative expenses, primarily associated with acquisitions completed or contemplated during the period. The acquisition-related expenses recognized during the three months ended December 30, 2016, include a $1.7 million charge to general and administrative expenses, primarily associated with acquisitions completed or contemplated during the period. [c] During the three months ended December 29, 2017 and December 30, 2016, the Company incurred $4.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively, in amortization of intangibles. [d] During the three months ended December 30, 2016, the Company incurred a $0.6 million charge in employee severance costs primarily related to restructuring plans that were implemented during the period. [e] During the three months ended December 29, 2017, these amounts primarily represent a one-time charge of $257.8 million related to the mandatory deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings, a one-time charge of $18.5 million related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to tax reform, use of net operating loss carryforwards, deferred tax expense not affecting taxes payable, and non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions. During the three months ended December 30, 2016, these amounts primarily represent the use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense not affecting taxes payable, tax deductible share-based compensation expense in excess of GAAP share-based compensation expense, the release of previously reserved items that are no longer required as a result of IRS audits, and non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions.
