    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cohesity, the leader of hyperconverged secondary storage , announced today that the company has further expanded its presence in the Asia Pacific market, bringing on Theo Hourmouzis as managing director, Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), and selecting Arrow Enterprise Computing Systems ANZ as its regional distribution partner. Cohesity increased revenue by 600 percent in 2017 with its completely channel-focused sales approach, and continues to build on its large base of customers and partners across the globe.\nCompanies are struggling to move beyond the legacy approach to secondary storage, which covers all non-primary data use cases – including data protection and backup, file and object shares, test/dev, and analytics – and has created a fragmented landscape of separate solutions and silos that typically account for 80 percent of enterprise data. Cohesity DataPlatform consolidates all of these workflows on a unified, scalable platform for the cloud or on premises. Cohesity delivers a radically simpler solution with a single interface, reducing cost, data center footprint, and making it easier to manage and extract insights.\nAs managing director, Hourmouzis will be responsible for Cohesity’s development and growth in the region, helping customers understand how to achieve radically efficient secondary storage and building relationships with partner resellers. Hourmouzis joins Cohesity after more than five years serving as senior director of sales, Asia Pacific, for Nimble Storage, which was recently acquired by HPE. Combined with his previous experience working for NetApp, Hourmouzis brings deep knowledge of the storage industry and regional technology partners to this new role.\n“Cohesity has the unique ability to fundamentally change the way enterprises manage and extract value from their secondary data, a space that has seen very little innovation and is ready for a new approach,” said Theo Hourmouzis, Cohesity’s managing director, Australia and New Zealand. “I’m excited about the opportunity to grow Cohesity’s presence in the ANZ market and empower more customers to consolidate their secondary storage environment, realizing efficiencies and cost saving with a focus on data mobility into the cloud.”\nArrow ECS ANZ, the leading value-add distributor for Australia and New Zealand, has partnered with Cohesity to deliver its hyperconverged secondary storage solutions to enterprises in the region. Cohesity has also established partnerships with several channel resellers in the region that will work directly to educate and sell to customers that want to overcome secondary storage obstacles.\n“We see Arrow’s partnership with Cohesity as a key opportunity for partners engaging in traditional backup and storage deals. We know end-users are looking for modern solutions to contemporary challenges, and partners are looking for new revenue opportunities and ways to differentiate,” said Nick Verykios, managing director, Arrow ECS ANZ. “Cohesity, together with Arrow, has the capacity to address all those points with the revolutionary secondary storage offering they bring to market.”\nThe Fortune Global 500 energy management company Schneider Electric recently adopted Cohesity DataPlatform to replace legacy data protection and backup solutions for its Energy & Sustainability Services division in the ANZ region. Cohesity’s hyperconverged secondary storage platform empowered Schneider Electric to simplify and streamline IT processes, achieve much faster recovery times, and seamlessly extend backup data into the cloud.\n“Cohesity has brought our once aging and legacy backup process into the modern day – providing a breath of fresh air in a previously tedious and frustrating process,” said Anthony De Luca, manager, IT Operations, Energy & Sustainability Services, Schneider Electric. “With Cohesity, our entire environment is backed up to the hour – every hour. Utilizing secondary cloud storage – with simple yet powerful storage policies – we know our data is securely backed up. What makes Cohesity so great is its ease of use, especially in recovering data almost immediately, running virtual machines straight from a snapshot, and finally, the incredibly responsive support team at Cohesity.”\n“We have seen incredible momentum across the globe driven by Cohesity’s revolutionary approach to secondary storage, and we’re excited for Theo to expand our presence in the region with Arrow ECS ANZ as a distributor,” said Rob Salmon, president and COO, Cohesity. “We value quality over quantity in our channel ecosystem; rather than adding thousands of resellers, we want to cultivate a small number of partners and show true value to them and to their customers.”\nMeet Cohesity at the Cisco Live 2018 Conference\nCustomers and partners will have a chance to meet the newly expanded Cohesity team during the upcoming Cisco Live 2018 Melbourne conference in March, at the company’s exhibition-floor booth, #E34.\nWhat: Cisco Live 2018 Melbourne When: March 6-9, 2018 Where: Booth #E34, Melbourne Convention & Exhibition Centre (MCEC) 1 Convention Centre Place South Wharf, Melbourne, Australia About Cohesity\nCohesity makes your data work for you by consolidating secondary storage silos onto a hyperconverged, web-scale data platform that spans both private and public clouds. Enterprise customers begin by radically streamlining their backup and data protection, then converge file and object services, test/dev instances, and analytic functions to provide a global data store. Cohesity counts many Global 1000 companies and federal agencies among its rapidly growing customer base and was named to Forbes’ “Next Billion-Dollar Startups 2017,” LinkedIn’s “Startups: The 50 Industry Disruptors You Need to Know Now,” and CRN’s “2017 Emerging Vendors in Storage” lists.
