    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nAs previously announced, U.S. Cellular will hold a teleconference February 23, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. CST. Listen to the call live via the Events & Presentations page of investors.uscellular.com .\nUnited States Cellular Corporation (NYSE:USM) reported total operating revenues of $1,029 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $1,006 million for the same period one year ago and Net income attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders and related diluted earnings per share were $273 million and $3.18, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding a benefit of $269 million related to the enactment of new tax legislation, Net income attributable to U.S. Cellular common shareholders and related diluted earnings per share excluding adjustments (non-GAAP) were $4 million and $0.05, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to Net loss attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders and related diluted loss per share of $6 million and $0.07, respectively, in the same period one year ago.\nU.S. Cellular reported total operating revenues of $3,890 million and $3,990 million for the years ended 2017 and 2016, respectively, and Net income attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders and related diluted earnings per share were $12 million and $0.14, respectively, for the year ended 2017. Excluding the benefit of $269 million related to the enactment of new tax legislation and the recognition of a loss on goodwill impairment of $370 million ($307 million, net of tax) in the third quarter, Net income attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders and related diluted earnings per share excluding adjustments (non-GAAP) were $50 million and $0.58, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to Net income attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders and related diluted earnings per share of $48 million and $0.56, respectively, for the year ended 2016.\n\"We made significant progress on the strategic imperatives we set for 2017,\" said Kenneth R. Meyers, U.S. Cellular President and CEO. \"With the success of our Total Plans, which include an unlimited data option and no hidden fees, we were able to grow our customer base through the powerful combination of new customer additions and increased loyalty and customer engagement. Through a company-wide initiative to better align costs with our strategic imperatives, we were able to reduce expenses by some $100 million in 2017 and, importantly, identify and implement programs to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond. This extensive attention on costs allowed us to offset a decline in revenues caused by competitive pricing pressures and generate a modest increase in profitability.\n\"Managing our investment spending was another imperative for us in 2017 as we remain focused on providing an exceptional wireless experience for our customers wherever they live, work or play. We do this by investing in our network to increase capacity and roll out new products and services. For example, VoLTE is now operational in Iowa and Wisconsin, providing enhanced features and higher quality calls. We were able to execute these network investments with capital spending well below our original expectations.\n\"As we look to 2018, I am optimistic about our ability to increase revenues through a larger subscriber base and an expectation for a more rational competitive environment. We will continue to control costs across the organization, and remain disciplined in managing investments of capital for network capacity and quality and for digitization initiatives.\"\n2018 Estimated Results\nU.S. Cellular's estimates of full-year 2018 results are shown below. Such estimates represent management's view as of February 23, 2018. Such forward‑looking statements should not be assumed to be current as of any future date. U.S. Cellular undertakes no duty to update such information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. There can be no assurance that final results will not differ materially from such estimated results.\n2018 Estimated Results and Actual Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n2018 Estimated Results\nActual Results for the Year\nEnded December 31, 2017\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal operating revenues\n$3,850-$4,050\n$\n3,890\nAdjusted OIBDA (1)(2)\n$625-$775\n$\n675\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$765-$915\n$\n820\nCapital expenditures\n$500-$550\n$\n469\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 estimated results and actual results for the year ended December 31, 2017. In providing 2018 estimated results, U.S. Cellular has not completed the below reconciliation to Net income because it does not provide guidance for income taxes. Although potentially significant, U.S. Cellular believes that the impact of income taxes cannot be reasonably predicted; therefore, U.S. Cellular is unable to provide such guidance.\n2018 Estimated Results\nActual Results for the\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet income (GAAP)\nN/A\n$\n15\nAdd back (deduct):\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\nN/A\n(287)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (GAAP)\n$\n10-160\n$\n(272)\nAdd back:\nInterest expense\n110\n113\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense\n625\n615\nEBITDA (Non-GAAP) (1)\n$\n745-895\n$\n456\nAdd back (deduct):\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n370\n(Gain) loss on sale of business and other exit costs, net\n–\n(1)\n(Gain) loss on license sales and exchanges, net\n–\n(22)\n(Gain) loss on asset disposals, net\n20\n17\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) (1)\n$\n765-915\n$\n820\nDeduct:\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated entities\n130\n137\nInterest and dividend income\n10\n8\nAdjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) (1)(2)\n$\n625-775\n$\n675\nNote: Totals may not foot due to rounding differences.\n(1)\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are defined as net income adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation above. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are not measures of financial performance under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) and should not be considered as alternatives to Net income or Cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of cash flows or as measures of liquidity. U.S. Cellular does not intend to imply that any such items set forth in the reconciliation above are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual; such items may occur in the future. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA as measurements of profitability, and therefore reconciliations to Net income are deemed appropriate. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are useful measures of U.S. Cellular's operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, gains and losses, and other items as presented above as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of U.S. Cellular's financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA shows adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, and gains and losses, while Adjusted OIBDA reduces this measure further to exclude Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and Interest and dividend income in order to more effectively show the performance of operating activities excluding investment activities. The table above reconciles EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA to the corresponding GAAP measure, Net income or Income (loss) before income taxes.\n(2)\nA reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA (Non-GAAP) to Operating income (GAAP) for full year 2017 actual results can be found on U.S. Cellular's website at investors.uscellular.com .\nConference Call Information\nU.S. Cellular will hold a conference call on February 23, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. Central Time.\nAccess the live call on the Events & Presentations page of investors.uscellular.com or at https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1145/24672 .

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which U.S. Cellular believes may be useful to investors and other users of its financial information in evaluating liquidity, specifically, the amount of net cash generated by business operations after deducting Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment.\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures present certain information in the table below excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge, enactment of H.R.1, originally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) and other related tax effects. The goodwill impairment charge, which occurred in the third quarter of 2017, and the deferred tax benefit are being excluded in this presentation, as they cause current operations of U.S. Cellular not to be comparable with prior periods. U.S. Cellular believes these measures may be useful to investors and other users of its financial information when comparing the current period financial results with periods that were not impacted by such items.\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income (loss) attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n273\n$\n(6)\n$\n12\n$\n48\nAdjustments:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n–\n370\n–\nTax benefit on impairment of goodwill (1)\n–\n–\n(63)\n–\nSubtotal of Non-GAAP goodwill adjustments\n–\n–\n307\n–\nEffect of the Tax Act\n(269)\n–\n(269)\n–\nSubtotal of Non-GAAP adjustments\n(269)\n–\n38\n–\nNet income (loss) attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders excluding adjustments (Non-GAAP)\n$\n4\n$\n(6)\n$\n50\n$\n48\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders (GAAP)\n$\n3.18\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.56\nAdjustments:\nLoss on impairment of goodwill\n–\n–\n4.31\n–\nTax benefit on impairment of goodwill (1)\n–\n–\n(0.74)\n–\nEffect of the Tax Act\n(3.13)\n–\n(3.13)\n–\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to U.S. Cellular shareholders excluding adjustments (Non-GAAP)\n$\n0.05\n$\n(0.07)\n$\n0.58\n$\n0.56\n(1)\nTax benefit represents the amount associated with the tax-amortizable portion of the loss on goodwill impairment.\nPostpaid ABPU and Postpaid ABPA\nU.S. Cellular presents Postpaid ABPU and Postpaid ABPA to reflect the revenue shift from Service revenues to Equipment sales resulting from the increased adoption of equipment installment plans. Postpaid ABPU and Postpaid ABPA, as previously defined herein, are non-GAAP financial measures which U.S. Cellular believes are useful to investors and other users of its financial information in showing trends in both service and equipment sales revenues received from customers.\nFor the Quarter Ended\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n(Dollars and connection counts in millions)\nCalculation of Postpaid ARPU\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nAverage number of postpaid connections\n4.52\n4.50\n4.47\n4.46\n4.48\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ARPU (GAAP metric)\n$\n44.12\n$\n43.41\n$\n44.60\n$\n45.42\n$\n45.19\nCalculation of Postpaid ABPU\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nEquipment installment plan billings\n170\n152\n142\n139\n138\nTotal billings to postpaid connections\n$\n768\n$\n738\n$\n739\n$\n747\n$\n745\nAverage number of postpaid connections\n4.52\n4.50\n4.47\n4.46\n4.48\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ABPU (Non-GAAP metric)\n$\n56.69\n$\n54.71\n$\n55.19\n$\n55.82\n$\n55.43\nCalculation of Postpaid ARPA\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nAverage number of postpaid accounts\n1.69\n1.68\n1.66\n1.66\n1.68\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ARPA (GAAP metric)\n$\n118.05\n$\n116.36\n$\n119.73\n$\n121.88\n$\n120.67\nCalculation of Postpaid ABPA\nPostpaid service revenues\n$\n598\n$\n586\n$\n597\n$\n608\n$\n607\nEquipment installment plan billings\n170\n152\n142\n139\n138\nTotal billings to postpaid accounts\n$\n768\n$\n738\n$\n739\n$\n747\n$\n745\nAverage number of postpaid accounts\n1.69\n1.68\n1.66\n1.66\n1.68\nNumber of months in period\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nPostpaid ABPA (Non-GAAP metric)\n$\n151.68\n$\n146.65\n$\n148.15\n$\n149.78\n$\n148.02\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-cellular-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300603349.html\nSOURCE United States Cellular Corporation",
