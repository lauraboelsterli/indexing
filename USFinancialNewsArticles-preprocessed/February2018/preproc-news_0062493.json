Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $112.3 million as compared to $111.1 million for the same period in 2016, a 1.2% increase.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Funds From Operations, or FFO, was $140.0 million versus $126.6 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of 10.6%.

Acquisition-adjusted net revenue and Acquisition-adjusted EBITDA include adjustments to the 2016 period for acquisitions and divestitures for the same time frame as actually owned in the 2017 period. See “Reconciliation of Reported Basis to Acquisition-Adjusted Results”, which provides reconciliations to GAAP for Acquisition-adjusted measures.\nTwelve Months Results\nLamar reported net revenues of $1.54 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 versus $1.50 billion for the same period in 2016, a 2.7% increase. Operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $455.4 million as compared to $439.0 million for the same period in 2016. Lamar recognized net income of $317.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income of $298.8 million for the same period in 2016. Net income per diluted share increased 5.9% to $3.23 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $3.05 for the same period in 2016. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA for twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $671.4 million versus $657.5 million for the same period in 2016, a 2.1% increase.\nCash flow provided by operating activities decreased to $507.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $521.8 million for the same period in 2016. Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 3.0% to $430.0 million as compared to $417.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, FFO was $513.0 million versus $475.6 million for the same period in 2016, a 7.9% increase.

See “Supplemental Schedules and Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures”, for a reconciliation to GAAP.\nRecent Events\nOn February 16, 2018, Lamar Media announced its intention to redeem in full all $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022. The redemption will be made in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes and the terms of the notice of redemption.\nLamar Media expects the Notes to be redeemed on March 19, 2018 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to 101.958% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to (but not including) the Redemption Date. Lamar intends to fund the redemption through borrowings from the establishment of a new term loan facility under Lamar Media’s senior credit facility (the “Term Loan”). Lamar Media expects to amend its senior credit agreement to establish the Term Loan on or before the Redemption Date.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding sales trends. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) our significant indebtedness; (2) the state of the economy and financial markets generally and the effect of the broader economy on the demand for advertising; (3) the continued popularity of outdoor advertising as an advertising medium; (4) our need for and ability to obtain additional funding for operations, debt refinancing or acquisitions; (5) our ability to continue to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) and maintain our status as a REIT; (6) the regulation of the outdoor advertising industry by federal, state and local governments; (7) the integration of companies and assets that we acquire and our ability to recognize cost savings or operating efficiencies as a result of these acquisitions; (8) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (9) changes in tax laws applicable to REITs or in the interpretation of those laws; (10) our ability to renew expiring contracts at favorable rates; (11) our ability to successfully implement our digital deployment strategy; (12) the effects of hurricane Maria in the short and long-term on our business and the advertising market in Puerto Rico; (13) the market for our Class A common stock; and (14) our ability to amend our senior credit facility to provide for a new term loan facility in order to fund our planned redemption of our 5 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022. For additional information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the risk factors included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as supplemented by any risk factors contained in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this document. These statements speak only as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements, except as may be required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has presented the following measures that are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”): Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Free Cash Flow, Funds From Operations (“FFO”), Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”), Diluted AFFO per share, Outdoor Operating Income and Acquisition-Adjusted Results. Our management reviews our performance by focusing on these key performance indicators not prepared in conformity with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP performance indicators are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOur Non-GAAP financial measures are determined as follows:\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense (income), gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and investments, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on disposition of assets and investments.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest, net of interest income and amortization of deferred financing costs, current taxes, preferred stock dividends and total capital expenditures.\nWe use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition of FFO, which is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate assets and investments and real estate related depreciation and amortization and including adjustments to eliminate unconsolidated affiliates and non-controlling interest.\nWe define AFFO as FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) non-cash portion of tax provision; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation and amortization; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs; (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt; (vii) non-recurring infrequent or unusual losses (gains); (viii) less maintenance capital expenditures; and (ix) an adjustment for unconsolidated affiliates and non-controlling interest.\nDiluted AFFO per share is defined as AFFO divided by Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.\nOutdoor Operating Income is defined as Operating Income before corporate expenses, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and gain (loss) on disposition of assets.\nAcquisition-Adjusted Results adjusts our net revenue, direct and general and administrative expenses, outdoor operating income, corporate expense and EBITDA for the prior period by adding to, or subtracting from, the corresponding revenue or expense generated by the acquired assets or divested before our acquisition or divestiture of these assets for the same time frame that those assets were owned in the current period. In calculating Acquisition-Adjusted Results, therefore, we include revenue and expenses generated by assets that we did not own in the prior period but acquired in the current period. We refer to the amount of pre-acquisition revenue and expense generated by or subtracted from the acquired assets during the prior period that corresponds with the current period in which we owned the assets (to the extent within the period to which this report relates) as “Acquisition-Adjusted Results”.\nAdjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Outdoor Operating Income and Acquisition-Adjusted Results are not intended to replace other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow, FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In the aftermath of hurricane Maria, which made landfall in Puerto Rico in late September 2017 and had a severely negative impact on the local economy, we present our Acquisition-Adjusted Results both including and excluding our operations in Puerto Rico in order to enable our investors to evaluate the impact on our business. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, FFO, AFFO, Diluted AFFO per share, Outdoor Operating Income and Acquisition-Adjusted Results are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. Specifically, we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating our core operating results; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the industry to measure operating performance as it excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization, which may vary significantly among companies, depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (3) Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO and Diluted AFFO per share each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-over-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and reflect the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs; (4) Acquisition-Adjusted Results is a supplement to enable investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions and divestures, which reflects our core performance and organic growth (if any) during the period in which the assets were owned and managed by us; (5) Free Cash Flow is an indicator of our ability to service debt and generate cash for acquisitions and other strategic investments; (6) Outdoor Operating Income provides investors a measurement of our core results without the impact of fluctuations in stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and corporate expenses; and (7) each of our Non-GAAP measures provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.\nOur measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Outdoor Operating Income and Acquisition-Adjusted Results may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Outdoor Operating Income and Acquisition-Adjusted Results to the most directly comparable GAAP measures have been included herein.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be held to discuss the Company’s operating results on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. central time.
