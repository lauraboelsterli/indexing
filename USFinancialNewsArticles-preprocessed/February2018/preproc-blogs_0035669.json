    "text": "Second US judge blocks Trump administration from ending DACA program US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled that DACA cannot end in March as planned. This decision is similar to an earlier ruling by a federal judge in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation over Trump's decision unfolds. Published 22 Mins Ago Reuters Monica Almeida | Reuters A DACA recipient who was brought to the U.S. when she was 4-years-old, speaks during a rally in support of a permanent legislative solution for immigrants in Los Angeles, California, February 3, 2018. \nA second U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump 's decision to end a program that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children from deportation. \nU.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, cannot end in March as planned, a victory for state attorneys general and immigrants who sued the Republican administration. The decision is similar to an earlier ruling by a federal judge in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation over Trump's decision unfolds.",
