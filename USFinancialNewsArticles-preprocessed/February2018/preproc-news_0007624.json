The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $0.1 million in loan level derivative income and a decrease of $0.1 million in gain on sales of loans and leases held-for-sale.\nPROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.

The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans on an annualized basis increased to 60 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 14 basis points for the third quarter of 2017.

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $0.4 million in compensation and employee benefits and a decrease of $0.2 million in FDIC insurance, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in equipment and data processing expense and an increase of $0.2 million in professional services. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 55.38 percent compared to 56.37 percent for the third quarter of 2017 and 56.92 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\nThe effective tax rate was 70.6 percent and 44.9 percent for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. As a result of changes introduced by the Tax Reform Act, the provision for income taxes included a total write-down associated with the revaluation of net deferred tax assets of $9.0 million. The changes to the future federal statutory tax rate and other provisions set forth in the Tax Reform Act resulted in the re-measurement of the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset and investments in low income housing tax credits.
