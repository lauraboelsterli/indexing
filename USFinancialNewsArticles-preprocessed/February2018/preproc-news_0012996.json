( bit.ly/2nIM92Z )\nTata Motors saw profit in the year-ago quarter hit by lower wholesale volumes and higher marketing expenses at its Jaguar Land Rover unit as well as wider losses at its domestic business.\nIn the latest quarter, retail sales of its sleek Jaguar saloons and Land Rover sport utility vehicles rose 3.5 percent, while the EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) rose 80 basis points, driven by higher volumes of its Velar and Discovery models.\nBut last month JLR said it would temporarily reduce production at its northern English car plant in Halewood in response to weakening demand due to Brexit and tax hikes on diesel cars.\nSeparately, the carmaker and Warbug Pincus called off a deal in which Tata Motors was to sell a 43 percent stake in Tata Technologies to the private equity firm. bit.ly/2nHCESH ($1 = 64.0650 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Arnab Paul in Bengaluru Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Louise Heavens)\n ",
