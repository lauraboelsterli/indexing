Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES GALLOP AHEAD (0820 GMT) It looks like investors have turned their attention from bond yields and rising inflation to the strong earnings picture in Europe, as the STOXX 600 powers ahead this morning thanks to a slew of well-received company results. Rounding up a couple of early standout performers, Dutch oil storage company Vopak , French satellite operator Eutelsat and utility EDF are all up 4 to 12 percent after their updates. Swedish defence firm Saab is down around 11 percent, however, after proposing a lower than expected dividend. Danone's shares are also up only a modest 0.7 percent following its results for 2017. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR BEFORE THE EUROPEAN OPEN (0749 GMT) European shares are expected to open higher and snap a three-week losing streak on Friday as volatility calms down and investors put aside worries over inflation that sparked a heavy sell-off in global equities earlier in the month. Futures on top European country indexes were up 0.4-0.6 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark was up more than 2 percent so far this week. The STOXX however is still down around 7 percent from the 2 1/2 year peak hit in January. According to the latest data from Thomson Reuters, European fourth quarter earnings are seen rising 14.6 percent. That's a big upwards revision from last week's 11 percent growth forecast and follows 15 weeks marred by a string of downgrades. The revision has brought Europe to just below the 14.8 percent growth rate expected for the S&P 500, although \"earnings beats\" in the U.S. stand at 78 percent vs 50 percent in Europe. For market moving headlines see the couple of posts below. (Danilo Masoni) CONSUMER STAPLES: FOOD FOR THOUGHT (0741 GMT) Yesterday we had full-year results from Nestle's, which dropped after forecasting only modest organic sales growth, whereas Danone has come out today saying that it is aiming for further sales and profit growth in 2018. Analysts are saying that Danone's full-year results have come in slightly ahead of consensus, but there is still work to be done. \"FY18 guidance is for DD EPS growth, which implies confidence on margins but not necessarily on the top line. We see good progress being made here, but ongoing negative momentum in Fresh Dairy testifies to the continuing challenges ahead,\" analysts at Jefferies say in a note. It has been a little difficult of late separating stock-specific weakness among consumer staples from the broader concerns around the impact of rising bond yields on the sector, but as you can see from the chart below their valuation premium has come down somewhat this year. (Kit Rees) DAX, CAC, FTSE FUTURES EDGE UP (0708 GMT) European stock index futures have opened with gains of around 0.3 percent, confirming earlier indications from financial spreadbetters. (Danilo Masoni) EARNINGS DOMINATE EUROPEAN EARLY MORNING HEADLINES (0648 GMT) We have earnings from top companies like Allianz, Renault and Eni this morning but also some fresh dealmaking activity with Roche agreeing to buy U.S. cancer data company Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion.
