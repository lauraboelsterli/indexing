Richard Pinedo pleaded guilty to knowingly buying and selling bank account numbers to circumvent online payment security systems between 2014 and 2017, according to a Feb. 12 court filing. The announcement came after the United States separately indicted a number of Russians as part of Mueller’s probe.
