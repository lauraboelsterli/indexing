Overall, the portfolio had net unrealized appreciation of $5.6 million. Our overall portfolio consisted of 84 companies with an average investment size of $8.8 million, had a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.3%, and was invested 84% in first lien secured debt, 5% in second lien secured debt, 6% in subordinated debt (of which 6% was invested in PSSL) and 5% in preferred and common equity (of which 3% was invested in PSSL).

Our debt portfolio consisted of 99% variable-rate investments (including 7% where LIBOR was below the floor) and 1% fixed-rate investments.

As of September 30, 2017, all of the investments held in PSSL were first lien secured debt.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we invested $176.9 million in 11 new and 11 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 8.0%. Sales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $149.1 million.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016, we invested $124.8 million in 12 new and 13 existing portfolio companies with a weighted average yield on debt investments of 7.6%. Sales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $70.4 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSet forth below are the results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $14.8 million and was attributable to $13.6 million from first lien secured debt and $1.2 million from second lien secured debt and subordinated debt. Investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $12.6 million and was attributable to $11.2 million from first lien senior debt and $1.4 million from second lien secured debt and subordinated debt. The increase in investment income compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the growth of our portfolio.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $16.8 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $1.8 million, incentive fee totaled $0.1 million (including $(0.1) million on realized gains and $0.2 million on unrealized gains accrued but not payable), debt related interest and expenses totaled $13.5 million (including $10.9 million in Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes), general and administrative expenses totaled $1.2 million and provision for taxes totaled $0.2 million. Expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 totaled $5.8 million. Base management fee for the same period totaled $1.6 million, incentive fee totaled $1.5 million (including $0.6 million on unrealized gains accrued but not yet payable), Credit Facility expenses totaled $1.8 million and general and administrative expenses totaled $0.9 million. The increase in expenses compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes in the current period, which was partially offset by a reduction in incentive fee.\nNet Investment (Loss) Income\nNet investment (loss) income totaled $(1.9) million, or $(0.05) per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $6.8 million, or $0.26 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Core net investment income, a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes capital gain incentive fee accruals not payable, Credit Facility amendment costs and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes, totaled $9.1 million, or $0.25 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Core net investment income totaled $7.4 million, or $0.28 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. There were no Credit Facility amendment costs during such period. The decrease in net investment income compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes in the current period.\nNet Realized Gains or Losses\nSales and repayments of investments for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $149.1 million and net realized losses totaled $2.8 million. Sales and repayments of investments totaled $70.4 million and realized gains totaled $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The change in realized gains was primarily due to changes in the market conditions of our investments and the values at which they were realized.\nUnrealized Appreciation or Depreciation on Investments, the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we reported net change in unrealized appreciation on investments of $3.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled $5.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation on our investments was driven primarily by changes in the capital market conditions, the financial performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on investments that were realized.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, our Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes had a net change in unrealized depreciation of $3.1 million. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, our Credit Facility had a net change in unrealized appreciation of $1.1 million. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, our net unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on the Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes totaled $0.1 million and $(3.1) million, respectively. The change in net unrealized depreciation compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to changes in the capital markets.\nNet Change in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet change in net assets resulting from operations totaled $1.9 million, or $0.05 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This compares to a net change in net assets resulting from operations of $8.8 million, or $0.33 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net change in net assets from operations compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to the expenses incurred in connection with the Credit Facility amendment and debt issuance costs on the 2023 Notes in the current period.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds of securities offerings, debt capital and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We have used, and expect to continue to use, our debt capital, proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment objectives.\nThe annualized weighted average cost of debt for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inclusive of the fee on the undrawn commitment of 0.375% on the Credit Facility, amendment costs and debt issuance costs, was 7.75% and 2.91%, respectively (excluding amendment and debt issuance costs, amounts are 3.80% and 2.91%, respectively).\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had $190.4 million and $253.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, respectively. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 3.46% and 3.18%, exclusive of the fee on undrawn commitments as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had $214.6 million and $121.2 million of unused borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, respectively, subject to regulatory restrictions.\nIn October and November 2017, we completed a follow-on public offering of 6,292,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $14.15 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $88.0 million. The Investment Adviser paid approximately $2.1 million of the sales load payable to the underwriters. We are not obligated to repay the sales load paid by our Investment Adviser.\nIn November 2017, we issued $138.6 million of our 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes pay interest at a rate of 3.83% per year. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2018. The principal on the 2023 Notes will be payable in four annual installments as follows: 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2020, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2021, 15% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2022 and 55% of the original principal amount on December 15, 2023.\nOn December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had cash equivalents of $127.8 million and $18.9 million, respectively, available for investing and general corporate purposes. We believe our liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities.\nOur operating activities used cash of $44.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and our financing activities provided cash of $153.4 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily from our recent equity offering, the issuance of the 2023 Notes and net borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nOur operating activities used cash of $63.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and our financing activities provided cash of $58.8 million for the same period. Our operating activities used cash primarily for our investment activities and our financing activities provided cash primarily from net borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we declared distributions of $0.285 and $0.285 per share, respectively, for total distributions of $10.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively. We monitor available net investment income to determine if a tax return of capital may occur for the fiscal year. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any given fiscal year, common stockholders will be notified of the portion of those distributions deemed to be a tax return of capital. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders subject to information reporting on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year and in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company makes available on its website its report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and stockholders may find the report on its website at www.pennantpark.com .\nPENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.
