    "text": "Feb 5 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co reported a quarterly loss due to a charge it took related to recent U.S. tax law changes, and said a late-stage trial testing its immunotherapy Opdivo in patients with a common type of lung cancer met its main goal.\nFourth-quarter net loss attributable came in at $2.33 billion compared with a year-ago profit of $894 million, as the drugmaker took a $2.9 billion charge.\nBristol-Myers in October said it expects to have final data in the first half of 2018 from a key trial of Opdivo as a treatment for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Martina D'Couto\n ",
