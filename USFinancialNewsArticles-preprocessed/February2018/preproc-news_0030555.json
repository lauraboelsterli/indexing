It’s quite scary when you come into your first run but we were quite confident and everything worked out in the end,” he said.\nWendl and Arlt had been decidedly second best to Eggert and Benecken throughout the season but stunned the world champions with a sizzling track record of 45.820 seconds in their opening run.\nThe Austrian duo of Peter Penz and Georg Fischler also threw down the gauntlet with a blazing first effort to leave Eggert and Benecken third at the interval.\nThat was how the podium positions remained as Wendl and Arlt summoned all their Olympic experience to continue Germany’s dominance of the event.\nGerman athletes have now won 11 out of 15 of the doubles golds in luge dating back to the 1964 Innsbruck Games.\nPenz and Georg Fischler continued Austria’s fine tournament, grabbing the nation’s second luge medal of the Games after David Gleirscher’s shock gold in the men’s singles on Sunday.\nBenecken won his bronze on his 28th birthday but hoped for better in four years at Beijing.\n“Maybe we started as the favourite but often the favourites don’t come to the finish with the medal or with the good run,” he said ruefully.\nA number of pairs struggled with the tricky ice track, including the Ukraine team of Olesandr Obolonchyk and Roman Zakharkiv, who careered down the course like a pin-ball on their first run, leaving their coach yanking at his long beard in frustration.\nDespite allowing mixed gender teams since 1994, the doubles event remains male-dominated due to height, weight and strength compatibility issues between athletes of the opposite sex.\nReporting by Ian Ransom, Editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
