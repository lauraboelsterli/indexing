    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRZO) today announced the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and provided an operational update, which includes the following highlights:\nTotal production of 62,417 Boe/d, 39% above the fourth quarter of 2016 and above the high-end of the Company's guidance range Crude oil production of 40,206 Bbls/d, 40% above the fourth quarter of 2016 Net loss attributable to common shareholders of $23.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, and Net cash provided by operating activities of $142.4 million Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of $47.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA of $184.1 million Adjusted EBITDA margin of $32/Boe, an increase of 23% versus the prior quarter Proved reserves of 261.7 MMBoe, a 31% increase over year-end 2016 564% reserve replacement from all sources at a finding, development, and acquisition (FD&A) cost of $13.47 per Boe 2018 capital expenditure guidance of $750-$800 million, which reflects an increase in oilfield service costs 2018 production guidance of 58,500-60,100 Boe/d, equivalent to pro forma annual growth of more than 30%\nCarrizo reported fourth quarter of 2017 net loss attributable to common shareholders of $23.4 million, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 include certain items typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, which excludes the impact of these items as described in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included below, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $47.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to $28.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $184.1 million, an increase of 56% from the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher production volumes and commodity prices. This represents the highest level of quarterly Adjusted EBITDA that the Company has reported. Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation to net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders are presented in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included below.\nProduction volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017 were 5,742 MBoe, or 62,417 Boe/d, an increase of 39% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year production growth was driven by drilling activity in the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin plus the addition of production from the Sanchez property acquisition in late 2016 and the ExL property acquisition during the third quarter, partially offset by the divestiture of the Company's Appalachian operations during the quarter. Crude oil production during the fourth quarter of 2017 averaged 40,206 Bbls/d, an increase of 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2016; natural gas and NGL production were 78,182 Mcf/d and 9,181 Bbls/d, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter of 2017 production exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance range of 60,933-62,200 Boe/d.\nDrilling, completion, and infrastructure capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $210.4 million. Approximately 49% of the fourth quarter drilling, completion, and infrastructure spending was in the Delaware Basin, while approximately 48% was in the Eagle Ford Shale. Land and seismic expenditures during the quarter were $4.5 million, and were primarily focused in the Delaware Basin.\n2017 Proved Reserves\nThe Company’s proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were 261.7 MMBoe, a 31% increase over year-end 2016, including 167.4 MMBbls of crude oil, a 30% increase over year-end 2016. This represents the highest level of crude oil reserves Carrizo has reported. The Company’s PV-10 value was $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s year-end 2017 proved reserves and PV-10 by region as determined by the Company’s independent reservoir engineers, Ryder Scott Company, L.P., in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, using pricing for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 based on the West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil price of $51.34/Bbl and the Henry Hub benchmark natural gas price of $2.98/MMBtu, before adjustment for differentials.\nCrude Oil NGLs Natural Gas Total PV-10 Region (MMBbl) (MMBbl) (Bcf) (MMBoe) ($MM) Eagle Ford 124.2 21.7 126.7 167.0 $ 1,871.2 Delaware Basin 40.4 20.4 180.5 90.9 715.0 Niobrara 2.8 0.5 3.3 3.8 52.2 Total 167.4 42.6 310.5 261.7 $ 2,638.4 The table below summarizes the changes in the Company’s proved reserves during 2017.\nCrude Oil NGLs Natural Gas Total (MMBbl) (MMBbl) (Bcf) (MMBoe) Proved reserves - December 31, 2016 128.4 23.9 287.5 200.2 Revisions of previous estimates (19.9 ) (0.9 ) 27.7 (16.1 ) Extensions and discoveries 50.5 13.8 99.0 80.7 Purchases of reserves in place 21.6 8.6 95.0 46.0 Divestitures of reserves in place (0.6 ) (0.5 ) (170.2 ) (29.5 ) Production (12.6 ) (2.3 ) (28.5 ) (19.6 ) Proved reserves - December 31, 2017 167.4 42.6 310.5 261.7 Proved developed - December 31, 2017 69.6 17.5 131.4 109.0 The following table summarizes the Company’s costs incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration, and development activities for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal ($MM) Property acquisition costs Proved properties $ 303.3 Unproved properties 525.0 Total property acquisition costs 828.3 Exploration costs 91.1 Development costs 570.0 Total costs incurred (1) $ 1,489.4\n(1) Total costs incurred includes capitalized general and administrative expense and asset retirement obligations and excludes capitalized interest.\n2017 highlights include:\nTotal reserve replacement was 564% at an all-sources FD&A cost of $13.47 per Boe Drill-bit reserve replacement was 330% at an F&D cost of $10.23 per Boe Total proved reserves increased to 261.7 MMBoe, a 31% increase versus year-end 2016 Eagle Ford reserves increased to 167.0 MMBoe, a 3% increase versus year-end 2016 Delaware Basin reserves increased to 90.9 MMBoe, a 677% increase versus year-end 2016 Crude oil represents 64% of total proved reserves and 83% of the total PV-10 value at December 31, 2017 Proved developed reserves increased to 109.0 MMBoe at year-end 2017, a 19% increase versus year-end 2016\n2018 Capital Program and Guidance\nFor 2018, Carrizo is providing initial drilling, completion, and infrastructure capital expenditure guidance of $750-$800 million, which incorporates an assumed double-digit increase in oilfield service costs. In recent months, Carrizo has been negotiating with oilfield service companies, and has currently fixed pricing on approximately 50% of its services for the majority of 2018. While the Company expects to partially offset some of the service cost increase with future efficiency gains, it has not factored these potential savings into its 2018 capital expenditure guidance. Carrizo currently plans to operate two rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale and three to four rigs in the Delaware Basin during 2018, as well as two to three completion crews during the year. Based on this level of activity, the Company expects to drill 93-103 gross (82-91 net) operated wells and complete 113-123 gross (96-105 net) operated wells during the year.\nIn order to continue driving operational efficiencies, Carrizo is seeking to complete \"multipads\" whenever possible in the Eagle Ford Shale. This incorporates using multiple completion crews simultaneously to fill in undeveloped areas. During the first quarter of 2018, Carrizo is completing a 16-well multipad in the Eagle Ford Shale utilizing three completion crews. In order to facilitate this, the Company has temporarily moved its Delaware Basin completion crew to the Eagle Ford Shale. While this development strategy should result in enhanced project returns, it is also likely to result in more uneven quarterly production growth.\nIn the Delaware Basin, Carrizo plans to allocate approximately 75%-80% of its development activity to its Phantom area, where it continues to be pleased with the well results it has seen. The Company expects to drive operational efficiencies in this area during 2018 by shifting to pad drilling. The remainder of the 2018 development activity is expected to be on the northern portion of the Company's legacy acreage, where offset operators have recently drilled strong wells.\nThe 2018 program also includes approximately $90 million for infrastructure expenditures. One of the key goals of the Company's 2018 infrastructure program is expanding its water disposal capacity in the Delaware Basin in order to facilitate the strong growth it expects from the region. The Company plans to do this via a combination of Carrizo-owned wells, access to third-party disposal systems, and eventually recycling. As a result of the 2018 activity, Carrizo currently expects more than a three-fold increase in its Phantom area water disposal capacity by year-end 2018.\nBased on this activity plan, Carrizo is providing initial 2018 production guidance of 58,500-60,100 Boe/d. Crude oil production is expected to account for 65%-67% of the Company's production for the year, while total liquids are expected to account for 80%-84%. This equates to annual production growth of approximately 10% using the midpoint of the range. Pro forma for the Company's acquisition and divestiture activity, the 2018 guidance equates to year-over-year production growth of more than 30%, with crude oil production growth of more than 20%.\nFor the first quarter of the year, Carrizo expects production to be 48,600-49,800 Boe/d; crude oil is expected to account for 65%-67% of production, while total liquids are expected to account for 80%-84%. First quarter production was negatively impacted by prolonged freezing temperatures in January. Shut-in production and operational delays during the month are expected to result in an impact of 500-600 Boe/d for the first quarter. First quarter production is also being impacted by the Company's current multipad development in the Eagle Ford Shale, as these wells are not expected to have a material impact on production until the second quarter. As a result, Carrizo expects to see a significant increase in production between the first and second quarters of the year.\nA full summary of Carrizo’s guidance is provided in the attached tables.\nS.P. “Chip” Johnson, IV, Carrizo’s President and CEO, commented on the results, “2017 was a transformational year for Carrizo. We highgraded our portfolio by announcing the divestiture of non-core assets in the DJ Basin and Appalachia, as well as our downdip assets in the Eagle Ford Shale, and acquiring a core acreage position in the Delaware Basin. This leaves us with a deep inventory of core locations in two of the highest-return basins in North America, the Eagle Ford Shale and Delaware Basin. We believe these assets are highly complementary. The Eagle Ford Shale is currently free cash flow positive at the field level, and we are able to use this excess cash flow to help fund the strong growth we expect to deliver from the Delaware Basin. At the corporate level, we remain committed to achieving cash flow neutrality and expect to be able to deliver this by the fourth quarter of 2018 at an oil price of $55-$60/Bbl, while still generating strong production growth.\n“We remain pleased with the results we have seen from our Phantom area acreage in the Delaware Basin. During the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver strong results from both the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B, with multiple wells delivering peak three-stream 90-day rates in excess of 1,500 Boe/d. Our production from the area is currently constrained by water takeaway capacity via pipeline, but we expect this to be remedied by next quarter, and expect significant growth after that. While our 2018 development program is expected to remain focused on the Wolfcamp A and B, we also plan to test the Wolfcamp C during the year.\n“The fourth quarter was another excellent quarter for the Company. Production increased by 13% and exceeded our guidance, price realizations were stronger than expected as our Eagle Ford production benefited from the LLS premium to WTI, and operating costs were in the lower half of our expected range. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by more than 20% versus the prior quarter.\n“During 2017, we once again delivered strong reserve growth. This was led by the Delaware Basin, where proved reserves increased by more than 675% during the year, and now account for approximately 35% of our total proved reserves, up from just 6% at year-end 2016. As a result, we were able to increase our total proved reserves by more than 30% during the year.”\nOperational Update\nIn the Eagle Ford Shale, Carrizo drilled 20 gross (16 net) operated wells during the fourth quarter and completed 14 gross (13 net) operated wells. Production from the play was approximately 41,600 Boe/d, a 7% increase versus the prior quarter. Crude oil production was more than 31,900 Bbls/d, accounting for approximately 77% of the Company's production from the play. During the fourth quarter, Carrizo turned 21 net wells to sales in the Eagle Ford Shale, which had an average lateral length of approximately 7,000 ft. The average peak 30-day rate from these wells was approximately 700 Boe/d (88% oil, 94% liquids) on restricted chokes. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 37 gross (31 net) operated Eagle Ford Shale wells in progress or waiting on completion, equating to net crude oil production potential of more than 11,700 Bbls/d. The Company is currently operating two rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale, and expects to drill 60-65 gross (56-61 net) operated wells and complete 80-85 gross (71-76 net) operated wells in the play during 2018.\nSubsequent to the sale of its Tier 1 assets in January, Carrizo sees more than 700 net remaining locations in the Core of the Eagle Ford Shale spaced at 330-500 ft., depending upon the geologic characteristics of the specific project areas. An additional 100-150 net locations have also been identified at tighter well spacing in areas the Company has currently tested. While still profitable, the cash flow profile from these wells is not consistent with Carrizo's free cash flow target and as such, the Company does not currently plan on drilling additional stagger-stack development wells in 2018 at forecasted commodity price and oilfield service cost levels. The Company does plan to continue to test wells spaced tighter than 330 ft. with stage spacing as short as 150 ft., as outlined below. Additionally, Carrizo has been successful in its efforts to extend the average lateral length of its future wells. While longer laterals are expected to enhance the returns generated by the Company's Eagle Ford Shale position, they also result in an approximate 5% reduction in the future well count.\nAs the Company’s number of producing wells continues to grow, and a larger percentage of new wells are drilled in areas with significant existing production, Carrizo has seen an increased impact from parent-child relationships on the new wells immediately offsetting the existing wells. This has also resulted in a higher ratio of existing wells requiring shut-in during completion operations as well as longer shut-in periods in some instances. In order to minimize these impacts, the Company plans to move to a multipad development whenever possible in the Eagle Ford Shale. This involves using multiple completion crews simultaneously to complete a large number of wells on multiple contiguous pads, thereby reducing future parent-child impacts. This should lead to higher average EURs over time for the new wells and less downtime for the parent wells. The Company's initial multipad is located in its Brown Trust area. The multipad includes 16 wells on three pads, with well spacing of 250-330 ft., and frac stage spacing of 150-180 ft. Production from the multipad is expected to begin in late March, and should reach gross oil rates of more than 10,000 Bbls/d once all of the wells are online.\nCarrizo has been testing multiple concepts in order to optimize its completion design in the Eagle Ford Shale, including tighter stage spacing, increased proppant, and amount and type of fluid. To date, the data indicates that tighter stage spacing is resulting in improved performance, while data on the other variables appears less conclusive. As a result of the Company's completion optimization work, it has seen more than a 10% improvement in the lateral-normalized performance of its 2017 wells relative to its 2016 wells. Carrizo has recently been testing stage spacing as tight as 150 ft., with the tighter-stage-spaced wells continuing to outperform nearby wells with wider stage spacing. In a recent test in the Company's North LaSalle area, two pads completed with 150-180 ft. stage spacing are outperforming the area typecurve by 15%-20% after approximately 110 days.\nIn the Delaware Basin, Carrizo drilled 9 gross (7 net) operated wells during the fourth quarter and completed 9 gross (7 net) operated wells. Production from the play was more than 15,100 Boe/d for the quarter, up more than 115% versus the prior quarter as a number of new wells were brought online and the Company got the benefit of a full quarter of production from the ExL acquisition. Crude oil production was approximately 6,500 Bbls/d, accounting for approximately 43% of the Company's production from the play. At the end of the quarter, Carrizo had 6 gross (5 net) operated Delaware Basin wells in progress or waiting on completion. The Company is currently operating four rigs in the Delaware Basin, but plans to reduce this to three later in the year. Carrizo expects to drill 33-38 gross (26-30 net) operated wells and complete 33-38 gross (25-29 net) operated wells in the play during 2018.\nIn the Phantom area, Carrizo continued to focus on the Wolfcamp B in order to further confirm its productivity across the acreage as well as ensure all depths were held. To date, more than 75% of the wells the Company has drilled since acquiring the asset have targeted the Wolfcamp B. Carrizo has been very pleased with the results it has seen, as production from the wells has met targeted levels, but with higher flowing wellhead pressures than expected. This could lead to a shallower decline than the Company is currently assuming in its Wolfcamp B typecurve.\nWhile the production from the Wolfcamp B wells has been very encouraging, the wells have also produced at a higher initial water-oil-ratio than Wolfcamp A wells, resulting in produced water volumes temporarily exceeding the Company’s acquisition forecast. Delays in forecasted upgrade projects to third-party disposal systems combined with these higher volumes have resulted in the Company’s production being temporarily constrained by the available water-takeaway infrastructure. Carrizo has been working diligently to alleviate this bottleneck by putting firm agreements in place with third-party providers in addition to installing a company-owned water management system; combined, this should allow Carrizo to double its water takeaway capacity by the beginning of the second quarter and more than triple it by year-end. While the infrastructure bottleneck has delayed the Company's planned production ramp in the basin by a quarter, Carrizo expects to have the infrastructure in place to support significant production growth from the area during 2018.\nHedging Activity\nCarrizo currently has hedges in place for approximately 75% of estimated crude oil production for 2018 (based on the midpoint of guidance). For the year, Carrizo currently has hedges covering 30,000 Bbls/d of crude oil production, consisting of three-way collars covering 24,000 Bbls/d of crude oil with an average floor price of $49.06/Bbl, ceiling price of $60.14/Bbl, and sub-floor price of $39.38/Bbl, and swaps covering 6,000 Bbls/d at an average fixed price of $49.55/Bbl. For 2019, Carrizo currently has three-way collars covering 12,000 Bbls/d of crude oil with an average floor price of $48.40/Bbl, ceiling price of $60.29/Bbl, and sub-floor price of $40.00/Bbl.\nCarrizo has hedges in place for more than 50% of estimated NGL production for 2018. For the year, Carrizo has swaps covering 2,200 Bbls/d of ethane, 1,500 Bbls/d of propane, 200 Bbls/d of butane, 600 Bbls/d of isobutane, and 600 Bbls/d of natural gasoline at average fixed prices of $12.01/Bbl, $34.23/Bbl, $38.85/Bbl, $38.98/Bbl, and $55.23/Bbl, respectively.\nCarrizo also has hedges in place for approximately 35% of estimated natural gas production for 2018. For March 2018-December 2018, the Company has swaps covering 25,000 MMBtu/d of natural gas at an average fixed price of $3.01/MMBtu.

(2) Adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (“Adjusted Diluted WASO”) is a non-GAAP financial measure which includes the effect of potentially dilutive instruments that, under certain circumstances described below, are excluded from diluted weighted average common shares outstanding (“Diluted WASO”), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. When a net loss attributable to common shareholders exists, all potentially dilutive instruments are anti-dilutive to the net loss attributable to common shareholders per common share and therefore excluded from the computation of Diluted WASO. The effect of potentially dilutive instruments is included in the computation of Adjusted Diluted WASO for purposes of computing the per diluted common share impacts of the reconciling items as well as adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders per diluted common share.

Items excluded are interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairments, dividends and accretion on preferred stock and items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results such as items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors and analysts, for analysis of the Company’s financial and operating performance on a recurring basis and the Company’s ability to internally generate funds for exploration and development, and to service debt. In addition, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of a company’s profitability or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities is presented below.

Items excluded are changes in the components of working capital and other items that the Company believes affect the comparability of operating cash flows such as items that are non-recurring.\nDiscretionary cash flows are presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of the Company’s ability to generate cash to fund exploration and development, and to service debt. In addition, management believes that discretionary cash flows is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nDiscretionary cash flows should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of a company’s cash flows or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, management believes that PV-10 is widely used by investors and analysts as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of the Company’s proved reserves to other oil and gas companies.\nPV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company’s financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 is presented below.\nAs of December 31, 2017 (In millions) Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (GAAP) $ 2,465.1 Add: present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% per annum 173.3 PV-10 (Non-GAAP) $ 2,638.4 Reserve Replacement (Non-GAAP)\nReserve replacement is a non-GAAP metric commonly used by the Company, as well as analysts and investors, to evaluate the Company’s ability to replenish annual production and grow its proved reserves. Total reserve replacement and drill-bit reserve replacement can be computed from information provided in this press release.\nTotal reserve replacement is defined as the sum of proved reserve extensions and discoveries, revisions of previous estimates and purchases of reserves in place divided by production for the corresponding period. Drill-bit reserve replacement is defined as the sum of proved reserve extensions and discoveries and revisions of previous estimates divided by production for the corresponding period. These definitions of reserve replacement may differ significantly from definitions used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, reserve replacement as defined above may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nReserve replacement is limited because it typically varies widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and property acquisitions. Its predictive and comparative value is also limited for the same reasons. Reserve replacement does not distinguish between changes in reserve quantities that are producing and those that will require additional time and capital to begin producing. In addition, since reserve replacement does not take into consideration the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, it cannot be used as a measure of value creation.\nFinding and Development Costs (Non-GAAP)\nFinding and development (\"F&D\") costs are non-GAAP metrics commonly used by the Company, as well as analysts and investors, to measure and evaluate the Company’s cost of adding proved reserves. The all sources finding, development, and acquisition (“FD&A”) cost and drill-bit F&D cost can be computed from information provided in this press release.\nAll sources FD&A cost is defined as the sum of exploration costs, development costs and property acquisition costs divided by the sum of proved reserve extensions and discoveries, revisions of previous estimates and purchases of reserves in place. Drill-bit F&D cost is defined as the sum of exploration costs and development costs divided by the sum of proved reserve extensions and discoveries and revisions of previous estimates. These definitions of all sources FD&A costs and drill-bit F&D costs may differ significantly from definitions used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, the all sources FD&A costs and drill-bit F&D costs defined above may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nDue to various factors, including timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. For example, development costs may be recorded in periods before or after the periods in which the related reserves are recorded.
