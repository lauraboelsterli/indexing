    "text": "Fourth Quarter 2017 Performance Sales of $1.12 billion, consistent with guidance GAAP operating income of $92 million and non-GAAP adjusted operating income (excluding special items) of $199 million GAAP net income of $0.27 per diluted share Non-GAAP adjusted net income (excluding special items) of $0.47 per diluted share, consistent with guidance Calendar Year 2017 Performance Sales of $4.56 billion, consistent with guidance GAAP operating income of $478 million and non-GAAP adjusted operating income (excluding special items) of $882 million GAAP net income of $0.98 per diluted share Non-GAAP adjusted net income (excluding special items) of $2.14 per diluted share, consistent with guidance\nHICKORY, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: COMM), a global leader in infrastructure solutions for communications networks, reported sales of $1.12 billion and net income of $54 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $91 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. A reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP results is attached.\nIn comparison, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, CommScope reported sales of $1.18 billion and net income of $54 million, $0.28 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $121 million, or $0.61 per diluted share.\n“We are pleased to deliver fourth quarter results consistent with our expectations despite lingering volatility in customer order patterns and near-term raw material cost pressures,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Eddie Edwards. “While 2017 was challenging across the industry, we made significant progress in strengthening CommScope for the long term. During the year, we substantially completed a complex systems integration, delivered on significant product development, extended a long-term optical fiber supply partnership and achieved our capital allocation priorities of strategically reinvesting in the business while repaying debt and returning capital to shareholders.\n“Looking ahead, we are expecting more normalized customer order patterns and preparing to capitalize on numerous global developments to ensure we return to growth in 2018. We believe there are significant opportunities ahead and are confident in our ability to leverage FirstNet and fiber deep network deployments, expansion within the hyperscale data centers and our compelling quick turn capabilities. We have developed a platform of world-class differentiated solutions and services and are well positioned for value creation in 2018 and beyond.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Overview\nFourth quarter 2017 sales decreased 5 percent year over year with growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Central America and Latin America (CALA) regions more than offset by declines in other regions, most notably in the U.S. Foreign exchange rate changes positively impacted revenue by about 1.5 percent year over year.\nGAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 declined 23 percent year over year to $92 million. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income, which excludes amortization of purchased intangibles, integration and transaction costs, restructuring costs and other special items, declined 21 percent year over year to $199 million. The decreases in operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income were primarily driven by lower sales volumes and the impact from higher commodity prices, partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Segment Overview\nFourth quarter Connectivity Solutions segment sales increased 2 percent year over year to $694 million with growth in international markets more than offsetting a modest decline domestically. Foreign exchange rate changes positively impacted revenue by about 1 percent from the year-ago period.\nConnectivity Solutions GAAP operating income increased 11 percent year over year to $48 million, while non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased 10 percent year over year to $125 million. GAAP operating income improved year over year due to lower integration and transaction costs in 2017 and an impairment charge recorded in 2016. The decrease in non-GAAP adjusted operating income was primarily driven by higher commodity prices, partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives.\nFourth quarter Mobility Solutions segment sales declined 14 percent year over year to $427 million. Year-over-year growth in the EMEA region was more than offset by declines in all other major geographic regions, most notably North America. Foreign exchange rate changes had a positive impact of about 2 percent on sales compared to the year-ago period.\nMobility Solutions GAAP operating income declined 43 percent year over year to $43 million, and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased 35 percent year over year to $74 million. Both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted operating income were impacted by lower sales volumes, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.\nFull Year 2017 Overview\nFor 2017, sales declined 7 percent to $4.56 billion driven by overall softness in the market that was exacerbated by M&A-related pauses in customer spending. Foreign exchange rate changes had a negligible impact to sales in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nGAAP operating income decreased 17 percent to $478 million and non-GAAP adjusted operating income declined 16 percent to $882 million versus prior year results, primarily due to lower sales volumes, unfavorable geographic and product mix and the negative impact from higher commodity prices. These declines were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense. CommScope realized over $170 million in BNS cost synergies during the two years ended December 31, 2017. It plans to realize at least an additional $30 million by the end of 2018.\nFull Year 2017 Segment Overview\nConnectivity Solutions segment sales declined 5 percent to $2.81 billion, primarily due to declines in all major geographic regions except the EMEA region. Foreign exchange rate changes had a negligible impact to sales in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nConnectivity Solutions GAAP operating income declined 17 percent to $242 million. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income for the segment decreased 17 percent to $526 million, or 19 percent of sales. The decreases in GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted operating income were driven by lower sales volumes, price reductions, unfavorable geographic and product mix and higher commodity costs. The decreases were partly offset by cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense.\nMobility Solutions segment sales declined 11 percent to $1.75 billion with declines in all major geographic regions. Foreign exchange rate changes had a negligible impact on sales in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nMobility Solutions GAAP operating income declined 17 percent to $236 million. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income for the segment decreased by 15 percent to $356 million, or 20 percent of sales. The decline was largely due to lower sales volumes, price reductions and unfavorable geographic mix, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn 2017, the Board of Directors authorized two separate $100 million stock repurchases of CommScope’s outstanding common stock. Since the initial authorization, the company repurchased $175 million of its common stock, or 4.8 million shares, at an average cost of $36.50 per share. There is $25 million remaining authorized under the stock repurchase program that expires on July 31, 2018.\nDebt Repayment\nThe company voluntarily repaid a net $210 million in debt during 2017 and delivered on its target to repay more than $1 billion of its debt since the BNS acquisition in August 2015. The next debt maturity is not until 2021.\nOutlook\nCommScope management provided the following first quarter and full year 2018 guidance.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance:\nRevenue of $1.085 billion – $1.135 billion Operating income of $93 million – $108 million Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $175 million – $195 million Non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent – 30 percent Earnings per diluted share of $0.13 – $0.16, based on 196 million weighted average diluted shares Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.44 – $0.49\nFull Year 2018 Guidance:\nRevenue of $4.675 billion – $4.825 billion Operating income of $615 million – $660 million Non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $935 million – $985 million Non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent – 30 percent Earnings per diluted share of $1.46 – $1.58, based on 196 million weighted average diluted shares Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.56 – $2.71 Cash flow from operations > $600 million\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP outlook is attached.\nManagement currently expects a non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate for 2018 to be in the range of 29 percent to 30 percent. This non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate does not reflect any potential impact from finalizing the estimated one-time benefits realized in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nConference Call, Webcast and Investor Presentation\nAs previously announced, CommScope will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET in which management will discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and 2018 guidance.

CommScope management further believes that these financial measures are useful in assessing CommScope’s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. CommScope management also uses certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring CommScope’s performance relative to that of its competitors. CommScope management believes these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate CommScope’s performance and that of its competitors. However, CommScope’s use of the terms non-GAAP adjusted operating income, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share may vary from that of others in its industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release or any other oral or written statements made by us or on our behalf may include forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
