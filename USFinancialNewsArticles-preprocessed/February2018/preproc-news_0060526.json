Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. All 2017 guidance metrics were achieved.\nWEST ORANGE, N.J., Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lincoln Educational Services Corporation (Nasdaq:LINC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS:\nStudent starts for the quarter, including the Transitional segment, remained essentially flat at approximately 1,900 students for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the Transitional segment for the quarter student starts rose 11.2%, as compared to student starts in the fourth quarter of 2016. Healthcare and Other Professions (“HOP”) student starts increased 16.1% while Transportation and Skilled Trades (“TST”) student starts rose 7.2%. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $67.4 million, a 7.1% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to reduced revenue from campuses in the Transitional segment. Excluding the Transitional segment revenues for the quarter, increased by $0.3 million when compared to the prior year comparable quarter. The two campuses in the Transitional segment were closed by fiscal year end. Educational services and facilities expense decreased by $4.0 million, or 11.6%, to $30.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $34.2 in the prior year comparable quarter. This decrease is primarily due to the Transitional segment, which accounted for approximately $3.5 million, or 87.7% of the total decrease. Selling general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.7 million, or 16.3%, to $29.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $35.1 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This decrease was also primarily due to cost reductions in the Transitional segment, which accounted for approximately $4.1 million of the decrease for the period. Additional cost savings of $2.1 million were realized in administrative expenses resulting from reduced salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in marketing investments. Management believes that this increased investment was a major factor behind the increase in student starts in the fourth quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter decreased by $1.0 million, or 67.0% to $0.5 million from $1.5 million in the prior year comparable period. The reduction is a result of lower debt outstanding in combination with more favorable terms under the Company’s credit facility that became effective on March 31, 2017 when compared to the terms of the previous term loan. Net income for the quarter was $7.7 million, or $0.32 earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $18.6 million, or $0.79 loss per share, in the prior year comparable quarter. The prior year loss was primarily attributed to a non-cash impairment charge of $17.5 million and a $8.1 million net loss in the Transitional segment during the prior comparable period.\n“Our solid increase in student starts in the fourth quarter is a primarily due to our increased investment in several marketing initiatives during the second half of the year and demonstrates interest in new and expanded programs offered by Lincoln during 2017,” said Scott Shaw, President and CEO. “In addition to the encouraging student start results, we improved our operating performance during the fourth quarter and excluding the Transitional segment, generated more than $9 million in net income.”\n“We are entering 2018 with cautious optimism,” added Mr. Shaw. “The student start trends of the fourth quarter have continued into the first two months of 2018 and our program diversification is playing a key role. In addition, we are executing prudent program expansion as the year progresses and we are continuing to enter into new partnerships, as well as expand existing partnerships, with corporations who are turning to Lincoln to fill a critical need to find trained employees. For instance, in late January, we announced a partnership with commercial refrigerator innovator, Hussmann, and during the fourth quarter, we expanded our Computer Numerical Control partnership with Haas to our Indianapolis campus. At the same time, our financial performance for 2018 should improve over last year as we benefit from lower projected interest expense as a result of the credit facility entered into early in 2017, as well as cost reductions resulting from the closure of all campuses in our Transitional segment.”\nFOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nTransportation and Skilled Trades\nTST segment revenue decreased 1.5% to $45.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $46.6 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease in revenue was driven by a 4.3% decline in average student population partially offset by a 2.8% increase in average revenue per student compared to the prior year comparable period.\nStudent starts for the quarter increased 7.2% compared to the prior year comparable period. Increases in student starts can be attributed to increased marketing investments as well as new or expanded programs initiated during 2017.\nOperating income was $8.9 million, a decrease of 4.9% from $9.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nEducational services and facilities expense decreased by $0.7 million, or 3.6% to $19.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $20.2 million in the prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily due to reductions in facilities expense resulting from fully depreciated assets and more favorable lease terms at one campus.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $0.5 million, or 2.9%, to $17.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $17.1 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase was attributable to several factors including increased administrative costs resulting from slightly higher bad debt expense as well as increased marketing investment that management believes is directly attributed to the increase in start growth quarter over quarter.\nHealthcare and Other Professions\nHOP segment revenue increased by $1.0 million to $21.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $20.1 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase in revenue is mainly due to a 3.4% increase in average student population, in combination with a 1.4% increase in average revenue per student.\nStudent starts for the quarter increased 16.1% compared to the prior year comparable period, which we attribute to the increased marketing spend.\nOperating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $16.9 million to $3.4 million, compared to an operating loss of $13.5 million in the prior year comparable period. Included in the prior year operating loss of $13.5 million are non-cash impairment charges of $16.1 million.\nEducational services and facilities expense increased by $0.2 million, or 2.5%, to $9.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $9.7 million in the prior year comparable period. The majority of the increase was due to increased instructional expenses and books and tools expenses.\nSelling general and administrative expenses remained essentially flat at $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nImpairment of goodwill and long-lived assets decreased by $16.1 million due to the absence of impairment charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to non-cash impairment charges of $16.1 million in the prior year comparable period.\nTransitional\nTransitional segment revenue was $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.8 million in the prior year comparable period due to the campus closures.\nOperating loss decreased by $6.6 million to $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $8.0 million in the prior year comparable period. The reduction in net loss was a result of closing schools in this segment. As of December 31, 2017, all operations in the Transitional segment were closed.\nCorporate and Other\nThis category includes unallocated expenses incurred on behalf of the company as a whole. Corporate and Other expenses decreased by $3.5 million, or 53.9%, to $3.0 million from $6.5 million, for the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily driven by a $2.6 million reduction in salaries and benefits expense quarter over quarter in addition to a $1.4 million impairment charge booked in 2016 for one of our corporate owned properties. Partially offsetting these reductions were $0.4 million in increased closed school costs. The additional closed school costs related to the closure of the Hartford, Connecticut campus on December 31, 2016. The additional expenses relating to the Hartford Connecticut campus will terminate with the apartment lease previously used for student housing, which will expire in September 2019.\n2017 FULL YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenue was $261.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $285.6 million in the prior year.\nOperating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $24.2 million when compared to the prior year. Included in the operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 is a $1.5 million gain on sale of assets relating to the sale of two of the Company’s three properties located in Palm Beach County, Florida. Included in the prior year’s net loss is a non-cash impairment charge of $21.4 million and an operating loss of $15.2 million relating to the Transitional segment.\nEducational services and facilities expense decreased by $15.0 million, or 10.4%, to $129.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $144.4 million in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $9.7 million, or 6.5%, to $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $148.4 million in the prior year.\nTransportation and Skilled Trades segment revenue was $177.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $177.9 million in the prior year.\nHealthcare and Other Professions segment revenue was $76.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $77.2 million in the prior year.\nBALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a net cash balance of $1.2 million compared to a net cash balance of $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash position can be attributed to several factors including (i) $2.8 million in fees paid for the early termination of the prior term loan as well as fees incurred for the implementation of the new credit facility, (ii) a $1.5 million lease termination fee paid in relation to the Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania campus, and (iii) $5.4 million in closing costs associated with the Transitional segment. Management believes that the Company has adequate resources in place to execute its 2018 operating plan. . Further, with the implementation of the new credit facility in the first quarter of 2017, management believes that the Company has adequate resources in place to execute its 2018 operating plan. In addition, the Company anticipates a savings of $3 million annually in reduced interest expense.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nManagement is providing the following guidance for 2018:\nRevenue is expected to increase by low single digits, excluding the 2017 Transitional segment, compared to the prior year. Operating Income for 2018 is expected to be in the range of breakeven and a loss of $3 million. Student starts are expected to increase by low single digits, excluding the 2017 Transitional segment, compared to prior year. Year-end population is expected to be greater than that of the prior year.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFO\nLincoln will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

EBITDA, Adjusted EDBITDA, Net cash, Net Income on a same school basis, and EBITDA on a same school basis are measurements not recognized in financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We define EBITDA as income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes non-cash charges related to impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. We define net cash as cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash less long-term debt including current portion. . We define Net Income on a same school basis as net income for the entire company excluding the Transitional segment. We define EBITDA on a same school basis as income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization for all operating segments except the Transitional segment. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net cash, Net Income on a same school basis, and EBITDA on a same school basis are presented because we believe they are a useful indicator of our performance and our ability to make strategic acquisitions and meet capital expenditure and debt service requirements. However, it is not intended to represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP and should not be used as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net cash, Net Income on a same school basis, and EBITDA on a same school basis are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Net cash, and Net Income on a same school basis, and EBITDA on a same school basis:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (Unaudited) (Unaudited) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 7,707 $ (18,628 ) $ (11,484 ) $ (28,304 ) Interest expense, net 492 1,489 7,042 5,976 (Benefit) Provision for income taxes (424 ) 50 (274 ) 200 Depreciation and amortization 2,264 2,471 8,702 11,061 EBITDA 10,039 (14,618 ) 3,986 (11,067 ) Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets -
