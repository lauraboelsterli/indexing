    "text": " 35 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago UK factory PMI falls to seven-month low in January - IHS Markit/CIPS David Milliken 3   British manufacturing lost more momentum than expected last month after one of the biggest jumps in the cost of raw materials in decades, a survey showed on Thursday. \nThe IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 55.3 in January, its lowest since June 2017, though still well above its long-run average of 51.7. \nMarkit said that if is sustained this level would point to quarterly growth of 0.6 percent for the sector - better than the broader economy but half the rate achieved in the final three months of 2017. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had on average forecast a small increase to 56.5. December’s reading of 56.3 was revised down fractionally to 56.2. \n“The UK manufacturing sector reported an unwelcome combination of slower growth and rising prices at the start of 2018,” said economist Rob Dobson of IHS Markit, the financial data company which compiles the survey. \n“The trend in demand will need to strengthen in the near-term to prevent further growth momentum being lost in the coming months,” he added. \nBritish manufacturers benefited from strong global growth over the past year and a fall in the pound since June 2016’s Brexit vote, and January’s data showed foreign demand was still growing at one of the fastest rates in the past four years. \nHowever, British manufacturers have not done as well as their competitors in continental Europe and the prospects at home for 2018 do not look so bright. \nNew orders expanded at the weakest pace since June 2017. \nConsumer goods makers in particular have suffered from weak domestic demand due to higher inflation. \nBank of England Governor Mark Carney also said on Tuesday that business investment was lower than it should be due to uncertainty about Britain’s future trade relations with the European Union, which it is due to leave in March 2019. \nOil prices rose to their highest in more than three years last month, and Thursday’s data showed manufacturers reported their third-biggest monthly increase in costs since the survey started in 1992. \nOil, chemicals, foodstuffs, metals and plastics all became dearer, and factories passed some of the extra cost on to customers. \nThis may concern the BoE, which is re-assessing how fast inflation will fall this year. Inflation peaked at its highest in more than five years in November, when the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. \nMost economists expect the BoE will not raise rates again until November, though a minority think an increase will come in May. The central bank will set out its latest thoughts on Feb. 8.",
