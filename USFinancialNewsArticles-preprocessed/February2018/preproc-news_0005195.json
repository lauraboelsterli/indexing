    "text": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday reported a loss for the first fiscal quarter as the chipmaker took a $6 billion one-time charge because of new U.S. tax laws.\nNet loss attributable to Qualcomm was $5.95 billion or $4.03 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 24, compared to a profit of $682 million or 46 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue rose 1.2 percent to $6.07 billion.\nThe results come as Qualcomm tries to fend off a $103 billion takeover bid by Broadcom and close its long-pending deal to buy automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors.
