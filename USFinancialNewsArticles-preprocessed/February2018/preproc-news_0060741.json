    "text": "44 COMMENTS Bank of America Corp. BAC -0.71% fired at least two employees in its hedge-fund-focused prime-brokerage unit as it expands an investigation into potential sexual misconduct in the business, people familiar with the matter said.\nThe bank fired two employees after determining they interfered with the probe of alleged inappropriate behavior by Omeed Malik, until recently one of the top executives in the unit, the people familiar with the matter said. The fired employees had earlier been placed on leave, the people said.\nMr. Malik was fired in January in the wake of complaints from female employees about unwanted advances, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.\nA Bank of America spokesman said the two employees in question no longer worked at the bank. A lawyer for Mr. Malik had no immediate comment.\nBank of America said in a recent regulatory filing that Mr. Malik was “discharged [for] personal conduct in violation of firm standards, including interfering with the firm’s review of the matter,” according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority document.\nWrite to Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com and Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com",
