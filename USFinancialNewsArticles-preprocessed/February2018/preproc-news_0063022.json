    "text": "Mr. Black' has pleaded guilty to federal fraud and money laundering charges.\nBut so has 'Mr. White', 'Mr. Pink' and 17 other defendants in a telemarketing scheme with its center in Phoenix.\nThat includes defendants with other aliases ranging from 'Fredo' to ' Brittany Wilson ' and ' Hailee Randall ,' according to federal prosecutors.\nMr. Black is actually Timothy Murphy , who also went by aliases Colby Muhlberg and Arthur Whitton . He pleaded guilty in federal court in Missouri to a wire fraud charge and conspiracy to commit money laundering charge.\nMurphy, 34, is from Phoenix and the latest Arizona defendant to plead guilty in a telemarketing scam aimed at elderly victims.\nMichael McNeill , 48, of Phoenix — aka Mr. White and Todd Lockwood — and Joshua Flynn , 36, of Chandler — aka Mr. Pink and Jeff Thomas — also pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges late last year in the same case, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office and Internal Revenue Service.\nRead more from Phoenix Business Journal:\nBest Western got caught up in #BoycottNRA, but company cut ties with NRA years ago\nPhoenix, Valley Metro open new office for light rail extension\nSatanists sue Scottsdale: What workplaces need to know about religious accommodation and discrimination\nAccording to federal prosecutors, the Phoenix-based telemarketing group along with associated businesses in Missouri generated more than $20 million in phony telemarketing sales related to business opportunities and used the proceeds instead to buy gold and silver coins.\nThe case has generated multiple indictments and guilty pleas with almost all defendants from Phoenix and its suburbs.\nOthers pleading guilty in the case include:\n• Ashley Powell , aka Brittany Wilson , 26, of Phoenix.\n• Dean Miller , aka Jeffry Wilkes , 44 of Phoenix\n• Scott Shocklee, aka Fredo, 40, of Phoenix,\n• Jason Gallagher , 36, of Gilbert,\n• Andre Devoe , 43, of Tempe\n• Cybill Osterman , 26, of Scottsdale\n• Jennifer Hansen, ake Hailee Randall , 35, of El Mirage\nAll those defendants inlcuding Mr. White, Mr. Black and Mr. Pink will be sentenced later this year.\n\"All twenty defendants have now pled guilty in connection with a multi-count indictment arising from their participation in a fraudulent telemarketing enterprise that often targeted elderly victims,\" said IRS Special Agent Brian Watson . \"The telemarketing enterprise sold false and fictitious business opportunities as part of a scheme that reached across the United States and Canada and generated in excess of $20 million in fraudulent sales.\"",
