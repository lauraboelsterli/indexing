LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) •Indian sovereign bonds are likely to trade steady in early session as investors await a fresh supply of state bonds and retail inflation data. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.46 percent - 7.52 percent band till the auction result. •The rupee will likely open flat to higher against the dollar, as global markets look to settle after bouts of massive risk-related sell-off last week, which can positively impact local shares as well. •The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,476.50, trading up 0.19 percent from its previous close. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks ended a wild week with a burst of buying, pushing the S&P 500 up 1.5 percent on Friday, but still recorded their worst week in two years, and investors braced for more volatile trading days ahead. • Asian share markets found a semblance of calm as S&P futures extended their bounce, though bond investors were still fretting about the risks from looming U.S. inflation data. • The yen edged higher versus the dollar, but traded below a five-month high after a bounce in U.S. equities late last week dampened demand for traditional safe haven currencies. • U.S. Treasury prices gained on Friday after renewed weakness in equity markets increased demand for the low-risk debt. • Oil prices rose, steadying from steep losses as calmer stock markets found their footing after tumbling in last week's chaotic trading. • Gold prices edged up early as the dollar eased a touch after last week's rally and investors waited for more data on U.S. inflation amid expectations of rising interest rates.
