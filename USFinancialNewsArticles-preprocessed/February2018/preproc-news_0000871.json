These achievements included a 24% increase in revenue, a 45% increase in gross profit and a 12% decrease in operating expenses compared to 2016; resulting in net income of $6,091 compared to a net loss of $(706,054) in 2016.

We added more than a dozen customers in 2017 which included initial sales to companies serving segments of the global photonics market. SCI’s 2017 year-end backlog of $1.9 million more than doubled compared to a year ago and underscores our progress.\nWe continued to improve our balance sheet during 2017, which included a 26% increase in year-end cash on hand and a 28% reduction in debt outstanding compared to 2016 year-end. We are building on the achievements of 2017 by continuing to pursue our strategy of establishing new and expanded customer relationships, accelerating time-to-market for new materials and applications, and further enhancing our financial strength.”\nRevenue\nIncreased sales of solar products, pricing, and product mix benefited revenue for the twelve months Revenue increased 24% to $6,801,365 for 2017, an increase of $1,335,766 from the prior year.
