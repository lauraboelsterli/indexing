    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of 8point3 Energy Partners LP (\"CAFD\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CAFD) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by an affiliate of Capital Dynamics Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $12.35 in cash, and an additional undisclosed accrued cash distribution.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether CAFD's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the deal significantly undervalues the Company. According to an analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc., this is a disappointing deal with very low \"odds of a competing proposal emerging.\" Further, when commenting about the acquisition, another analyst at JMP Securities LLC did not express much confidence, stating that \"[i]t may not appear that they maximized the value of the [C]ompany.\"\nMoreover, following the acquisition announcement, CAFD shares traded for as low as $11.77, a drop of nearly 20% from the Company's February 2 trading price of $14.55.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether CAFD's Board acted in the best interests of CAFD's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own CAFD shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/8point3-energy-partners-lp /\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-8point3-energy-partners-lp-acquisition-300596239.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
