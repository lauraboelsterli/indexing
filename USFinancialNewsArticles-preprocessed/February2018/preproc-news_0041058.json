    "text": " 25 PM / Updated 29 minutes ago Germany edge out Switzerland to reach quarters Reuters Staff 1 Min   Yannic Seidenberg scored less than a minute into overtime to propel Germany past Switzerland 2-1 on Tuesday and give them the last spot   of the   tournament. Slideshow (3 Images) Germany took an early lead on a powerplay goal by Leonhard Pfoderl after Switzerlandâ€™s Cody Almond received a five-minute major penalty and one-period suspension for a check to the head. Switzerland levelled at 1-1 a period later on a goal by Simon Moser and that was how it remained through regulation time. The Germans will play top-seeded Sweden in the last eight on Wednesday with Switzerland eliminated from the tournament.  ",
