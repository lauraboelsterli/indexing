    "text": "SOUTH ORANGE, N.J., Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nephros, Inc. (OTCQB:NEPH), a commercial stage medical device company that develops and sells high performance liquid purification ultrafilters and an on-line mid-dilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) system for use with a hemodialysis (HD) machine for the treatment of patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), today announced financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“2017 was a transformational year for us,” said Daron Evans, President and CEO of Nephros. “The strategic shifts we initiated in early 2015 have translated into material changes in our product offerings, our relationships with strategic partners and customers, and ultimately in our financial performance. We believe we are still in the early phase of our growth curve, and have been energized by the performance of our products in the market. As our products are placed in more medical facilities, it becomes easier for our strategic distribution partners to further expand our footprint. In 2018, we will continue to focus on, and to grow, our core medical device water filter business, while taking advantage of revenue and value enhancing opportunities when available in other parts of our business.”\n“We finished the year with over $3.8 million in revenue and over $2 million in cash, the strongest operating position in the company’s history,” said Andy Astor, Chief Financial Officer. “Our progress in 2017 continued to validate our growth strategy and we were pleased to approach cash flow neutral in the fourth quarter. For 2018, we project quarter-over-quarter revenue growth to average 10-12%, and we project 2018 revenues to exceed $6 million.”\nCorporate Update\nHospital Infection Control Filter Market\nIn 2017, revenue from the hospital infection control market grew approximately 90% versus 2016, driven by the launch of new products and increased sales through our strategic distribution partners. In 2018, we will continue to focus on increasing our installed base of hospital customers by supporting our strategic distribution partners. We also plan to enhance our emergency support capabilities for legionella outbreaks, when every hour is critical. We will be launching a marketing effort through our strategic distributors to promote our “same-day” delivery capabilities, made possible by a larger in-house logistics team and warehouse space in our new headquarters near the Newark, New Jersey airport.\n“We appreciate the efforts of our strategic partners in our collective quest to protect patients from legionella, pseudomonas, and other water borne pathogens,” said Shane Sullivan, Director of North American Sales. “We are extremely excited to be able to respond to outbreaks across the country in hours, saving invaluable time for the infection control teams on the ground trying to protect patient health.”\nDialysis Water Filter Market\nRevenue from the dialysis water filter market grew by approximately 50% in 2017 versus 2016. As we continue the launch of our EndoPur TM Endotoxin filter product line, which is targeted at large dialysis clinic reverse osmosis systems, and our work with equipment manufacturers to standardize on Nephros ultrafilters, we expect an acceleration of growth in 2018.\nCommercial / Industrial Water Filter Market\nIn 2017, we focused on continuing to perform pilot tests in multiple areas of potential interest, driven primarily by our strategic distribution partners. We also launched our Lead Filter System. We will be using performance data from these pilot tests to target certain niche markets where we believe our products may add substantial value, and to continue our opportunistic exploration of additional ways to leverage our product portfolio outside of medical device markets.\nHemodiafiltration System\nAfter a year of patient treatments at a Vanderbilt University dialysis clinic using our first-generation HDF system, the program was concluded in January 2018. Nephros will work with Vanderbilt to publish data from the program.\nNow that we have run commercial pilot programs with our first-generation HDF system in multiple dialysis clinics across the country, we better understand the value proposition required to meet the needs of the current clinical and economic ESRD treatment paradigm. Our new, second-generation system incorporates new features that could enable us to better manufacture at scale, reduce the per treatment cost of performing HDF, and better align with current work flow practices. We have already initiated development efforts on the updated device, and will be forming a new subsidiary, Specialty Renal Products, Inc., to drive the development of our second-generation HDF system.\n“We have learned a great deal over the last two years from patients and dialysis care teams,” said Monet Carnahan, Director of Dialysis Products. “We have incorporated their feedback into the updated design and look forward to providing patients and caregivers the option of hemodiafiltration treatments with a more user-friendly, cost-efficient system.”\nFinancial Performance for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately $1,301,000, compared with approximately $745,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 75%. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, were approximately $3,809,000, compared with approximately $2,320,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 65%.\nCost of goods sold was approximately $1,517,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to approximately $1,026,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 48%. Gross margins were 60% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 56% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were approximately $1,002,000 and $1,079,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, a 7% decrease. Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately $218,000 and $230,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, a 5% decrease. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $3,298,000 and $2,854,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, a 16% increase.\nNet cash used in operating activities in the fourth quarter 2017 was approximately $38,000, including approximately $65,000 of cash paid for interest on outstanding notes. As of December 31, 2017, Nephros had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2,194,000.\nAnnual Meeting\nNephros will host an annual shareholder meeting on May 23, 2018 at 9:00am. The meeting will be held at the company’s headquarters facility at 380 Lackawanna Place, South Orange, New Jersey 07079.\nAbout Nephros, Inc.\nNephros is a commercial stage medical device company that develops and sells high performance liquid purification filters, as well as a hemodiafiltration system for the treatment of patients with End Stage Renal Disease.
