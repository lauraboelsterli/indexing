Forward-looking statements give Generac's current expectations and projections relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"confident,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"can have,\" \"likely,\" \"future,\" “optimistic” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.\nAny such forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Although Generac believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect Generac's actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including:\nfrequency and duration of power outages impacting demand for Generac products; availability, cost and quality of raw materials and key components used in producing Generac products; the impact on our results of possible fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodities and product mix; the possibility that the expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings of our acquisitions will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that our acquisitions will not be integrated successfully; difficulties Generac may encounter as its business expands globally; Generac's dependence on its distribution network; Generac's ability to invest in, develop or adapt to changing technologies and manufacturing techniques; loss of key management and employees; increase in product and other liability claims or recalls; and changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, Generac's actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in any forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of these and other factors that may affect future results is contained in Generac's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), particularly in the Risk Factors section of the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its periodic reports on Form 10-Q. Stockholders, potential investors and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement made by Generac in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Generac undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nCONTACT:\nMichael W.
