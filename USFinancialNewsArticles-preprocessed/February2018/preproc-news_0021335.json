These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of SMIC's senior management and involve significant risks, both known and unknown, uncertainties and other factors that may cause SMIC's actual performance, financial condition or results of operations to be materially different from those suggested by the forward-looking statements including, among others, risks associated with cyclicality and market conditions in the semiconductor industry, intense competition in the semiconductor industry, SMIC's reliance on a small number of customers, timely wafer acceptance by SMIC's customers, timely introduction of new technologies, SMIC's ability to ramp new products into volume, supply and demand for semiconductor foundry services, industry overcapacity, shortages in equipment, components and raw materials, availability of manufacturing capacity, financial stability in end markets, orders or judgments from pending litigation, intensive intellectual property litigation in semiconductor industry, general economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to the information contained in this press release, you should also consider the information contained in our other filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on April 27, 2017, especially in the \"Risk Factors\" section and such other documents that we may file with the SEC or The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited (\"SEHK\") from time to time, including current reports on Form 6-K. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this press release. Except as may be required by law, SMIC undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAbout Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"non-GAAP\") Financial Measures\nTo supplement SMIC's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with IFRS, SMIC uses in this press release non-GAAP measures of operating results that are adjusted to exclude finance cost, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefits and expenses, the effect of employee bonus accrual, government funding, gain or loss on the disposal of machinery and equipment and gain from the disposal of living quarters. This earnings release also includes first quarter 2018 guidance for non-GAAP operating expenses. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. This earnings release includes EBITDA, EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating expenses which consist of total operating expenses as adjusted to exclude the effect of employee bonus accrual, government funding, gain or loss on the disposal of machinery and equipment and gain from the disposal of living quarters. These non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated or presented in accordance with, and are not alternatives or substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, and should be read only in conjunction with the Group's financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The Group's non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nSMIC believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors' and management's comparisons to SMIC's historical performance. The Group's management regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand, manage and evaluate the Group's business and make financial and operational decisions.\nThe accompanying table has more information and reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis because the effect of these adjustment items excluded for the purpose of non-GAAP operating expenses guidance are subject to some unpredictable conditions that cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations\n+86-21-3861-0000 ext. 12804\nir@smics.com\nSummary of Fourth Quarter 201 7 Operating Resul t s\nAmounts in US$ thousands, except for EPS and operating data\n4Q17\n3Q17\nQoQ\n4Q16\nYoY\nRevenue\n787,174\n769,723\n2.3%\n814,802\n-3.4%\nCost of sales\n(638,678)\n(592,426)\n7.8%\n(568,790)\n12.3%\nGross profit\n148,496\n177,297\n-16.2%\n246,012\n-39.6%\nOperating expenses\n(145,323)\n(154,592)\n-6.0%\n(196,994)\n-26.2%\nProfit from operations\n3,173\n22,705\n-86.0%\n49,018\n-93.5%\nOther income (expense), net\n(6,086)\n7,290\n-\n473\n-\n(Loss) profit before tax\n(2,913)\n29,995\n-\n49,491\n-\nIncome tax benefit\n1,217\n595\n104.5%\n8,547\n-85.8%\n(Loss) p rofit for the period\n(1,696)\n30,590\n-\n58,038\n-\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nExchange differences on translating foreign operations\n8,458\n5,686\n48.8%\n(11,250)\n-\nChange in value of available-for-sale financial assets\n(67)\n(455)\n-85.3%\n617\n-\nCash flow hedges\n(595)\n5,620\n-\n(34,912)\n-98.3%\nActuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans\n(556)\n32\n-\n1,438\n-\nShare of other comprehensive income of joint ventures accounted for using equity method ( 4 )\n11,755\n5,891\n99.5%\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n17,299\n47,364\n-63.5%\n13,931\n24.2%\nProfit (loss) for the period attributable to:\nSMIC\n47,718\n25,899\n84.2%\n104,008\n-54.1%\nNon-controlling interests\n(49,414)\n4,691\n-\n(45,970)\n7.5%\n(Loss) p rofit for the period\n(1,696)\n30,590\n-\n58,038\n-\nGross margin\n18.9%\n23.0%\n30.2%\nEarnings per ordinary share ( 1 ) Basic\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.02\nDiluted\n$0.01\n$0.01\n$0.02\nEarnings per ADS ( 2 )\nBasic\n$0.05\n$0.03\n$0.12\nDiluted\n$0.05\n$0.03\n$0.11\nWafers shipped (in 8\" equivalent wafers)\n1,124,821\n1,076,039\n1,096,011\nCapacity utilization ( 3 )\n85.8%\n83.9%\n96.5%\nNote:\n(1) Based on weighted average ordinary shares of 4,729million (basic) and 5,159 million (diluted) in 4Q17, 4,651million (basic) and 4,690 million (diluted) in 3Q17, and 4,239 million (basic) and 5,055 million (diluted) in 4Q16. The basic and diluted earnings per share for 4Q16 have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the share consolidation, on the basis that every ten ordinary shares of par value of $0.0004 each consolidated into one consolidated share of par value of $0.004 each, which was accounted for as a reverse stock split effective on December 7, 2016 (\"Share Consolidation\")\n(2) Each ADS represents 5 ordinary shares.\n(3) Based on total equivalent wafers out divided by estimated total quarterly capacity.\n(4) The comparative figure of 3Q17 has been revised to conform the current period's presentation. Such revision reflected the increase of US$5.9 million in the \"share of other comprehensive income of joint ventures accounted for using equity method\" in the 3Q17 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, and both the \"reserves\" and \"investment in joint ventures\" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of September 30, 2017.\nRevenue increased by 2.3% QoQ from $769.7 million in 3Q17 to $787.2 million in 4Q17 mainly due to an increase of wafer shipment in 4Q17. Cost of sales was $638.7 million in 4Q17, an increase of 7.8% QoQ from $592.4 million in 3Q17. Gross profit was $148.5 million in 4Q17, a decrease of 16.2% QoQ from $177.3 million in 3Q17. Gross margin was 18.9% in 4Q17, as compared to 23.0% in 3Q17, primarily due to a product-mix change in 4Q17. Operating expenses were $145.3 million in 4Q17, a decrease of 6.0% QoQ from $154.6 million in 3Q17, mainly due to the reasons stated in Operating Expenses (Income) Analysis below. Other income (expense), net was $6.1 million loss in 4Q17, as compared to $7.3 million gain in 3Q17. The change was mainly due to the reasons stated in Other Income (Expense), Net below. Share of other comprehensive income of joint ventures accounted for using equity method was $11.8 million in 4Q17, compared to $5.9 million in 3Q17. The amount was recognized as the Group's share of the change in value of available-for-sale financial assets of the joint ventures, which are all unlisted companies invested indirectly through China IC Capital Co., Ltd (a wholly-owned investment fund company of the Company). Non-controlling Interests were $49.4 million losses in 4Q17, as compared to $4.7 million gains in 3Q17, mainly due to the allocation of the annual advanced technology R&D expenses to Semiconductor Manufacturing North China (Beijing) Corporation (the Company's majority-owned subsidiary in Beijing) in 4Q17.\nAnalysis of Revenue\nRevenue Analysis\nBy Application\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\nComputer\n6.6%\n5.8%\n3.9%\nCommunications\n42.5%\n45.3%\n44.3%\nConsumer\n37.6%\n37.0%\n37.4%\nAuto/Industrial\n8.8%\n8.1%\n7.0%\nOthers\n4.5%\n3.8%\n7.4%\nBy Service Type\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\nWafers\n99.7%\n98.4%\n96.4%\nMask making, testing, others\n0.3%\n1.6%\n3.6%\nBy Geography\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\nNorth America\n38.1%\n41.9%\n33.2%\nChina ( 1 )\n51.3%\n45.7%\n47.8%\nEurasia ( 2 )\n10.6%\n12.4%\n19.0%\nWafer Revenue Analysis\nBy Technology\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n28 nm\n11.3%\n8.8%\n3.5%\n40/45 nm\n23.6%\n20.6%\n23.6%\n55/65 nm\n16.0%\n20.2%\n19.8%\n90 nm\n1.8%\n1.4%\n1.6%\n0.11/0.13 µm\n6.3%\n8.1%\n14.8%\n0.15/0.18 µm\n37.8%\n37.8%\n34.2%\n0.25/0.35 µm\n3.2%\n3.1%\n2.5%\nNote:\n(1) Including Hong Kong, but excluding Taiwan\n(2) Excluding China and Hong Kong\nCapacity *\nFab\n4Q17\n3Q17\nShanghai 200mm Fab\n109,000\n114,000\nShanghai 300mm Fab\n38,250\n40,500\nBeijing 300mm Fab\n103,500\n112,500\nTianjin 200mm Fab\n50,000\n47,000\nShenzhen 200mm Fab\n30,000\n32,075\nShenzhen 300mm Fab\n6,750\n-\nMajority-Owned Beijing 300mm Fab\n65,250\n61,875\nMajority-Owned Avezzano 200mm Fab\n40,000\n40,000\nTotal monthly wafer fabrication capacity\n442,750\n447,950\nNote:\n* Wafers per month at the end of the period in 8\" equivalent wafers, calculated on a 30-day basis for comparison purposes\nMonthly capacity decreased to 442,750 8-inch equivalent wafers in 4Q17 from 447,950 8-inch equivalent wafers in 3Q17, primarily because of a product-mix change in 4Q17.

Excluding the funding of R&D contracts from the government, R&D expenses increased by $4.1 million QoQ to $135.1 million in 4Q17. The change was mainly due to higher level of R&D activities in 4Q17. Funding of R&D contracts from the government was $33.8 million in 4Q17, compared to $24.2 million in 3Q17. General and administrative expenses increased by 26.2% to $58.2 million in 4Q17, compared to $46.1 million in 3Q17. The change was mainly due to an increase in the government tax surcharges, accrued employee bonus and the patent expenses in 4Q17.

Foreign exchange gains were mainly due to an appreciation of RMB against USD. Foreign monetary assets mainly consist of cash and cash equivalent and trade and other receivables in RMB. Foreign monetary liabilities mainly consist of borrowings, medium-term notes and trade and other payables in RMB. The change in other gains or losses, net was mainly due to a potential cash compensation accrued at about $12.5 million in 4Q17 that may be incurred depending on the profit of Suzhou Changjiang Electric Xinke Investment Co., Ltd during the three years of 2017, 2018 and 2019.

SMIC reviews non-GAAP operating expenses together with operating expenses to understand, manage and evaluate its business and make financial and operational decisions. The Group also believes it is useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact our net profit for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider the non-GAAP operating expenses in isolation from or as an alternative to operating expenses prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of the non-GAAP operating expenses to its most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with IFRS, for the periods indicated.\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 3 1 , 201 7\nSeptember 3 0 , 201 7\nDecember 31 , 201 6\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nOperating expenses\n(145,323)\n(154,592)\n(196,994)\nEmployee bonus accrued\n776\n-\n28,644\nGovernment funding\n(46,833)\n(28,459)\n(23,635)\n(Gain) loss on the disposal of\nmachinery and equipment\n(5,913)\n(4,972)\n9,936\nGain from the disposal of living\nquarters\n(3,268)\n(1,074)\n(1,246)\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\n(200,561)\n(189,097)\n(183,295)\n(2) EBITDA is defined as profit for the period excluding the impact of the finance cost, depreciation and amortization, and income tax benefit and expense. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by revenue. SMIC uses EBITDA margin as a measure of operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Group's annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of the Group's business; to evaluate the effectiveness of the Group's business strategies; and in communications with SMIC's board of directors concerning the Group's financial performance. Although EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items, such as net finance cost, income tax benefit and expense and depreciation and amortization that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their respective financing structures and accounting policies, the book values of their assets, their capital structures and the methods by which their assets were acquired, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Group's results of operations as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: it does not reflect the Group's capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group's working capital needs; it does not reflect finance cost; it does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes; that, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and that other companies in SMIC's industry may calculate these measures differently than SMIC does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to their most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with IFRS, for the periods indicated.\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 3 1 , 201 7\nSeptember 3 0 , 201 7\nDecember 3 1 , 201 6\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Loss) profit for the period\n(1,696)\n30,590\n58,038\nFinance costs\n9,420\n(12,906)\n9,253\nDepreciation and amortization\n251,741\n243,196\n215,586\nIncome tax benefit\n(1,217)\n(595)\n(8,547)\nEBITDA\n258,248\n260,285\n274,330\nProfit margin\n-0.2%\n4.0%\n7.1%\nEBITDA margin\n32.8%\n33.8%\n33.7%\n(3) The comparative figure of 3Q17 has been revised to conform the current period's presentation.

The gross proceeds of the placing are approximately HK$2.57 billion (approximately US$329.1 million) and the net proceeds of the placing (after deduction of fees, commissions and expenses) are approximately HK$2.55 billion (approximately US$326.4 million).\n(2) Both reserves and investments in joint ventures included an accumulated amount of $17.6 million in 4Q17 (3Q17: $5.9 million). The amount was recognized as the Group's share of the change in value of available-for-sale financial assets of the joint ventures, which are all unlisted companies invested indirectly through China IC Capital Co., Ltd (a wholly-owned investment fund company of the Company).\n(3) On December 14, 2017, the Company fulfilled all conditions set out in the placed perpetual subordinated convertible securities (the \"PSCS\") subscription agreement and completed the issue of the PSCS in the principal amount of US$65.0 million. The net proceeds (after deduction of fees, commissions and expenses) are approximately US$64.1 million. Assuming full conversion of the PSCS at the initial conversion price of HK$12.78, the PSCS will be convertible into 39,688,654 paced conversion shares.\n(4) Other liabilities including the non-current and current portion of long-term payables for the new purchased tangible and intangible assets were classified into the non-current and current liabilities respectively in 4Q17. Additionally, other liabilities included a potential cash compensation accrued in 4Q17 that may be incurred depending on the profit of Suzhou Changjiang Electric Xinke Investment Co., Ltd during the three years of 2017, 2018 and 2019. The potential cash compensation was deemed as the terms of the supplemental agreement entered by SilTech Semiconductor (Shanghai) Corporation Limited (an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) and Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co., Ltd on December 9, 2016.\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nCash flow from operating activities\n(Loss) profit for the period\n(1,696)\n30,590\nDepreciation and amortization\n251,741\n243,196\nShare of loss (gain) of investment using equity method\n3,023\n(1,181)\nChanges in working capital and others\n70,630\n146,935\nNet cash from operating activities\n323,698\n419,540\nCash flow from i nvesting activities:\nPayments for property, plant and equipment\n(410,945)\n(691,170)\nPayments for intangible assets\n(7,410)\n(7,217)\nNet proceeds after netting off land appreciation tax from disposal of\nproperty, plant and equipment and assets classified as held for sale ( 1 )\n10,182\n418,956\nChanges in restricted cash relating to investing activities\n26,732\n-\nPayments to acquire financial assets\n(86,233)\n(99,668)\nProceeds on sale of financial assets\n14,200\n9,871\nPayment to acquire long-term investment\n(15,095)\n(30,042)\nProceeds from disposal of equity investment\n1,028\n-\nDistributions received from associates\n-\n255\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(467,541)\n(399,015)\nCash flow from f inancing activities:\nProceeds from borrowings\n389,547\n275,554\nRepayment of borrowings\n(240,076)\n(58,417)\nProceeds from exercise of employee stock options\n13,078\n356\nProceeds from issuance of perpetual subordinated convertible securities\n64,350\n-\nProceeds from non-controlling interest – capital contribution\n294,000\n-\nProceeds from issuance of shares\n326,351\n-\nNet cash from financing activities\n847,250\n217,493\nEffects of exchange rate changes on the balance of cash held in foreign\ncurrencies\n15,744\n5,013\nN et increase in cash and cash equivalent\n719,151\n243,031\nC ash and cash equivalent, beginning of period\n1,119,149\n876,118\nC ash and cash equivalent, end of period\n1,838,300\n1,119,149\nNote:\n(1) In 3Q17, there were seven financing arrangements in total consideration of US$410.8 million entered into by the Group with Xincheng Leasing (Tianjin) Co., Ltd, Xindian Leasing (Tianjin) Co., Ltd and Xinlu Leasing (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (the three leasing companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sino IC Leasing Co., Ltd., an associate of the Group) respectively, in the form of a sale and leaseback transaction with a repurchase option. A batch of production equipment of the Group was sold and leased back under these financing arrangements. As the repurchase prices are set at the expected fair value and the Group is not reasonably certain that it will exercise the repurchase options, the above transactions have been accounted for a disposal of property, plant and equipment followed with an operating lease.\nAs at the date of this announcement, the directors of the Company are:\nExecutive Directors\nZhou Zixue (Chairman)\nZhao HaiJun (Co-Chief Executive Officer)\nLiang Mong Song (Co-Chief Executive Officer)\nGao Yonggang (Chief Financial Officer and Joint Company Secretary)\nNon-executive Directors\nTzu-Yin Chiu (Vice Chairman)\nChen Shanzhi\nZhou Jie\nRen Kai\nLu Jun\nTong Guohua\nIndependent Non-executive Directors\nWilliam Tudor Brown\nLip-Bu Tan\nCarmen I-Hua Chang\nShang-yi Chiang\nJason Jingsheng Cong\nBy order of the Board\nSemiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation\nDr. Gao Yonggang\nExecutive Director, Chief Financial Officer and Joint Company Secretary\nShanghai, PRC\nFebruary 8, 2018\n* For identification purposes only\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smic-reports-2017-fourth-quarter-results-300595710.html\nSOURCE Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation",
