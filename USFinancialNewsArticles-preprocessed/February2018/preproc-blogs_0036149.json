    "text": "Ker Robertson | Getty Images U.S. men's snowboarder Shaun White attends a press conference at the Main Press Centre during previews ahead of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 8, 2018 Shaun White dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations made against him in a 2016 lawsuit as \"gossip\" and hurried away from reporters trying to ask him more about the allegations Wednesday, just hours after winning his third gold medal in the men's halfpipe.\nWhite has been the world's dominant snowboarder for more than a decade, winning gold medals in 2006, 2010 and again this year, completing a comeback after finishing fourth in 2014.\nAs White was competing, many on social media resurfaced the details from the lawsuit by a former drummer in White's rock band, Bad Things. Lena Zawaideh said White sexually harassed and refused to pay her wages after he fired her. The lawsuit was settled in May for an undisclosed amount.\nWhite was asked if the allegations might tarnish his reputation.\n\"I'm here to talk about the Olympics, not gossip and stuff,\" he said. \"I don't think so.\"\nReporters attempted to follow up about the lawsuit, but U.S. Snowboarding and Freeskiing Event Director Nick Alexakos shut them down.\nWhite immediately left the stage following the conference while reporters continued to question him.\n\"I have to get to the medal ceremony,\" he said while being ushered away by Alexakos.\nPhone calls and an email to Zawaideh's attorney from the lawsuit were not immediately returned.\nIn the lawsuit, Zawaideh said White repeatedly sexually harassed her, forced her to watch pornography, and told her how to get her hair cut.\nThe lawsuit included screengrabs of text messages allegedly sent by White asking about the haircut and suggesting she wear a provocative outfit.\nThe lawsuit also said White grabbed Zawaideh's buttocks shortly after leaving a band practice and that he once shoved a bottle of vodka into her mouth and forced her to drink from it. It also said that \"White stuck his hands down his pants, approached Zawaideh, and stuck his hands in her face trying to make her smell them.\" The lawsuit also says White tried to kiss Zawaideh at a Halloween party.\nBad Things signed with Warner Bros. Records in 2013. The rock group released a self-titled album in January of 2014 and toured briefly.\nPraise for White's performance in Pyeongchang caught backfire on social media at a time when #MeToo and other movements are calling for more accountability about harassment and abuse.",
