    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Dividend Declared\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ares Capital Corporation (“Ares Capital”) (NASDAQ: ARCC) announced that its Board of Directors has declared a first quarter dividend of $0.38 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nDECEMBER 31, 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nAres Capital also announced financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFinancial\nQ4-17 Q4-16 FY-17 FY-16 (dollar amounts\nin millions, except per share data)\nTotal Amount Per Share(1) Total Amount Per Share(1) Total Amount\nPer Share(1)\nTotal Amount\nPer Share(1)\nCore EPS(2) $ 0.38 $ 0.42 $ 1.39 $ 1.61 Net investment income $ 140 $ 0.33 $ 138 $ 0.44 $ 511 $ 1.20 $ 494 $ 1.57 Net realized gains (losses) $ (123 ) $ (0.29 ) $ 32 $ 0.10 $ 20 $ 0.05 $ 110 $ 0.35 Net unrealized gains (losses) $ 215 $ 0.50 $ (95 ) $ (0.30 ) $ 136 $ 0.32 $ (130 ) $ (0.41 ) GAAP net income $ 232 $ 0.54 $ 75 $ 0.24 $ 667 $ 1.57 $ 474 $ 1.51 Dividends declared and payable $ 0.38 $ 0.38 $ 1.52 $ 1.52\nAs of December 31, (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 Portfolio investments at fair value $ 11,841 $ 8,820 Total assets $ 12,347 $ 9,245 Stockholders’ equity $ 7,098 $ 5,165 Net assets per share $ 16.65 $ 16.45\n(1) All per share amounts are basic and diluted.\n(2) Basic and diluted Core EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core EPS is the net per share increase (decrease) in stockholders’ equity resulting from operations less professional fees and other costs related to the acquisition of American Capital, Ltd. (“American Capital”) (the “American Capital Acquisition”), net realized and unrealized gains and losses, any capital gains incentive fees attributable to such net realized and unrealized gains and losses and any income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses. Basic and diluted GAAP EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Ares Capital believes that Core EPS provides useful information to investors regarding financial performance because it is one method Ares Capital uses to measure its financial condition and results of operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of basic and diluted Core EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Core EPS excludes $0.01 and $0.01 per share, respectively, of professional fees and other costs related to the American Capital Acquisition. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Core EPS excludes $0.09 and $0.04 per share, respectively, of professional fees and other costs related to the American Capital Acquisition.\nPortfolio Activity\n(dollar amounts in millions) Q4-17 Q4-16 FY-17 FY-16 Portfolio Activity During the Period: Gross commitments(3)(4) $ 1,506 $ 1,164 $ 5,889 $ 3,703 Exits of commitments(3) $ 1,321 $ 1,102 $ 5,593 $ 3,844 Portfolio as of the End of the Period: Number of portfolio company investments 314 218 Weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities(5): At amortized cost\n9.7 % 9.3 % At fair value 9.8 % 9.4 % Weighted average yield on total investments(6): At amortized cost 8.7 % 8.3 % At fair value 8.7 % 8.5 %\n(3) In July 2017, in connection with the effective termination of the Senior Secured Loan Fund LLC (the “SSLP”), Ares Capital purchased $1.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of first lien senior secured loans outstanding at par plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees from the SSLP (the “SSLP Loan Sale”) and assumed the SSLP’s remaining unfunded loan commitments totaling $50 million. Upon completion of the SSLP Loan Sale, the SSLP made a liquidation distribution to the holders of the subordinated certificates of the SSLP (the “SSLP Certificates”) of which Ares Capital received $1.5 billion. The FY-17 gross commitments exclude those investment commitments acquired from the SSLP and the FY-17 exits of commitments exclude the amounts received by Ares Capital from the SSLP’s liquidation distribution.\n(4) The FY-17 gross commitments exclude $2.5 billion of investments acquired as part of the American Capital Acquisition on January 3, 2017.\n(5) Weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities is computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities divided by (b) the total accruing debt and other income producing securities at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities that were acquired as part of the American Capital Acquisition and held as of December 31, 2017 was 10.3% and 10.1% at amortized cost and fair value, respectively.\n(6) Weighted average yield on total investments is calculated as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on accruing debt and other income producing securities divided by (b) the total investments at amortized cost or at fair value as applicable. The weighted average yield on total investments that were acquired as part of the American Capital Acquisition and held as of December 31, 2017 was 8.7% and 7.8% at amortized cost and fair value, respectively.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 OPERATING RESULTS\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Ares Capital reported GAAP net income of $232 million or $0.54 per share (basic and diluted), Core EPS(2) of $0.38 per share (basic and diluted), net investment income of $140 million or $0.33 per share (basic and diluted), and net realized and unrealized gains of $92 million or $0.21 per share (basic and diluted).\nNet income can vary substantially from period to period due to various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, the amount of acquisition related expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net income may not be meaningful.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total assets were $12.3 billion, stockholders’ equity was $7.1 billion and net asset value per share was $16.65.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Ares Capital made $1,506 million in new commitments, including commitments to 14 new portfolio companies and 26 existing portfolio companies. Of the new commitments, 38 were sponsored transactions. As of December 31, 2017, 161 separate private equity sponsors were represented in Ares Capital’s portfolio. Of the $1,506 million in new commitments made during the fourth quarter of 2017, 72% were in first lien senior secured loans, 18% were in second lien senior secured loans, 6% were in senior subordinated loans, 3% were in the subordinated certificates of the Senior Direct Lending Program LLC (the “SDLP”) through which Ares Capital co-invests with Varagon Capital Partners (“Varagon”) and its clients in first lien senior secured loans, and 1% were in other equity securities. Of these commitments, 95% were in floating rate debt securities, of which 97% contained interest rate floors and the remaining 3% were in the subordinated certificates of the SDLP to make co-investments with Varagon and its clients in floating rate first lien senior secured loans through the SDLP, all of which contained interest rate floors. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that Ares Capital will be able to do so.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, significant new commitments included:\n$282 million in first lien senior secured revolving and term loans and a senior subordinated loan of an education services provider to the medical sector; $144 million in first lien senior secured revolving and term loans of an aerospace precision components manufacturer; $123 million in a second lien senior secured term loan and equity in a manufacturer and distributor of textiles, apparel and luxury goods; $120 million in first lien senior secured revolving, delayed draw and term loans and second lien senior secured delayed draw and term loans of a cutting tool provider to the metalworking industry; $107 million in first lien senior secured revolving, delayed draw and term loans and a second lien senior secured term loan of a full service independent insurance agency; $102 million in first lien senior secured revolving and term loans and equity in a professional employer organization offering human resources, compliance and risk management services; $56 million in first lien senior secured delayed draw and term loans and equity in a sand-based proppant producer and distributor to the oil and natural gas industry; $52 million in first lien senior secured revolving and term loans of a manufacturer of single-use obstetrics products; $51 million in first lien senior secured revolving, delayed draw and term loans of a commercial and industrial waste processing and disposal services provider; $50 million in a first lien senior secured delayed draw term loan and equity in an owner and operator of commercial and industrial solar projects; $47 million in first lien senior secured revolving and term loans in an integrated technology solutions provider to car wash operators; $46 million in a first lien senior secured term loan of a management software solutions provider; and $42 million in the subordinated certificates of the SDLP to make a co-investment with Varagon and its clients in a first lien senior secured loan to one portfolio company in the business services industry.\nAlso in the fourth quarter of 2017, Ares Capital exited approximately $1,321 million of investment commitments (including exits of $205 million of commitments acquired as part of the American Capital Acquisition). Of the total investment commitments exited, 48% were second lien senior secured loans, 34% were first lien senior secured loans, 11% were preferred equity securities, 4% were collateralized loan obligations, 2% were senior subordinated loans and 1% were other equity securities. Of the approximately $1,321 million of exited investment commitments, 82% were floating rate, 12% were on non-accrual status, 3% were fixed rate and 3% were non-interest bearing.\nThe fair value of Ares Capital’s portfolio investments at December 31, 2017 was $11.8 billion, including $10.6 billion in accruing debt and other income producing securities. As of December 31, 2017, the total portfolio at fair value included $1.7 billion of investments acquired in the American Capital Acquisition. The total portfolio investments at fair value were comprised of approximately 44% of first lien senior secured loans, 32% of second lien senior secured loans, 4% of subordinated certificates of the SDLP (the proceeds of which were applied to co-investments with Varagon and its clients in first lien senior secured loans through the SDLP), 8% of senior subordinated loans, 1% of collateralized loan obligations, 4% of preferred equity securities and 7% of other equity securities. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities in the portfolio at amortized cost and fair value was 9.7% and 9.8%, respectively, the weighted average yield on total investments in the portfolio at amortized cost and fair value was 8.7% and 8.7%, respectively, and 81% of the total investments at fair value were in floating rate securities.\n“We finished 2017 with our highest quarterly earnings of the year, reflecting higher portfolio yields and strong portfolio performance,” said Kipp deVeer, Chief Executive Officer of Ares Capital. “Our core earnings have improved every quarter for the last three based on strong execution on our goals of improving our portfolio yields and selectively investing in high-quality, upper middle market companies. Going forward, we believe the expansion of our strategic Senior Direct Loan Program, continued portfolio rotation opportunities and rising rates position us for further potential earnings improvement in 2018.”\n“Throughout 2017, we expanded our available capital, strengthened our financial position and locked in favorable long term borrowing costs,” said Penni Roll, Chief Financial Officer of Ares Capital. “Going forward, we believe our modestly leveraged balance sheet with long dated liabilities and significant liquidity provides us the flexibility to be opportunistic in varying market conditions.”\nPORTFOLIO QUALITY\nAres Capital Management LLC (“Ares Capital Management” or Ares Capital’s “investment adviser”) employs an investment rating system to categorize Ares Capital’s investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Ares Capital’s investment adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. Under this system, investments with a grade of 4 involve the least amount of risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. Investments graded 3 involve a level of risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to Ares Capital’s initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to Ares Capital’s ability to ultimately recoup the cost of Ares Capital’s investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 3. Investments graded 2 indicate that the risk to Ares Capital’s ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due. An investment grade of 1 indicates that the risk to Ares Capital’s ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 1, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 1, it is anticipated that Ares Capital will not recoup Ares Capital’s initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of Ares Capital’s initial cost basis upon exit. For investments graded 1 or 2, Ares Capital’s investment adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time.\nAres Capital assigned a fair value on January 3, 2017 (the “Acquisition Date”), which was the date we closed the American Capital Acquisition, to each of the portfolio investments acquired in connection with the American Capital Acquisition. The initial cost basis of each investment acquired was equal to the fair value of such investment as of the Acquisition Date. Many of these portfolio investments were assigned a fair value reflecting a discount to American Capital’s cost basis at the time of American Capital’s origination or acquisition. Each investment was initially assessed a grade of 3 (i.e., generally the grade we assign a portfolio company at acquisition), reflecting the relative risk to our initial cost basis of such investments. It is important to note that our grading system does not take into account factors or events in respect of the period from when American Capital originated or acquired such portfolio investments or the status of these portfolio investments in terms of compliance with debt facilities, financial performance and similar factors. Rather, it is only intended to measure risk from the time that we acquired the portfolio investment in connection with the American Capital Acquisition. Accordingly, it is possible that the grades of these portfolio investments may be reduced or increased after the Acquisition Date.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average grade of the investments in Ares Capital’s portfolio at fair value was 3.1 and 3.1, respectively, and loans on non-accrual status represented 3.1% and 2.9%, respectively, of total investments at amortized cost (or 1.4% and 0.8%, respectively, at fair value).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIn October 2017, Ares Capital and its consolidated subsidiary, Ares Capital CP Funding LLC (“Ares Capital CP”), entered into an agreement to amend Ares Capital CP’s revolving funding facility (as amended, the \"Revolving Funding Facility\"), that among other things, (a) modified the interest rate charged on the Revolving Funding Facility from a rate based on LIBOR plus 2.30% per annum or a \"base rate\" (as defined in the agreements governing the Revolving Funding Facility) plus 1.30% per annum, to a rate based on LIBOR plus 2.15% per annum or a \"base rate\" plus 1.15% per annum and (b) modified certain loan portfolio concentration limits.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Ares Capital had $316 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.9 billion in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding ($4.9 billion at carrying value). Subject to leverage, borrowing base and other restrictions, Ares Capital had approximately $2.5 billion available for additional borrowings under its existing credit facilities and Small Business Administration-guaranteed debentures as of December 31, 2017.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 DIVIDEND\nOn November 2, 2017, Ares Capital declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.38 per share for a total of approximately $162 million. The record date for this dividend was December 15, 2017 and the dividend was paid on December 29, 2017.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIn January 2018, Ares Capital issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The 2025 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.25% per year, payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2018. The 2025 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at our option at any time at the redemption prices as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the 2025 Notes.\nIn January 2018, the SDLP’s total available capital was increased from $2.9 billion to $6.4 billion. In connection with this expansion, Varagon and its clients agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of up to approximately $5.0 billion and Ares Capital agreed to make capital available to the SDLP of up to approximately $1.4 billion. Ares Capital will continue to provide capital to the SDLP in the form of subordinated certificates (the “SDLP Certificates”), and Varagon and its clients will provide capital to the SDLP in the form of senior notes, intermediate funding notes and SDLP Certificates. Investment of any unfunded amount must be approved by the investment committee of the SDLP consisting of representatives of Ares Capital and Varagon (with approval from a representative of each required).\nIn February 2018, Ares Capital’s board of directors authorized an amendment to its $300 million stock repurchase program to extend the expiration date of the program from February 28, 2018 to February 28, 2019. Under the stock repurchase program, Ares Capital may repurchase up to $300 million in the aggregate of its outstanding common stock in the open market at a price per share that meets certain thresholds below its net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by Ares Capital, in its discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors.\nFrom January 1, 2018 through February 8, 2018, Ares Capital made new investment commitments of approximately $938 million, of which $749 million were funded. Of these new commitments, 48% were in first lien senior secured loans, 21% were in other equity securities, 18% were in senior subordinated loans, 7% were in second lien senior secured loans and 6% were in investments in the SDLP Certificates to make co-investments with Varagon and its clients in floating rate first lien senior secured loans through the SDLP. Of the approximately $938 million of new investment commitments, 68% were floating rate, 11% were fixed rate and 21% were non-interest bearing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities funded during the period at amortized cost was 9.6%. Ares Capital may seek to sell all or a portion of these new investment commitments, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nFrom January 1, 2018 through February 8, 2018, Ares Capital exited approximately $871 million of investment commitments, including $166 million of investment commitments acquired in the American Capital Acquisition. Of the total investment commitments exited, 60% were first lien senior secured loans, 33% were second lien senior secured loans, 3% were senior subordinated loans, 3% were investments in the SDLP Certificates and 1% was other equity securities. Of the approximately $871 million of exited investment commitments, 99% were floating rate and 1% was non-interest bearing. The weighted average yield of debt and other income producing securities exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 8.5% and the weighted average yield on total investments exited or repaid during the period at amortized cost was 8.3%. On the approximately $871 million of investment commitments exited from January 1, 2018 through February 8, 2018, Ares Capital recognized total net realized gains of approximately $3 million.\nIn addition, as of February 8, 2018, Ares Capital had an investment backlog and pipeline of approximately $505 million and $240 million, respectively. Investment backlog includes transactions approved by Ares Capital’s investment adviser’s investment committee and/or for which a formal mandate, letter of intent or a signed commitment have been issued, and therefore Ares Capital believes are likely to close. Investment pipeline includes transactions where due diligence and analysis are in process, but no formal mandate, letter of intent or signed commitment have been issued. The consummation of any of the investments in this backlog and pipeline depends upon, among other things, one or more of the following: satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of the prospective portfolio company, Ares Capital’s acceptance of the terms and structure of such investment and the execution and delivery of satisfactory transaction documentation. In addition, Ares Capital may sell all or a portion of these investments and certain of these investments may result in the repayment of existing investments. Ares Capital cannot assure you that it will make any of these investments or that Ares Capital will sell all or any portion of these investments.\nWEBCAST / CONFERENCE CALL\nAres Capital will host a webcast/conference call on Tuesday, February 13, 2018 at 12:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss its quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 financial results.
