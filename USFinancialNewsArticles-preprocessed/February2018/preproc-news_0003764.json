    "text": "  27 minutes ago Rampant Eibar crush sorry Sevilla 5-1 Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMADRID (Reuters) - Eibar hammered Vincenzo Montella’s Sevilla 5-1 to move within a point of their stunned opponents in La Liga on Saturday. \nSevilla, with one eye on their King’s Cup semi-final, second leg against Leganes on Wednesday, were far from their best and Eibar, inspired by winger Fabian Orellana, took full advantage. \nThe Basques, who are now one place behind Sevilla in seventh on 32 points, took 38 seconds to go ahead when Kike Garcia broke away and rifled an effort past Sergio Rico at his near post. \nOrellana stabbed home the second goal in the 17th minute before Pablo Sarabia pulled one back for the visitors with a penalty for handball by Dani Garcia. \nSevilla, who drew 1-1 in the first leg of their King’s Cup semi-final, were unbeaten in five games before Saturday’s match and seemed poised to mount a comeback but Ivan Ramis restored Eibar’s two-goal lead with a towering header from a corner. \nOrellana grabbed his second after the break, with Anaitz Arbilla curling home a fine free kick to complete the rout and delight the home fans at the Ipurua Stadium.
