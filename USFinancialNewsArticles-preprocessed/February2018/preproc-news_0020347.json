Results from UK companies including Thomas Cook, TalkTalk, DFS Furniture, and Sophos, are just hitting the wire. M&A activity could also liven up today's session with Swiss Re's shares seen opening up 5 percent after the reinsurer said it was in talks with SoftBank on a potential minority stake. (Helen Reid) EARNINGS, BANK OF ENGLAND IN FOCUS (0644 GMT) Nevertheless there are other events in Europe today which should grab investors' attention, with results still rolling in from big corporate players. Banks are at the forefront today with Societe Generale reporting forecast-beating results despite quarterly profit plunging on tax-related and restructuring costs. Commerzbank also flagged a 51 percent decline in Q4 profit, blaming weak markets and its overhaul. Other notable results include truck maker Volvo, which reported record profit, and Swiss engineering group ABB, which gave a brighter outlook for the year. We'll also be closely watching the Bank of England's rate decision and inflation report - particularly considering the past week's jitters over inflation. SocGen analysts expect the BoE to slightly raise growth and inflation forecasts. \"The MPC will be happy to see that the money market is now taking seriously its message of further tightening,\" they write. \"However the market has brought forward the expected timing of rate increases compared to its view three months ago quite aggressively, and even though we expect the tone of the report to be slightly more hawkish, we think it might not be enough to validate the current Overnight Index Swap curve.\" (Helen Reid)",
