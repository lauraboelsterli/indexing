Keith replaces Drew Del Matto who served as Chief Financial Officer since January 2014 and is departing Fortinet for another opportunity.\n“I am pleased to announce Keith’s appointment to Interim Chief Financial Officer,” said Ken Xie, Founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. “Keith has been instrumental in driving business scale and increased levels of productivity through the transformation of our financial, accounting and ERP systems and processes.
