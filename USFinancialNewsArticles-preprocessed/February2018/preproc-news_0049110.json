The hearing will deal with Gates' attorneys request to withdraw from the case over what they have described as \"irreconcilable differences.\" Published 4 Hours Ago Reuters Getty Images Former Trump Aide Rick Gates attends a hearing on his fraud, conspiracy and money-laundering at the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse on February 7, 2018 in Washington, DC. \nA U.S. judge has ordered a closed hearing for Friday in the Russia probe case of Rick Gates, a former campaign aide for President Donald Trump , according to a court filing on Thursday. \nThe hearing will deal with Gates' attorneys request to withdraw from the case over what they have described as \"irreconcilable differences.\" \nGates is charged with conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud the United States and failing to register as a foreign agent for political work representing a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party. \nThe charges are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election.",
