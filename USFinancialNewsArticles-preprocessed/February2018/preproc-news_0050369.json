    "text": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock soars on earnings beat February 22, 2018 \nHewlett Packard Enterprise shares skyrocketed as much as 19 percent on Thursday after the company reported first quarter financial results that blasted past analysts’ expectations on top and bottom lines. \nHere’s how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: 34 cents vs. 22 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $7.67 billion vs. $7.07 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters \nThe company also saw growth in revenue from servers and networking — two areas analysts thought might drag on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s top line. \nHPE reported storage revenue increased by 24 percent year-over-year, while data center networking revenue grew by 27 percent since last year. \nRevenue from servers and storage declined in the year-ago quarter — 12 and 13 percent respectively, so analysts weren’t expecting such a quick turn around. \nCFO Tim Stonesifer attributed growth in storage revenue, both to organic causes and to the acquisition of flash storage technology company Nimble in fiscal 2017.

HPE forecast a range of $1.35 to $1.45 EPS for fiscal 2018, whereas analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected EPS of $1.18. \nHewlett Packard Enterprise’s report comes at a key moment for the company. \nCEO Meg Whitman stepped down February 1, handing over the reins to the president and veteran executive Antonio Neri, making the company’s first quarter her last. When Whitman announced her impending departure in November, shares tanked 6 percent, despite an earnings beat. \nWhitman, who served as CEO since 2011, oversaw the company’s split into two brands. She remained CEO at the newly streamlined Hewlett Packard Enterprise, where she prioritized cloud services and spun off product and consumer hardware to HP. Her tenure at HPE saw a ramping up of acquisitions — eight in the last two years. MUST READ Stocks mostly lower as Apple falls 2.5% \nWhitman’s legacy may well live on with Neri. \nIn HPE’s earnings call, the new CEO reiterated his commitment to what he called Whitman’s “rigorous discipline” and return on investment-based strategy for running the company. \nAlthough he said the company is still focused on returning capital to investors, Neri said he feels HPE has the flexibility to also invest in innovation. This could mean a mix of internal investments, partnerships with or acquisitions of smaller companies. ",
