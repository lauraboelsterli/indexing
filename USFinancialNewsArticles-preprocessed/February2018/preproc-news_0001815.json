Slideshow (5 Images) \nSeveral scuffles broke out mid-afternoon between migrants from different communities, the prefecture said. \n“The police intervened to protect Afghan migrants who were threatened by 200 migrants of Eritrean nationality,” it said. \nAuthorities said around 600 migrants are in the Calais region, though humanitarian groups put the number at 800.
