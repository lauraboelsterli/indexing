As a result, they feel safer in taking added risk.\nWhy is low volatility a problem? \"Low volatility may eventually prove to be a trap for markets, when the tide turns, suddenly revealing the pressure cooker it led investors into,\" Filia said.\n\"Low volatility sows the seeds of its own demise, as it leads to complacency, excess risk-taking, excess leverage and a vast correlation across investment strategies: in the words of Hyman Minsky, stability is destabilizing.\"\nDaniel Lacalle, chief economist at Tressis, told CNBC Wednesday that \"even the mildest change on volatility as seen this week can cause abrupt moves in markets.\"\nThe VIX, which shows the market's expectation of 30-day volatility, hit a five-month high Tuesday while U.S. stocks saw back-to-back declines — which have been uncommon lately. At the same time, bond markets have seen yields rising close to the 3 percent level, adding to concerns of a potential market correction.\nBut some investors prefer looking at several factors... \"Personally, I would probably look at a combination of extended valuation levels and much talk that markets can only go up from here, while the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain or overheating,\" Lothar Mentel, chief executive officer at Tatton Investment Management, told CNBC via email.\nHe explained that he has extended valuations in the U.S., but there is much talk that U.S. stocks are about to fall while the economic outlook is currently pretty stable. \"The worst we can see on the horizon is a slowing in the growth of growth itself, rather than growth turning negative,\" he said.\n\"So I am afraid low equity volatility is always a concern, but by no means 'the canary in the coal mine' on its own.\"\nshow chapters Strategist: Volatility is back, deal with it 6:03 PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 | 03:51",
