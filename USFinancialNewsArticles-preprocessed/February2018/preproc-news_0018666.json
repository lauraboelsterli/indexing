    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 4:54 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago France banks on apprenticeships to bring down youth unemployment Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Friday outlined a revamp of France’s apprenticeship system in the hope of getting more young people into work, as companies struggle to find skilled labor. \nEmployers welcomed the plans, which would give firms more control over a system they say is ill-adapted to their needs although they partly finance it through a special payroll tax. \n“The current system gets bogged down because it suffers from being too complex,” Philippe told journalists. \nUnder the plan, companies and unions - instead of civil servants at the Education Ministry - will jointly define qualifications needed for vocational training courses. \nRepresentatives from each industry will help decide how much money each program gets. \nCurrently, regional governments receive revenue from the apprenticeship tax and use it to finance special training centers that are often ill-attended. \nYoung people up to 30, instead of the current 26, will be able to join apprenticeships. \nThe government wants to increase pay for apprentices by 30 euros a month while publishing how successful each program is in winning them jobs. \nMore than one in five young people is out of work, a much higher proportion than the overall jobless rate of 9.7 percent. \nApprenticeships are much more common in northern Europe. About a third of upper-school students are enrolled in such programs in Germany compared to only 5 percent in France, according to OECD data. \nThe head of the Medef employers’ union, Pierre Gattaz, said the government’s plan “corresponds to the changes that we want”.
