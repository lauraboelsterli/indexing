    "text": "- Collaboration to focus on intelligent image and video-based search, targeted brand advertising for sharing economy apps\nHONG KONG, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sharing Economy International, Inc. (\"SEII\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: SEII) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, EC Technology & Innovations Limited (\"ECTI\"), has entered into an exclusivity agreement with the shareholders of Pandoodle Corporation (\"Pandoodle\"), regarding a potential acquisition by ECTI of not less than 51% of Pandoodle.\nPandoodle provides video and imaging solutions that increase advertising value through artificial intelligence (\"A.I.\"), video and image analysis and recognition technologies. Pandoodle offers Dolo, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that automates the analysis and insertion of branded content, providing advertisers and publishers with personalized branding in real-time. Pandoodle's custom software solutions, deep analytics, and image and video capabilities allow content owners to incorporate brand placement slots within their videos.\n\"I was so excited when I first met with Pandoodle and learned about their technologies. Their intelligent video and imaging analysis and recognition technologies provide very targeted solutions, both in intelligent search and matching and the brand advertising market,\" said Parkson Yip, COO of SEII. \"With intelligent image and video recognition technologies from Pandoodle, users on our sharing economy apps and platforms can search by image or video and we can provide them with the best matches available. With the proliferation of video and image content available today, video and image-based searching provide a convenience for users to locate items based on what they see. In addition, there is a significant potential market opportunity to extend targeted brand advertising onto any image and video content when users are browsing online or on social media. This will allow brand advertisers reach their target customer group very precisely with high frequency, independent from the media platform. Furthermore, our advertising and media business unit can collaborate with Pandoodle to develop new and creative brand exposure advertising solutions. More important is the highly experienced management and leadership team at Pandoodle, which we expect will help accelerate adoption of SEII's sharing economy solutions and platforms as we move into the US market.\"\n\"I am thrilled for the opportunity to work with SEII, an international sharing economy company, which has the same vision and objectives as we do for the advancement of technology,\" said Dirk Brown, Founder and CEO of Pandoodle. \"By partnering with the SEII group, we can join a group of entrepreneurs and innovators to further expand and apply our video and imaging A.I. technologies in more applications and markets. Alongside SEII's own advertising and media development initiatives, we can work together to build a new targeted advertising platform based on video and imagine insertion. On the other hand, we are also very interested in supporting the introduction of SEII sharing economy platforms and solutions to the US market. I believe this will truly be a win-win collaboration for both companies.\"\nThere can be no assurances that the parties may enter into any agreement to do a transaction, and even if an agreement is entered into, there can be no assurances that such transaction will be consummated.\nAbout Sharing Economy International Inc.\nSharing Economy International Inc., through its affiliated companies, designs, manufactures and distributes a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry.
