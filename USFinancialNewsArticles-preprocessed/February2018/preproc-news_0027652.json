Uno sales were up 12% last year from 2016, reports the Associated Press. Mattel is apparently latching onto this bright light, selling Uno in more places, launching a version that’s playable on Facebook Messenger, and even reportedly working on an Uno app. \nDos will be released at Target (tgt) stores in March.
