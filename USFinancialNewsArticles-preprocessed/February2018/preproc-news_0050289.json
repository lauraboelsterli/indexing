Van Hoof had been suspended from his role since November, pending an investigation into misconduct. “During the process, it became clear that there are irreconcilable differences between Eddie and British Gymnastics regarding the leadership, conduct and culture of elite coaching for our sport,” a statement said. “The situation had become untenable and it was best for all sides to bring matters to a close.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Kevin Liffey",
