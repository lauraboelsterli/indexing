    "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Swedish wunderkind Jennie-Lee Burmansson came up short in her bid to become the youngest freestyle skier to win a medal at a Winter Olympics but the 15-year-old will return to school “stoked” for making the final.\nAfter 16-year-old French world champion Tess Ledeux crashed out of qualifying, Burmansson finished eighth behind Swiss gold medallist Sarah Hoefflin in glorious sunshine at the Phoenix Snow Park.\nAnother Swiss in Mathilde Gremaud took silver, with Isabel Atkin clinching the bronze for Great Britain.\nRelated Coverage No regrets for Howell after missing out on slopestyle final “It went OK, I made the final, so I‘m stoked about it,” Burmansson, who took bronze at the Winter X Games in Aspen in the leadup, told Reuters.\nWith 65.00 her highest mark, Burmansson went for glory on her third and final run to attempt to reel in the Swiss leaders, but she decisively wiped out.\n“I don’t know, I couldn’t really figure it out in training, I couldn’t really get some good tricks on the jumps as well,” she said.\nFreestyle Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Ski Slopestyle Qualifications - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 17, 2018 - Tess Ledeux of France competes. REUTERS/Mike Blake Ledeux had earlier gone for a more risky routine in her second run during qualifying, needing a big score to reach the top 12 for the final.\nBut she badly lost control of her last jump, her arms pinwheeling in the air before she thudded down in an explosion of snow.\nFreestyle Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Ski Slopestyle Qualifications - Phoenix Snow Park - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 17, 2018 - Emma Dahlstrom of Sweden competes. REUTERS/Mike Blake The score of 28.40 left her with a highest mark of 69.40, 15th out of the field of 23.\nClearly distraught, Ledeux promptly left the venue, potentially raising the ire of the International Olympic Committee for skipping media duties.\nAt the age of 15 years and 116 days, Ledeux’s world title at Sierra Nevada, Spain, last year made her the youngest freestyle skier to win a world championship.\nBut the raised intensity of the Olympic theatre clearly got to the teenager, who might sooner have opted for a safer routine in her second effort.\nFrance’s day got worse with the nation’s other skier Lou Barin also missing out on qualifying with a 19th placing.\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury and Sudipto Ganguly\n ",
