    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to revive litigation in which shareholders accused the federal government of overstepping its authority when it restructured mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac following the 2008 housing crisis.\nThe justices left in place a lower courtâ€™s 2017 ruling that the investors, led by hedge fund Perry Capital, could not pursue legal claims accusing the government of unlawfully channeling profits from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the U.S. Treasury Department.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ",
