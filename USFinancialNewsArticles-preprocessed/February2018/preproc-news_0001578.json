Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented most accurately reflect the company's operating results from providing investment management and related services to individuals and institutions and uses these measures to evaluate financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures have material limitations and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures can be found beginning on page 11 of this earnings release.\nAsset Flows and Assets Under Management\n(in billions)\nThree Months Ended\nThree\nMonths\nEnded\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nChange\n9/30/2017\nChange\nEnding long-term assets under management (1)\n$\n88.8\n$\n45.4\n96%\n$\n87.1\n2%\nEnding total assets under management\n$\n91.0\n$\n45.4\n101%\n$\n90.6\n—%\nAverage long-term assets under management (1)\n$\n87.8\n$\n45.3\n94%\n$\n86.0\n2%\nAverage total assets under management\n$\n91.4\n$\n45.3\n102%\n$\n89.3\n2%\nGross sales\n$\n4.1\n$\n2.6\n56%\n$\n4.6\n(10)%\nNet flows\n$\n(0.8)\n$\n(0.4)\n106%\n$\n0.2\nN/M\n(1)\nExcludes assets under management in liquidity strategies, including open-end mutual funds and institutional accounts\nN/M - Not Meaningful\nLong-term assets under management of $88.8 billion at December 31, 2017 increased $1.7 billion, or 1.9 percent, from September 30, 2017 primarily reflecting market appreciation. Total assets under management at December 31, 2017, which included $2.1 billion of assets in liquidity strategies, were $91.0 billion.\nTotal sales were $4.1 billion compared with $4.6 billion in the third quarter, which included the issuance of a $0.5 billion collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managed by Seix. Institutional sales increased 39 percent sequentially due to higher sales at Kayne Anderson Rudnick and Rampart; ETF sales also increased. Total sales increased 56 percent from the prior-year quarter due to higher sales in institutional, retail separate accounts, and open-end funds.\nMutual fund sales were $2.6 billion compared with $2.8 billion in the prior quarter and $1.6 billion in the prior-year quarter. The sequential-quarter decrease reflects lower sales in bank loan strategies; the increase from the prior-year quarter primarily reflects higher sales in domestic equity and fixed income strategies.\nTotal net flows were ($0.8) billion compared with $0.2 billion sequentially, as positive contributions from retail separate accounts and ETFs were more than offset by net outflows in mutual funds and institutional.\nMutual fund net flows were ($0.6) billion compared with breakeven in the third quarter due primarily to net outflows in bank loan strategies, reflecting industry trends in that asset class. The year-over-year improvement was due primarily to positive net flows in international equity and fixed income strategies.\nGAAP Results\nOperating income of $28.0 million increased from the prior quarter due to a 4 percent increase in revenues and a 6 percent decrease in operating expenses. Fourth-quarter operating expenses included $3.4 million of acquisition and integration costs for the RidgeWorth transaction compared with $4.9 million in the third quarter.\nIncome tax expense of $24.6 million included a $13.1 million non-cash tax charge reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that resulted in the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates.\nFourth-quarter net income per diluted share of $0.46 included ($1.76) from the tax charge, ($0.30) of realized and unrealized losses on investments, and ($0.28) of acquisition and integration costs. Third quarter net income per share of $2.21 included $1.22 of realized and unrealized gains on investments, ($0.20) of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, ($0.36) of acquisition and integration costs, and ($0.81) of CLO launch-related expenses.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased 12 percent to 7.4 million from 8.5 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the calculation of the \"if-converted\" method in the quarter, in which the impact of the deduction of preferred dividends from net income was shown to be more dilutive than the conversion of the preferred shares.\nNon-GAAP Results\nRevenues, as adjusted, of $109.4 million increased 5 percent sequentially and reflect higher investment management fees, as adjusted. The 4 percent sequential-quarter change in investment management fees, as adjusted, was due to an increase in average assets and a higher average fee rate, which reflected lower fund expense reimbursements and market appreciation in equity strategies. Third quarter investment management fees, as adjusted, included $0.8 million of incentive fees earned on structured products.\nOperating expenses, as adjusted, of $70.3 million increased 2 percent sequentially due to higher employment expenses, as adjusted, and other operating expenses, as adjusted, reflecting an increase in profit-based incentive compensation and $0.9 million of transaction costs related to the agreement with Sustainable Growth Advisers (SGA).\nOperating income, as adjusted, of $39.1 million increased 11 percent from the third quarter and the related margin increased to 36 percent from 34 percent.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, was $2.60 per diluted common share, an increase of 13 percent from the third quarter, reflecting higher operating income and a lower share count primarily due to a lower preferred stock conversion rate resulting from the higher common stock conversion price during the quarter.\nThe effective tax rate, as adjusted, was 39 percent, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior quarter, due to changes in the 2017 state tax apportionment rules. Income taxes, as adjusted, did not include any impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSelect Balance Sheet Items (Unaudited)\n(in millions)\nAs of\nAs of\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nChange\n9/30/2017\nChange\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n132.1\n$\n64.6\n104%\n$\n164.9\n(20)%\nContingent consideration\n$\n—\n$\n—\nN/M\n$\n51.7\n(100)%\nDebt\n$\n248.3\n$\n30.0\nN/M\n$\n248.5\n—%\nTotal equity attributable to stockholders\n$\n588.5\n$\n321.7\n83%\n$\n584.2\n1%\nWorking capital (1)\n$\n76.3\n$\n27.7\n175%\n$\n68.0\n12%\nNet debt (cash) (2)\n$\n127.2\n$\n(34.6)\nN/M\n$\n146.8\n(13%)\n(1)\nDefined as cash and cash equivalents plus accounts receivable, net, less accrued compensation and benefits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable, and contingent consideration\n(2)\nDefined as gross debt plus contingent consideration less cash and cash equivalents\nN/M - Not Meaningful\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 decreased 20 percent from September 30, 2017, as cash flow from operations was more than offset by the payment of the $51.7 million contingent consideration related to the RidgeWorth acquisition, and an investment in an existing CLO that facilitated the extension of the reinvestment period and maturity date.\nDividend and interest income earned on investments was $2.9 million in the quarter compared with $4.2 million sequentially.\nThe net leverage ratio, which is net debt to EBITDA (in accordance with the company's credit agreement), decreased to 0.7x at December 31, 2017 from 0.9x at September 30, 2017.\nAgreement with Sustainable Growth Advisers\nThe company separately announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a majority interest in SGA, a growth equity manager specializing in high-conviction U.S. and global portfolios with $11.6 billion in assets under management at December 31, 2017. At closing, the company will acquire a 70 percent equity interest in SGA for $129.5 million, pending any price adjustments tied to client consents. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to customary closing conditions and client approvals. The company expects to finance the transaction using balance sheet resources and available capacity on its credit facility, or may seek additional sources of debt financing, depending on market conditions.\nConference Call\nVirtus Investment Partners management will host an investor conference call on Friday, February 2, at 10 a.m. Eastern to discuss these financial results and related matters.

Distribution and other asset-based expenses - Primarily payments to third-party distribution partners and third-party service providers for providing services to investors in our sponsored funds and payments to third-party service providers for investment management-related services. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with other asset management firms that do not utilize intermediary distribution partners or third-party service providers.\n2. Consolidated investment products - Revenues and expenses generated by operating activities of majority-owned mutual funds and CLOs that are consolidated in the financial statements. Management believes that excluding these operating activities to reflect net revenues and expenses of the company prior to the consolidation of these products is consistent with the approach of reflecting its operating results from managing third-party client assets.\n3. Amortization of intangible assets - Non-cash amortization expense or impairment expense, if any, attributable to acquisition-related intangible assets. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with other asset management firms that have not engaged in acquisitions.\n4. Restructuring and severance - Certain expenses associated with restructuring the business, including lease abandonment-related expenses and severance costs associated with staff reductions, that are not reflective of the ongoing earnings generation of the business. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with prior periods.\n5. Acquisition and integration expenses - Expenses that are directly related to acquisition and integration activities. Acquisition expenses include transaction closing costs, certain professional fees, and financing fees. Integration expenses include costs incurred that are directly attributable to combining businesses, including compensation, restructuring and severance charges, professional fees, consulting fees, and other expenses. Management believes that making these adjustments aids in comparing the company's operating results with other asset management firms that have not engaged in acquisitions.\nComponents of Acquisition and Integration Expenses for the respective periods are shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nAcquisition and Integration Expenses\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n9/30/2017\nEmployment expenses\n$\n2,009\n$\n—\n$\n2,275\nRestructuring and severance\n102\n—\n1,447\nOther operating expenses\n1,269\n3,347\n1,196\nTotal Acquisition and Integration Expenses\n$\n3,380\n$\n3,347\n$\n4,918\n6. Other - Certain expenses that are not reflective of the ongoing earnings generation of the business. In addition, it includes income tax expense (benefit) items, such as adjustments for uncertain tax positions, changes in tax law, valuation allowances and other unusual or infrequent items not related to current operating results to reflect a normalized effective rate. Preferred dividends are adjusted as the shares are mandatorily convertible into common shares at the end of three years and the non-GAAP weighted average shares are adjusted to reflect the conversion. Management believes that making these adjustments aids in comparing the company's operating results with prior periods.\nComponents of Other for the respective periods are shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nOther\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\n9/30/2017\nSystem transition expenses\n$\n256\n$\n611\n$\n406\nTax impact of system transition expenses\n(100)\n(230)\n(156)\nTax impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n13,059\n—\n—\nOther discrete tax adjustments\n(910)\n—\n(183)\nTotal tax related items\n12,049\n(230)\n(339)\nPreferred stockholder dividends\n2,084\n—\n2,084\nTotal Other\n$\n14,389\n$\n381\n$\n2,151\n7. Seed capital and CLO investments earnings (loss) - Gains and losses (realized and unrealized), dividends and interest income generated by seed capital and CLO investments. Earnings or losses generated by investments in seed capital and CLO investments can vary significantly from period to period and do not reflect the company's operating results from providing investment management and related services. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with prior periods and with other asset management firms that do not have meaningful seed capital and CLO investments.\nDefinitions:\nRevenues, as adjusted, comprise the fee revenues paid by clients for investment management and related services. Revenues, as adjusted, for purposes of calculating net income attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, differ from U.S. GAAP revenues in that they are reduced by distribution and other asset-based expenses that are generally passed through to external parties, and exclude the impact of consolidated investment products.\nOperating expenses, as adjusted, is calculated to reflect expenses from ongoing continuing operations. Operating expenses, as adjusted, for purposes of calculating net income attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, differ from U.S. GAAP expenses in that they exclude amortization or impairment, if any, of intangible assets, restructuring and severance, the impact of consolidated investment products, acquisition and integration-related expenses and certain other expenses that do not reflect the ongoing earnings generation of the business.\nOperating margin, as adjusted, is a metric used to evaluate efficiency represented by operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenues, as adjusted.\nEarnings (loss) per share, as adjusted, represent net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, divided by weighted average shares outstanding, as adjusted, on either a basic or diluted basis.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains statements that are, or may be considered to be, forward-looking statements.
