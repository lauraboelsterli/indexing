    "text": " 09 AM / Updated an hour ago Nirav Modi's Firestar Diamond files for bankruptcy in U.S. Reuters Staff 1 Min Read Feb 27 (Reuters) - Firestar Diamond Inc, the flagship company of billionaire Nirav Modi who is at the centre of Indiaâ€™s biggest-ever bank scam, has filed for bankruptcy in the United States. The company has listed assets and liabilities in the range of $50 million to $100 million, according to a court filing in the Southern District Of New York on Monday. Indian state-run lender Punjab National Bank had earlier this month unearthed fraudulent transactions at one of its Mumbai branches, the amount of which could now be about $2 billion. Modi, founder of Firestar Diamond, and his uncle Mehul Choksi, who owns Gitanjali Gems Ltd, are suspected of colluding with two employees from Punjab National Bank in the fraud.
