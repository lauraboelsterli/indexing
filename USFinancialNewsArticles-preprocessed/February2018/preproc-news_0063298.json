Revenue was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, compared to $1.2 billion and $5.0 billion for the comparable periods in 2016. Income from construction operations was $59.3 million and $179.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, compared to $52.1 million and $201.9 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in income from construction operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely due to contributions from certain higher-margin Civil projects. Income from construction operations in 2017 was adversely affected by unfavorable adjustments on certain mechanical projects in the Specialty Contractors segment.\nNet income attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 increased substantially to $80.9 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, and $148.4 million, or $2.92 per diluted share, respectively, compared to $30.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and $95.8 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, for the comparable periods in 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 included a tax benefit of $53.3 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, which primarily resulted from the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities due to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income for full year 2017 was also favorably impacted by a gain of $37 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, on a legal settlement that was recorded in other income earlier in the year.\nThe Company generated operating cash of $163.6 million in 2017, which established a new record for annual operating cash generation. Operating cash exceeded net income in 2017 for a second consecutive year. The Company anticipates that cash generation will continue to be strong in 2018 and that cash flow from operations will again exceed net income for the year.\nBacklog as of December 31, 2017, was $7.3 billion, up 17% compared to $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. New awards and adjustments to contracts in progress during the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were $1.0 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, compared to $0.8 billion and $3.7 billion for the same periods last year. The Civil segment was the major contributor to new award activity in 2017, and both the Civil and Building segments are expected to drive backlog growth in 2018. The Company has previously announced certain sizeable new projects that are expected to be booked as new awards in the first quarter of 2018, including the $1.41 billion Newark Airport Terminal One Design-Build project and a $172 million mechanical project at the Baruch Houses complex in New York.\n“We had an excellent year of new awards that grew our backlog significantly. In addition, our continued intense focus on improved working capital management enabled us to generate record operating cash in 2017,” remarked Ronald Tutor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Tutor continued, “The Civil segment performed particularly well, growing its backlog by 54% in 2017 and finishing with a 12.0% operating margin for the year. Our large current backlog and volume of prospective opportunities together with our expectation for improved profitability in the Specialty Contractors segment provides us with confidence for even better operating results in 2018.”\nOutlook and Guidance\nThe Company anticipates continued strong demand across various end markets. Revenue growth in 2018 is expected to be driven by higher volume of work in the Civil and Building segments, while increased operating income is expected to result from consistent operating margins in the Civil and Building segments and a higher operating margin in the Specialty Contractors segment. In addition, the lower effective tax rate resulting from recent tax reform together with reduced interest expense should positively benefit the Company’s 2018 results.\nFor 2018, the Company is establishing its initial EPS guidance at a range of $1.90 to $2.30 per diluted share. The Company’s results are anticipated to be weighted towards the second half of 2018 due to the seasonality of the business.\nFourth Quarter Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 2:00 PM Pacific Time on Tuesday, February 27, 2018, to discuss the fourth quarter and full year results.
