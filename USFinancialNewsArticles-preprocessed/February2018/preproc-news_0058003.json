The results of Shagrir until that date are included in Pointer's results as discontinued operation.\nManagement Comment\nDavid Mahlab, Pointer's Chief Executive Officer , commented: \"We are very proud with our Q4 and full year 2017 results, built on our ability to execute our strategy successfully. To reiterate, our overall strategic goals are to (i) continue to develop cutting edge technologies to provide actionable business intelligence with strong ROI to our Fleet Management, Mobile Asset Management and Internet of Vehicles customers, (ii) pursue selective M&A opportunities to expand our market share and capabilities, and (iii) continue to grow revenues organically while improving our profitability margins. Our record full year financial results reflect successful execution on this strategy, and demonstrate strong revenue growth and profitability, improved margins and cash generation.\n\"The integration of Cielo in Brazil progresses according to plan and we look forward to the increasing its contribution to our results in 2018. We have also successfully completed the integration of our recent acquisition in South Africa and are already starting to enjoy the synergies from this acquisition. Our investments in technology as well as in sales and marketing are enabling us to maintain our growth and momentum in the market.\"\nMr. Mahlab continued , \"During 2017, our technology was instrumental in winning new customers, increasing our revenues from recurring services and broadening our customer base for fleet management solutions and mobile asset tracking.\n\"During the year, we announced several wins, including two for connected car projects, one with Nissan India and the other with Peugeot-Citroen's importer in Israel, Lubinski. The successful integration of Cielo's technology enabled us to win an important contract in Brazil, with Fibria. Our mobile asset management technology, Cellocator's Nano CelloTrack, lead to a key win in North America. Earlier in the year, we announced that Femsa chose our most advanced fleet management solution which was successfully implemented during 2017. Looking ahead, we are confident of our ability to continue growing our business successfully for the foreseeable future.\"\nFinancial Summary for the Full Year of 2017\nRevenues for 2017 were $78.2 million compared to $64.4 million in 2016, an increase of 21%.

On the call, management will review and discuss the results. To listen to the call, please dial in to one of the following teleconferencing numbers. Please begin placing your call a few minutes before the conference call commences.\nDial in numbers are as follows:\nFrom the USA +1-888-281-1167; From Israel 03-918-0685; From the UK 0-800-917-5108\nA replay will be available a few hours following the call on the company's website.\nReconciliation between results on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis\nReconciliation between results on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis is provided in a table immediately following the Condensed Interim Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPointer uses EBITDA and Non-GAAP operating income and net income as Non-GAAP financial performance measurements.\nPointer calculates EBITDA by adding back to net income financial expenses, taxes and depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.\nPointer calculates Non-GAAP operating income by adding back to operating income the effects of non-cash stock based compensation expenses, amortization of long lived assets, other expenses of retirement costs and losses and acquisition related one-time costs.\nPointer calculates Non-GAAP net income by adding back to net income the effects of non-cash stock based compensation expenses, amortization of long lived assets, non-cash tax expenses, other expenses of retirement costs, spin-off related expenses and losses and acquisition related one-time costs.\nThe purpose of such adjustments is to give an indication of the Company's performance exclusive of Non-GAAP charges that are considered by management to be outside of the Company's core operating results.\nEBITDA and non-GAAP operating and net income are provided to investors to complement results provided in accordance with GAAP, as management believes the measure helps illustrate underlying operating trends in the Company's business and uses the measure to establish internal budgets and goals, manage the business and evaluate performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures help investors to understand the Company's current and future operating cash flow and performance, especially as the Company's acquisitions have resulted in amortization and non-cash items that have had a material impact on the Company's GAAP profits. EBITDA and non GAAP operating and net income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nAbout Pointer Telocation\nFor over 20 years, Pointer has rewritten the rules for the Mobile Resource Management (MRM) market and is a pioneer in the Connected Car segment.
