    "text": "OAKLAND, Calif., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community Bank of the Bay (CBYAA), a San Francisco Bay Area commercial bank with full service offices in Oakland and Danville, and two business offices in the Silicon Valley, reported unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nNet income for the quarter ending December 31, 2017 totaled $48 thousand, compared to $565 thousand in the prior quarter, and $357 thousand in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per common share were effectively nil in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a one-time deferred tax asset write down.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Net Income included a $455 thousand write down of a deferred tax asset due to recently enacted Federal Corporate Tax Reform. Excluding this write down Net Income would have been $502 thousand, or $0.07 per common share compared with $0.08 in the prior quarter when the Bank benefited from a $227 thousand Bank Enterprise Award.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $295 million, an increase of $46.3 million, or 18.6 percent, from a year ago. Average earning assets for the quarter reached $285 million, an increase of $39.6 million, or 16.2 percent, compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nDeposits totaled $257 million at December 31, 2017 and were up $33.7 million, or 15.1 percent, from a year ago. The growth was concentrated in non-interest bearing demand accounts, which increased 32.2% from a year ago.\nLoans totaled $238 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $22.0 million, or 10.2 percent, from the prior quarter, and were higher by $52.0 million, or 27.8 percent, compared to the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2017 growth included $6.6 million in net commercial loan originations and $5.0 million in single family mortgage acquisitions.\nNon-performing assets remained unchanged during the fourth quarter and totaled $1.4 million at December 31, 2017, representing 0.5 percent of total loans. The allowance for loan losses represents 1.46 percent of total loans at quarter end.\nNet interest margin for the fourth quarter totaled 3.96 percent compared with 3.98 percent for the prior quarter and 4.12 percent in the same quarter a year ago. The decline from the same quarter a year ago is primarily due to a shift in the mix from higher-yielding loans to lower-yielding cash and equivalents.\nTotal equity as of December 31, 2017 of $37.7 million increased by $94 thousand, or 0.2 percent, from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting fourth-quarter earnings including one time deferred tax asset write down. The increase in equity of $12.8 million from a year ago primarily relates to the first-quarter 2017 issuance of 2,285,715 common shares totaling $12 million. The Bank’s capital levels remain well above FDIC “Well Capitalized” standards as of December 31, 2017, with a total capital ratio of 16.75 percent, a tier 1 capital ratio of 15.50 percent, and a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 13.82 percent.\nBook value per common share totaled $5.07 as of December 31, 2017, up from $4.79 at December 31, 2016, mainly reflecting earnings.\n“We are pleased with the year’s growth and deployment of the new capital. Loans increased $52 million during the year and we are starting 2018 with outstanding loans $34 million above their 2017 average. This higher level of earning assets combined with lower corporate tax rates, and possibly higher interest rates should drive revenue increases in 2018,” said William S. Keller, President, and Chief Executive Officer. “After raising capital we set out to not only grow earnings capacity, but also to invest in our personnel and infrastructure without severely pressuring income. If not for the one-time effect of the deferred tax asset adjustment we accomplished that. Among a number of quality additions, we are pleased to announce that Mr. John Barr has returned as our full-time Chief Credit Officer and Mr. Mukhtar Ali has joined the bank as Chief Operating Officer. Both executives are respected professionals who are well known in our community and will help position us to take maximum advantage of the continued growth in our markets.”\nAbout Community Bank of the Bay\nCommunity Bank of the Bay (OTCBB:CBYAA) serves the financial needs of closely held businesses and professional service firms, as well as their owner-operators and non-profit organizations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.
