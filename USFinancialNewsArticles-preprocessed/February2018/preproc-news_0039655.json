    "text": " 59 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago BOJ's Kuroda warns against premature plan of stimulus exit Reuters Staff 1   Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Friday the central bank should not prematurely announce plans for withdrawing its massive monetary stimulus as doing so could confuse markets. “When the time for an exit (from the ultra-easy policy) comes, the BOJ will communicate its intentions appropriately to ensure it doesn’t cause turbulence in markets,” Kuroda told parliament.
