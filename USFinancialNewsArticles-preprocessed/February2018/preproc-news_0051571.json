    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday he was hopeful that the United Nations Security Council would call for a ceasefire in Syria.\nMacron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to Russiaâ€™s President Vladimir Putin -- whose military intervention in Syria gave President Bashar al-Assad the upper hand in the seven-year-old conflict -- to stop bombardments of the rebel-held pocket of eastern Ghouta.\nMacron added that he would continue his efforts to mediate if a ceasefire proved to be impossible.\nReporting by Jean-Baptiste Vey, writing by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ",
