    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DPA Communications has made a move to the west coast, opening up a new office in Los Angeles' Melrose District. The L.A. opening marks the second office for DPA, and is led by Anthony Mastracci as Account Director.\nAnthony Mastracci, a Boston native, serves as Account Director for DPA, and has worked in social media, content management, content creation, video production, marketing and journalism over the last five years in various industries. He has been published by the Boston Globe, Boston.com , Lowell Sun and has produced video content for Boston Burger Co., Hormel Foods, and Papa John's, among others. Prior to DPA, he worked as the Branding and Content Specialist for Social Media Relations in Los Angeles, advising L.A.-based brands like C'est La Vie Couture, The JYIM, and Sofi Essentials on their digital and social presence.\n\"As we approach our six-year anniversary at DPA, we realize now more than ever that a bi-coastal presence is invaluable to so many of the brands we currently work with and those that we would like to work with in the near future,\" said Dominic Amenta, founder and principal at DPA Communications. \"To make a new L.A. presence successful, we knew it was imperative to find the right person with the right combination of PR and social media influencer relations know-how, the innate ability to network within the right circles for our skillset and had to be a good cultural fit with our group. Hands down, Anthony is our guy!\"\nMastracci also runs and curates a successful menswear and lifestyle blog, The Next Gentleman , which he began in Boston in 2015. He has worked on national and regional influencer campaigns with brands like Daniel Wellington, Jack Wills, and Members Only, and has hosted menswear styling events in Boston for Indochino, J Crew and Banana Republic. Mastracci graduated from Emerson College (Boston) with a B.S. in Journalism and lives in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking for his friends and skateboarding on the flat, \"sans-pothole\" streets of L.A.\n\"About a year ago, I took a vacation to Los Angeles to get away from the harsh Boston winter. Less than 24 hours into my trip, I got an emphatic feeling in my gut that there was something really special here for me,\" Mastracci said. \"I was amazed to find out that special something was to bring DPA to Los Angeles, especially after having so much success working with the team there when I was on the influencer side of the business.\"\nAbout DPA Communications\nDPA Communications – launched in March 2012 and headquartered in Boston – is a full-service public relations and marketing firm.
