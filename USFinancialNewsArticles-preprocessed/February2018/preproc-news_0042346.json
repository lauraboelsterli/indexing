    "text": "AUDUBON, Pa., Feb. 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Globus Medical, Inc. (NYSE:GMED), a leading musculoskeletal solutions company, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter:\nWorldwide sales increased 16.1% as reported to $176.0 million Fourth quarter net income was $24.4 million, or 13.8% of sales, including a one-time tax reform expense of $11.0 million Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.25 Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $0.38 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 34.9% of sales\nFull Year 2017:\nWorldwide sales increased 12.8% as reported to $636.0 million Net income for the year was $107.3 million, or 16.9% of sales, including a one-time tax reform expense of $11.0 million Diluted EPS were $1.10 Non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.31 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 35.6% of sales\n“Fourth quarter sales were a record $176.0 million, a year-over-year increase of 16.1%,\" said Dave Demski, CEO. \"We also delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, despite increased investments to support our robotics and trauma launches. Sales growth was strong across all parts of the business in the fourth quarter, with U.S. spine up 6.5%, international spine up 16.2% and Imaging, Navigation and Robotics posting revenue for the first time.”\n\"Full year 2017 sales were $636.0 million, a 12.8% increase over 2016 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.31. In 2017, we not only recorded our first sales of the ExcelsiusGPS™ robotic and navigation system, we also launched 9 new products in spine, received FDA clearance for 10 systems in trauma, further expanded our in-house manufacturing capacity, recruited a record number of competitive sales reps into our U.S. spine sales force, made tremendous progress on the Alphatec International integration, and smoothly completed the CEO transition.\"\nFourth quarter sales in the U.S. increased 16.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of mid-single digit core spine growth plus a successful robotic launch. International sales increased by 16.2% over the fourth quarter of 2016 on an as reported basis.\nFourth quarter GAAP net income was $24.4 million, flat compared to the same period last year including a one-time tax reform expense of $11.0 million. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.25, also flat compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.38 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20.6%, compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe company generated operating cash flow of $44.8 million and non-GAAP free cash flow of $31.4 2017. Full year 2017 operating cash flow was $159.5 million and non-GAAP free cash flow was $107.8 million. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $429.8 million. The company remains debt free.\n2018 Annual Guidance\nThe company confirms 2018 full year sales of $690 million and non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share of $1.50.\nConference Call Information\nGlobus Medical will hold a teleconference to discuss its 2017 fourth quarter and full year results with the investment community at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today.

Additional information can be accessed at www.globusmedical.com .\nTo supplement our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. For example, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which represents net income before interest income, net and other non-operating expenses, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, provisions for litigation, technology in-licensing fee, and acquisition related costs, is useful as an additional measure of operating performance, and particularly as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period, as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance, and it removes the effect of our capital structure, asset base, income taxes and interest income and expense. Our management also uses non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Provision for litigation represents costs incurred for litigation settlements or unfavorable verdicts when the loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or in the case of a favorable settlement, when income is realized. Acquisition related costs/licensing represents the change in fair value of business acquisition related contingent consideration; costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses including but not limited to costs to exit or convert contractual obligations, severance, and information system conversion; and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process such as banker fees, legal fees, and other acquisition related professional fees, as well as one time licensing fees.\nIn addition, for the period ended December 31, 2017 and for other comparative periods, we are presenting non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which represents net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the provision for litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustment and the tax effects of such adjustments. Prior period adjustments represent the cumulative impact of prior year adjustments related to depreciation, scrap and provision for excess and obsolete inventory, none of which were individually material to the related year's financial position or results of operations. We believe these non-GAAP measures are also useful indicators of our operating performance, and particularly as additional measures of comparative operating performance from period to period as they remove the effects of litigation, amortization of intangibles, acquisition related costs/licensing, prior period adjustments and the tax effects of such adjustments, which we believe are not reflective of underlying business trends. Additionally, for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and for other comparative periods, we also define the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow as the net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the impact of restricted cash, less the cash impact of purchases of property and equipment. We believe that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating our overall financial performance for comparative periods as it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations and fund acquisitions. Furthermore, the non-GAAP measure of constant currency sales growth is calculated by translating current year sales at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior year period. We believe constant currency sales growth provides insight to the comparative increase or decrease in period sales, in dollar and percentage terms, excluding the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and constant currency sales growth are not calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures do not include certain expenses that may be necessary to evaluate our liquidity or operating results. Our definitions of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and constant currency sales growth may differ from that of other companies and therefore may not be comparable. Additionally, we have recast prior periods for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nSafe Harbor Statements\nAll statements included in this press release other than statements of historical fact are and may be identified by their use of words such as “believe,” “may,” “might,” “could,” “will,” “aim,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan” and other similar terms.
