    "text": "Quarterly sales for the Company of $306.4 million\nGAAP Gross margin of 30.2% up 490 basis points versus same quarter last year\nGAAP EPS of $0.32 per diluted share and Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS of $0.52 per diluted share\nGREENVILLE, S.C., KEMET Corporation (\"KEMET\" or the “Company”) (NYSE:KEM), a leading global supplier of passive electronic components, today reported preliminary results for our third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet sales of $306.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased $4.9 million, or 1.6%, from net sales of $301.5 million for the prior quarter ended September 30, 2017. Net sales increased $43.1 million, or 16.4%, up from proforma net sales (including the TOKIN acquisition) of $263.3 million at December 31, 2016.\nU.S. GAAP net income was $18.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to U.S. GAAP net income of $12.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported a U.S. GAAP net income of $12.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share. The company completed its acquisition of TOKIN on April 19, 2017, and as such, TOKIN’s results are included in our results for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. However, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 our results only included our 34% equity investment in TOKIN.\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income was $30.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to non-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income of $26.5 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported non-U.S. GAAP adjusted net income of $5.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share.\n“What a difference a year makes. The December quarter ended much stronger than we had predicted as customers continued to request product after the Christmas holiday. Sales compared to one year ago on a proforma basis were up 16.4% in a market that continues to be vibrant,” stated Per Loof, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe we have a digital platform in place that will help us manage the growth in the market and we are employing additional capital as quickly as possible to provide needed additional capacity beginning later this summer which will generate further revenue in the back half of our next fiscal year,” continued Loof.\nGAAP net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 included TOKIN acquisition gains totaling $135.6 million and equity method investment income of $75.4 million, primarily related to KEMET's thirty-four percent interest in TOKIN's gain on the sale of its electro-mechanical devices (“EMD”) business. In the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company increased the gain on acquisition by $1.3 million. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company increased the gain on acquisition by $0.3 million. The Company continues to evaluate the calculation of acquisition related gains and, as such, these preliminary numbers may change in the future.\nNet income (loss) for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include various items affecting comparability as denoted in the U.S. GAAP to Non-U.S. GAAP reconciliation table included hereafter.\nAbout KEMET\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “KEM” (NYSE:KEM).

Management believes that investors may find it useful to review the Company’s financial results as adjusted to exclude items as determined by management as further described below.\nAdjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted gross margin represents net sales less cost of sales excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. Management uses adjusted gross margin to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. The Company believes that adjusted gross margin is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company. Adjusted gross margin should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table provides reconciliation from U.S. GAAP Gross margin to Non-U.S. GAAP adjusted gross margin (amounts in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarters Ended (Unaudited) December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (1) Net sales $ 306,408 $ 301,471 $ 188,029 Cost of sales 213,947 216,395 140,551 Gross margin (U.S. GAAP) 92,461 85,076 47,478 Gross margin as a % of net sales 30.2 % 28.2 % 25.3 % Non-U.S. GAAP adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 402 342 308 Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) $ 92,863 $ 85,418 $ 47,786 Adjusted gross margin as a % of net sales (non-GAAP) 30.3 % 28.3 % 25.4 %\n(1) Quarter ended December 31, 2016 adjusted due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\nAdjusted operating income (loss) represents operating income (loss), excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. Management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to facilitate our analysis and understanding of our business operations by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided earlier in this presentation which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. The Company believes that adjusted operating income (loss) is useful to investors to provide a supplemental way to understand our underlying operating performance and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. Adjusted operating income (loss) should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is calculated as follows (amounts in thousands):\nQuarters Ended (Unaudited) December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (1) Operating income (loss) (U.S. GAAP) $ 32,077 $ 31,643 $ 14,182 Adjustments: ERP integration/IT transition costs — — 1,734 Stock-based compensation expense 2,206 1,530 1,139 Restructuring charges 3,530 1,393 (369 ) Legal expenses/fines related to antitrust class actions 1,482 2,375 293 TOKIN investment-related expenses — — 204 (Gain) loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets (902 ) (39 ) 132 Adjusted operating income (loss) (non-GAAP) $ 38,393 $ 36,902 $ 17,315\n(1) Quarter ended December 31, 2016 adjusted due to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n“Adjusted net income (loss)” and “Adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share” represent net income (loss) and net income (loss) per basic and diluted share excluding adjustments which are outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided below. The Company believes that these Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and allows investors to monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. Management uses these Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance by excluding the items outlined in the quantitative reconciliation provided earlier in this presentation which might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table provides reconciliation from U.S. GAAP net income (loss) to Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted net income (loss) (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nQuarters Ended (Unaudited) December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 U.S. GAAP Net sales $ 306,408 $ 301,471 $ 188,029 Net income (loss) $ 18,641 $ 12,849 $ 12,278 Net income (loss) per basic share $ 0.33 $ 0.26 $ 0.26 Net income (loss) per diluted share $ 0.32 $ 0.22 $ 0.22 Non-U.S. GAAP Net income (loss) $ 18,641 $ 12,849 $ 12,278 Adjustments: Net foreign exchange (gain) loss 2,239 1,891 (2,621 ) ERP integration/IT transition costs — — 1,734 Stock-based compensation expense 2,206 1,530 1,139 Restructuring charges 3,530 1,393 (369 ) Legal expenses/fines related to antitrust class actions 4,073 10,327 293 TOKIN investment-related expenses — — 204 Amortization included in interest expense 696 664 183 Acquisition gains (310 ) (1,285 ) — Equity (income) loss from equity method investments (238 ) (224 ) 133 (Gain) loss on write down and disposal of long-lived assets (902 ) (39 ) 132 Change in value of TOKIN option — — (6,900 ) Income tax effect of non-U.S. GAAP adjustments (1) 667 (631 ) (396 ) Adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) $ 30,602 $ 26,475 $ 5,810 Adjusted net income (loss) per basic share (non-GAAP) $ 0.54 $ 0.53 $ 0.12 Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share (non-GAAP) $ 0.52 $ 0.45 $ 0.11 Weighted average shares outstanding: Weighted average shares-basic 56,778 49,819 46,606 Weighted average shares-diluted 58,937 58,409 55,296",
