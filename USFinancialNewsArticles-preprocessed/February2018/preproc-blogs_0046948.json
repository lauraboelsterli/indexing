    "text": "2 COMMENTS Volatility returns to stocks Bond yields continue to climb European banks slide U.S. stocks pulled back Tuesday, relinquishing some of last week’s big gains as shares of major retailers suffered.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74 points, or 0.3%, to 25141 shortly after the opening bell, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite was down less than 0.1%.\nWalmart was one of the worst-performing stocks in early trading, as shares shed more 7% after it reported slowing online sales growth , indicating its difficulty in fending off competition from Amazon.com.\nShares of Gap also struggled, falling 5.9%. The retailer said Tuesday it will replace the president and chief executive of its flagship Gap brand as it looks to boost sales.\nOther retailers were all trading lower in the wake of the early-morning moves, including Target, Macy’s and Kohl’s.\nDespite the early resistance Tuesday, stocks have recovered most of the value shed earlier this month. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 climbed more than 4% last week, giving the indexes their biggest weekly climbs since 2013 and 2016, respectively.\nThat had helped the Dow recover roughly half of its more than 10% decline from its January peak. Still, investors are reacquainting themselves with a market force that was absent for much of last year: volatility.\n“What we’re currently seeing is a regime shift and the pain of [monetary policy] normalization which does bring some volatility,” said Christian Keller, head of economics research at Barclays. “Overall, we’re facing a new situation: central banks, like the [Federal Reserve], are tightening more confidently or preparing to do so, in the case of the [European Central Bank]. That’s a different theme to what we’ve seen over the past few years.”\nHSBC shares fell after the bank’s results undershot analysts’ expectations.

Bond yields move inversely to prices.\nThat bond market optimism was noteworthy after a tumultuous few weeks for stock markets, in a signal that fears about inflation, rather than growth, have underpinned the recent turbulence .\nRising inflation in the U.S. and Europe has prompted investors to second-guess central bank guidance amid speculation that those institutions will end the accommodative policies, which have supported equity markets in recent years, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investments.\nRecent signals from the ECB—among other central banks—have combined with jitters about rising U.S. inflation to “generate fears that the Fed is falling behind the curve,” said Lefteris Farmakis, a macro-strategist at UBS.\n“What you’re seeing is that everyone’s catching up with the Federal Reserve, with overall pricing on Fed rate hikes still similar to how it’s been for the past year,” Mr. Farmakis said, adding that the shift in perception has been a factor preventing the U.S. dollar from recovering from its battering over recent months.\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.3% in recent trading. Japan’s Nikkei closed 1% down, giving up some of its early-week rise thanks to the weakness of its electronics and banking sectors.\nWith Chinese and Taiwanese markets were still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hang Seng Index closed down 0.8% in its first full day of trading, while South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.1%.\n—Michael Wursthorn and Kenan Machado contributed to this article.\nWrite to David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com",
