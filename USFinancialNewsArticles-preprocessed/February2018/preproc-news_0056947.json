    "text": "Pollo Tropical Comparable Restaurant Sales Increased in December, January and Month to Date February\nCompany Initiates Share Repurchase Program\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Fiesta” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: FRGI), parent company of the Pollo Tropical® and Taco Cabana® restaurant brands, today reported results for the 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week full year 2017, which ended on December 31, 2017. The Company also announced that its board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to 1.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock.\nFiesta President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Stockinger said, “The improvement in Pollo Tropical’s sales trajectory demonstrates that key elements of our Strategic Renewal Plan are building business momentum as we enter 2018. This is especially true in our core Miami-Dade and Broward county areas where we initially focused our revitalization efforts. Pollo Tropical recorded its best quarterly comparable restaurant sales performance over the past seven quarters in the fourth quarter of 2017 while, more importantly, the brand’s comparable restaurant sales rose 2.4% in December. In January, comparable restaurant sales increased 0.6% despite the approximately 0.7% negative impact related to a fiscal calendar shift of New Year’s Day. Pollo Tropical’s January comparable restaurant sales in Florida were 0.2% lower than TDnK’s Black Box Intelligence’s fast-casual Florida benchmark, while January comparable restaurant sales in Miami-Dade and Broward county areas exceeded TDnK’s Black Box Intelligence’s fast-casual Miami-Dade and Broward county benchmarks by 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. This momentum has continued into the first three weeks in February, with Pollo Tropical comparable restaurant sales growth of 1.2%.”\nMr. Stockinger added, “Since the Taco Cabana brand re-launch will start later than that of Pollo Tropical, sales trends at Taco Cabana have remained challenged but are improving as our team works in earnest to implement operational, culinary and facility initiatives to revitalize the brand. We are focused on attracting loyal guests as well as increasing the profitability of each transaction by offering high quality menu and promotional items at reasonable prices, while eliminating deep discounting, thereby increasing our average check. Our efforts to evolve our guest base have initially resulted in transaction declines but we anticipate a gradual improvement in trends as we build guest loyalty and frequency. With the focus and leadership of a new brand President, Taco Cabana is on track for a full re-launch by mid-2018. Taco Cabana’s January comparable restaurant sales declined by 3.4%, including the approximately 0.6% negative impact related to the fiscal calendar shift of New Year’s Day and the approximately 1.6% negative impact related to reduced overnight operating hours. Taco Cabana's January comparable restaurant sales were 1.1% lower than TDnK’s Black Box Intelligence’s fast-casual Texas benchmark. Additionally, comparable restaurant sales declined 2.0% in the first three weeks in February. Improving guest metrics continue to provide us confidence of anticipated future performance improvement, similar to what we are experiencing at Pollo Tropical.”\nMr. Stockinger concluded, “We believe that as our sales improve at both brands, our deliberate focus on improving margins, while staying committed to delivering exceptional and consistent hospitality and craveable food at a great value will further bolster profitability during the year. We still have much work to do, but are optimistic that the Strategic Renewal Plan is reinvigorating our brands and will create strong value for our shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary\nSelect Fourth quarter 2017 results:\nTotal revenues decreased 5.3% from the prior year period to $162.2 million; Comparable restaurant sales at Pollo Tropical decreased 0.1%, primarily driven by a decrease in comparable restaurant transactions of 2.7%; Comparable restaurant sales at Taco Cabana decreased 7.4%, primarily driven by a decrease in comparable restaurant transactions of 12.2%; Net loss of $10.8 million or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to the prior year period net income of $2.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Adjusted net loss of $(0.1) million, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to the prior year period adjusted net income of $7.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share (see non-GAAP reconciliation table below); and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $8.9 million compared to the prior year period Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $22.2 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation table below); and Refinanced Company debt and entered into a new senior secured credit facility that provides up to $150 million of revolving credit borrowings.\nDebt Refinancing, Initial Share Repurchase Plan and Capital Allocation\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, as previously disclosed, Fiesta refinanced its debt, entering into a new senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures in November 2022 and provides up to $150 million of revolving credit borrowings.\nThe Company also announced that its board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock.\nUnder the share repurchase program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, stock price, trading volume, general market and economic conditions, and other corporate considerations. The share repurchase program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended, superseded or terminated at any time by the board of directors.\nIn 2018, anticipated capital expenditures include opening nine new Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants in Florida and seven new Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants in Texas. Up to five of the new Taco Cabana restaurants may come from converting closed Pollo Tropical restaurants. Total capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to be $60.0 million to $70.0 million, including $26.0 million to $29.0 million for the development of new restaurants.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Brand Sales Results\nPollo Tropical restaurant sales decreased 5.1% to $90.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period due primarily to a comparable restaurant sales decrease of 0.1% and 31 fewer Company-owned restaurants in operation compared to the prior year period as a result of restaurant closures. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales resulted from a 2.7% decrease in comparable restaurant transactions, partially offset by a 2.6% increase in average check. Comparable restaurant sales and transactions were negatively impacted by sales cannibalization from new restaurants on existing restaurants by approximately 0.7%. The increase in average check was primarily driven by menu price increases that positively impacted restaurant sales by 2.9%.\nTaco Cabana restaurant sales decreased 5.7% to $70.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year period due primarily to a comparable restaurant sales decrease of 7.4%. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales resulted from a 12.2% decrease in comparable restaurant transactions which were negatively impacted by the reduction in overnight operating hours, partially offset by a 4.8% increase in average check. The increase in average check was primarily driven by menu price increases that positively impacted restaurant sales by 3.2% and positive sales mix associated with higher priced promotions and lower discounts.\n2017 Change in Tax Law and 2018 Estimated Effective Tax Rate\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which includes a provision that reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, was signed into law. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the enactment of this new tax legislation required us to revalue our net deferred income tax assets at the new corporate statutory rate of 21.0% as of the enactment date, which resulted in a one-time adjustment to our deferred income taxes of $9.0 million with a corresponding non-cash increase to the provision for income taxes as a discrete item during the fourth quarter of 2017. The change in the corporate tax rate reduced the nominal value of our deferred tax assets, but it did not reduce the future tax deductions they represent.\nThe Company estimates an effective tax rate in 2018 of 23% to 25%.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nTotal revenues decreased 6.0% in 2017 to $669.1 million from $711.8 million in 2016, driven primarily by a decrease in comparable restaurant sales partially attributable to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma (the “Hurricanes”), permanent restaurant closures in the fourth quarter of 2016 and in 2017, reduced promotional discounts and our planned reduction in advertising while we implemented initiatives related to the Strategic Renewal Plan (the “Plan”).\nThe Company recognized a net loss of $(36.2) million in 2017, or $(1.35) per diluted share, compared to net income of $16.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted share in 2016, due primarily to impairment and other lease charges, the net impact of lower comparable restaurant sales and the effect of the Act. The increase in net loss is also due to higher incentive based compensation costs related to new executives and retention incentive plans and investments in enhanced food quality, hospitality and restaurant facilities associated with the Plan, partially offset by the impact of closing unprofitable restaurants and lower pre-opening costs.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA decreased $29.1 million in 2017 to $67.4 million compared to $96.6 million in 2016 (see non-GAAP reconciliation table below).\nHurricanes\nWe estimate the Hurricanes negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA and income (loss) from operations by approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million for Pollo Tropical, net of $0.7 million in estimated insurance recoveries, and approximately $0.5 million to $1.5 million for Taco Cabana, net of $0.2 million in estimated insurance recoveries, and negatively impacted comparable restaurant sales and transactions by approximately 1.0% to 2.0% for Pollo Tropical and approximately 0.5% to 1.0% for Taco Cabana for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. We will record additional expected insurance proceeds related to hurricane affected restaurants in future periods when additional information is available or, for business interruption coverage for lost profit, at the time of final settlement.\nRestaurant Portfolio\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Fiesta opened one Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurant in Florida. The Company closed four Company-owned underperforming Pollo Tropical restaurants in the Atlanta metropolitan area, completing its restaurant portfolio analysis as part of the Plan. The Company also closed two Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants including one location in the Houston metropolitan area that did not reopen after it closed due to Hurricane Harvey and one restaurant that was nearing lease expiration.\nAs there were 146 Company-owned Pollo Tropical restaurants, 166 Company-owned Taco Cabana restaurants, 31 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in the U.S., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Guyana, Panama and Venezuela and seven franchised Taco Cabana restaurants in the U.S.\nInvestor Conference Call Today\nFiesta will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 201-689-8562.

Prior to the second quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges, stock-based compensation expense, and other expense (income), net. In 2017, our board of directors appointed a new Chief Executive Officer who initiated the Plan and uses an Adjusted EBITDA measure for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources to segments. The new Adjusted EBITDA measure used by the chief operating decision maker includes adjustments for significant items that management believes are related to strategic changes and/or are not related to the ongoing operation of our restaurants. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, the primary measure of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources is Adjusted EBITDA, which is now defined as earnings attributable to the applicable operating segments before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges, stock-based compensation expense, other expense (income), net, and certain significant items for each segment that are related to strategic changes and/or are not related to the ongoing operation of our restaurants as set forth in the reconciliation table below. Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses associated with administrative support for executive management, information systems and certain finance, legal, supply chain, human resources, construction and other administrative functions. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding franchise royalty revenues and fees, pre-opening costs and general and administrative expenses (including corporate-level general and administrative expenses).\nAdjusted EBITDA for each of our segments is the primary measure of segment profit or loss used by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. In addition, management believes that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results of operations calculated in accordance with GAAP and our reconciliation of net income (loss) to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA (i) provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period changes, (ii) provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our business, and (iii) permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, such measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies.\nThree Months Ended Pollo Tropical Taco Cabana Other Consolidated December 31, 2017: Net income (loss) $

indicated\n(In thousands of dollars, except per share amounts):\nAdjusted net income and related adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before a one-time income tax provision adjustment due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"), impairment and other lease charges, other expense (income), net, unused pre-production costs in advertising expense, terminated capital project costs, board and shareholder matter costs, write-off of site development costs, Plan restructuring costs and retention bonuses, office restructuring and relocation costs, certain legal settlements and related costs and other significant items that are related to strategic changes and/or are not related to the ongoing operation of our restaurants. Management believes that adjusted net income and related adjusted earnings per diluted share, when viewed with our results of operations calculated in accordance with GAAP (i) provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period growth, (ii) provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our business, and (iii) permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, such measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly should not be considered as alternatives to net income or net income per share as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies.\n(unaudited) Three months ended December 31, 2017 January 1, 2017 Income\n(Loss)\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nProvision\nFor\nIncome\nTaxes (a)\nNet\nIncome\n(Loss)\nDiluted\nEPS\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nProvision\nFor\nIncome\nTaxes (a)\nNet\nIncome\nDiluted\nEPS\nReported - GAAP $ (4,269 ) $ 6,486 $ (10,755 ) $ (0.40 ) $ 2,703 $ 271 $ 2,432 $ 0.09 Adjustments: Non-general and administrative expense adjustments: Income tax due to federal rate change (a) — (8,952 ) 8,952 0.33 Impairment and other lease charges (b) 2,679 1,015 1,664 0.06 7,037 2,656 4,381 0.16 Other expense (income), net (c) 420 159 261 0.01 110 42 68 — Total Non-general and administrative expense 3,099 (7,778 ) 10,877 0.40 7,147 2,698 4,449 0.17 General and administrative expense adjustments: Board and shareholder matter costs (f) (699 ) (265 ) (434 ) (0.02 ) 550 208 342 0.01 Write-off of site development costs (g) 49 19 30 — 381 144 237 0.01 Plan restructuring costs and retention bonuses (h) 319 121 198 0.01 86 32 54 — Legal settlements and related costs (j) — — — — (149 ) (56 ) (93 ) — Total General and administrative expense (331 ) (125 ) (206 ) (0.01 ) 868 328 540 0.02 Adjusted - Non-GAAP $ (1,501 ) $ (1,417 ) $ (84 ) $ — $ 10,718 $ 3,297 $ 7,421 $ 0.28 (unaudited) Twelve months ended December 31, 2017 January 1, 2017 Income\n(Loss)\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nBenefit\nFrom\nIncome\nTaxes (a)\nNet\nIncome\n(Loss)\nDiluted\nEPS\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nProvision\nFor\nIncome\nTaxes (a)\nNet\nIncome\nDiluted\nEPS\nReported - GAAP $ (43,987 ) $ (7,755 ) $ (36,232 ) $ (1.35 ) $ 25,048 $ 8,336 $ 16,712 $ 0.62 Adjustments: Non-general and administrative expense adjustments: Income tax due to federal rate change (a) — (8,952 ) 8,952 0.33 Impairment and other lease charges (b) 61,760 23,407 38,353 1.42 25,644 9,681 15,963 0.59 Other expense (income), net (c) 1,679 636 1,043 0.04 (128 ) (48 ) (80 ) — Unused pre-production costs in advertising\nexpense (d) 410 155 255 0.01 — — — — Total Non-general and administrative expense 63,849 15,246 48,603 1.80 25,516 9,633 15,883 0.59 General and administrative expense adjustments: Terminated capital project (e) 849 322 527 0.02 — — — — Board and shareholder matter costs (f) 3,049 1,156 1,893 0.07 1,580 596 984 0.04 Write-off of site development costs (g) 511 194 317 0.01 1,258 475 783 0.03 Plan restructuring costs and retention bonuses (h) 2,420 917 1,503 0.06 86 32 54 — Office restructuring and relocation costs (i) (152 ) (58 ) (94 ) — 539 203 336 0.01 Legal settlements and related costs (j) (473 ) (179 ) (294 ) (0.01 ) 310 117 193 0.01 Total General and administrative expense 6,204 2,352 3,852 0.14 3,773 1,423 2,350 0.09 Adjusted - Non-GAAP $ 26,066 $ 9,843 $ 16,223 $ 0.60 $ 54,337 $ 19,392 $ 34,945 $ 1.30 (a) The provision (benefit) for income taxes related to the adjustments was calculated using the Company's combined federal statutory and estimated state rate of 37.9% and 37.8% for the periods ending December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively. On December 22, 2017, the Act, which includes a provision that reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, was signed into law. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the enactment of this new tax legislation required us to revalue our net deferred income tax assets at the new corporate statutory rate of 21.0% as of the enactment date, which resulted in a one-time adjustment that increased our provision for income taxes of $9.0 million as a discrete item during the fourth quarter of 2017. For fiscal years subsequent to 2017, our federal statutory tax rate will be 21%. (b) Impairment and other lease charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily include additional impairment charges related to previously impaired restaurants, an impairment charge for an office location that was closed in December 2017, and other lease charges, net of recoveries, related primarily to two Taco Cabana restaurants and an office location that were closed during the fourth quarter of 2017. Impairment and other lease charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily include impairment charges for 40 Pollo Tropical restaurants closed in 2017 (seven of which were initially impaired in 2016), impairment charges for six Taco Cabana restaurants closed in 2017 (four of which were initially impaired in 2016), impairment charges with respect to two Pollo Tropical restaurants and five Taco Cabana restaurants that the Company continues to operate, impairment charges with respect to an office location that was closed in December 2017, and other lease charges, net of recoveries, related to restaurants and an office location closed in 2017 as well as previously closed restaurants. Impairment and other lease charges for the three and twelve months ended January 1, 2017 primarily include impairment charges for one Pollo Tropical restaurant, which was subsequently closed in 2017, and six Taco Cabana restaurants, three of which were subsequently closed in 2017, plus additional impairment charges related to previously impaired Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana locations as well as lease charges related to the closure of 10 Pollo Tropical restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2016. Impairment and other lease charges for the twelve months ended January 1, 2017 also include impairment charges related to 16 Pollo Tropical restaurants that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and second quarter of 2017 and one Taco Cabana restaurant, which was subsequently closed in 2017. (c) Other expense (income), net for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily includes costs for the removal of signs and equipment and equipment transfers and storage related to the closure of restaurants, severance for closed restaurant employees and food donated to charitable organizations, partially offset by additional proceeds received related to two Taco Cabana locations as a result of eminent domain proceedings and additional expected insurance proceeds related to a Taco Cabana restaurant that was temporarily closed due to a fire. Other expense (income), net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 also includes estimated insurance recoveries related to a Taco Cabana restaurant closed due to Hurricane Harvey damage, and expected business interruption insurance proceeds related to a Taco Cabana restaurant that was temporarily closed due to a fire. Other expense (income), net for the three and twelve months ended January 1, 2017, includes costs for the removal of signs and equipment related to the closure of 10 Pollo Tropical restaurants in the fourth quarter of 2016, and for the twelve months ended January 1, 2017, includes additional proceeds related to a location that closed in 2015 as a result of an eminent domain proceeding. (d) Unused pre-production costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, include costs for advertising pre-production that will not be used. (e) Terminated capital project costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, include costs related to the write-off of a capital project that was terminated in the first quarter. (f) Board and shareholder matter costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, include fees and related insurance recoveries related to shareholder activism and CEO and board member searches. Board and shareholder matter costs for the three and twelve months ended January 1, 2017, primarily include fees related to shareholder activism and the previously proposed and terminated separation transaction. (g) Write-off of site development costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, includes the write-off of site costs related to locations that we decided not to develop. (h) Plan restructuring costs and retention bonuses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, include severance related to the Plan and reduction in force and bonuses paid to certain employees for retention purposes. (i) Office restructuring and relocation costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, include severance and relocation adjustments and costs associated with the prior-year restructuring of Pollo Tropical brand and corporate offices. (j) Legal settlements and related costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and three and twelve months ended January 1, 2017, include costs and benefits related to litigation matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006360/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nFiesta Restaurant Group, Inc.\nRaphael Gross, 203-682-8253\ninvestors@frgi.com\nSource: Fiesta Restaurant Group, Inc.",
