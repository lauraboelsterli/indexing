The 23-year-old defender was arrested on Tuesday for alleged involvement with others in holding a man who they threatened with a gun, according to media reports. Semedo’s agent Catio Balde told Portuguese television network TSF on Wednesday that his client had been tricked. On Thursday a judge ordered that Semedo be held in custody without bail for charges also including robbery and illegal possession of weapons. Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Hugh Lawson",
