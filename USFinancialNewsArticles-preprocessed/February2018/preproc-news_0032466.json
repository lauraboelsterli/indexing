    "text": "MEXICO CITY, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Petróleos Mexicanos (\"PEMEX\") announces the early tender results for (a) its offers to purchase for cash (i) any and all of its outstanding series of notes listed below under the heading \"Any and All Offers\" (collectively, the \"Any and All Notes\", and such offers, the \"Any and All Offers\") and (ii) the series of notes set forth in the table below under the heading \"Waterfall Tender Offers\" (collectively, the \"Waterfall Notes\", and such offers, the \"Waterfall Tender Offers) for a specified maximum aggregate purchase price payable per series of Waterfall Notes, and (b) its concurrent solicitation of consents (the \"Consent Solicitation\") from holders of each series of Any and All Notes to a proposed amendment to the indenture governing the Any and All Notes (the \"Indenture\"). The Any and All Offers and the Waterfall Tender Offers are collectively referred to as the \"Tender Offers.\"\nThe Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation are being made pursuant to the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement dated February 1, 2018 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the \"Statement\"), and the related consent and letter of transmittal dated February 1, 2018, which set forth in more detail the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.\nAny and All Offers\nThe following table summarizes the early tender results for the Any and All Offers as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 14, 2018 (the \"Early Tender Date\") and the principal amount of each series of Any and All Notes that PEMEX has accepted for purchase:\nTitle of Securities\nCUSIP\nISIN\nPrincipal Amount Outstanding\nTotal\nConsideration (1)\nPrincipal Amount Tendered\nPrincipal Amount Accepted for Purchase\n3.125% Notes\ndue 2019\n71654QBQ4\n71656MAW9\nUS71654QBQ47\nUS71656MAW91\nU.S.$327,409,000\nU.S.$1,009.64\nU.S.$138,498,000\nU.S.$138,498,000\n5.500% Notes due 2019\n71654QBZ4\n71656M BH1\nUS71654QBZ46\nUS71656MBH16\nU.S.$750,000,000\nU.S.$ 1,029.64\nU.S.$557,359,000\nU.S.$557,359,000\n(1) Per U.S.$1,000. The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium equal to U.S.$30.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for each series of Any and All Notes accepted for purchase.\nPEMEX announces that it has waived the Any and All Condition as it applies to the Any and All Offer for its 3.125% Notes due 2019 (the \"3.125% Notes\"), which condition required that holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of 3.125% Notes provide consents to amend the indenture governing the 3.125% Notes to shorten the minimum notice period for the optional redemption of the 3.125% Notes to not less than three business days and no more than 10 days prior to the redemption date. As a result, PEMEX accepts for purchase all of the U.S.$138,498,000 principal amount of its 3.125% Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date. Because holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of 3.125% Notes did not provide consents at or prior to the Early Tender Date, the indenture governing the 3.125% Notes will not be amended to reflect the above amendment, unless holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of 3.125% Notes provide consents at or prior to the expiration date of the Any and All Offers. Except as described herein, the terms of the Any and All Offers remain unchanged.\nAs a result of PEMEX's acceptance for purchase of all U.S.$557,359,000 principal amount of its 5.500% Notes due 2019 (the \"5.500% Notes\") tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date, holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of 5.500% Notes have provided consents to (i) amend the indenture governing the 5.500% Notes (the \"Indenture\") to shorten the minimum notice period for the optional redemption of the 5.500% Notes to not less than three business days and no more than 10 days prior to the redemption date (the \"Amendment\"), and (ii) to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in order to effect the Amendment.\nThe early settlement date on which (i) PEMEX will make the payment for the Any and All Notes accepted in the Any and All Offers, and (ii) PEMEX and the trustee under the Indenture (the \"Trustee\") will execute the supplemental indenture to the Indenture in order to effect the Amendment, is expected to be February 16, 2018 (the \"Early Settlement Date\").\nHolders of Any and All Notes that validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date and whose Any and All Notes have been accepted for purchase are entitled to receive the total consideration set forth in the table above, which includes, in each case, an early tender premium equal to U.S.$30.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Any and All Notes accepted for purchase, and to receive accrued and unpaid interest on their accepted Any and All Notes from the last interest payment date to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date. The total cash payment to purchase the accepted Any and All Notes will be approximately U.S.$715 million, including accrued and unpaid interest. Any and all Notes that have been validly tendered cannot be withdrawn, except as may be required by applicable law.\nThe Any and All Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 1, 2018 (the \"Expiration Date\"). Holders who tender Any and All Notes after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the Expiration Date and whose Any and All Notes are accepted for purchase will be entitled to receive only the Tender Offer Consideration of U.S.$979.64 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 3.125% Notes and U.S.$999.64 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of 5.500% Notes, and to receive accrued and unpaid interest on their accepted Any and All Notes from the last interest payment date to, but excluding, the final settlement date.\nWaterfall Tender Offers\nThe following table summarizes the early tender results for the Waterfall Tender Offers as of the Early Tender Date and the principal amount of Waterfall Notes that PEMEX has accepted for purchase, as well as the proration factor for each series of Waterfall Notes:\nTitle of Security\nCUSIP\nPrincipal Amount Outstanding\nMaximum\nSeries Cap\nTotal\nConsideration (1)\nPrincipal Amount Tendered\nPrincipal Amount Accepted for Purchase\nProration Factor\n8.000% Notes\ndue 2019\n71654QAU6\n71656MAA7\n71656LAA9\nU.S.$1,312,275,000\nU.S.$100,000,000\nU.S.$1,065.92\nU.S.$590,721,000\nU.S.$91,843,000\n15.57%\n6.000% Notes\ndue 2020\n71654QAW2\n71656LAC5\n71656MAC3\nU.S.$1,000,000,000\nU.S.$200,000,000\nU.S.$1,065.96\nU.S.$503,808,000\nU.S.$183,017,000\n36.38%\n3.500% Notes\ndue 2020\n71654QBU5\n71656LBC4\n71656MBC2\nU.S.$1,500,000,000\nU.S.$833,433,382.72 (2)\nU.S.$1,017.50\nU.S.$817,303,000\nU.S.$817,303,000\n100.00%\n(1) Per U.S.$1,000. The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium equal to U.S.$30.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for each series of Waterfall Notes accepted for purchase.\n(2) Indicates the increase of the maximum purchase price, including accrued interest, that PEMEX is offering to pay for the 3.500% Notes due 2020 validly tendered in the Waterfall Tender Offers, in order to accept for purchase all validly tendered 3.500% Notes due 2020.\nFor the 8.000% Notes due 2019 (the \"8.000% Notes\") and the 6.000% Notes due 2020 (\"6.000% Notes\"), the purchase of Waterfall Notes validly tendered would result in the payment by PEMEX of a purchase price per series, including accrued and unpaid interest, in excess of the Maximum Series Cap for such series set forth in the table above. As a result, PEMEX will pay holders of the 8.000% Notes due 2019 and 6.000% Notes due 2020 on a pro rata basis according to the pro ration procedures described in the Statement.\nPEMEX announces that it has increased the maximum series cap for the 3.500% Notes due 2020 (the \"3.500% Notes\"), which consists of the maximum aggregate purchase price, including accrued interest, that PEMEX is offering to pay for the 3.500% Notes validly tendered in the Waterfall Tender Offers, from U.S.$600 million to U.S.$833,433,382.72, in order to accept for purchase all validly tendered 3.500% Notes. As a result, PEMEX will accept for purchase all of the U.S.$ 817,303,000 principal amount of 3.500% Notes tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date.\nAs a result of the increase in the maximum series cap for the 3.500% Notes, PEMEX has increased the aggregate waterfall tender cap, which consists of the maximum aggregate purchase price, including accrued interest, that PEMEX is offering to pay for all Waterfall Notes validly tendered in the Waterfall Tender Offers, from U.S.$900 million to US$1,133,432,614.97.\nExcept as described herein, the terms of the Waterfall Tender Offers remain unchanged.\nThe early settlement date on which PEMEX will make the payment for the Waterfall Notes accepted in the Waterfall Tender Offers is expected to be February 16, 2018.\nHolders of Waterfall Notes that validly tendered on or prior to the Early Tender Date and whose Waterfall Notes have been accepted for purchase are entitled to receive the total consideration set forth in the table above, which includes, in each case, an early tender premium equal to U.S.$30.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount of Waterfall Notes accepted for purchase, and to receive accrued and unpaid interest on their accepted Waterfall Notes from the last interest payment date to, but excluding, the Early Settlement Date. The total cash payment to purchase the accepted Waterfall Notes will be approximately U.S.$1.13 billion, including accrued and unpaid interest. Waterfall Notes that have been validly tendered cannot be withdrawn, except as may be required by applicable law.\nThe Waterfall Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 1, 2018. Because the Waterfall Tender Offers were oversubscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders of Waterfall Notes who tender after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Waterfall Notes accepted for purchase. Any tendered Waterfall Notes that are not accepted for purchase will be returned or credited without expense to the holder's account.\n####\nGlobal Bondholder Services Corporation is acting as the Depositary and Information Agent for the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.
