Last week's volatile trading had seen major indexes record some of their biggest one-day falls.\nWith markets seemingly returning to calmer waters, oil traders said attention was turning to inventory levels.\n\"The change in inventories this week will be crucial for determining whether further declines in the oil price are on the cards,\" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.\nThe private American Petroleum Institute is due to publish crude inventory estimates on Tuesday, while the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration releases fuel storage and crude production data on Wednesday.\nIn an effort to tighten markets and prop up prices, OPEC and a group of other producers including Russia have been withholding supplies since 2017. The cuts are scheduled to last through 2018.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Dale Hudson)",
