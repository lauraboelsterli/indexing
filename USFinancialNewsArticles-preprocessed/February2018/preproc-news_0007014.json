    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average rose on Thursday morning, rebounding from a six-day losing streak and pushing most sectors into positive territory, as a weaker yen and corporate earnings helped drive the benchmark index higher.\nThe Nikkei gained 1.4 percent to 23,410.33 in midmorning trade, after declining for sixth straight sessions.\nFujifilm Holdings jumped more than 13 percent after the company said it will take over Xerox Corp in $6.1 billion deal, combining the U.S. company into their existing joint venture to gain scale and cut costs amid declining demand for office printing.\nNintendo Co soared as much as 3.8 pct to a one-week high after it reported its biggest third-quarter operating profit in eight years, driven by strong demand for its new Switch games console.\nHino Motors soared 8.3 percent after the truckmaker raised its full-year net profit outlook.\nOn the other hand, Fujitsu Ltd dived more than 12 percent after its operating profit dropped 29.3 percent for the April-December period, hit by factors such as non-performing businesses.\nThe broader Topix gained 1.4 percent to 1,861.82, with 31 of its 33 subsectors rising.\nEditing by Sam Holmes\n ",
