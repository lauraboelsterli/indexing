So far this year, the euro remains 2.28 percent higher. It hit a three-year high of $1.2538 in late January.\nThe dollar, against a basket of currencies, was flat on Friday after gaining 1.1 percent this week. The U.S. currency remains down 2.1 percent this year.\nThe dollar also recovered against the yen in early European trading after earlier falling to near four-month lows as investors sought out safety in the Japanese currency.\nThe dollar fell as low as 108.50 yen, nearing its four-month low of 108.28 on Jan. 26. It later edged up to 109.255 yen, a 0.5 percent gain, but was still down for the week.\nThere was limited market reaction after the U.S. Senate approved a budget deal including stopgap government funding bill, which was too late to prevent a federal shutdown that was already underway.\nBefore this week’s market mayhem, one of the most popular trades in the currency market was to buy the euro on expectations of unwinding of stimulus by the ECB and to sell the yen on the view that the Bank of Japan will be the last to exit from its ultra-loose policy.\n“Given the troubles in stock markets, market players will likely continue to reduce their positions for now,” said Minori Uchida, chief FX analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo.\nMany market players are closing existing positions rather than making new bets as they look to reduce risk exposure during the pick up in volatility.\nEquity market volatility has surged this week, and while foreign exchange markets have remained far calmer, the carnage this week has upended some popular trades. UniCredit said it was closing a short position in the euro versus the Norwegian krone after the sell-off penalized the previously buoyant currency.\nThe Swiss franc, another currency investors turn to as a perceived safe haven, also hit a four-month high against the euro at 1.146 francs before falling back to trade at 1.1518, down 0.5 percent on the day.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets (Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in TOKYO; Editing by Peter Graff)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
