    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Agreeing a new customs union with the European Union after Brexit would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday, challenging the opposition Labour Party over its plans.\nIn parliament, May said her government wanted to seal a deal with the EU that would hand Britain control over its laws, borders and money, and one which would not lead to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by William James\n ",
