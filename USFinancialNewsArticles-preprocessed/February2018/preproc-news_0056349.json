    "text": "0 COMMENTS Standard Chartered STAN -1.41% PLC swung to a net profit for 2017 and resumed dividend payments, as Chief Executive Bill Winters said a yearslong overhaul is paying off.\nSince Mr. Winters’s arrival in 2015, the Asia-focused bank has exited businesses, unloaded assets and had suspended dividends after years of rapid growth fizzled out and left it with piles of bad loans. On Tuesday, Mr. Winters said Standard Chartered is poised for growth again and has had a good start to 2018.\nFor full-year 2017, the bank reported a net profit of $774 million, compared with a net loss of $478 million a year earlier. The bank declared a total dividend of 11 cents a share for last year and said it intends to increase the payout as its performance improves.\nOn a call with analysts, Mr. Winters said Standard Chartered has reset its culture and approach to risk, getting back to its roots as a bank focused on commerce and creating prosperity. A strong performance culture at the bank had gone “off track” but was now shifting through training and listening sessions about its values, he said.\nMr. Winters said the bank halved its bad loans in 2017 to $1.2 billion from $2.38 billion, and that revenue is more stable since the cleanup. He said the bank is on track to hit targets set under the bank’s plans including reaching a return of equity above 8% in the medium term. The measure was 3.5% in 2017.\nOperating income for the full year rose 3.5% to $14.29 billion, but fell in the fourth quarter, to $3.48 billion from $3.53 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses in 2017 edged higher to $10.12 billion from $9.98 billion.\nMr. Winters said the main drag in the fourth quarter was in financial markets, where revenue sank to $536 million from $780 million. He said the fall was “discouraging,” but was in line with the declines other banks reported in foreign exchange and rates in the quarter.\nStandard Chartered’s main selling point to investors has been the expectation that profit will start tracking growth rates in its main Asian markets once its restructuring is complete. Mr. Winters said getting more efficient and productive will also drive returns, including by automating some activities.\nThe lender’s former management team left after a commodities selloff in 2014 wiped out parts of its loan book. Finance chief Andy Halford said the bank is around “halfway up the hill” on its turnaround.\n“It’s a little bit of a bumpy road but we never expected anything else,” Mr. Winters said.\nWrite to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com and Chester Yung at chester.yung@wsj.com",
