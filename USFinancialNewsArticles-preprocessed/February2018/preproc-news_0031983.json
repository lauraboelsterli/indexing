    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Renault ( RENA.PA ) said on Thursday its board had asked Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn to stay on for another four years and pursue closer integration with alliance partner Nissan ( 7201.T ).\nGhosn, 63, should “take decisive steps to make the alliance irreversible” during his next term, to be proposed to shareholders at their annual meeting in June, the company said in a statement summarizing board resolutions.\nFrance, which owns 15 percent of Renault, has been pressing for a deeper tie-up with Nissan to ensure the carmakers’ 19-year-old alliance can survive the eventual departure of Ghosn, its main architect.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he was seeking a “clear road map safeguarding the interests of the company, the alliance and all of the French industrial sites”.\nGhosn had earlier been expected to hand over the reins to a new CEO and move to a non-executive chairman role overseeing the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance.\nBut the plan foundered on differences with the French state over the alliance’s future shape and direction, sources have said. Renault currently holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors ( 7211.T ) via a 34 percent stake.\nInstead, Renault confirmed Chief Competitive Officer Thierry Bollore’s promotion to the new role of chief operating officer. Bollore, a former Michelin ( MICP.PA ) manager, joined Renault in 2012 from French supplier Faurecia ( EPED.PA ).\nBoth sides have sought to avoid a repeat of a bitter 2015 clash in which Macron - then economy minister - raised the government’s Renault stake to swing a shareholder vote and secure double voting rights.\nFrench state representatives had been pushing Ghosn since the middle of last year to hire a second-in-command with the managerial and international clout to succeed him.\nIndependent board members including former Total ( TOTF.PA ) boss Thierry Desmarest had voiced concerns about the recruitment process and its failure to identify external candidates, sources have said.\nDesmarest, 72, resigned from the board last week but said in a subsequent company statement that he fully supported the “strategy and governance of Renault”.\nRenault is scheduled to publish its 2017 financial results on Friday.\nReporting by Laurence Frost and Ingrid Melander, editing by David Evans and Hugh Lawson\n ",
