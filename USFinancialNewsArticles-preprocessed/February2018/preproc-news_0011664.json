This report includes the following non-GAAP measures: gross margin, EBIT (margin), EBITDA (margin), adjusted net result, adjusted EPS and net cash, which are further explained on page 16 of this report.\nTomTom's Chief Executive Officer, Harold Goddijn\n“Our business continues to shift towards higher gross margins, better predictability due to longer term contracts and more upfront cash flows. Over 60% of our revenue is now coming from data, software and services. We are becoming a software technology company, with a leading position in connected car, fleet management and online location and navigation services.\nAs a result of significant wins in North America, Automotive order intake exceeded €400 million in 2017, a new record. We have over 800,000 cars connected to our fleet management platform. Our online location and navigation services will become part of Microsoft’s Azure platform in 2018.”\nOutlook 2018\nForward-looking statements (and restated comparable 2017 figures) are provided using IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 accounting standards. Going forward, the definition of adjusted EPS is changed to better reflect the transition of our business model towards a software and services company.\nOutlook 2018 Restated 2017 Revenue* ~ €800 million €903 million Gross margin close to 70% 63% Adjusted EPS** ~ €0.25 €0.18 OPEX & CAPEX (excl. acquisitions) ~ €700 million €721 million * 2018 revenue outlook reflects the continuous decline of Consumer.\n** Adjusted net result is now calculated as net result attributed to equity holders adjusted for movement of deferred/unbilled revenue, deferred cost of sales, impairments and material restructuring and disposal costs on a post-tax basis. Adjusted EPS is calculated as adjusted net result divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares over the period.\nAdjusted EPS definitions used throughout this report are further explained on page 12.\nUpdate share buyback programme\nOn 8 December 2017, TomTom completed its share buyback programme that was launched on 19 September 2017. Under this programme, a total of 5,384,450 ordinary TomTom shares were repurchased on Euronext Amsterdam at an average price of €9.25 per share, for a total consideration of €49.8 million. TomTom will use the shares to cover its commitments arising from its stock option and share plans.\nFinancial and business review\nTomTom generated revenue of €220 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 17% compared with €266 million in Q4 '16. Automotive & Enterprise showed strong year on year revenue growth in Q4, which was offset by a decline in Consumer. On a full year basis, total revenue was €903 million (FY '16: €987 million). Automotive & Enterprise and Telematics revenue delivered a combined year on year revenue growth of 16% in 2017. However, this revenue growth was more than offset by a decline of Consumer revenue of 27% year on year.\nGross margin was 62% in FY '17 (FY '16: 57%) and EBITDA was €141 million in FY '17 (FY '16: €141 million). The adjusted net result for the year was a gain of €61 million, which translates to adjusted EPS of €0.26 in FY '17 (FY '16: €0.23).\nAutomotive & Enterprise\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q4 '17 Q4 '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nFY '17 FY '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nAutomotive 53.9 36.7 47% 190.6 132.6 44% Enterprise 32.8 35.0 -7% 138.2 136.3 1% Total Automotive & Enterprise revenue 86.6 71.7 21% 328.8 269.0 22% Automotive & Enterprise segment EBITDA 100.0 82.1 22% EBITDA margin (%) 30% 31% Automotive & Enterprise segment EBIT -47.6 -25.5 EBIT margin (%) -14% -9% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nAutomotive & Enterprise combined revenue in the quarter was €87 million (Q4 '16: €72 million) and €329 million for the full year 2017 (FY '16: €269 million).\nAutomotive generated revenue of €54 million in the quarter, representing a 47% increase year on year. On a full year basis, Automotive revenue reached €191 million, 44% higher compared with last year (FY '16: €133 million). This considerable revenue growth mainly came from the ramp-up of a new contract that went live in 2016 as well as higher revenue from existing contracts. The deferred revenue position of Automotive increased in the year by 94% to €113 million at the end of 2017 (December 2016: €59 million). A breakdown of deferred revenue is provided in the Balance Sheet section.\nEnterprise revenue in Q4 '17 was €33 million compared with €35 million in the same quarter last year. This decline was mainly caused by a weaker USD. On a full year basis, Enterprise reported total revenue of €138 million, 1% higher compared with €136 million in 2016.\nWe launched our traffic service in Japan during the quarter, bringing our global Traffic coverage to 69 countries. We announced a collaboration with ZENRIN, Japan’s market leader in mapping and navigation, to cooperate on traffic services and mapping in Japan. With this collaboration, we will be able to provide even more accurate traffic information to OEMs and Tier 1s in the country. In addition, we extended our HD Map coverage to Japan, covering over 18,000 kilometres of freeways across the country.\nAt the CES 2018, we launched AutoStream, an innovative map delivery service that enables vehicles to build a horizon for the road ahead by streaming the latest map data from the TomTom cloud. TomTom AutoStream has launched with two initial partners: Baidu and Zenuity. We also announced TomTom MotionQ, a unique predictive driving concept to ensure the comfort of passengers in self-driving transport. We are working together with Qualcomm to demonstrate new location technologies for autonomous driving, specifically, fusing the TomTom HD Map, with camera technologies and GPS data from the Qualcomm ® Drive Data Platform, to power highly precise and reliable localisation for connected car applications and autonomous vehicles.\nAlso in the quarter, TomTom Route Monitoring was introduced, designed to address the growing road congestion challenges faced by smart cities worldwide. This service helps traffic managers, event managers and emergency service dispatchers to monitor travel times and delays on routes of interest, as they happen, and inform the public of delays and alternative routes through smartphones, in-car systems and variable message signs.\nIn Enterprise, we announced that our online APIs are integrated in the newly launched Microsoft Azure cloud platform. By providing our location-based technologies on Azure, we enable IoT solutions, with impact on a wide range of industries from Smart Cities to Automotive. We have also completely revamped the developer portal for Online APIs during the quarter. Update included enhancements to the product offerings and a pricing model geared towards small and medium sized businesses to easily integrate TomTom’s Online APIs into their applications. We started to supply map and traffic data to Transport Systems Catapult (TSC), supporting their intelligent mobility platform in providing innovative transportation solutions in the UK.\nTelematics\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q4 '17 Q4 '16 y.o.y.¹\nchange\nFY '17 FY '16 y.o.y.¹\nchange\nSubscriptions 32.7 30.8 6% 126.3 118.4 7% Hardware and other services² 9.2 10.8 -15% 35.8 36.8 -3% Total Telematics revenue 42.0 41.6 1% 162.1 155.1 4% Telematics segment EBITDA 59.1 59.1 0% EBITDA margin (%) 36% 38% Telematics segment EBIT 43.0 44.5 -3% EBIT margin (%) 27% 29% Monthly revenue per subscription (€) 13.6 14.5 -6% 13.8 14.9 -7% Subscriber installed base (# in thousands) 809 696 16% 1 Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\n2 Other services revenue comprises installation services and separately purchased traffic service and/or map content.\nTelematics generated revenue of €42 million in Q4 '17, flat compared with €42 million in Q4 '16. This performance was driven by growth in the WEBFLEET subscriber base, which was partially offset by a decline in hardware revenue. The recurring subscription revenue amounted to €33 million for the quarter, 6% higher compared with the same quarter last year. Hardware revenue declined with 15% year on year, due to a higher proportion of hardware rental in our subscriber sales mix. Revenue for 2017 was €162 million, representing a 4% growth year on year (FY '16: €155 million).\nAt the end of the year, Telematics reached more than 809,000 fleet management and connected car subscriptions. This represents a 16% year on year increase, from 696,000 subscriptions at the end of 2016.\nConsumer\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q4 '17 Q4 '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nFY '17 FY '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nConsumer products 81.0 140.6 -42% 367.7 502.0 -27% Automotive hardware 10.0 11.7 -13% 44.9 61.2 -27% Total Consumer revenue 91.0 152.3 -40% 412.5 563.2 -27% Consumer segment EBITDA -11.2 5.9 EBITDA margin (%) -3% 1% Consumer segment EBIT -19.8 -3.9 EBIT margin (%) -5% -1% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nTotal Consumer revenue for the quarter was €91 million, a decline of 40% compared with the same quarter last year (Q4 '16: €152 million). On a full year basis, Consumer revenue declined by 27% to €413 million (FY '16: €563 million), reflecting a decrease in both Consumer products as well as Automotive hardware revenue.\nData, software & services and Hardware revenue split\n(€ in millions) Q4 '17 Q4 '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nFY '17 FY '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nData, software & services 139.5 122.9 13% 547.2 481.4 14% Hardware 80.1 142.7 -44% 356.2 505.9 -30% Total revenue 219.6 265.6 -17% 903.4 987.3 -9% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nHardware revenue for the quarter was €80 million compared with €143 million in Q4 '16. Data, software & services revenue in the quarter was €140 million, 13% higher compared with €123 million in Q4 '16, due to growing Automotive and Telematics subscription revenue. As a percentage of revenue, data, software & services revenue increased to 64% in Q4 '17 from 46% in Q4 '16.\nOn a full year basis, revenue from data, software & services was €547 million (FY '16: €481 million) and accounted for 61% of total revenue (FY '16: 49%).\nGeographical revenue split\n(€ in millions) FY '17 FY '16 y.o.y.\nchange\nEurope 702.1 773.2 -9% North America 147.5 167.4 -12% Rest of the world 53.7 46.7 15% Total revenue 903.4 987.3 -9% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nFrom a regional perspective, 78% of 2017 revenue was generated in Europe (FY '16: 78%), 16% in North America (FY '16: 17%) and the remaining 6% in the rest of the world (FY '16: 5%).\nGross margin\nThe gross margin for the quarter was 59%, which is one percentage point higher compared with the same quarter last year. On a full year basis, gross margin was 62% (FY '16: 57%). At constant currency rates for the US dollar and GB pound, FY '17 gross margin and operating result would have been the same.\nOperating expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter were €160 million, which is €6 million higher compared with the same quarter last year (Q4 '16: €154 million). The increase results from additional amortisation charges partly offset by lower personnel related cost.\nOn a full year basis, total operating expenses amounted to €764 million compared with €557 million in 2016, an increase of €207 million year on year. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge our operating expenses increased by €38 million. The increase resulted from restructuring charges in our Consumer business, accelerated amortisation of some customer relationships and the disposal of some technology assets.\nFX sensitivity\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q4 '17\nactual\nQ4 '17\nrecalculated at\nQ4 '16 FX rates 1\nFY '17\nactual FY '17\nrecalculated at\nFY '16 FX rates 1\nRevenue 219.6 223.2 903.4 911.0 Gross result 130.6 130.5 564.0 568.3 Gross margin 59% 58% 62% 62% EBIT (FY excl. impairment charge) -29.5 -30.9 -31.2 -30.0 EBIT margin (FY excl. impairment charge) -13% -14% -3% -3% FX RATES IN € Q4 '17 Q4 '16 FY '17 FY '16 US dollar 1.18 1.09 1.13 1.11 GB pound 0.88 0.87 0.87 0.81 ¹ The Q4 '17/FY '17 income and expense in US dollar and GB pound have been converted to euro using Q4 '16 / FY '16 average exchange rates.

The other financial result for the quarter was a gain of €0.9 million (Q4 '16: loss of €2.0 million), which consisted primarily of foreign exchange gains from the revaluation of monetary balance sheet items partially offset by our hedging results. On a full year basis, the total financial income and expense was a gain of €1.7 million compared with a loss of €2.4 million in 2016.\nIncome tax\nThe net income tax for the quarter was a charge of €5.8 million versus a net income tax charge of €3.0 million in Q4 '16.

The year on year increase was mainly driven by lower working capital utilisation in Q4 '17. On a full year basis, cash flow from operating activities was €173 million compared with €144 million in 2016.\nThe cash flow used in investing activities during the quarter increased by €3.0 million year on year to €29 million (Q4 '16: €26 million). On a full year basis, the cash flow used in investing activities (excluding the effect of acquisitions) was €120 million, an increase of €2.6 million year on year (FY '16: €117 million).

Adjusted net result is now calculated as net result attributed to equity holders adjusted for movement of deferred and unbilled revenue, deferred cost of sales, impairments and material restructuring and disposal costs on a post-tax basis. Below table shows the calculations of adjusted EPS, using the old and the new definitions and taking into account different accounting standards.\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) FY '17 Restated FY '17 Restated FY '17 Definition Old definition Old definition New definition Accounting standards As applicable in 2017 IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 Net result -204.4 -194.4 -194.4 Net result attributed to equity holders -204.0 -194.0 -194.0 Impairment charge 168.7 168.7 168.7 Acquisition-related expenses 72.2 72.2 11.3 Restructuring charge and disposals 44.6 44.6 44.6 Remeasurement of deferred tax liability 4.6 4.6 4.6 Deferred/unbilled revenue movement 25.1 Deferred cost of sales movement -1.0 Tax effect of adjustments -24.9 -24.9 -17.0 Adjusted net result 61.3 71.2 42.3 Adjusted EPS, € fully diluted 0.26 0.30 0.18 TOMTOM NV\nTransition to new accounting standards\n1 January 2018\nTomTom has assessed the estimated impact that the initial application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 will have on the consolidated financial statements. The estimated impact of the adoption of these standards on the Group’s equity as at 1 January 2018 is based on assessments undertaken to date. There is no expected material impact from the adoption of IFRS 9. The estimated adjustments due to adoption of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 are material and are illustrated in the subsequent tables.\nContents:\nConsolidated condensed statement of income using IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 accounting standards\nConsolidated condensed balance sheet using IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 accounting standards\nConsolidated condensed statement of income using IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 accounting standards\nThe new accounting policies are subject to change until the group presents its first financial statements that include the date of initial application and, therefore, the actual impact of adopting the new standards at 1 January 2018 may change.\n(€ in millions) FY '17 Reported IFRS 15 IFRS 16 FY '17 Restated Automotive & Enterprise 328.8 4.4 333.2 Automotive 190.6 5.1 195.7 Enterprise 138.2 -0.7 137.5 Telematics 162.1 1.5 163.6 Consumer 412.5 -6.4 406.1 Total Revenue 903.4 -0.5 902.9 Cost of sales 339.3 -6.2 333.1 Gross result 564.1 5.7 569.8 Research and development expenses 207.9 207.9 Amortisation of technology and databases 112.3 112.3 Marketing expenses 57.4 -5.6 51.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 217.7 -2.6 215.1 Impairment charge 168.7 168.7 Total operating expenses 763.9 -5.6 -2.6 755.7 Operating result (EBIT) -199.8 11.3 2.6 -186.0 EBITDA 141.2 5.7 16.5 163.3\nInterest result -1.0 -0.9 -1.9 Other financial result 2.7 2.7 Result of associates 0.8 0.8 Result before tax -197.4 11.3 1.7 -184.4 Income tax gain / (expense) -7.0 -2.6 -0.4 -10.0 Net result -204.4 8.7 1.3 -194.4 Earnings per share: EPS, € diluted 1\n-0.87 0.04 0.01 -0.83 aEPS, € diluted 2\n0.26 0.04 0.01 0.30 Basic number of shares (in millions) 233.7 233.7 Diluted number of shares (in millions) 236.8 236.8",
