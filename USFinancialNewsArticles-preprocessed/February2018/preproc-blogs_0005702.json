    "text": "Time Warner's HBO premium channel has more than 5 million online streaming subscribers, up from 2 million a year ago, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday.\nThose online subscribers come from all online streaming offerings it works with, including its own HBO Now as well as Amazon's Amazon Channels, AT&T's DirectTV Now and Sony Vue.\nSubscriber growth contributed to better-than-expected performance for the division in the most recent quarter. Revenue from HBO, home to hit fantasy show \"Game of Thrones,\" rose 12.7 percent to $1.68 billion, the company reported Thursday. Analysts were expecting revenue of $1.65 billion, according to data and analytics firm FactSet.\nHBO parent company Time Warner beat analyst estimates as it awaits the outcome of a Department of Justice lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. That suit is set to go to trial in March.\nThe company's net income attributable to shareholders surged to $1.39 billion, or 1.75 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a gain of $1.06 per share related to changes to U.S. tax laws.\nIn the year-ago quarter, the company earned $293 million, or 37 cents per share.\nRevenue rose 9 percent to $8.61 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $8.42 billion. According to Thomson Reuters, Time Warner's adjusted EPS was $1.60 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $1.43.",
