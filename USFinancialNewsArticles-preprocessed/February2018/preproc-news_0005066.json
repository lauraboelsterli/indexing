SYY -1.40% and US Foods Holding Corp. USFD -0.53% , two of the country’s largest food distributors are suing big suppliers including Tyson Foods Inc. TSN -0.46% and Sanderson Farms Inc., SAFM 2.47% the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge reports, charging they conspired to manipulate wholesale prices even as American poultry consumption has reached record levels. The complaints are the latest in a string of lawsuits and probes involving the companies that control the U.S. chicken industry, which produces about 41 billion pounds of meat annually for grocery stores, restaurants, and overseas buyers. The suits come as more companies across a range of industries use of data services to get a better grip on the direction of markets. In this case, the food distributors say wholesalers have been using information services to help them manipulate supplies and prices. Those prices have been rising even as demand for poultry grows.\nThe freight and logistics world is giving a chilly reception so far to the outlines of President Donald Trump’s infrastructure investment program. Groups including truckers, port operators and highway planners say they’re happy with the president’s goal of spending $1.5 trillion on roads, bridges and other transportation projects, but the WSJ reports the lack of funding details in Mr. Trump’s State of the Union speech leaves many wary that longstanding divisions will get in the way of the plan . Administration officials have said they plan to contribute $200 billion in federal money to lure more private and state investment. Several transport groups already are pushing for more direct federal backing. Big questions over how to get the revenue for roads have created divisions over infrastructure spending even as lawmakers like to talk about the bipartisan nature of projects. Groups are expecting the White House to release a more detailed plan next month, but the dividing lines already are being set.\nSome companies are girding for another “Amazon effect,” this one for hiring. Amazon.com Inc.’s plans to hire thousands of people in the area it picks as a second home has businesses concerned it would be tougher to attract talent if the behemoth moves in. Amazon expects to create as many as 50,000 jobs paying an average of $100,000 at its new site, the WSJ’s Lauren Weber and Laura Stevens write, likely creating more competition for workers and wage increases in an already-tight labor market. The scale of Amazon’s plans will make the impact on regional employment markets far greater than that of its growing network of fulfillment centers. But Amazon’s new headquarters jobs will come in the technology and supply-chain management areas, creating recruiting competition in fields growing more important to companies as they adjust to e-commerce. And if Amazon tabs Atlanta as its new site, it would vie for talent with a key transport provider, United Parcel Service Inc.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES\nA Sysco distribution center in Concord, N.C. Photo: Bloomberg Newsa Hennes & Mauritz AB is trying to speed up its shift into fast fashion’s online commerce. The retailer known as H&M is scrambling to recover from a late and slow move into e-commerce, a strategic shortfall the WSJ’s Dominic Chopping reports led to a recent 32% fall in fourth-quarter profit. Although the company’s digitization process is now in full swing, expanding online sales aren’t compensating for reduced foot traffic. H&M is caught in a contradiction facing many retailers: the push toward online sales is eating away at resources while whittling down margins. Now, the company is focusing on integrating physical and digital stores, which has shown promise at other retailers. One of those using the strategy is H&M competitor Zara, which has adjusted its nimble distribution system to fit the online and brick-and-mortar world—providing a pattern that H&M’s supply-chain designers hope to copy.\nThe U.S. trucking market may be even tighter than some market-wide measures suggest. New results from several truckload businesses show strong gains in operating profits and revenues that were boosted by double-digit surges in freight rates. Net profit at Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. nearly doubled, the magazine Heavy Duty Trucking reported . A measure of pricing strength at the Knight operation rose 14.9% as the company pulled back trucks and prices at the freight brokerage division rose even faster, with revenue per load jumping 17.2%. The push toward brokerage signals the strain shipping customers face finding trucks, which helped boost fourth-quarter earnings at C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. by 24.7%. Robinson’s truckload net revenue—the money it keeps after paying truckers—soared 15.3% from the year before. Robinson projects more of the same this year, with the double-digit growth in spot markets pushing into the market for contract business.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ It’s going to come down to who puts forward real money and who is talking ideology and fake money. ’\n—Chris Spear, president and chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, on U.S. infrastructure spending.\nNumber of the Day 6.6% Year-over-year growth in world-wide air cargo volume in the fourth quarter, according to World ACD.\nIN OTHER NEWS The U.S. Federal Reserve is holding short-term interest rates steady amid market expectations of a rate increase in March .
