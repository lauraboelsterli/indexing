    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration on Monday revived its support for construction of a new FBI headquarters, saying it planned to ask Congress in 2018 for the remaining $2.175 billion needed to help pay for it.\nThe funding request, tucked inside the president’s larger $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, would help cover the cost to tear down and rebuild the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s aging 1970s-era headquarters building in downtown Washington, which has nets rigged to catch falling stones.\nThe move marks a reversal from July, when the administration canceled a years-long search to find a new home for the crime-fighting agency.\nThe FBI had previously searched for possible new spots in either Maryland or Virginia.\nThe total estimated cost for a new FBI headquarters is $3.3 billion, Assistant Attorney General Lee Lofthus told reporters in a briefing on Monday at the Justice Department.\nThe FBI has already set aside $1.125 billion toward the construction project.\n“The idea is to build a modern and secure headquarters building across the street on the site of the (J. Edgar) Hoover building,” Lofthus said.\n“This is an important part of the president’s infrastructure program.”\nLofthus added that the projected $3.3 billion would also cover the cost of “swing space,” or space that FBI employees will use on a temporary basis during construction.\nThe agency endorsed the plan, saying in a statement: ”The FBI believes this proposed consolidation strategy enhances mission resiliency, continuity of operations, and will provide the Bureau with the agility necessary to meet future needs.”\nAlso on Monday, the Trump administration unveiled its proposal for the fiscal 2019 budget.\nThat plan asks for a Justice Department budget of $28 billion, a slight decrease of 1.2 percent from the 2017 enacted level.\nMost of the Justice Department’s components would see a funding boost under the plan, with increases proposed for the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as for U.S. attorneys and the office that oversees immigration courts.\nThe decrease would be achieved by consolidating the COPS grants program into the Office of Justice Programs, and closing two regional Bureau of Prisons offices.\nThe plan also calls for stripping the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) of its powers to police cigarette and alcohol smuggling and transferring them to a tax and trade unit inside the Treasury Department.\nAfter that, the ATF would focus solely on efforts to combat violent crimes such as arson, illegal firearms trafficking and bombings.\n(This story has been refiled to fix the spelling error in “site” in paragraph 7)\nReporting by Sarah N.
