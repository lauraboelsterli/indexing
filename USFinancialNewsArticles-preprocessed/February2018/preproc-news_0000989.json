    "text": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hawthorn Bancshares Inc. (NASDAQ:HWBK), today reported consolidated financial results for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income for the current year was $3.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted common share, compared to $7.3 million, or $1.24 per diluted common share, for 2016. Included in the 2017 net income is a $4.1 million charge, or $0.70 per diluted common share, that includes $3.1 million resulting from application of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.0 million resulting from tax planning strategies implemented at year-end 2017.\nThe return on average common equity was 3.59% (7.90% excluding the charge from the Tax Act) and the return on average assets was 0.25% (0.56% excluding the charge from the Tax Act) for the current year compared to 7.97% and 0.58% for the prior year, respectively.\nCommenting on earnings performance, Chairman David T. Turner said, “Hawthorn reported a 4% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.29 excluding the impact of the Tax Act for the current year. Loans increased $94.4 million, or 9.7%, from the prior year end and they have increased $203 million, or 23.5%, since year-end 2015. This growth was accomplished without a deterioration in credit quality as nonperforming loans to total loans improved from 1.19% at 12/31/15 to 1.00% at 12/31/17. Our current year net interest margin remained strong at 3.41% while net interest income was $42.9 million, a $2.6 million increase from the prior year driven primarily by loan growth. Non-interest income of $9.0 million for the current year was level with the prior year, mostly due to securities gains of $0.6 million recognized in 2016 that offset increases in most other non-interest income categories. Non-interest expense of $38.8 million was $2.0 million higher than the prior year mostly due to a $0.9 million, or 4.5%, increase in salaries and benefits expense and a net increase in other operating expenses of $1.1 million primarily due to costs associated with technology related expenses to improve operating efficiencies and our ability to react to new technology developments.”\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $42.9 million compared to $40.3 million for the prior year. The increase in average loans from 2016 of $111 million, or 12.1%, was the primary contributor to the growth in net interest income. The net interest margin declined 7 basis points from 2016 to 3.41% for 2017 primarily due to the yield on average earning assets increasing 7 basis points while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points.\nNon-Interest Income and Expense\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.0 million compared to $8.9 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2016. The net change from the prior year was primarily due to increases in trust income of $0.2 million and combined real estate servicing and mortgage loan sales income of $0.3 million offset by securities gains of $0.6 million recognized in the prior year.\nNon-interest expense was $38.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.0 million, or 5.4%, over the prior year level of $36.8 million. Salaries and benefits increased $0.9 million, or 4.5% over 2016 due to cost of living adjustments, merit increases and increased health insurance and pension costs. Other operating expenses increased $1.1 million primarily due to technology related costs.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company’s level of non-performing loans at December 31, 2017 was 1.00% of total loans compared to 0.95% at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $799,000, or 0.08% of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $143,000, or 0.02% of average loans for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net charge-offs over the prior year was primarily due to a recovery of approximately $500,000 on a construction loan during the second quarter of 2016. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2017 was $10.9 million, or 1.02% of outstanding loans, 101.57% of non-performing loans and 180.87% of nonperforming loans when excluding accruing TDR’s. At December 31, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $9.9 million, or 1.01% of outstanding loans, 107.35% of non-performing loans and 282.94% of nonperforming loans when excluding accruing TDR’s. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is commensurate with risks in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nComparing December 31, 2017 balances with December 31, 2016, total assets increased $142.2 million to $1.4 billion. The largest driver in asset growth was the increase in loans of $94.4 million, or 9.7%, while federal funds sold and other overnight interest-bearing deposits increased $41.6 million. Total deposits increased $115.1 million, or 11.4%, to $1.1 billion and FHLB advances and other borrowings increased $28.0 million to $121.4 million at December 31, 2017. During the same period, stockholders’ equity increased 0.4% to $91.4 million, or 6.4% of total assets. The total risk based capital ratio of 12.93% and the leverage ratio of 9.33% at December 31, 2017, respectively, far exceed minimum regulatory requirements of 8.00% and 4.00%, respectively.\n[Tables follow] FINANCIAL SUMMARY (unaudited) $000 Three Months Ended Statement of income information: December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Total interest income $ 13,219 $ 12,936 $ 11,877 Total interest expense 2,351 2,183 1,497 Net interest income 10,868 10,753 10,380 Provision for loan losses 530 555 450 Noninterest income 2,268 2,181 2,395 Noninterest expense 9,999 9,766 9,285 Pre-tax income 2,607 2,613 3,040 Income taxes 4,979 847 1,052 Net income $ (2,372 ) $ 1,766 $ 1,988 Earnings per share: Basic: $ (0.41 ) $ 0.30 $ 0.34 Diluted: $ (0.41 ) $ 0.30 $ 0.34 Statement of income information: For the Year Ended 2017 2016 Total interest income $ 50,935 $ 46,010 Total interest expense 8,007 5,663 Net interest income 42,928 40,347 Provision for loan losses 1,765 1,425 Noninterest income 8,955 8,917 Noninterest expense 38,802 36,807 Pre-tax income 11,316 11,032 Income taxes 7,902 3,750 Net income $ 3,414 $ 7,282 Earnings per share: Basic: $ 0.59 $ 1.24 Diluted: $ 0.59 $ 1.24 Key financial ratios: December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Return on average assets (YTD) 0.25 % 0.58 % 0.58 % Return on average common equity (YTD) 3.59 % 8.18 % 7.97 % December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Allowance for loan losses to total loans 1.02 % 1.05 % 1.01 % Nonperforming loans to total loans 1.00 % 1.06 % 0.95 % Nonperforming assets to loans and foreclosed assets 2.21 % 2.29 % 2.37 % Allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans 101.57 % 99.42 % 107.35 % Allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans - excluding performing TDRs 180.87 % 172.20 % 282.94 % Balance sheet information: December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Loans, net of allowance for loan losses $ 1,057,580 $ 1,034,047 $ 964,143 Investment securities 237,579 222,410 224,308 Total assets 1,429,216 1,386,532 1,287,048 Deposits 1,125,812 1,107,960 1,010,666 Total stockholders’ equity 91,371 96,072 91,017 Book value per share $ 15.68 $ 16.47 $ 15.52 Market price per share $ 20.75 $ 20.70 $ 17.02 Use of Non-GAAP Measures\nSeveral financial measures in this press release are non-GAAP, meaning they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the U.S. The non-GAAP items presented in this press release are non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP basic earnings per share, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP return on average assets and non-GAAP return on average common equity. These measures include adjustments to exclude the transitional impact of the Tax Act and the Company's implementation of new tax planning strategies, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying earnings performance. [The adjustments do not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate under the Tax Act on current year earnings.] The Company believes that the exclusion of these items provides a useful basis for evaluating the Company's underlying performance, but should not be considered in isolation and is not in accordance with, or a substitute for, evaluating performance utilizing GAAP financial information. The Company uses non-GAAP measures to analyze its financial performance and to make financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis. The Company believes that providing such adjusted results allows investors to better understand that Company's comparative operating performance for the periods presented. Non-GAAP measures are not formally defined by GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by the Company. The Company has reconciled each of these measures to a comparable GAAP measure below:\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (unaudited) $000 Three Months Ended Statement of inc ome information: December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Net income - GAAP $ (2,372 ) $ 1,766 $ 1,988 Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 4,105 0 0 Net income and Dec 2017 non-GAAP Net income $ 1,733 $ 1,766 $ 1,988 Earnings per share: Basic - GAAP $ (0.41 ) $ 0.30 $ 0.34 Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 0.71 0.00 0.00 Basic and Dec 2017 non-GAAP Basic $ 0.30 $ 0.30 $ 0.34 Diluted - GAAP $ (0.41 ) $ 0.30 $ 0.34 Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 0.71 0.00 0.00 Diluted and Dec 2017 non-GAAP Diluted $ 0.30 $ 0.30 $ 0.34 Statement of income information: For the Year Ended 2017 2016 Net income - GAAP $ 3,414 $ 7,282 Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 4,105 0 Net income and 2017 non-GAAP Net income $ 7,519 $ 7,282 Earnings per share: Basic - GAAP $ 0.59 $ 1.24 Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 0.70 0.00 Basic and 2017 non-GAAP Basic $ 1.29 $ 1.24 Diluted - GAAP $ 0.59 $ 1.24 Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 0.70 0.00 Diluted and 2017 non-GAAP Diluted $ 1.29 $ 1.24 Key financial rati os: December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Return on average assets (YTD) - GAAP 0.25 % 0.58 % 0.58 % Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 0.31 % 0.00 0.00 Return on average assets (YTD) and Dec 2017\nnon-GAAP Return on average assets (YTD) 0.56 % 0.58 % 0.58 % Return on average common equity (YTD) - GAAP 3.59 % 8.18 % 7.97 % Effect of net deferred tax asset adjustments (a) 4.31 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Return on average common equity (YTD) and Dec 2017\nnon-GAAP Return on average common equity (YTD) 7.90 % 8.18 % 7.97 % (a) Calculated using the difference in combined statutory rates of 38% for 2017 and 21% for subsequent years.
