    "text": "Shares of Amazon, Netflix and other popular tech stocks fell Monday as investors took profits in some of their biggest bull market winners amid a steep market sell-off.\nAmazon closed 2.8 percent lower, while Netflix declined 4.9 percent. Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook pulled back 5.1 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Apple closed 2.5 percent lower after briefly rising as much as 2.1 percent.\nThese stocks followed the broader U.S. stock market lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,100 points and the S&P 500 declined 4.1 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite pulled back 3.8 percent.\nInvestors have poured loads of money into these stocks over the past year. In the past 12 months, these stocks have all soared at least 21 percent.\n\nTheir gains have also been key in lifting the broader market to record highs over the past year. Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet, Facebook and Apple have all benefited from strong quarterly results in the past year.\nAmazon shares surged earlier last week after it said fourth-quarter revenue jumped 38 percent , topping Wall Street estimates. And Amazon is universally liked on Wall Street with 34 analysts rating the stock buy and two giving it a hold, according to TipRanks.com. Zero analysts give it a sell. \nBut none of that mattered Monday as investors looked to sell their biggest winners in order to raise capital amid the sell-off.",
