(Nasdaq:SYNT), a leading global provider of integrated information technology and knowledge process services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nSyntel's revenue for the fourth quarter increased 0.8 percent to $239.8 million from $237.9 million in the prior-year period, and 3.7 percent from $231.3 million in the third quarter of 2017.
