Prior-year dividends were 0.46 euros and 0.45 euros per preference share and per ordinary share, respectively. Therefore, the total amount disbursed under this proposal would increase by 11.0% to 34.5 million euros from 31.1 million euros a year earlier.\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board will submit a proposal to the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting to elect Dr. Guido Oelkers to the Supervisory Board as a representative of the shareholders.

He was appointed by court order after Supervisory Board member Professor Arnold Picot, Ph.D., had passed away.\nGuido Oelkers, who was born in 1965 and holds a university degree in business administration and economics, has served in various functions in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors since 1987, among these at former Hoechst AG, as well as at Aventis and Nycomed.
