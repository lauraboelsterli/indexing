Under TSX Venture Exchange (“ TSXV ”) policies, Bluedrop is entitled to purchase up to 2% of the total issued and outstanding common shares in any 30 day period up to the maximum of 5,052,889 common shares over the 12 month period that the NCIB is in place.\nAs previously announced, Bluedrop entered into an automatic share purchase plan (the “ Plan ”) with Haywood Securities Inc. (“ Haywood ”). The Plan allows for purchases of common shares under the NCIB at times when Bluedrop ordinarily would not be active in the market due to its own internal black-out periods or under applicable Canadian securities laws. Pursuant to the Plan, the Corporation has instructed Haywood to make purchases of common shares with certain instructions which are subject to specified limits, including price, volume and frequency, as set out in the Plan. Within these specified limits, Haywood has discretion with respect to the purchase of the shares under the NCIB during the black-out period in accordance with the rules of the TSXV.\nPurchases under the NCIB commenced on March 31, 2017 and pursuant to the Corporation’s first two tranches of share purchases under the NCIB an aggregate of 1,624,000 common shares were repurchased.\nThe third tranche of share purchases under the NCIB shall not exceed either (a) 1,000,000 common shares; or (b) the aggregate amount of $150,000.\nAll common shares purchased by the Company will be on the open market through the facilities of TSXV by Haywood acting on behalf of Bluedrop in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and will be surrendered by the Company to its transfer agent for cancellation.\nAbout Bluedrop\nBluedrop Performance Learning Inc.
