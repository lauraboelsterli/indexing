    "text": "MEXICO CITY, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Latin American currencies firmed on Monday as markets stabilized following last week's extreme volatility and steep losses. Appetite for risk-taking crept back into currency markets, helping higher-yielding emerging market currencies including the Colombian peso, which was up by more than 1 percent after shedding more than 3 percent last week. \"Investors see opportunities in some assets including (emerging market) currencies at current prices after the massive selloff last week,\" said FX strategist Juan Carlos Alderete of Banorte. Mexico's peso currency was up 0.2 percent. In Chile, the central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate to 2.75 percent from 2.5 percent currently, within 11 months, according to a monthly poll of 47 analysts surveyed by the bank and published on Monday. The markets in Brazil, Latin America's largest, were closed for Carnival celebrations, as were Argentina's.
