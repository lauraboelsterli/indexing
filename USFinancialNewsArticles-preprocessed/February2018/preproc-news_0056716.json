    "text": "Another company cuts ties with NRA By The Associated Press Published 5 Hours Ago The Associated Press \nHearing aid maker Starkey Hearing Technologies is joining other companies that have cut ties with the National Rifle Association after the latest school massacre. \nThe Eden Prairie, Minnesota, company announced the decision over the weekend, saying it would not renew its discount program offered to NRA members. \nU.S. corporations that had partnered with the NRA for years began to distance themselves from the organization after a 17 people, mostly students, were shot at a high school in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14. \nThere have been more than 20 companies, including Metlife, Hertz, Avis, Enterprise, Best Western, Wyndham, United Airlines, and Delta, which have ended NRA partnerships since the shooting. \nThe NRA has pushed back aggressively, calling the departure of its corporate partners a \"shameful display of political and civic cowardice.\" ",
