Apart from D&A, each of the above expense categories includes personnel-related costs and expenses, relevant office space rental, and related share-based compensation expense. Increases across all cost categories reflect investments in overall growth. In Q4 2017 Yandex's headcount increased by 549 full-time employees. The total number of full-time employees was 7,445 as of December 31, 2017, up by 8% compared with September 30, 2017, and up 19% from December 31, 2016.\nCost of revenues, including traffic acquisition costs (TAC) In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change TAC: Related to the Yandex advertising network 3,101 3,567 15% 11,015 12,907 17% Related to distribution partners 1,173 1,222 4% 3,935 4,438 13% Total TAC 4,274 4,789 12% 14,950 17,345 16% Total TAC as a % of total revenues 19.3% 17.2% 19.7% 18.4% Other cost of revenues 1,362 2,008 47% 4,804 6,592 37% Other cost of revenues as a % of revenues 6.2% 7.2% 6.3% 7.0% Total cost of revenues 5,636 6,797 21% 19,754 23,937 21% Total cost of revenues as a % of revenues 25.5% 24.4% 26.0% 25.5% TAC grew 12% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016 and represented 17.2% of total revenues, 210 basis points lower than in Q4 2016 and 160 basis points lower compared with Q3 2017 due to revenue mix effect.\nOther cost of revenues in Q4 2017 increased 47% compared with Q4 2016, primarily due to an increase in services provided to Taxi corporate clients, for which revenue and related costs are recorded on a gross basis, as well as growth of outsourced services in Taxi.\nProduct development In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change Product development 4,303 5,201 21% 15,832 18,761 19% As a % of revenues 19.4% 18.6% 20.8% 19.9% Product development expenses grew slower than revenue and reflected salary increases in late 2016 and in 2017 and new hires.\nSales, general and administrative (SG&A) In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change Sales, general and administrative 6,435 8,022 25% 17,885 27,081 51% As a % of revenues 29.1% 28.8% 23.6% 28.8% SG&A expenses grew in line with revenue, increasing by 25% in Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016 as we continued to invest in advertising and marketing to support our business units, primarily Taxi.\nShare-based compensation (SBC) expense\nSBC expense is included in each of the cost of revenues, product development, and SG&A categories discussed above.\nIn RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change SBC expense included in cost of revenues 48 36 -25% 193 178 -8% SBC expense included in product development 566 811 43% 2,238 2,477 11% SBC expense included in SG&A 251 547 118% 991 1,538 55% Total SBC expense 865 1,394 61% 3,422 4,193 23% As a % of revenues 3.9% 5.0% 4.5% 4.5% Total SBC expense increased 61% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016. The acceleration of growth rates of our total SBC expense is primarily related to new equity-based grants made in 2016-2017 as well as to accelerated vesting of a portion of RSUs.\nDepreciation and amortization (D&A) expense In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change Depreciation and amortization 2,408 3,023 26% 9,607 11,239 17% As a % of revenues 10.9% 10.9% 12.7% 11.9% D&A expense increased 26% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016. The acceleration of D&A expense growth rate in Q4 2017, compared with previous quarters, primarily reflects our investments in servers connected with the launch of our new data center in Vladimir, Russia, earlier in 2017.\nIncome from operations In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change Income from operations 3,337 4,817 44% 12,847 13,036 1% Income from operations increased 44% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016. This growth rate was driven by low base of Q4 2016 impacted by RUB 0.5 billion VAT provision, primarily related to prior years’ tax audit.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change Adjusted EBITDA 6,701 9,293 39% 26,121 29,075 11% Adjusted EBITDA increased 39% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA by segments In RUB millions Three months ended\nDecember 31, Twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 Change 2016 2017 Change Adjusted EBITDA: Search and Portal 8,123 10,665 31% 28,445 36,658 29% E-commerce 329 370 12% 1,420 1,598 13% Taxi (1,300 ) (1,584 ) 22% (2,086 ) (7,963 ) n/m Classifieds (97 ) 72 n/m (54 ) 108 n/m Experiments (354 ) (230 ) -35% (1,604 ) (1,326 ) -17% Total adjusted EBITDA 6,701 9,293 39% 26,121 29,075 11% Adjusted EBITDA of Taxi was negative RUB 1,584 million in Q4 2017, and improved significantly compared with negative RUB 3,168 million in Q3 2017. This improvement was mainly related to optimization of user and driver incentives, that we started in September 2017.\nInterest income in Q4 2017 was RUB 780 million, up from RUB 609 million in Q4 2016.\nInterest expense in Q4 2017 was RUB 226 million, down from RUB 265 million in Q4 2016.\nForeign exchange loss in Q4 2017 was RUB 243 million, compared with a foreign exchange loss of RUB 1,163 million in Q4 2016. This loss reflects the appreciation of the Russian ruble during Q4 2017 from RUB 58.0169 to $1.00 on September 30, 2017, to RUB 57.6002 to $1.00 on December 31, 2017. Yandex's Russian operating subsidiaries' functional currency is the Russian ruble, and therefore changes due to exchange rate fluctuations in the ruble value of these subsidiaries' monetary that are denominated in other currencies are recognized as foreign exchange gains or losses within the Other (loss)/income, net line in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Although the U.S. dollar value of Yandex's U.S. dollar-denominated was not impacted by these currency fluctuations, they resulted in a downward revaluation of the ruble equivalent of these U.S. dollar-denominated monetary in Q4 2017.\nIncome tax expense for Q4 2017 was RUB 1,897 million, up from RUB 1,314 million in Q4 2016. Our effective tax rate of 35.1% in Q4 2017 was lower than in Q4 2016, primarily due to the effects of certain tax provisions recognized in Q4 2016 related to the results of prior years' tax audits. Adjusted for the similar tax effects, SBC expense and also for additional dividend withholding tax provided by our main Russian operating subsidiary following decision to remit earnings for the year 2013 to our Dutch parent company, our effective tax rate for Q4 2017 was 22.8%, compared with 23.4% for full year 2016 as adjusted for SBC expense and similar provisions in that year.\nNet income was RUB 3.5 billion ($60.8 million) in Q4 2017, up 189% compared with Q4 2016, mainly due to growth in income from operations in Q4 2017 as well as due to higher foreign exchange loss in Q4 2016 compared with Q4 2017.\nAdjusted net income in Q4 2017 was RUB 5.2 billion ($91.1 million), a 62% increase from Q4 2016.\nAdjusted net income margin was 18.8% in Q4 2017, compared with 14.7% in Q4 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Yandex had cash, cash equivalents and term deposits of RUB 70.7 billion ($1,227.6 million).\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities for Q4 2017 was RUB 7.6 billion ($131.8 million) and capital expenditures were RUB 2.6 billion ($44.5 million).\nDuring Q4 2017 there were no repurchases of convertible debt notes.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets relate to the equity incentive arrangements we have made available to the senior employees of the Taxi, Classifieds and E-commerce segments, pursuant to which such persons are eligible to acquire depositary receipts, or receive options to acquire depositary receipts, which entitle them to economic interests in the respective business unit subsidiaries.\nThe total number of shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was 326,304,843 including 285,612,556 Class A shares, 40,692,286 Class B shares, and one Priority share and excluding 3,751,911 Class A shares held in treasury and all Class C shares outstanding solely as a result of the conversion of Class B shares into Class A shares. All such Class C shares will be cancelled.\nThere were also employee share options outstanding to purchase up to an additional 2.7 million shares, at a weighted average exercise price of $26.68 per share, 1.0 million of which were fully vested; equity-settled share appreciation rights (SARs) for 0.2 million shares, at a weighted average measurement price of $32.10, all of which, excluding SARs for approximately 1,000 shares, were fully vested; and restricted share units (RSUs) covering 11.2 million shares, of which RSUs to acquire 2.4 million shares were fully vested. Equity awards in respect of business unit subsidiaries are described under Redeemable noncontrolling interests above.\nPlease note that historical information on revenues and adjusted EBITDA of our segments is provided in the supplementary slides accompanying our Q4 2017 earnings release, including quarterly data for the twelve quarters from Q1 2015 through Q4 2017 and annual data for the five years from 2013 through 2017.\nFinancial outlook\nWe expect our consolidated ruble-based revenue to grow in the range of 25% to 30% in the full year 2018 compared with 2017. This outlook implies consolidation of Yandex.Taxi with Uber’s operations in Russia and neighboring countries starting from February 7, 2018, but excludes the effect of potential deconsolidation of Yandex.Market.\nWe expect our Search and Portal ruble-based revenue to grow in the range of 18% to 20% in the full year 2018 compared with 2017.\nThis outlook reflects our current view, based on the trends that we see at this time, and may change in light of market and economic developments in the business sectors and jurisdictions in which we operate.\nConference Call Information\nYandex’s management will hold an earnings conference call on February 15, 2018 at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time (4:00 PM Moscow time; 1:00 PM London time).\nTo access the conference call live, please dial:\nUS: +1 646 828 8193\nUK/International: +44(0)330 336 9105\nRussia: 8 800 500 9283\nPasscode: 8775378\nA replay of the call will be available until February 22, 2018.

These include statements regarding our anticipated revenues for full-year 2018. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by such statements, and our reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted or implied by such statements include, among others, macroeconomic and geopolitical developments affecting the Russian economy, competitive pressures, changes in advertising patterns, changes in user preferences, changes in the political, legal and/or regulatory environment, technological developments, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions «Risk Factors» and «Operating and Financial Review and Prospects» in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is available on our investor relations website at http://ir.yandex.com/sec.cfm and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . All information in this release and in the attachments is as of February 15, 2018, and Yandex undertakes no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: ex-TAC revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted ex-TAC EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin and adjusted ex-TAC net income margin. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned «Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measures», included following the accompanying financial tables. We define the various non-GAAP financial measures we use as follows:\nEx-TAC revenues means U.S. GAAP revenues less total traffic acquisition costs (TAC) Adjusted EBITDA means U.S. GAAP net income plus (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) SBC expense, (3) accrual of expense related to the contingent compensation that may be payable to employees in connection with certain business combinations, (4) interest expense, (5) other loss/(income), net, (6) operating losses resulting from sanctions in Ukraine imposed in May 2017 and (7) provision for income taxes, less interest income Adjusted EBITDA margin means adjusted EBITDA divided by U.S. GAAP revenues Adjusted ex-TAC EBITDA margin means adjusted EBITDA divided by ex-TAC revenues Adjusted net income means U.S. GAAP net income plus (1) SBC expense adjusted for the income tax reduction attributable to SBC expense, (2) accrual of expense related to the contingent compensation that may be payable to certain employees in connection with certain business combinations, (3) foreign exchange losses adjusted for reduction in income tax attributable to foreign exchange losses, (4) amortization of debt discount related to our convertible debt adjusted for the related reduction in income tax and (5) losses resulting from sanctions in Ukraine imposed in May 2017 less (gains)/losses from repurchases of our convertible notes adjusted for the related increase/(reduction) in income tax Adjusted net income margin means adjusted net income divided by U.S. GAAP revenues Adjusted ex-TAC net income margin means adjusted net income divided by ex-TAC revenues\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for evaluating financial performance as well as decision-making. Management believes that these metrics reflect the organic, core operating performance of the company, and therefore are useful to analysts and investors in providing supplemental information that helps them understand, model and forecast the evolution of our operating business.\nAlthough our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for operational decision-making and considers these financial measures to be useful for analysts and investors, we recognize that there are a number of limitations related to such measures. In particular, it should be noted that several of these measures exclude some recurring costs, particularly share-based compensation. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of the measures described above may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations.\nBelow we describe why we make particular adjustments to certain U.S. GAAP financial measures:\nTAC\nWe believe that it may be useful for investors and analysts to review certain measures both in accordance with U.S. GAAP and net of the effect of TAC, which we view as comparable to sales commissions but, unlike sales commissions, are not deducted from U.S. GAAP revenues. By presenting revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted net income margin net of TAC, we believe that investors and analysts are able to obtain a clearer picture of our business without the impact of the revenues we share with our partners.\nSBC\nSBC is a significant expense item, and an important part of our compensation and incentive programs. As it is a non-cash charge, however, and highly dependent on our share price at the time of equity award grants, we believe that it is useful for investors and analysts to see certain financial measures excluding the impact of these charges in order to obtain a clearer picture of our operating performance.\nAcquisition-related costs\nWe may incur expenses in connection with acquisitions that are not indicative of our recurring core operating performance. In particular, we are required under U.S. GAAP to accrue as expense the contingent compensation that is payable to certain employees in connection with certain business combinations. We eliminate these acquisition-related expenses from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to provide management and investors a tool for comparing on a period-to-period basis our operating performance in the ordinary course of operations.\nForeign exchange losses\nBecause we hold significant in currencies other than our Russian ruble operating currency, and because foreign exchange fluctuations are outside of our operational control, we believe that it is useful to present adjusted net income and related margin measures excluding these effects, in order to provide greater clarity regarding our operating performance.\nAmortization of debt discount\nWe also adjust net income for interest expense representing amortization of the debt discount related to our convertible notes issued in Q4 2013 and Q1 2014.We have eliminated this expense from adjusted net income as it is non-cash in nature and is not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nGains and losses from repurchases of convertible debt\nAdjusted net income for 2017 also excludes a loss from the repurchase of $12.0 million in principal of our 1.125% convertible senior notes due 2018 for approximately $11.6 million. We have eliminated this loss from adjusted net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as it is not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nLosses resulting from sanctions in Ukraine\nAdjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA exclude losses and gains from write-off of in our Ukrainian legal entities that we recorded in 2017. In May 2017, the government of Ukraine imposed sanctions on our Ukrainian operations.
