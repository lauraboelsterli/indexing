    "text": "HACKENSACK, N.J. and PETACH TIKVAH, Israel, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: BCLI), a leading developer of adult stem cell therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases, announced today the appointment of Anthony (Tony) Polverino, Ph.D., to its board of directors. Dr. Polverino is a highly accomplished senior biopharmaceutical executive with more than 25 years' industry experience in drug research and development.\n\"We are honored to have Dr. Polverino join our board of directors,\" said Chaim Lebovits, president and chief executive officer of BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics. \"His extensive experience in the biotech industry and in academic research, which includes senior roles at Kite, a Gilead Company and Amgen, will be invaluable as we continue to develop NurOwn ® as a potential breakthrough treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and pursue development of our pipeline candidates in other CNS diseases. We look forward to the strategic insights and contributions he will make.\"\nDr. Polverino is currently the interim chief scientific officer of Kite (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences), which he joined in 2015, and where he is currently responsible for establishing Kite's strategic non-clinical R&D roadmap to support its current and future portfolio. Prior to this, he was the vice president of research at Kite, where his responsibilities included corporate goal setting, budget allocation, scientific and investor interactions, business development in-licensing and partnership deals. Dr. Polverino spent 20 years in positions of increasing responsibilities at Amgen, Inc., most recently as executive director of its Therapeutic Innovation Unit, where he managed research programs in oncology, metabolic disease, inflammatory disease and schizophrenia. Prior to Amgen, he was a postdoctoral scientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked primarily on oncology research. Dr. Polverino is an author of several patents, and has been published in nearly 40 scientific and peer-reviewed journals. He earned a B.Sc. in Biochemistry/Physiology and a B.Sc. (Honors) in Pharmacology, both from Adelaide University in Adelaide, Australia and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Flinders University, also in Adelaide.\n\"I am excited to have the opportunity to join Brainstorm's board of directors,\" said Dr. Polverino. \"Brainstorm is developing innovative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and I look forward to providing scientific and business guidance to the company.\"\nAbout NurOwn ®\nNurOwn ® utilizes a patient's own cells which have been engineered outside the body, to produce and secrete factors known to promote neuronal survival. NurOwn ® has the potential to be the first ALS treatment to improve patient functioning as a regenerative medicine. Regenerative medicine solutions are desperately needed in the field of neurodegenerative diseases as current therapies have limited efficacy, only slow progression and do not maintain or restore function. NurOwn ® is currently being tested in a multi-site Phase 3 clinical trial in the U.S. and, if successful, the results from this trial will submitted to the FDA and other regulatory authorities around the world with the goal of obtaining marketing approval. BrainStorm has completed two single arm clinical trials which established the safety profile of NurOwn ® and provided indications of a treatment benefit. Additionally, the company has completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study at three prestigious academic medical centers in the US. In this study, clinically meaningful changes in functioning were observed in patients receiving NurOwn ® .\nAbout BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc.\nBrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. is a biotechnology company engaged in the development of first-of-its-kind adult stem cell therapies derived from autologous bone marrow cells for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The Company holds the rights to develop and commercialize its NurOwn® technology through an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Ramot, the technology transfer company of Tel Aviv University. NurOwn® has been administered to approximately 70 patients with ALS in clinical trials conducted in the United States and Israel. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in the U. S., a clinically meaningful benefit was demonstrated by higher response to NurOwn® compared with placebo.
