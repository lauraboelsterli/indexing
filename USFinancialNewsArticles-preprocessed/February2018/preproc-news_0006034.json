    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 12:07 PM / in 9 minutes Ice hockey: Jagr rules out Olympic return due to fitness problems Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech ice hockey great Jaromir Jagr, who plans to skate for his hometown team HC Kladno after an unsuccessful stint with the NHL’s Calgary Flames, ruled out playing in this month’s Winter Olympics due to fitness issues. \nThe 45-year-old winger, who was a member of the Czech’s 1998 Olympic gold medal winning team, said he had considered a return to the national team for the Games in South Korea but has not been able to get match fit. \n“I was kind of hoping that if I stayed here in the Czech league or somewhere in Europe, I would get used to the bigger ice and if I was going to be good enough to help the team, there was a possibility to play,” Jagr told a news conference. \n“But right now, I am not ready, I am not good, I did not play many games, so not a chance.” \nJagr joined the Flames earlier this season on a one-year contract, scoring a goal and six assists in 22 games. But the winger has been sidelined since the end of 2017 with a lower body injury that prompted the Flames to release him.
