    "text": " 26 AM / in 9 minutes Ford says Jan China vehicle sales drop 18 pct y/y Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSHANGHAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday that its January vehicle sales in China dropped 18 percent versus the same period a year earlier, marking a difficult start to 2018 for the U.S. carmaker in China where it is looking to revive growth. \nFord sold 75,990 vehicles in the market last month, the company said in a statement. \nFord’s China chief Jason Luo stepped down last month after only five months at the helm, a sudden resignation that raised questions over how the automaker will best tackle a sales slump in the world’s biggest car market.
