    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kroll (\"the Company\"), a global leader in risk mitigation, investigations, compliance, cyber resilience, security, and incident response solutions, today announced the appointment of Matthew Dunn as an Associate Managing Director in its Cyber Security and Investigations practice, based in Nashville, Tennessee. Dunn joins Kroll after a distinguished 20-year career with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he most recently served as the Supervisory Special Agent overseeing the FBI Cyber Crimes/Counterintelligence Squad in Nashville.\n\"Matt brings to Kroll an exceptional combination of professional experiences garnered in federal law enforcement as well as in the practice of law handling litigation matters in both federal agency and private practice contexts. While with the FBI, many of Matt's assignments involved global investigations, and we are looking forward to his bringing this informed perspective on cyber and other threats to our organization and our clients,\" said Jason Smolanoff, Senior Managing Director and Global Cyber Security Practice Leader for Kroll. \"Matt is joining a strong and growing global team of cyber professionals, who collectively have the multidisciplinary expertise and experience so vital for helping our clients navigate today's multitude of cyber threats. I am delighted to welcome Matt to the team.\"\nIn his most recent role with the FBI as the Supervisory Special Agent overseeing the FBI Cyber Crimes/Counterintelligence Squad in Nashville, Dunn oversaw national security and criminal computer intrusion investigations, particularly those impacting victims in the Middle District of Tennessee. Concurrently, he also served as the Supervisory Special Agent for the FBI Memphis Division SWAT Team, to which he was appointed in 2011.\nPrior to this assignment, from 2010-2014, Dunn served as the Supervisory Special Agent for the FBI Nashville Violent Crime Gang Task Force, where he was responsible for investigations focused on gangs/criminal enterprises and the most violent criminal offenders operating in that region. Dunn began his career with the FBI as a Special Agent in the Philadelphia Field Office in 1997, where he was assigned to the Latin American/Caribbean Drug Squad. He subsequently was promoted in 2002 to a Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI's Terrorist Financing Operations Section in the Counterterrorism Division at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he coordinated terrorist financing investigations on high-profile counterterrorism cases among the FBI, other U.S. Intelligence Agencies, and foreign partner entities. From 2005-2010, Dunn served as an Assistant Legal Attaché and opened the Toronto Sub-Office of the FBI's Ottawa Legal Attaché. During this time, Dunn established productive liaison contacts to effectively coordinate multinational joint investigations with Canadian authorities where FBI criminal and national security investigations had a nexus to the Greater Toronto Area.\nFrom 1992-1997, Dunn served as an attorney in the Litigation Division of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. He also served as a partner with the law firm of Hoffman and Dunn from 1994-1997, focusing on a variety of legal matters.\nDunn earned his Juris Doctor at the University of Bridgeport School of Law and a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Massachusetts.\nAbout Kroll:\nKroll is the leading global provider of risk solutions.
