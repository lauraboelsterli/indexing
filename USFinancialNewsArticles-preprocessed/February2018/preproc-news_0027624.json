    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - For the nearly 3,000 dogs converging on New York City on Monday for the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, “Good Dog!” is a dreaded assessment but “Best Dog!” is a dream come true.\nThis year’s two-day event draws challengers from all 50 U.S. states and 16 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Japan, Russia, Australia and China, Westminster Kennel Club said in a statement.\nIt is the second-oldest U.S. sporting event, and some view it as the canine version of the Olympic Games, which coincidentally are taking place simultaneously in South Korea.\nA total of 2,882 dogs are set to compete with the top dog picked as Best of Show on Tuesday, organizers said.\nLast year, the world-renowned contest for purebred canines drew 2,798 competitors.\nThe competition features dogs from 201 breeds and varieties, from muscular French bulldogs to butterfly-eared papillons.\nDogs are divided into seven groups: hounds, toys, nonsporting, herding, working, sporting and terrier. The dogs crowned champion of each of the seven groups then vie for the Best of Show trophy.\nRumor, a female German shepherd, was named Best in Show at last year’s competition.
