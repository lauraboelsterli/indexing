    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avidbank Specialty Finance, a Division of Avidbank that specializes in technology, sponsor finance and asset-based lending, has provided an acquisition term loan and a working capital line of credit to Red Monkey Foods (“RMF”).\nFounded in 2002 and headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, RMF is a leading provider of private label organic spices, seasonings and other natural dry food products. In November of 2017, RMF completed the acquisition of San Francisco Salt Company (“SFS”), a premier provider of specialty bath and gourmet salts founded in 2002 and located in San Francisco, California.\nSFS was RMF’s first corporate acquisition and was led by majority owner, San Francisco Equity Partners (“SFEP”). In conjunction with the close, Avidbank increased its existing credit facilities to support the acquisition and future growth. With the increased facilities, RMF and SFS are poised for tremendous growth fueled by category expertise and strong industry tailwinds.\n“We are pleased to participate in Red Monkey Foods’ acquisition of San Francisco Salt,” said Larry LaCroix, Executive Vice President and Head of Avidbank’s Specialty Finance Division. “The new credit facility reflects our ongoing commitment to our clients’ growth.
