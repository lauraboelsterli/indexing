    "text": " 00 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago Asian shares flirt with six-week low as U.S. yields creep up Hideyuki Sano 4 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares flirted with six-week lows on Thursday as U.S. bond yields crept up towards four-year highs as investors fretted that low borrowing costs enjoyed by companies for many years may be endangered by the threat of rising inflation. \nU.S. congressional leaders reached a two-year budget deal to raise government spending by almost $300 billion, a rare display of bipartisanship that is positive for risk sentiment but is also widening the federal deficit sharply. \n“The scale of increase was much larger than what markets were expecting just a few months ago. It will have as big impacts as tax cuts. Since the markets haven’t priced this in yet, U.S. bonds could be sold for another week or so,” said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities. \nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield US10YT=RR jumped back to 2.813 percent, near Monday’s four-year peak of 2.885 percent. \nThat is keeping investors nervous, with the prospects of rising interest rates around the world triggering a massive selloff in equities in the past few days. The rising costs of dollar funding is detrimental to firms not just in the United States but around the world. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.1 percent in early Thursday trade, staying near its six-week low touched on Tuesday. \nJapan's Nikkei .N225 gained 0.6 percent, though it was still down more than six percent so far this week. \nMSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets .MIWD PUS has lost ground in seven of the last eight sessions until Wednesday, a period in which it slumped 6.8 percent. \nU.S. stocks ran out of steam on Wednesday after an early surge, with the S&P 500 .SPX ending down 0.50 percent and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC losing 0.9 percent. \nThe Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX .VIX and often seen as investors’ fear gauge, fell 2.3 points to 27.73, but that was still more than twice the levels generally seen in the past few months. \nThe dollar gained after the debt ceiling deal in Washington, rising against a broad range of currencies. \nThe dollar index .DXY rose to a two-week high of 90.403 on Wednesday and last stood at 90.291. \nThe euro dipped to $1.2271 EUR= , staying near its lowest level in two weeks. \nSouthern European government bond yields tumbled on Wednesday, after Germany’s pro-European, pro-spending Social Democratic party took the finance ministry in a coalition government. \nThe dollar stood at 109.41 yen JPY= , recovering from Wednesday's low of 108.92. \nThe New Zealand dollar fell to four-week lows after New Zealand’s central bank lowered its forecasts for inflation right out to 2020 while saying volatility in equity markets this week was a warning sign that global markets are nervous about the risk of higher inflation and rising interest rates. \nThe kiwi fetched $0.7230 NZD=D4 after having slumped to $0.7209, a low last seen on Jan. 11. \nPrecious metals also dipped, with gold hitting a four-week low of $1,311.6 XAU=. \nOne outlier was the Chinese yuan, which continued to strengthen, with the Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNY index .RXYY hitting a two-year high, having risen 1.7 percent already during the first week of February. \nOil prices fell after U.S. data showed a build in inventories and record high crude production, raising worries of more selling. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 tumbled to a six-week low of $65.16 $ per barrel. \nU.S. crude futures CLc1 hit one-month low of $61.25 per barrel and last traded at $61.65.
