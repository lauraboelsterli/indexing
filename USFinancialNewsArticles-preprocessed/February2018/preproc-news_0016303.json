    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - YouTube found no evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum, a senior executive told a British parliamentary committee inquiry into fake news.\nBritain’s Digital, Media, Culture and Sport Committee is taking evidence on Thursday at George Washington University as part of its inquiry.\nJuniper Downs, YouTube’s global head of public policy, said the Google division found “no evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit referendum.”\nRelations between Russia and Britain are strained. British Prime Minister Theresa May last year accused Moscow of military aggression and said there was evidence of Russia’s meddling in foreign elections.\nThe Kremlin, which under Vladimir Putin has clawed back some of the global influence lost when the Soviet Union collapsed, has denied meddling in elections in the West. It says anti-Russian hysteria is sweeping through the United States and Europe.\nReporting by Mark Hosenball; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ",
