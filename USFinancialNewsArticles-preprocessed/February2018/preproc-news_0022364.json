    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) (“Organovo”) today reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter of 2018 and updated its full-year fiscal 2018 outlook. The Company reported fiscal third-quarter total revenue of $1.2 million. Total revenue was unchanged from the prior-year period and decreased 15 percent versus the fiscal second quarter of 2018. Net loss was $7.8 million, or $0.07 per share, for the fiscal third quarter of 2018, as compared to $9.6 million, or $0.09 per share, for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. Negative Adjusted EBITDA (1) for the third quarter was $5.2 million, as compared to $7.3 million for the prior-year period.\n“Our liver therapeutic tissue program continues to make excellent progress in achieving critical regulatory and scientific milestones,” said Taylor J. Crouch, CEO, Organovo. “With the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) recently granting orphan designation for our NovoTissues ® treatment of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (“A1AT”), our path to commercializing this novel therapeutic comes with significant developmental and economic incentives. With few alternative therapies and a high annual cost of care, patient need is great in treating this rare, debilitating liver disease. We’ve also begun new studies in a second therapeutic indication within the category of inborn errors of metabolism, Fumarylacetoacetate Hydrolase (“FAH”) deficiency, and look forward to reporting proof-of-principle data in the coming months.”\nCrouch continued, “In our commercial segment, we continue to shift our R&D and business development efforts to high-value liver disease modeling services. We’re seeing meaningful early uptake as we transition away from routine toxicology projects, with nearly all of our service revenue in the fiscal third quarter representing disease modeling studies. With approximately 250 global programs pursuing treatments in the areas of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (”NASH”), we believe being a pioneer in this area translates into the best path forward for boosting our revenue growth. Sophisticated clients are already partnering with us in a multi-faceted approach to develop custom tissue models, allowing us to target the entire drug discovery and development spectrum. We continue to expect deeper engagement from our customers over the next several months.”\nCrouch concluded, “We have the ability to monetize our platform in many ways, including the provision of primary human cells for research applications, compound screening in disease models, licensing agreements that capitalize on our technology, and the ongoing development of novel therapeutics. We’ll continue to direct our resources at all of these opportunities as we focus on long-term value creation.”\nThird-Quarter Organovo Business Highlights\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $1.2 million, unchanged from the year-ago period. Higher grant revenue related to the Company’s National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) project offset lower revenue from collaborative agreements. Product and service revenue was $0.8 million, up 19 percent from the prior-year period, largely driven by an increase in liver disease modeling studies and sales from human cell and tissue products.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of revenues was $0.2 million, a decrease of 9 percent from the prior-year period, reflecting a greater contribution from higher-margin primary human cell and tissue products. Research and development costs decreased 20 percent year-over-year to $4.0 million, primarily due to lower employee and lab supply costs related to the Company’s organizational restructuring and prioritization of R&D projects. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 12 percent from the prior-year period to $4.9 million, reflecting lower employee and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, which offset $0.8 million in severance and other costs related to the Company’s organizational restructuring.\nLiquidity & Capital Resources\nThe Company ended the fiscal third quarter with a cash and cash equivalents balance of $47.3 million. During the fiscal third quarter, the Company generated net proceeds of approximately $3.1 million from the issuance of 2.3 million shares of common stock in at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings at a weighted average price of $1.42 per share. Through January 31, 2018, the Company generated additional net proceeds of approximately $2.1 million from the issuance of 1.5 million shares of common stock in ATM offerings at a weighted average price of $1.40. Working capital was $46.0 million to end the fiscal third quarter compared to $67.5 million in the prior-year quarter.\nFiscal-Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company updated its full-year fiscal 2018 outlook for total revenue and negative Adjusted EBITDA. The Company now expects:\nTotal revenue of between $4.5 million and $5.2 million for fiscal-year 2018. Fiscal 2017 total revenue was $4.2 million. Negative Adjusted EBITDA of between $25.0 million and $26.0 million for fiscal-year 2018. Fiscal 2017 negative Adjusted EBITDA was $29.8 million. The Company’s continued improvement in negative Adjusted EBITDA will be largely driven by reduced operating costs as the result of its organizational restructuring and a more rigorous focus on its existing commercial opportunities and therapeutics research program.\nFiscal-Year 2018 Outlook\n(November 2017) Fiscal-Year 2018 Outlook\n(February 2018) Fiscal-Year 2018\nTotal Revenue $4.5 million - $6.5 million $4.5 million - $5.2 million Fiscal-Year 2018 Negative\nAdjusted EBITDA $26.0 million - $28.0 million $25.0 million - $26.0 million A reconciliation of non-GAAP negative Adjusted EBITDA, as forecasted for fiscal 2018, to the closest corresponding GAAP measure, net loss, is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility of certain charges that may impact our GAAP results on a forward-looking basis, such as the measures and effects of stock-based compensation.\nDefinitions & Supplemental Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides Adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a supplemental measure to help investors evaluate the Company's fundamental operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and restructuring/CEO transition costs. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, U.S. GAAP measurements such as net income or loss. By eliminating interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and restructuring/CEO transition costs, the Company believes the result is a useful measure across time in evaluating its fundamental core operating performance. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage the business, including in preparing its annual operating budget, financial projections and compensation plans. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. However, there is no standardized measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA as the Company presents it may not be comparable with similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Since Adjusted EBITDA does not account for certain expenses, its utility as a measure of the Company's operating performance has material limitations. Due to these limitations, investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, but should also consider other measurements, such as net income or loss and revenues, to measure the Company’s operating performance. Please refer to the schedule below for a reconciliation of consolidated GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nOrganovo Holdings, Inc.
