    "text": "DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT and NEW YORK, Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATPCO , the leading source for airline industry pricing and shopping data, today announced the acquisition of Routehappy , the airline industry’s leading rich content provider for flight shopping. The acquisition broadens ATPCO’s value to the entire airline distribution ecosystem by enabling rich content, making it a centralized platform for both airfare data and rich content.\nAirline rich content provider, Routehappy's user interface.\n“Airline merchandising is rapidly evolving, as rich content is more widely adopted across both NDC and traditional distribution models. As an industry, we want travelers to be able to see, and trust, the differences between flight options,” said Jerry Foran, Chairman of the Board of ATPCO and Head of Product Delivery, Revenue Management at British Airways. “This acquisition is another example of how ATPCO is executing on its promise to fuel the future of airline distribution.”\nFounded in 2011 and based in New York with 19 full-time employees, Routehappy has more than 65 customers across the travel industry including Expedia, Google, Sabre, and United Airlines. Routehappy has paved the way for a more transparent shopping experience for flyers around the world with rich content for over 300 airlines and its APIs delivering over 10 billion queries since its inception. Routehappy’s rich content has proven to increase conversion, yield and customer satisfaction for both airlines and distributors. By joining ATPCO, Routehappy’s four rich content types—Scores, Amenities, UPAs (Universal Product Attributes) and UTAs (Universal Ticket Attributes)—become an industry standard to rapidly accelerate the adoption of rich content.\n“Our acquisition of Routehappy drives strategic innovation, reduces complexity, and delivers network economics to the entire distribution ecosystem. Routehappy has created an offering that solves many of the challenges that airlines encounter in delivering consistent messaging, branding, and merchandising through multiple distribution channels,” said ATPCO President and CEO Rolf Purzer. “By aligning Routehappy’s complementary rich content with ATPCO’s fare and pricing data, airlines can ensure consistent and differentiated offers for their products in every sales channel.”\nATPCO works with more than 430 airlines who use its fare and pricing rules content to fuel an estimated 87% of worldwide ticket sales. Bringing together the unmatched rich content offerings of Routehappy with the unparalleled breadth of ATPCO fare data means airlines have greater ease in controlling the look and feel of their offers across all channels of sales. The move further advances ATPCO’s vision of empowering smart connection of all content through all channels within the ecosystem. The deal represents ATPCO’s first acquisition in its 53-year history, and redoubles its efforts to serve the needs of the next generation of air travel distribution.\n“Routehappy has helped United differentiate our products and services in clear and meaningful ways,” said Tye Radcliffe, United’s Director of Distribution. “The tools Routehappy offers enable a more seamless shopping experience for our travel agents and customers.”\nAccording to Robert Albert, Routehappy’s founder and CEO, who will continue to lead the company as a strategic business unit of ATPCO, “Routehappy was founded with the mission to differentiate and better monetize flight shopping.
