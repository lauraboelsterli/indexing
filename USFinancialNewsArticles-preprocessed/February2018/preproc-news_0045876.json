    "text": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The following are some of the factors that may move German stocks on Wednesday:\nDEUTSCHE BOERSE Q4 press, analyst conferences due. Deutsche Boerse late on Tuesday posted a 26 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, and said it expects a 10 percent rise in 2018 profit despite missing its 2017 target amid weak markets.\nVOLKSWAGEN Volkswagen and labour union IG Metall reached a wage agreement for more than 120,000 workers in Germany in a fourth round of talks, the union said on Wednesday, adding it would provide details at a news conference at 0900 GMT.\nSeparately, Volkswagen wants to introduce a code of conduct for all employees as a result of revelations of diesel fume tests involving monkeys and humans and is also reviewing all the research it funds around the world, Bild newspaper reports. Volkswagen declines to comment.\nAlso, a Virginia state court judge on Tuesday rejected a request by the U.S. unit of Volkswagen to delay several of the company’s trials over excess emissions because of “inflammatory” comments made by a lawyer representing car owners that it fears will prejudice the jury.\nAudi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler has rejected suggestions he is about to be ousted and believes he has the support of parent Volkswagen, Handelsblatt reports.\nDEUTSCHE POST German trade union Verdi threatened to raise the pressure on the postal and logistics group with warning strikes after wage talks failed to reach a breakthrough.\nHOCHTIEF Q4 results due.
