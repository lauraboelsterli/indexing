Sales in comparable stores remained unchanged on a percentage basis for the 52-week period ended January 27, 2018 compared to the 52-week period ended January 28, 2017.\nDuring the year, the Company purchased $219.0 million of Class A Common Stock under its share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases were accomplished entirely from available cash and operating cash flow.\nGross Margin/Inventory\nGross margin from retail operations (which excludes CDI) improved 48 basis points of sales for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2017 primarily due to increased markups. Inventory increased 4% at February 3, 2018 compared to January 28, 2017. Consolidated gross margin for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018 improved 53 basis points of sales compared to the prior year fourth quarter.\nGross margin from retail operations declined 65 basis points of sales for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018 compared to the prior 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017 primarily due to increased markdown activity. Consolidated gross margin for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018 declined 48 basis points of sales compared to the prior 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017.\nSelling, General & Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"operating expenses\") were $480.8 million (23.3% of sales) and $451.6 million (23.3% of sales) during the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018 and the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2017, respectively. The increase in operating expenses of $29.2 million is due to the additional week of operations during the 2017 reporting period. For the 14-week period compared to the 13-week period, the dollar increase is comprised primarily of increased payroll, supplies and utilities.\nOperating expenses increased $36.5 million to $1.692 billion (27.0% of sales) from $1.656 billion (26.5% of sales) during the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2018 compared to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017. The increase in expenses is primarily due to the additional week of operations during the 2017 reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nNet income for the fourth quarter includes an estimated tax benefit of approximately $77.4 million ($2.73 per share) related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017. This benefit is primarily due to the Company's reasonable estimate of the effect of reduced future corporate income tax rates on its existing net deferred tax liabilities.\nShare Repurchase\nDuring the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018, the Company purchased $34.6 million (0.6 million shares) of Class A Common Stock under its $500 million share repurchase program.
