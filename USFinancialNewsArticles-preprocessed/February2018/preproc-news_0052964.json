Combined ratio of 81.3%, combined ratio before the impact of the LPT of 83.0%. The Board declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized a new $50.0 million share repurchase program.\nRENO, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Employers Holdings, Inc. (“EHI” or the “Company”) (NYSE:EIG) today reported the following for the fourth quarter of 2017: (i) net income of $31.3 million ($0.94 per diluted share); (ii) net income excluding the impact of the LPT of $28.2 million ($0.85 per diluted share); and (iii) adjusted net income of $35.2 million ($1.06 per diluted share).\nThe Company also reported that the Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 dividend and authorized a new $50.0 million share repurchase program. The first quarter dividend, which was increased to $0.20 per share, will be paid on March 21, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 7, 2018. The new share repurchase authorization, which replaces an expiring program with a remaining authorization of $28.9 million, will expire on February 26, 2020.\nThe Company's adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $3.9 million year-over-year. This increase reflects strong underwriting results highlighted by an 83.0% combined ratio before the impact of the LPT and a 6% increase in net earned premiums.\nThe Company's net income and net income before the impact of the LPT for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $4.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively, year-over-year. The decreases were the result of a non-recurring income tax expense of $7.0 million in connection with U.S. corporate tax reform enacted in December. This incremental income tax expense represents the impact of re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. statutory tax rate.\nThe Company’s book value per share of $29.07, book value per share including the Deferred Gain of $34.09 and adjusted book value per share of $30.80, increased 13.4%, 9.7% and 7.2% for the year, respectively, each computed after taking into account dividends declared during 2017.\nChief Executive Officer Douglas D. Dirks commented on the results: “The fourth quarter marked a strong end to a successful year for EMPLOYERS. During the fourth quarter we grew written premiums by 8% year-over-year, lowered our current and prior year loss reserve provisions and increased the quarterly dividend by 33.3%.\nIn addition, we have recently initiated a plan of aggressive development and implementation of new technologies and capabilities that we believe will fundamentally transform and enhance the digital experience of our customers. We have chosen to reinvest the expected financial benefits from corporate income tax reform back into our business over the next several years by greatly accelerating the development and deployment of these new digital capabilities. We believe that these new technological and intellectual capabilities will support our future growth initiatives, provide us with greater pricing precision and flexibility and promote long-term value creation.\nWe expect that the development and implementation of these new technologies and capabilities will increase our underwriting and other operating expense ratio by approximately four percentage points in 2018 and two percentage points in 2019, as compared to that experienced in 2017. However, we expect that these increased expenses will be offset by operational efficiency gains in future periods.”\nSummary of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\n(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2016, unless noted otherwise).\nNet earned premiums of $181.6 million increased $9.6 million due primarily to new business writings and increases in final audit premiums, partially offset by declines in renewal business premium.\nThe loss ratio before the impact of the LPT of 48.6% decreased 5.4 percentage points reflecting the continued impacts of key business initiatives including: an emphasis on settling open claims; diversifying our risk exposure across geographic markets; and leveraging data-driven strategies to target, underwrite and price profitable classes of business across all of our markets.\nThe commission expense ratio of 13.6% increased 2.0 percentage points due mainly to increases in agency incentives and in the amount of business produced by our partnerships and alliances.\nThe underwriting and other operating expense ratio of 20.8% increased 0.7 percentage points due mainly to increases in fourth quarter professional fees and incentive accruals.\nNet investment income of $19.1 million was unchanged.\nStockholders’ Equity including the Deferred Gain\nStockholders’ equity including the Deferred Gain was $1,111.3 million, an increase of 9.4% from December 31, 2016.\nConference Call and Webcast, Reports Filed With The Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and Supplemental Materials\nThe information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the Financial Supplement that is attached to this press release and is available on our website.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP\nWithin this earnings release we present various financial measures, some of which are \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" A description of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the attached Financial Supplement. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are meaningful to the Company's investors, analysts and other interested parties who benefit from having an objective and consistent basis for comparison with other companies within our industry. These non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures and investors should be careful when comparing the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe Company will host a conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. The conference call will be available via a live web cast on the Company's web site at www.employers.com . An archived version will be available several hours after the call.

Glossary of Financial Measures\nWithin this earnings release we present the following measures, each of which are \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" A reconciliation of these measures to the Company's most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included herein. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures are important to the Company's investors, analysts and other interested parties who benefit from having an objective and consistent basis for comparison with other companies within our industry. Management further believes that these measures are more relevant than comparable GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance.\nThe LPT Agreement is a non-recurring transaction that does not result in ongoing cash benefits to the Company. Management believes that providing non-GAAP measures that exclude the effects of the LPT Agreement (amortization of deferred reinsurance gain, adjustments to LPT Agreement ceded reserves and adjustments to contingent commission receivable) is useful in providing investors, analysts and other interested parties a meaningful understanding of the Company's ongoing underwriting performance.\nDeferred reinsurance gain (Deferred Gain) reflects the unamortized gain from the LPT Agreement. This gain has been deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method, whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries, except for the contingent profit commission, which is being amortized through June 30, 2024. Amortization is reflected in losses and LAE incurred.\nAdjusted net income (see Page 4 for calculations) is net income excluding the effects of the LPT Agreement, net realized gains (losses) on investments (net of tax), net impact of tax reform, gain on redemption of notes payable (net of tax), and amortization of intangible assets (net of tax). Management believes that providing this non-GAAP measures is helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties in identifying trends in the Company's operating performance because such items have limited significance to its ongoing operations or can be impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and may not represent operating trends. The Company previously referred to Adjusted net income as Operating income.\nStockholders' equity including the Deferred Gain is stockholders' equity including the Deferred Gain. Management believes that providing this non-GAAP measure is useful in providing investors, analysts and other interested parties a meaningful measure of the Company's total underwriting capital.\nAdjusted stockholders' equity (see Page 8 for calculations) is stockholders' equity including the Deferred Gain, less accumulated other comprehensive income (net of tax). Management believes that providing this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors, analysts and other interested parties since it serves as the denominator to the Company's operating return on equity metric.\nReturn on stockholders' equity and Adjusted return on stockholders' equity (see Page 4 for calculations) . Management believes that these profitability measures are widely used by our investors, analysts and other interested parties. The Company previously referred to Adjusted return on stockholders' equity as Operating return on adjusted stockholders' equity.\nBook value per share, Book value per share including the Deferred Gain, and Adjusted book value per share (see Page 8 for calculations). Management believes that these valuation measures are widely used by our investors, analysts and other interested parties. The Company previously referred to Book value per share as GAAP book value per share, and Book value per share including Deferred Gain as Book value per share.\nNet income, Combined ratio, and Combined ratio before impact of the LPT (see Pages 3 and 5 for calculations). Management believes that these performance and underwriting measures are widely used by our investors, analysts and other interested parties.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006419/en/\nEmployers Holdings, Inc.\nMedia:\nTy Vukelich, 775-327-2677\ntvukelich@employers.com\nor\nAnalysts:\nMike Paquette, 775-327-2562\nmwoodard@employers.com\nSource: Employers Holdings, Inc.",
