    "text": "LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Bitcoin has failed as a currency measured by the traditional benchmarks, and is neither a store of value nor a useful way to buy things, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Monday.\n“It has pretty much failed thus far on ... the traditional aspects of money. It is not a store of value because it is all over the map. Nobody uses it as a medium of exchange,” Carney told students at London’s Regent’s University.\nBut the underlying technology may still prove useful as a way to verify financial transactions in a decentralised way, he added in response to a question.\nThe central bank governor also said sterling’s movements were largely driven by financial speculation over Brexit, and he said British and European officials were working hard to secure a transitional deal before the end of March.
