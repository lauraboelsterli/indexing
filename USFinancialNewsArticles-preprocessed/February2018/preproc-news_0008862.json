    "text": "Former CyberArk and CloudLock Executives to Drive Enterprise Adoption of Next-Generation Email Security Platform to Thwart Phishing Attacks\nBELMONT, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GreatHorn , the leader in next-generation email security that protects enterprises from advanced threats, today announced that it has made two key appointments to the management team: Christy Lynch as Vice President of Marketing and Ann Sharon as Vice President of Operations. Lynch will lead the strategy and execution of all aspects of GreatHorn’s marketing efforts to broaden market awareness and demand for the company’s Inbound Email Security solution that provides cloud-native protection against email attacks, including targeted phishing and social engineering, to enterprises that use cloud email systems. Sharon will oversee the company’s day-to-day operations and focus on strategic planning and goal-setting to support GreatHorn’s growth.\n“Lynch and Sharon bring tremendous industry experience and insight, gained from working with a range of cybersecurity and technology organizations, ranging from early-stage startups to high-growth organizations and market leaders,” said GreatHorn CEO Kevin O’Brien. “They are valuable additions to the management team as we look to drive market awareness and customer demand for our innovative, next-generation email security solution while optimizing and scaling our business operations to support rapid expansion.”\nLynch brings more than 20 years of technology marketing and communications experience at both high-growth start ups and publicly-traded companies in the enterprise technology and information security industries. Most recently, Lynch served as the Vice President of Corporate Marketing at CyberArk where she led a team responsible for corporate communications, branding, digital marketing and demand generation contributing to the company’s growth, successful IPO and market leadership in privileged account security.\nSharon previously served as Vice President of Business Operations for CloudLock where she helped drive the company’s go-to-market strategy and led many cross-functional programs before the company was acquired by Cisco. Sharon also oversaw the product and program management operations for EMC’s secure remote support portfolio.\nEmail threats, while not new, increasingly have become more sophisticated. Enterprises using cloud-based email platforms like Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite find that legacy email gateway technology does not provide sufficient protection against advanced threats including targeted phishing, business email compromise, malware and ransomware. GreatHorn is the only cloud-native email security solution that protects against advanced threats and provides post-delivery remediation, without requiring MX rerouting or introducing email latency. Lynch and Sharon join the GreatHorn management team as the company has received a groundswell of recognition, including being named a Cool Vendor in Gartner’s report, Cool Vendors in Cloud Security, 2017 1 , a finalist in the 2017 RSAC Innovation Sandbox , as well as one of CB Insights’ “ 10 Email Security Startups to Watch .”\n1, Gartner, Cool Vendors in Cloud Security, 2017, Jay Heiser, Greg Young, Steve Riley, Neil MacDonald, 26 May 2017, ID: G00326827\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
