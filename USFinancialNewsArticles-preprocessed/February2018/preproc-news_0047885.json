EQT said its board had unanimously approved a plan for separation, creating a standalone publicly traded corporation that will focus on midstream operations. The company which completed the $6.7 billion acquisition of Rice Energy in November, was being urged by investors D.E. Shaw & Co and Jana Partners to separate its business units.
