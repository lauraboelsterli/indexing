    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cigna Corp ( CI.N ), which manages healthcare benefits for some of the largest U.S. corporations, said on Thursday that medical costs among its customers grew less than 3 percent in 2017, below its expectations.\nChief Executive Officer David Cordani, speaking with analysts after reporting fourth-quarter earnings, said even that growth rate was unsustainable. Medical costs typically rise faster than inflation, and most insurers typically report annual increases of 6 percent, plus or minus 100 basis points.\nCordani was responding to analyst questions about a new healthcare venture announced by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) and Amazon.com Inc Corp ( AMZN.O ), saying they needed to address too-high healthcare costs that were hurting business.\nReporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ",
