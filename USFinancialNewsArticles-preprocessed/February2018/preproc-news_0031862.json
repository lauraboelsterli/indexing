    "text": "Ed Dickinson brings more than three decades of aerospace industry experience, including 23 years with LMI Cliff Stebe, who served as interim CEO since October, continues as CFO\nST. LOUIS, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Sonaca Group has named Lawrence E. “Ed” Dickinson III as chief executive officer of LMI Aerospace, effective immediately. Dickinson originally joined LMI in 1993 as chief financial officer, and later took on other roles before retiring in June 2016. In his brief retirement, Dickinson continued to serve as a consultant to the company. In November 2017, Dickinson rejoined LMI as interim chief operating officer; the company expects to announce soon a long-term successor for that position. Cliff Stebe, who has served as LMI CFO since November 2013 and interim CEO since October 2017, will continue as CFO.\n“Ed brings more than three decades of aerospace industry experience, and a deep knowledge of LMI’s operations, customers and workforce from more than 23 years with LMI,” said Bernard Delvaux, Sonaca Group chief executive officer. “He brings a passion for the legacy LMI has built over nearly 70 years, and a vision for leading the organization into an even brighter future.”\n“In the coming years, we’ll see unprecedented production rates on commercial aircraft programs and will have the opportunity to deliver greater content than ever before on some of the industry’s best platforms,” Dickinson said. “Throughout the company, our immediate focus is on sharpening our operational discipline and hiring the skills and talent needed to continue delivering the strong performance our customers deserve and expect.”\n“Across the Sonaca Group, we’re strengthening our focus on succession planning – both by hiring the right talent to fill key leadership roles, and by providing interim opportunities to valued leaders such as Cliff Stebe,” Delvaux said. “I am grateful to Cliff for taking the helm over the past four months and leading LMI through this transition – these experiences have no doubt helped him grow as a leader and will continue to enrich his career at LMI and with the Sonaca Group.”\nMore About Ed Dickinson\nDuring his previous tenure at LMI, Dickinson also played an integral role in the start-up of the company’s Tulsa, Okla., processing operation, and the acquisition and integration of several key capabilities and organizations into LMI’s corporate structure. In November 2013, Dickinson was named president overseeing the integration of the company’s Valent Aerostructures acquisition. He served as president of corporate development and strategy from January 2015 until June 2016.\nDickinson began his career in public accounting, then served as a cost accountant and credit analyst at Monsanto Company, before transitioning to the aerospace industry. He was at LaBarge for nearly a decade, serving in various finance roles and ultimately as controller. Dickinson holds a bachelor’s degree in Accounting from the University of Alabama and a Master of Business Administration degree from Washington University in St. Louis.\nAbout LMI Aerospace – A Member of the Sonaca Group\nLMI Aerospace is a leading supplier of structural assemblies, kits and components and provider of engineering services to the commercial, business and regional, and military aerospace markets.
