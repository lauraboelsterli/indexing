    "text": "LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - South African assets soared on Thursday with the rand at near three-year highs after scandal-ridden President Jacob Zuma resigned, clearing the way for the more business-friendly Cyril Ramaphosa to take over, while broader emerging stocks rallied.\nThe rand extended gains to firm 0.7 percent and stocks leapt 3.6 percent to two-week highs, set for their biggest one-day gain September 2015.\nSouth African stocks Old Mutual and Anglo American were also among the top gainers on Britain’s FTSE 100 in early trading, up 4 percent and 3 percent respectively.\nZuma’s resignation on Wednesday clears the way for Ramaphosa to press on with long-awaited structural reforms.\nPer Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB, said Ramaphosa’s state of the nation address, expected on Friday, would be critical as he would need to set out a reform path acceptable to the ruling ANC party’s wider membership.\n“He’s going to have come out sounding pretty strong. It’s been a bruising battle to get Zuma out and he needs to show he is the undisputed leader and he has the momentum to get the work going,” Hammarlund said.\nOn the debt side, the average yield spread of South African sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global fell 4 basis points (bps) to 239 bps.\nFive-year credit default swaps for South Africa fell 4 bps from Wednesday’s close to 151 bps, according to IHS Markit data. Local benchmark 10-year bond yields, which had topped 9.5 percent in November, fell to 8.29 percent, the lowest since March 2017.\nSergey Dergachev, a senior portfolio manager at Union Investment, said South Africa’s upcoming budget and a ratings decision from Moody’s would be a key focus for debt investors.\n“Once these big decisions are behind us, I think South Africa could offer a good opportunity,” he said.\nEmerging markets as a whole were also trading stronger, with MSCI’s benchmark index up 1.5 percent in a fourth straight day of gains. Hammarlund said investors had seen a buying opportunity after last week’s sharp correction.\nHong Kong shares led the pack, up almost 2 percent in half a day of trading ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. Other big Asian markets such as South Korea and Chinese mainland bourses were already closed.\nEmerging Europe made strong gains, with Turkish stocks up 1.5 percent and Moscow shares 0.8 percent.\nWith the dollar index weakening by 0.5 percent, emerging currencies such as the Mexican peso firmed 0.6 percent.\nTunisia’s 2025 dollar bond was trading slightly firmer at 94.8 cents after slumping to its lowest point since last July on Wednesday when central bank governor Chedli Ayari resigned, paving the way for a World Bank official to be appointed in his place.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see)\nEmerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1202.97 +17.64 +1.49 +3.84\nCzech Rep 1113.67 +4.04 +0.36 +3.29\nPoland 2461.70 +11.91 +0.49 +0.02\nHungary 38774.01 +319.66 +0.83 -1.53\nRomania 8206.88 +39.72 +0.49 +5.84\nGreece 835.66 +10.02 +1.21 +4.15\nRussia 1265.05 +20.20 +1.62 +9.58\nSouth Africa 52411.41 +1855.41 +3.67 -0.23\nTurkey 15190.04 +1735.10 +1.53 -0.12\nChina 3199.48 +14.52 +0.46 -3.26\nIndia 34223.35 +67.40 +0.20 +0.49\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.37 25.36 -0.03 +0.62\nPoland 4.15 4.15 -0.02 +0.52\nHungary 311.66 311.76 +0.03 -0.36\nRomania 4.66 4.66 +0.03 +0.44\nSerbia 118.07 118.07 -0.00 +0.28\nRussia 56.63 56.69 +0.09 +1.81\nKazakhstan 320.16 322.66 +0.78 +3.95\nUkraine 26.76 26.67 -0.34 +5.18\nSouth Africa 11.63 11.71 +0.64 +6.21\nKenya 101.20 101.20 +0.00 +1.88\nIsrael 3.52 3.52 +0.11 -1.13\nTurkey 3.77 3.78 +0.19 +0.43\nChina 6.34 6.34 +0.00 +2.56\nIndia 63.94 64.10 +0.24 -0.17\nBrazil 3.22 3.22 +0.00 +2.95\nMexico 18.48 18.59 +0.60 +6.35\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov‘gn Debt EMBIG 315 -2 .07 7 83.67 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; editing by Mark Heinrich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
