    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - Akamai Technologies Inc reported a 7.7 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Tuesday as the company benefited from higher demand for its cloud security services.\nHowever, the companyâ€™s net income fell to $19.1 million, or 11 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $91.6 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe fourth quarter was impacted by a $52 million restructuring charge and a $26 million provisional charge associated with the U.S. tax code overhaul.\nRevenue rose to $663.5 million from $616.1 million.
