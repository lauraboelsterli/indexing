    "text": "Change underway with strategic objectives driving operational excellence, improved customer\nservice, enhanced growth, and innovation focus\nTORONTO, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Hydro One Limited (Hydro One or the Company), the parent company of Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution utility, today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.29, and EPS was $0.26, compared to $0.22 in the prior year Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approves the Hydro One and Avista Corporation (Avista) merger; other approvals are pending 2018 allowed regulated return on equity (ROE) reset to 9.00% from 8.78% for both transmission and distribution businesses Improved management and efficiency programs generated $89.5 million in productivity savings in 2017 Customer-focused initiatives targeting better communication, convenience and affordability resulted in improved customer satisfaction levels, and the largest reduction in overdue accounts receivable in the Company's history $733 million worth of assets placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $699 million last year, representing an increase of 4.9% Recognition by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) with an Emergency Assistance Award for Hydro One's outstanding restoration efforts following Hurricane Irma in September 2017 New Chief Financial Officer appointed subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter\n\"Our fourth quarter results show that focusing on our long-term strategic objectives of operational excellence and improved customer service is generating strong results as we continue to enhance productivity, as well as reduce costs through the implementation of innovative initiatives,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hydro One. \"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's approval of the Avista transaction was a good start to 2018, a year in which we expect to continue improving our execution capabilities on all fronts.\"\nSelected Consolidated Financial and Operating Highlights\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n(amounts throughout in millions of Canadian dollars, except as otherwise noted)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\n1,439\n1,614\n5,990\n6,552\nPurchased power\n662\n858\n2,875\n3,427\nRevenues, net of purchased power 1\n777\n756\n3,115\n3,125\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n155\n128\n658\n721\nCosts related to acquisition of Avista, after tax\n15\n—\n36\n—\nAdjusted net income attributable to common shareholders 1\n170\n128\n694\n721\nBasic earnings per common share (EPS)\n$0.26\n$0.22\n$1.11\n$1.21\nDiluted EPS\n$0.26\n$0.21\n$1.10\n$1.21\nBasic Adjusted EPS 1\n$0.29\n$0.22\n$1.17\n$1.21\nDiluted Adjusted EPS 1\n$0.28\n$0.21\n$1.16\n$1.21\nNet cash from operating activities\n523\n474\n1,716\n1,656\nCapital investments\n431\n477\n1,567\n1,697\nAssets placed in-service\n733\n699\n1,592\n1,605\nTransmission: Average monthly Ontario 60-minute peak demand (MW)\n18,946\n19,415\n19,587\n20,690\nDistribution: Electricity distributed to Hydro One customers (GWh)\n6,784\n6,521\n25,876\n26,289\n1\nNon-GAAP Measures - Hydro One uses financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Hydro One calculated the non-GAAP measures by adjusting certain US GAAP measures for specific items that impact comparability but which the Company does not consider part of normal, ongoing operations. Refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these items.\nKey Financial Highlights\nIn the final quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $155 million (2016 - $128 million), a 21.1% increase from last year, and EPS of $0.26 (2016 - $0.22). Adjusted EPS, which exclude the impact of $15 million costs related to the Avista acquisition, were $0.29 for the quarter.\nRevenues, net of purchased power, for the fourth quarter were higher than last year by 2.8%. This increase reflects higher transmission revenues driven by the OEB's decision on the 2017-2018 transmission rates filing, and higher energy consumption due to colder weather, partially offset by a reduction in the 2017 allowed return on equity from 9.19% to 8.78%.\nThe comparability of fourth quarter earnings was positively impacted by lower support services costs, reduced vegetation management costs, a reduction of provision for payments in lieu of property taxes following a favourable reassessment of the regulations, insurance proceeds received on failed equipment at two transformer stations, and a tax recovery of previous year's expenses. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to an increase in rate base and increased financing charges primarily due to interest on Convertible Debentures issued in August 2017.\nFor the year, the Company reported net income of $658 million (2016 - $721 million), an 8.7% reduction from last year, and EPS of $1.11 (2016 - $1.21). Adjusted EPS are $1.17 for the year. In addition to the factors noted above, net income for the year was also impacted by lower revenues due to milder weather during the first three quarters of 2017, higher consulting costs related to the acquisition of Avista, and a significantly lower bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2016 due to revised estimates of uncollectible accounts as a result of stabilization of the customer information system.\nHydro One continues to invest in the reliability and performance of Ontario's electricity transmission and distribution systems, address aging power system infrastructure, facilitate connectivity to new generation sources, and improve service to customers. The Company made capital investments of $431 million during the fourth quarter, and placed $733 million worth of new assets in-service.\nSelected Operating Highlights\nOn January 16, 2018, Hydro One and Avista received approval from FERC on the merger application filed on September 14, 2017. This approval comes as the two companies make progress in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to close the transaction in the second half of 2018.\nThe Company continued to achieve substantial productivity savings in the fourth quarter, primarily through field automation, fleet optimization and a more competitive procurement process for materials and equipment. The fleet optimization initiative leverages telematics data to identify all underutilized vehicles and removes them from service. The equipment complement has been reduced by 10% in 2017 and will be maintained at the new optimal level going forward.\nIn December 2017, Hydro One customers started to receive a redesigned electricity bill. The new, easy-to-understand statement was developed using proven research and direct feedback from thousands of customers. Previously, bill-related questions accounted for over 35% of calls to our Customer Contact Centre and Hydro One expects to see a reduction in calls due to improved clarity on the new billing statement. During December 2017, calls related to understanding the bill dropped by 25%.\nAlso in December, Hydro One announced that its contact centre employees, previously contracted out, will be coming back in-house to better serve customers and provide a more seamless experience.\nSeveral customer service initiatives aimed at convenience and affordability, such as the new bill, extended contact centre hours, the revision of collections policies, the elimination of security deposits, Winter Relief and the Affordability Fund, have improved customer satisfaction and helped to reduce overdue accounts receivable by $40 million in 2017.\nIn 2017, distribution customer satisfaction reached 71%, a jump of 5% over 2016 and a four-year high. Transmission customer satisfaction hit 88% in 2017, a 12% increase since 2016.\nAfter a severe winter storm hit Vermont on October 30, 2017, Hydro One received the call for help through the North Atlantic Mutual Assistance Group. The Company assembled a group of 60 employees and 35 vehicles in less than 12 hours to assist Green Mountain Power. Over a three day period, Hydro One was able to restore power to 3,000 customers impacted by the storm.\nIn January 2018, Hydro One was recognized by the EEI with an Emergency Assistance Award for the Company's outstanding restoration efforts following Hurricane Irma in September 2017. Hydro One crews demonstrated their commitment to operational excellence by quickly mobilizing 175 employees to help restore power to more than 10,000 Florida residents after Hurricane Irma pummeled the state and surrounding region.\nOn January 28, 2018, Mr. Paul Dobson was appointed to the position of Chief Financial Officer of Hydro One, effective March 1, 2018. Mr. Dobson was most recently the Chief Financial Officer at Direct Energy Ltd. in Houston, Texas.\nCommon Share Dividends\nFollowing the conclusion of the fourth quarter, on February 12, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of $0.22 per share to be paid on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 13, 2018.\nSupplemental Segment Information\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n(millions of dollars)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\nTransmission\n379\n373\n1,578\n1,584\nDistribution\n1,049\n1,228\n4,366\n4,915\nOther\n11\n13\n46\n53\nTotal revenues\n1,439\n1,614\n5,990\n6,552\nRevenues, net of purchased power\nTransmission\n379\n373\n1,578\n1,584\nDistribution\n387\n370\n1,491\n1,488\nOther\n11\n13\n46\n53\nTotal revenues, net of purchased power\n777\n756\n3,115\n3,125\nIncome (loss) before financing charges and taxes\nTransmission\n189\n170\n783\n812\nDistribution\n139\n111\n508\n501\nOther\n(9)\n(16)\n(59)\n(35)\nTotal income before financing charges and taxes\n319\n265\n1,232\n1,278\nCapital investments\nTransmission\n267\n274\n968\n988\nDistribution\n161\n201\n588\n703\nOther\n3\n2\n11\n6\nTotal capital investments\n431\n477\n1,567\n1,697\nAssets placed in-service\nTransmission\n522\n488\n889\n937\nDistribution\n207\n211\n689\n662\nOther\n4\n—\n14\n6\nTotal assets placed in-service\n733\n699\n1,592\n1,605\nSummary of Fourth Quarter Results of Operations\nNet Income\nNet income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of $155 million is an increase of $27 million or 21.1% from the prior year. Excluding the impact of costs related to the Avista acquisition, net income for the quarter increased by 32.8%.\nRevenues\nThe quarterly increase of $6 million or 1.6% in transmission revenues was primarily due to higher revenues driven by the OEB's decision on the 2017-2018 transmission rates filing, partially offset by lower OEB-approved transmission rates.\nThe quarterly increase of $17 million or 4.6% in distribution revenues, net of purchased power, was primarily due to higher energy consumption mainly resulting from colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2017; and higher external revenues related to CDM incentive bonus; partially offset by reduction in 2017 allowed ROE for the distribution business.\nOM&A Costs\nThe quarterly decrease of $19 million or 19.4% in transmission OM&A costs was primarily due to a reduction of provision for payments in lieu of property taxes following a favourable reassessment of the regulations, lower support services costs, and insurance proceeds received due to equipment failures at the Fairchild and Campbell transmission stations.\nThe quarterly decrease of $17 million or 10.4% in distribution OM&A costs was primarily due to lower expenditures for vegetation management programs due to strategic changes to the forestry program scope that resulted in cost efficiency and improved management of the Company's rights of ways; lower bad debt expense attributable to lower write-offs and improved accounts receivable aging; and a tax recovery of previous year's expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase of $10 million or 4.9% in depreciation and amortization costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly due to the growth in capital assets as the Company continues to place new assets in-service, consistent with its ongoing capital investment program.\nFinancing Charges\nThe quarterly increase of $18 million or 17.8% in financing charges was primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to the Convertible Debentures issued in August 2017; partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on long-term debt resulting from a decrease in weighted average long-term debt outstanding during the quarter, together with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $9 million compared to 2016, and the Company realized an effective tax rate of approximately 19.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to approximately 17.7% realized in 2016. The increase in the tax expense is primarily due to higher income before taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital Investments\nThe decrease in transmission capital investments during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the following:\nlower volume and timing of spare transformer equipment purchases; timing and substantial completion of major development projects, including Guelph Area Transmission Refurbishment, Midtown Transmission Reinforcement, and Holland and Hawthorne transmission stations; and timing of work related to the Clarington Transmission Station project; partially offset by timing on work on station refurbishments and equipment replacement projects; and timing of work at Leamington transmission station.\nThe decrease in distribution capital investments during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the following:\ntiming of capital contributions for jointly used facilities and lower volume of line relocation work; substantial completion of work on the Bolton Operation Centre in the fourth quarter of 2016; lower volume of work within distribution station refurbishment programs; timing of information technology projects including e-Billing and website redesign; lower volume of line refurbishments and replacements work; and lower volume of fleet and work equipment purchases; partially offset by high volume of work on new connections and upgrades due to increased demand.\nAssets Placed In-Service\nThe increase in transmission assets placed in-service during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the following:\nsubstantial investments of major development projects at Leamington and Holland transmission stations were placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2017; higher volume of investments for overhead lines and component refurbishments and replacement programs; timing of assets placed in-service for sustainment investment projects including the transformer asset replacement project at Overbrook transmission station and the breaker replacement project at Richview transmission station; partially offset by a large number of cumulative sustainment investments that were placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2016 at the Bruce A and Burlington transmission stations; timing of investments that were placed in-service for the Advanced Distribution System project; and timing of assets that were placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain information technology development projects.\nThe decrease in distribution assets placed in-service during the fourth quarter was primarily due to the following:\ntiming of distribution station refurbishments and spare transformer purchases; and lower volume of work on distribution generation connection projects; partially offset by higher volume of subdivision connections due to increased demand; and substantial investments that were placed in-service in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the Leamington transmission station feeder development project.\nConsolidated Income Statements\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n(millions of dollars, except per share amounts)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\nDistribution\n1,049\n1,228\n4,366\n4,915\nTransmission\n379\n373\n1,578\n1,584\nOther\n11\n13\n46\n53\n1,439\n1,614\n5,990\n6,552\nCosts\nPurchased power\n662\n858\n2,875\n3,427\nOperation, maintenance and administration\n244\n287\n1,066\n1,069\nDepreciation and amortization\n214\n204\n817\n778\n1,120\n1,349\n4,758\n5,274\nIncome before financing charges and taxes\n319\n265\n1,232\n1,278\nFinancing charges\n119\n101\n439\n393\nIncome before taxes\n200\n164\n793\n885\nIncome taxes\n38\n29\n111\n139\nNet income\n162\n135\n682\n746\nOther comprehensive income\n—\n—\n1\n—\nComprehensive income\n162\n135\n683\n746\nNet income attributable to:\nNoncontrolling interest\n2\n2\n6\n6\nPreferred shareholders\n5\n5\n18\n19\nCommon shareholders\n155\n128\n658\n721\n162\n135\n682\n746\nComprehensive income attributable to:\nNoncontrolling interest\n2\n2\n6\n6\nPreferred shareholders\n5\n5\n18\n19\nCommon shareholders\n155\n128\n659\n721\n162\n135\n683\n746\nBasic EPS\n$0.26\n$0.22\n$1.11\n$1.21\nDiluted EPS\n$0.26\n$0.21\n$1.10\n$1.21\nAdjusted basic EPS\n$0.29\n$0.22\n$1.17\n$1.21\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$0.28\n$0.21\n$1.16\n$1.21\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31 (millions of dollars)\n2017\n2016\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n25\n50\nAccounts receivable\n636\n838\nDue from related parties\n253\n158\nOther current assets\n105\n102\n1,019\n1,148\nProperty, plant and equipment\n19,947\n19,140\nOther long-term assets:\nRegulatory assets\n3,049\n3,145\nDeferred income tax assets\n987\n1,235\nIntangible assets\n369\n349\nGoodwill\n325\n327\nOther assets\n5\n7\n4,735\n5,063\nTotal assets\n25,701\n25,351\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nShort-term notes payable\n926\n469\nLong-term debt payable within one year\n752\n602\nAccounts payable and other current liabilities\n905\n945\nDue to related parties\n157\n147\n2,740\n2,163\nLong-term liabilities\nLong-term debt\n9,315\n10,078\nConvertible debentures\n487\n—\nRegulatory liabilities\n128\n209\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n71\n60\nOther long-term liabilities\n2,707\n2,752\n12,708\n13,099\nTotal liabilities\n15,448\n15,262\nNoncontrolling interest subject to redemption\n22\n22\nEquity\nCommon shares\n5,631\n5,623\nPreferred shares\n418\n418\nAdditional paid-in capital\n49\n34\nRetained earnings\n4,090\n3,950\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(7)\n(8)\nHydro One shareholders' equity\n10,181\n10,017\nNoncontrolling interest\n50\n50\nTotal equity\n10,231\n10,067\n25,701\n25,351\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n(millions of dollars)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nOperating activities\nNet income\n162\n135\n682\n746\nEnvironmental expenditures\n(5)\n(5)\n(24)\n(20)\nAdjustments for non-cash items\nDepreciation and amortization\n190\n182\n727\n688\nRegulatory assets and liabilities\n20\n12\n112\n(16)\nDeferred income taxes\n30\n24\n85\n114\nOther\n12\n4\n21\n10\nChanges in non-cash balances related to operations\n114\n122\n113\n134\nNet cash from operating activities\n523\n474\n1,716\n1,656\nFinancing activities\nLong-term debt issued\n—\n950\n—\n2,300\nLong-term debt repaid\n(601)\n(52)\n(602)\n(502)\nShort-term notes issued\n985\n596\n3,795\n3,031\nShort-term notes repaid\n(953)\n(1,245)\n(3,338)\n(4,053)\nConvertible debentures issued\n—\n—\n513\n—\nDividends paid\n(136)\n(130)\n(536)\n(596)\nDistributions paid to noncontrolling interest\n(2)\n(2)\n(6)\n(9)\nOther\n—\n(4)\n(27)\n(10)\nNet cash from (used in) financing activities\n(707)\n113\n(201)\n161\nInvesting activities\nCapital expenditures\nProperty, plant and equipment\n(396)\n(444)\n(1,467)\n(1,600)\nIntangible assets\n(23)\n(18)\n(80)\n(61)\nCapital contributions received\n—\n6\n—\n21\nAcquisitions\n—\n(221)\n9\n(224)\nOther\n6\n—\n(2)\n3\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(413)\n(677)\n(1,540)\n(1,861)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(597)\n(90)\n(25)\n(44)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n622\n140\n50\n94\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n25\n50\n25\n50\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A).
