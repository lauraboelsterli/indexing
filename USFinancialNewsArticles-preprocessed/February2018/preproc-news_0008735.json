Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - AS Monaco vs Olympique Lyonnais - Stade Louis II, Monaco - February 4, 2018 Monaco's Radamel Falcao in action with Lyon's Jeremy Morel REUTERS/Jean-Pierre Amet \nAt Monaco’s Louis-II stadium, the visitors made a flying start. \nMariano Diaz put Lyon ahead with a 30-metre shot deflected in by Monaco midfielder Youri Tielemans in the 12th minute. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThey doubled their advantage after 28 minutes when Bertrand Traore latched on to Ferland Mendy’s cross at the end of a superb move but Monaco soon pulled one back when Balde slalomed through the Lyon defence and scored with a low shot. \nAfter Kamil Glik was fouled in the box, Radamel Falcao’s penalty was saved but the Colombian striker tucked in the rebound from close range before Balde picked up his second yellow card and was sent off before halftime. \nMonaco sat back after the interval and grabbed all three points when Lopes’s late strike flew into the net.
