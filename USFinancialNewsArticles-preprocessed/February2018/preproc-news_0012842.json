    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Tuesday reported a slightly better-than-expected rise in sales at established restaurants, boosted by menu price increases, as it works to regain customer trust after food safety lapses in 2015.\nSales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months were up 0.9 percent for the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.\nReporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
