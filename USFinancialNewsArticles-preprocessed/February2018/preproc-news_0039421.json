From manufacturing to sales representatives, resort staff, and clinicians in our health clinic, we want to empower all employees to reach their personal and professional goals.”\nIn 1998, James began her career with Cook Medical on the sales team for Urology in Midlands and North Western United Kingdom. While in Europe, she held positions including sales representative and regional manager of Urology for Northern Europe. In 2006, James moved to the U.S. to serve as a global product manager, followed next by a position as National Sales Manager for North America.
