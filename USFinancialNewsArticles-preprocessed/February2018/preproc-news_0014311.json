    "text": "TORONTO, NEW YORK & COLOGNE, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HBC (TSX: HBC ) today announced that, after a careful review and consideration conducted in consultation with our financial and legal advisors which included an in-person meeting with SIGNA Holding GmbH and its advisors, its Board of Directors unanimously rejected the unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company's German business and related real estate assets. Additionally, SIGNA Holding GmbH has withdrawn its offer, thus concluding discussions.\n“The Board has unanimously concluded that Signa’s proposal is not in the best interest of HBC’s shareholders. It significantly undervalues our German business and related real estate assets and is not supported by sufficient certainty of financing to warrant further consideration at this time,” said David Leith, lead independent Director of the Board.\n“Our European business and related real estate assets represent critical components of our long-term strategy and we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive results across our iconic retail banners. Our diverse European real estate holdings add significant value to our global real estate assets and we remain committed to creating opportunities to improve the productivity of our portfolio. The Company appreciates the interest in its European business and real estate assets, which validates the Company’s view of the considerable underlying value these assets provide to HBC’s shareholders. As always, we remain committed to any and all opportunities to enhance shareholder value,” said Richard Baker, HBC’s Governor, Executive Chairman and interim CEO.\nAbout HBC\nHBC is a diversified global retailer focused on driving the performance of high-quality stores and their all-channel offerings, growing through acquisitions, and unlocking the value of real estate holdings. Founded in 1670, HBC is the oldest company in North America. HBC's portfolio today includes formats ranging from luxury to premium department stores to off-price fashion shopping destinations, with more than 480 stores and over 66,000 employees around the world.\nHBC's leading banners across North America and Europe include Hudson's Bay, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Gilt, Saks OFF 5TH, Galeria Kaufhof, the largest department store group in Germany, and Belgium's only department store group, Galeria INNO.\nHBC has significant investments in real estate joint ventures. It has partnered with Simon Property Group Inc. in the HBS Global Properties Joint Venture, which owns properties in the United States and Germany. In Canada, it has partnered with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust in the RioCan-HBC Joint Venture.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, statements with respect to HBC’s long-term strategy, ability to drive results and creating opportunities to improve the productivity of its portfolio and other statements that are not historical facts.
