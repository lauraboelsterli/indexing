    "text": "Acquisition bolsters EP Wealth’s presence in Northern CA and adds $240M in AUM\nTORRANCE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EP Wealth Advisors, LLC (“EP Wealth”), a leading independent registered investment advisor that specializes in client-centric financial planning and investment management services, has announced its acquisition of Millie Capital Management LLC (“MCM”).\nWith offices in Reno, Nev. and Walnut Creek, Calif., MCM is an independent registered investment advisor that specializes in designing investment plans and managing portfolios for high net worth individuals. MCM is dedicated to acting as a fiduciary for its clients and offers specialized services that help investors properly diversify and mitigate investment risk. The firm was founded by Ross Millie in 1991. Millie will assume the role of Senior Wealth Advisor at EP Wealth.\n“Ross has spent the last 27 years building a dedicated fiduciary-minded financial planning practice and helping his clients achieve financial success. His commitment to offering high quality service complements our approach to doing business,” said Patrick Goshtigian, CFA ® , President and CEO of EP Wealth. “Our size and scope can afford Ross greater leverage as he continues to meet these goals. We’re thrilled to partner with a likeminded advisor and work together to promote ongoing client success.”\n“In order for me to spend more time with my clients, I need a partner who offers greater leverage and in-house expertise,” said Millie. “I was most attracted to EP Wealth’s investment philosophy and dedication to achieving consistent returns for its clients. I am excited to offer my clients exposure to this expertise and gain further leverage through EP Wealth’s customized and individualized approach to financial planning.”\nThis is EP Wealth’s third acquisition in Northern California since 2016. Ballou Plum Wealth Advisors in Lafayette joined EP Wealth in Jan. 2016, and Private Capital Management Associates in San Mateo was acquired in June 2017. Today’s transaction marks EP Wealth’s first since taking a minority investment from Wealth Partners Capital Group (“WPCG”), a financial services holding firm, in July 2017.\nWPCG Partner Rich Gill commented, “The financial advice industry is increasingly complex, and EP Wealth offers a unique business model to smaller RIA firms. The partnership they’ve established with MCM showcases the power of their approach, the firm’s robust infrastructure and the team’s deep planning expertise, both for advisors and for the end clients.”\nThe acquisition closed on Feb. 9, 2018 and the transaction will increase EP Wealth’s assets under management by $240 million, as well as add 40 new households with average assets of more than $5 million to its roster. MCM was advised by David Selig, CEO of Advice Dynamics Partners. Financial and legal terms of the deal will not be disclosed.\nAbout EP Wealth Advisors\nEP Wealth Advisors, LLC (“EP Wealth”) is a fee-only registered investment advisor and financial planning firm based in Torrance, CA with additional offices in the San Francisco Bay area, West Los Angeles and Irvine, CA, Seattle and Denver.
