    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 12:09 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Michael Kors' same-store sales fall less than expected Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 7 (Reuters) - Michael Kors Holdings Ltd reported a much smaller-than-expected drop in same-store sales for the holiday quarter during which the affordable luxury products maker sharply cut promotions to reinvigorate sales and brand prestige. \nThe company said same-store sales fell 3.2 percent in its third quarter ended Dec. 30, well below analysts average estimate of a decline of 6.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nKors’s total revenue rose 6.5 percent to $1.44 billion in the quarter, which included two months of sales for Jimmy Choo, the high-end shoemaker it bought last year.
