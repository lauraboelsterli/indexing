    "text": "Published: Feb 28, 2018 12:12 p.m. ET Share \nManafort’s trial to open in September \nBy Getty Images Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \nWASHINGTON -- Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, will face trial in mid-September on charges of conspiring against the U.S., conspiring to launder money, and failing to register as an agent of a foreign power, a federal judge said Wednesday. \nThe Sept. 17 date was set by U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson in Washington’s federal court during a hearing at which the longtime political consultant pleaded not guilty to new charges Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller unveiled last week. \nManafort has also been charged separately by Mueller’s prosecutors in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., on tax and bank-fraud counts. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday on those charges. \nIn both cases, Manafort is accused of seeking to avoid paying taxes on millions of dollars in income he earned for work on behalf of Ukraine’s government and a pro-Russia political party.
