    "text": "SUWANEE, Ga., Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ARRIS International plc (NASDAQ: ARRS) today announced preliminary and unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenues were $1.739 billion GAAP net income was $0.07 per diluted share Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.88 per diluted share End-of-quarter cash resources were $511 million $50 million of share repurchases $822 million of cash resources used to complete Ruckus Networks acquisition Order backlog was $1.1 billion Book-to-bill ratio was 1.02\n\"Our strong fourth quarter results capped a year in which we made important strategic and financial strides in positioning ARRIS for long-term profitable growth,\" said Bruce McClelland, ARRIS CEO. \"A favorable product mix helped drive record quarterly non-GAAP earnings, and we achieved sequential profitability improvement throughout the year, while returning nearly $200 million in capital to shareholders via share repurchases. The recently closed Ruckus acquisition is already contributing to results and creates a more compelling, diversified platform for growth as we deliver innovative connectivity solutions across the enterprise and service provider markets.\"\n\"With respect to the first quarter 2018, we are estimating revenues in the range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion. We expect GAAP net loss per diluted share in the range of $(0.43) to $(0.38) and adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $0.50 to $0.55. For full year 2018, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.100 billion to $7.350 billion, GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.48 to $0.73, and adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.05. We expect our 2018 performance to be driven by our new Enterprise segment, expanded Network and Cloud share, growing international sales, and continued shift to broadband in our CPE business.\"\nARRIS will host its 2018 Investor Day on Wednesday, March 28, 2018 at The Westin New York at Times Square. Registration for the event can be found at the Company's website in the Investor Relations section.\nRevenues in the fourth quarter 2017 of $1.739 billion were down $20 million, or 1%, as compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenues of $1.759 billion.

Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\" or referred to herein as \"reported\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide management and other users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:\nReduction in Revenue Related to Warrants: We entered into agreements with two customers for the issuance of warrants to purchase up to 14.0 million of ARRIS's ordinary shares. Vesting of the warrants is subject to certain purchase volume commitments, and therefore the accounting guidance requires that we record any change in the fair value of warrants as a reduction in revenue. Until final vesting, changes in the fair value of the warrants will be marked to market and any adjustment recorded in revenue. We have excluded the effect of the implied fair value in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of these items on our total revenues and gross margin.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income (loss) measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. We record non-cash compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock units. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of the grants, the non-cash compensation expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods.\nAcquisition Accounting Impacts Related to Deferred Revenue: In connection with our acquisition of Ruckus Networks, business combination rules require us to account for the fair values of arrangements for which acceptance has not been obtained, and post contract support in our purchase accounting. The non-GAAP adjustment to our sales and cost of sales is intended to include the full amounts of such revenues. We believe the adjustment to these revenues is useful as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business. We have historically experienced high renewal rates related to our support agreements and our objective is to increase the renewal rates on acquired post contract support agreements; however, we cannot be certain that our customers will renew our contracts\nAcquisition Accounting Impacts Related to Inventory Valuation: In connection with the accounting related to our acquisitions, business combinations rules require the acquired inventory be recorded at fair value on the opening balance sheet. This is different from historical cost. Essentially we are required to write the inventory up to end customer price less a reasonable margin as a distributor. We have excluded the resulting adjustments in inventory and cost of goods sold as the historic and forward gross margin trends will differ as a result of the adjustments. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of this on cost of goods sold and margin.\nIntegration, Acquisition, Restructuring Costs and Other Costs: We have excluded the effect of acquisition, integration, and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income (loss) measures. We incurred expenses in connection with the ActiveVideo, Pace Combination and pending Ruckus Networks acquisition, which we generally would not otherwise incur in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of transaction costs, costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs, and integration related outside services. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance and abandoned facilities. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income (loss) measures. Amortization of intangible assets is non-cash, and is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangibles: We have excluded the effect of the estimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although an impairment does not directly impact the Company's current cash position, such expense represents the declining value of the technology and other intangible assets that were acquired. We exclude these impairments when significant and they are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\nNoncontrolling Interest share of Non-GAAP Adjustments: The joint venture formed for the ActiveVideo acquisition is accounted for by ARRIS under the consolidation method. As a result, the consolidated statements of operations include the revenues, expenses, and gains and losses of the noncontrolling interest. The amount of net income (loss) related to the noncontrolling interest are reported and presented separately in the consolidated statement of operations. We have excluded the noncontrolling share of any non GAAP adjusted measures recorded by the venture, as we believe it is useful to understand the effect of excluding this item when evaluating our ongoing performance.\nImpairment (Gain) on Investments: We have excluded the effects of other-than-temporary impairments and certain gains on investments in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this non-cash item in our other expense (income).\nDebt Amendment Fees: In 2017, the Company amended its credit agreement. This debt modification allowed us to improve the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and extend the maturitity of the Term Loan B. We have excluded the effect of the associated fees in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this item in our interest expense.\nCredit Facility - Ticking Fees: In connection with our acquisition of Pace, the cash portion of the consideration was funded through debt financing commitments. A ticking fee was paid to our banks to compensate for the time lag between the commitment allocation on a loan and the actual funding. We have excluded the effect of the ticking fee in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this item in our other expense (income).\nForeign Exchange Contract Losses Related to Cash Consideration of Pace Acquisition: In the second quarter of 2015, the Company announced its intent to acquire Pace plc in exchange for stock and cash. We subsequently entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with the cash consideration of the Pace acquisition. These foreign exchange forward contracts were not designated as hedges, and accordingly, all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as a loss (gain) on foreign currency in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this on our other expense (income).\nRemeasurement of Certain Deferred Tax Liabilities: The Company recorded a foreign currency remeasurement (gain) loss related to a deferred income tax liability, in the United Kingdom, arising from the assignment of intangibles acquired in the Pace acquisition. This deferred income tax liability is denominated in GBP. The foreign currency remeasurement gain derives from the remeasurement of the GBP deferred income tax liability to the USD, since the date of the acquisition. We have excluded the impact of this gain in the calculation of our non-GAAP measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this item on our total other expense (income).\nFrance R&D Tax Credit: France R&D tax credits were recorded as an other asset on the date of our acquisition of Pace, as Pace France, a subsidiary of Pace, had a history of losses and did not expect to utilize their R&D Tax Credits against a future France income tax liability but rather expected to use the credits to offset non-income taxes. In the third quarter of 2016, our restructuring in France required a reclassification of the R&D tax credits from other assets to deferred tax assets prior to the utilization of the tax credits. This impact of the reclassification was a charge to other expense with an offsetting tax benefit. However, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined that the original classification within income taxes was more appropriate and therefore the reclassification from the third quarter of 2016 reversed. We have excluded the effect of the other expense and tax benefit in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of this event on our total other expense (income) and income tax.\nForeign Withholding Tax: In connection with our acquisition of Pace, ARRIS US Holdings, Inc. transferred shares of its subsidiary ARRIS Financing II Sarl to ARRIS International plc. Under U.S. tax law, based on the best available information, we believe the transfer constituted a deemed distribution from ARRIS U.S. Holdings Inc. to ARRIS International plc that is treated as a dividend for U.S. tax purposes. A deemed dividend of this type is subject to U.S. withholding tax to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits (as computed for tax purposes) (\"E&P\") of ARRIS U.S. Holdings Inc., which include the E&P of the former ARRIS Group, Inc. and subsidiaries through December 31, 2016. Accordingly, ARRIS U.S. Holdings Inc. remitted U.S. withholding tax in the amount of $55 million based upon its estimated E&P of $1.1 billion and the U.S. dividend withholding tax rate of 5 percent (as provided in Article 10 (Dividends) of the United Kingdom-United States Tax Treaty). We have excluded the withholding tax in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit): We have excluded the tax effect of the non-GAAP items mentioned above. Additionally, we have excluded the effects of certain tax adjustments related to tax and legal restructuring, state valuation allowances, research and development tax credits and provision to return differences.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arris-announces-preliminary-and-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300598906.html\nSOURCE ARRIS",
