This guidance includes approximately $5 million of incremental revenue from adopting ASC 606. For the quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company expects revenue in the range of $119 to $123 million, compared to first quarter 2017 revenue of $101.7 million, representing growth of approximately 17% to 21%. This guidance includes approximately $2 million of incremental revenue from adopting ASC 606.\nFuture results may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains.\n1 On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, which changes the way public companies recognize revenue, as well as certain related costs and expenses. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial trends. The Company's 2018 guidance reflects the adoption of this standard on a prospective basis and it anticipates the most significant impact relates to the timing of revenue recognition within its drug delivery product line.\nConference Call:\nInsulet will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on February 21, 2018 to discuss the financial results and outlook. The link to the live call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://investors.insulet.com , \"Events and Presentations\", and will be archived for future reference.
