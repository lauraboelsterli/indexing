    "text": "(Reuters) - Luke List and Jamie Lovemark took a one-stroke lead at the Honda Classic in Florida on a windy Friday as Tiger Woods fought back from late trouble to sit four back after a one-over par 71.\nList, one of the early starters, shot the day’s low round, a four-under 66, to complete the second round at PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, at three-under 137.\nLovemark later shot a 69 for a share of the halfway lead.\nFirst-day co-leader Webb Simpson was in a group of four one stroke behind the leading pair.\nWoods, making his third start of the PGA Tour season after a year-long absence following back surgery, rebounded nicely from a rough 30 minutes to go one-over for the tournament at 141.\nAfter a bogey and two birdies left him one-under for the day through 14, Woods found water at 15 and wound up with a double-bogey five.\nA bogey at the next hole resulted in a three-stroke turn around in two holes.\nBut the 14-times major champion birdied the 17th and finished with a par to remain in contention.\nSimpson shot 72 to join Briton Tommy Fleetwood (68), American Russell Henley (70) and South African Rory Sabbatini (69) at two-under 138.\nSwede Alex Noren, who had shared the lead with Simpson, shot 75 to wind up in Wood’s group of 10 at 141.\nRory McIlroy shot a second consecutive 72 but defending champion Rickie Fowler failed to make the projected cut after a 76 for a 147 total.\nReporting by Gene Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
