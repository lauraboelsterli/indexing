    "text": "Weston, FL, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monaker Group (OTCQB: MKGI), a travel and technology company focused on the alternative lodging rental (ALR) market, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a 1-for-2.5 reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split is anticipated to be effective prior to the stock market opening on February 12, 2018. With the successful implementation of the reverse stock split and provided that the Company's common stock meets the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement, the Company believes it will meet the final requirement for listing Monaker's common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market within the coming weeks.\n\"We have elected to affect a reverse stock split to allow Monaker to meet the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market,\" stated Bill Kerby, CEO of Monaker. \"We believe that listing on NASDAQ should help broaden our shareholder base, increase appeal to institutional investors, provide shareholders with better liquidity and, as a result, could ultimately contribute to increasing shareholder value.\" The Board made the decision that the Company should take steps necessary to uplist the company’s common stock on NASDAQ as we deploy the the travel industry’s first B2B reservation system supporting instantaneous booking for over a million alternative lodging rentals with several large established lodging distribution partners.\"\nEach stockholder's percentage ownership interest in Monaker Group and the proportional voting power will remain unchanged after the reverse stock split, except for minimal changes due to rounding. In addition, the rights and privileges of the holders of Monaker’s common stock are unaffected by the reverse stock split. This reverse stock split is anticipated to become effective prior to market open on February 12, 2018 and the Company's common stock will begin trading on a post-split basis under the symbol \"MKGID\" at the open of trading on Monday, February 12, 2018.\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, every 2.5 shares of issued and outstanding common stock will be exchanged for one share of common stock, with all fractional shares being rounded up to the nearest whole share. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of issued and outstanding common stock from approximately 20.3 million pre-split shares to approximately 8.1 million post-split shares. Proportional adjustments will be made to Monaker's outstanding warrants.\nThe Company's ticker symbol will remain unchanged, although a \"D\" will be placed at the end of the MKGI ticker symbol (MKGID) for 20 business days following the stock split. The Company's common stock will also be identified under a new CUSIP number (609011200). Before any listing of the common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market can occur, NASDAQ will need to finalize the Company's application for listing. There can be no assurance that the Company's application for listing will be approved.\nAdditional information regarding the reverse stock split is contained in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K as filed with the SEC on February 12, 2018.\nAbout Monaker Group\nMonaker Group is a technology-driven travel company focused on delivering innovation to alternative lodging rentals (ALR) market.
