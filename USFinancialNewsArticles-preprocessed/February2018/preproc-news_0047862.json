    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bowers & Wilkins, the British loudspeaker brand known for its high-performance audio products, continues to expand its growing sales channel with another audio industry veteran, Andrew Kissinger. Joining as Regional Sales Manager for the Southwest Territory, Kissinger represents another in a series of high profile appointments at Bowers & Wilkins, following the announcements of Kevin Wolff as Director of North American Sales and David Ellington as Regional Sales Manager Southern Territory late last year.\nKissinger's career in premium audio spans over 18 years and began in Southern California where he joined The Good Guys selling audio/video products throughout California. He moved to an Inside Sales role and ultimately a Regional Sales Manager position for AudioQuest and contributed to supporting the day-to-day operations of the Distributor in Mexico as well. He has received numerous accolades including Dealerscope Magazines 40 under 40 and has earned a reputation for excellent customer service, a passion for the channel, and supporting the premium audio space.\nIn his new role, Kissinger will be responsible for managing the Southwest Sales Territory of the rapidly expanding Bowers & Wilkins product family â€“ including the recently announced 700 Series, the PX Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones, the DB Series Subwoofer, and the Rotel line.\n\"We are excited to welcome Andrew to our continually growing North American Sales team,\" said Richard Campbell, Chief Revenue Officer. \"He has a reputation of building deep relationships through exceptional customer service and growing the business within our core dealer channel which is an excellent match with the quality and reputation you expect from the Bowers & Wilkins.\"\n\"I am very excited to be joining the Bowers and Wilkins team,\" said Kissinger. \"Bowers & Wilkins has been a brand I have admired for many years. The opportunity to work with the premier audio brand in the industry is one I could not be happier to have and I look forward to representing and building the brand in the Southwest Territory of the U.S.\" Kissinger represents yet another senior hire on the expanding North American sales team since Richard Campbell took over Bowers & Wilkins global sales this past year. The hire represents a continuing investment in the brand as they continue to strengthen its already premier position as the leader for performance audio across custom install, luxury home speakers, headphones and performance car audio.\nAbout Bowers & Wilkins\nBowers & Wilkins is Britain's leading manufacturer of high performance speakers and headphones.
