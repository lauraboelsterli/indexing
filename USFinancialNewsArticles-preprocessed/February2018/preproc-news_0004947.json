    "text": "Performance Highlights\nRecord high total assets of $1.7 billion, net loans of $1.3 billion, and deposits of $1.4 billion.\nNet interest margin, taxable equivalent, increased to 4.64 percent in the quarter due to higher earning assets yields.\nEfficiency ratio decreased by over 4 percentage points to 74.3 percent, while operating efficiency ratio dropped to 60.7 percent.\nNet operating earnings available to common shareholders totaled $3.7 million in the quarter and net operating ROAA increased to 0.99 percent.\nAsset quality was outstanding with nonperforming assets to total assets of just 0.29 percent.\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SmartFinancial, Inc. (\"SmartFinancial\") (NASDAQ:SMBK), announced today net income per common share of $38 thousand in its fourth quarter of 2017 or $0.00 per share, compared to $1.4 million or $0.23 per share a year ago. On November 1, 2017, SmartFinancial completed the acquisition of Capstone Bancshares and Capstone Community Bank and this quarter includes two months of the results of the acquired companies. This quarter also included $1.7 million in pre-tax merger related charges and a $2.5 million after-tax charge to reduce the value of the firm's deferred tax assets as a result of the tax law signed in December.\nBilly Carroll stated “We are extremely proud of our achievements in the fourth quarter and for the year. 2017 was a transformative year for SmartFinancial. We completed a branch acquisition in Cleveland, TN in the second quarter, announced and closed our Tuscaloosa, AL-based Capstone Bancshares deal and in the fourth quarter announced the Tennessee Bancshares acquisition to expand our footprint in Middle Tennessee and Huntsville, AL. Our pre-tax financial results were very solid, even while closing Capstone during the quarter. Net Operating Earnings per common share were $0.35 compared to $0.23 a year ago.\n\"The passage of the tax reform legislation will have a very positive impact on our earnings stream as we move into 2018, but it required us to revalue our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $2.5 million non-cash charge to tax expense. Despite the one-time charge, the tax reform will be very good for our company, our industry, and our shareholders.\n\"The company’s organic growth continued to be strong, even while working on various acquisition initiatives. Including a particularly robust $83 million for the fourth quarter. This growth has been accomplished with maintaining outstanding credit quality with a 0.29 percent non-performing assets-to-assets ratio. All of our markets continue to trend well and our credit metrics show no deterioration. Also important to note, our core margin remains strong, even with a slight increase in funds costs. Our efficiency ratio was down quarter to quarter, even with the merger-related expenses. This remains a key emphasis for our management team and will continue to be a focus as we integrate our upcoming acquisitions.\"\nSmartFinancial's Chairman, Miller Welborn, concluded: \"I’ve been extremely pleased with our team’s effort during the quarter and the year and we’ve now positioned the company to capitalize on the foundation we’ve built over the last two years. Our fourth quarter core operating metrics give a glimpse of what our company’s future holds. Our management has been working to make sure we have a successful integration of Capstone and of Southern Community Bank in 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 compared to Third Quarter 2017\nNet income available to common shareholders totaled $38 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017.
