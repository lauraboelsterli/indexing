Financial results will be released before the market opens on Tuesday February 20, 2018.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Copper Mountain's mill throughput averaged 40,130 tpd, producing 22.3 million pounds of copper equivalent, including 19.5 million pounds of copper plus gold and silver credits, for a 2017 total of 88.3 million pounds of copper equivalent, including 75.8 million pounds of copper plus gold and silver credits, hitting our guidance target range.\nThe copper price averaged US$2.79/Lb in 2017, well above the previous year's average of US$2.20/Lb. Currently, copper is approximately US$3.21/Lb, which bodes well for CMMC shareholders.\nCopper Mountain's business strategy continues to unfold as planned:\nWe have an efficient and strong operational base from which to grow . Organically , we are testing areas underneath our existing pit and are drilling the adjacent New Ingerbelle deposit to be included in our next updated 43-101 resource/reserve statement planned for Q2-2018. Results so far are encouraging. In M&A news, Copper Mountain announced plans to acquire Altona Mining (Australia), en route to our plans for Copper Mountain mine #2.
