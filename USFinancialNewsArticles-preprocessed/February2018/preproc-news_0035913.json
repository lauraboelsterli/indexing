    "text": "Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan on Tuesday reiterated that the bank was stable after the U.S. Federal Reserve imposed several regulatory restrictions, and said there was no change to his cost-cutting measures.\nSpeaking at Credit Suisse’s financial services conference at Key Biscayne, Florida, Sloan said his company had plans in place to address the Fed’s concerns about its ability to improve governance and controls after the sales scandal that erupted in 2016.\nThe U.S. federal reserve in early February imposed several regulatory restrictions on the third-largest U.S. bank - a move that Wells estimates will cut its annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year.
