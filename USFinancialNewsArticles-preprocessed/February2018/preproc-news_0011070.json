    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Any congressional immigration plan that does not provide for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ‘is a total waste of time,’ U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday as two top senators planned to unveil a bipartisan compromise plan.\n“Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!” Trump wrote on Twitter.\nReporting by Susan HeaveyEditing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
