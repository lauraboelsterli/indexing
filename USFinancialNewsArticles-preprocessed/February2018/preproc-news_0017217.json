Clay (collectively with certain other participants in the solicitation, the \"Concerned Aviragen Shareholders Group\", the \"CAS Group\", \"we\" or \"us\"), who are significant stockholders of Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Aviragen\", \"AVIR\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: AVIR), with collective beneficial ownership of approximately 8.3% of AVIR's outstanding shares of common stock (the \"Common Stock\"), today announced that it has carefully reviewed and considered the improved terms of the proposed merger (the \"Merger\") between the Company and Vaxart, Inc. (\"Vaxart\") recently announced by the Company and that, in light of these recent developments, the CAS Group is now in support of the Merger. The Company previously announced that the special meeting (the \"Special Meeting\") of Aviragen stockholders, originally scheduled for February 6, 2018, was adjourned to February 9, 2018. We anticipate that the Company will further adjourn the Special Meeting to February 13, 2018. The new deal terms were set forth in the Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of October 27, 2017 (as amended and may be amended, modified or amended and restated from time to time, the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among the Company, Agora Merger Sub, Inc. and Vaxart, filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2018.\nThe CAS Group also announced that it has entered into a Settlement Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with the Company and Vaxart in connection with the Special Meeting.

In addition, pursuant to the Agreement, the CAS Group withdrew its nomination of directors in connection with the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and agreed to vote all shares of Common Stock held by the CAS Group at the Annual Meeting in favor of the directors nominated for election by the Board. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to reimburse the CAS Group for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with, among other things its solicitation in connection with the Special Meeting, not to exceed $200,000.\nThe CAS Group will vote all proxies it has received from Aviragen stockholders at the Special Meeting pursuant to the instructions provided by such stockholders.\nYOU MAY REVOKE ANY PROXY BY SIGNING, DATING AND RETURNING A NEW PROXY CARD.
