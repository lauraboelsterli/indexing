In the last few weeks we have not played our best cricket. To be able to put some pressure on the Indians was a good feeling,” South Africa captain Aiden Markram said at the post-match presentation. \nIndia won the toss and chose to bat, and their innings was anchored by the excellent left-hander Dhawan, who put on 158 for the second wicket with captain Virat Kohli (75 from 83 balls). \nAt that stage India had looked on course for a score well in excess of 320 but managed only 83 runs for the loss of five more wickets in the final 15 overs after the players had left the field because of the threat of lightning. \nThe hosts reached 43 for one in 7.2 overs in their reply when rain swept across the ground, keeping the players off the field for just shy of two hours. MAGNIFICENT MILLER \nTheir shortened innings forced South Africa to be more positive against the Indian spinners and this worked to their advantage as they launched both Chahal (1-68 in 5.3 overs) and Yadav (2-51 in 6 overs) over the boundary with regularity. \nDavid Miller (39 from 28 balls) survived being bowled by leg-spinner Chahal off a no-ball when he had seven and put on a crucial stand of 72 in 41 balls for the fifth wicket with the impressive Heinrich Klaasen (43 not out in 27 balls) that turned the tide in the favour of the home side. \n“It became a T20 game and you have to take your chances,” Kohli said. “If it was a full game, you never know. Give credit to South Africa, they played with a lot of character and deserved to win.” Reporting   Dalton",
