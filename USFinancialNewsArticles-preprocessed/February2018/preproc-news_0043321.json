Metro, which raised equity to fuel its growth in 2017, issued new targets for 2023 and increased some of its 2020 targets on Wednesday. Analysts have long suggested that the bank’s quick pace of growth is likely to force it to return to the market to seek fresh capital. (Reporting by Esha Vaish in Bengaluru)",
