    "text": "BELLEVILLE, Wis., Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Duluth Holdings Inc. (dba, Duluth Trading Company) (“Duluth Trading”) (“Company”) (NASDAQ:DLTH), a lifestyle brand of men’s and women’s casual wear, workwear and accessories, today announced the retirement of two members of its Board of Directors.\nWilliam E. Ferry and C. Roger Lewis informed the Company that they have independently decided not to stand for re-election to Duluth’s Board of Directors at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Mr. Ferry, age 77, has been a member of the Board since September 2015 and had served on the Company’s advisory board since 1992, and Mr. Lewis, age 75, has served on the Board since September 2015 and had served on the advisory board since 2007. Both will continue to serve as directors until the close of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nStephen L. Schlecht, Executive Chairman of Duluth Holdings, said, \"Bill Ferry and Roger Lewis have shared their wealth of knowledge, experience and insight that have greatly benefited Duluth both as a private and public Company. On behalf of our board of directors, I wish to extend our sincerest gratitude to both Bill and Roger for their significant contributions to the Company over many years. Their leadership and collaboration on the board will be greatly missed and we wish them the very best in their well-earned retirements and all their future endeavors.”\nIn their communications with the board, each of Mr. Ferry and Mr. Lewis stated his decision was a desire to retire and not due to any disagreements or company-related issues. At the present time, the Company intends to launch a search to fill the two independent board seats.\nAbout Duluth Trading\nDuluth Trading is a rapidly growing lifestyle brand for the Modern, Self-Reliant American.
