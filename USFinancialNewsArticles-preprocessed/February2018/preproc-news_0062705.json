    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. (GBT) (NASDAQ:GBT) today reported recent business progress and financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We continue to build positive momentum toward bringing voxelotor, the first and only sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to the SCD community,” said Ted W. Love, M.D., president and chief executive officer of GBT. “We expect to continue this momentum in 2018, as we expect to announce top-line clinical data from our ongoing voxelotor clinical programs - HOPE Study Part A and HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. We are also working diligently to diversify our pipeline, both through our internal research as well as through business development efforts, by exploring innovative opportunities that have the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of underserved patient communities.”\nRecent Business Progress\nSickle Cell Disease (SCD)\nReceived acceptance of four abstracts for poster presentations at the upcoming 2018 American Society of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology (ASPHO) Conference, which will be held May 2-5 in Pittsburgh. Received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for voxelotor for the treatment of SCD in January 2018. Presented results from six studies at the 59th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition, including results from the ongoing Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, which demonstrated that voxelotor provided clinical benefits in children age 12 to 17, and a case series of seven patients with severe SCD who were treated with voxelotor through single-patient compassionate access. Announced that the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 HOPE ( H emoglobin O xygen Affinity Modulation to Inhibit HbS P olym E rization) Study evaluating voxelotor for the treatment of SCD, completed its first scheduled clinical safety review. Based on the available safety data to date, the DSMB recommended that this pivotal study continue as planned and approved initiation of enrollment in adolescent patients age 12 to 17.\nCorporate\nRaised approximately $110.9 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting costs and commissions and estimated offering expenses, from an underwritten public offering in December 2017 and related exercise of the over-allotment option in January 2018. Appointed Wendy L. Yarno to the Company’s board of directors. Ms. Yarno has more than 25 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, including serving as chief marketing officer for Merck & Co. Inc.\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $329.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $197.3 million at December 31, 2016. This amount excludes approximately $14.5 million that resulted from the underwriters exercising their over-allotment option in January 2018.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $41.3 million compared with $27.2 million for the same period in 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $0.94 compared with $0.74 for the same period in 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $117.0 million compared with $82.5 million for the same period in 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $2.76 compared with $2.48 for the same period in 2016. We expect our net loss to increase during 2018 as we expand our manufacturing efforts for voxelotor, increase patient enrollment in our various SCD clinical trials and increase general and administrative (G&A) spending as we prepare for the potential commercial launch of voxelotor in SCD.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $31.3 million compared with $20.9 million for the same period in 2016. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $87.8 million compared with $62.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses for both comparative periods is primarily attributable to increased expenses for the Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study and the pivotal HOPE Study. Total R&D stock compensation expense incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $1.8 million, compared with $1.9 million for the same period in 2016. Total R&D stock compensation expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $5.9 million, compared with $4.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nG&A expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $10.6 million compared with $6.6 million for the same period in 2016. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $31.4 million compared with $21.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses for both comparative periods is primarily attributable to increased employee-related costs and increased professional and consulting services associated with the growth of the Company's operations. Total G&A stock compensation expense incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $2.9 million, compared with $1.5 million for the same period in 2016. Total G&A stock compensation expense incurred in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $7.8 million, compared with $5.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nAbout GBT\nGBT is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company determined to discover, develop and deliver innovative treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities.
