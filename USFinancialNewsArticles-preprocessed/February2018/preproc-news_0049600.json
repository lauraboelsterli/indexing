The company repurchased 2,600 shares of its common stock during the quarter at an average price of $169.93.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights:\nTotal revenues were $840.7 million, up 11.2 percent from $756.0 million in 2016. Recurring revenue from maintenance and subscriptions was $535.1 million, up 14.9 percent compared to 2016, and comprised 63.6 percent of 2017 revenue. Operating income was $160.9 million, up 22.6 percent from $131.3 million in 2016. Net income was $163.9 million, or $4.18 per diluted share, up 49.2 percent compared to $109.9 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, in 2016. Cash flows from operations were $195.8 million, up 2.0 percent compared to $191.9 million in 2016. Non-GAAP total revenues were $841.8 million, up 9.1 percent from $771.6 million in 2016.

Non-GAAP net income was $153.9 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, up 13.3 percent compared to $135.8 million, or $3.49 per diluted share, in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $254.3 million, up 12.3 percent compared to $226.4 million in 2016. Total backlog was $1.1 billion, up 17.6 percent from $953.3 million at December 31, 2016. Software-related backlog (excluding appraisal services) was $1.1 billion, an increase of 18.4 percent compared to $914.6 million at December 31, 2016. The company repurchased 44,496 shares of its common stock during the year at an average price of $148.62.\n“We are pleased with Tyler's very strong finish to 2017,” said John S. Marr Jr., Tyler’s chairman and chief executive officer. “We achieved double-digit total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with subscription revenue growth of 26 percent. In addition, license and royalties revenue reached a new quarterly high, surpassing $20 million for the first time. We also achieved an increase in our non-GAAP operating margin of 120 basis points.\n\"Our GAAP effective tax rate was favorably impacted in the fourth quarter by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Going forward, we expect that our effective tax rate will benefit significantly from the reduction in corporate tax rates as a result of the Tax Act.\n“Market activity and our competitive position in the local government software market remain strong and our total bookings for the quarter rose 37 percent. Bookings under both our license and subscription models were robust, and subscription arrangements comprised approximately 33 percent of the total dollar volume of new software contracts. We added approximately $7 million in annual recurring revenues from software subscriptions in the fourth quarter, an increase of 156 percent over last year. Annual bookings for 2017 exceeded $1 billion for the first time, and year-end backlog was $1.1 billion, up 18 percent over last year.\n\"With our positive outlook for 2018 and our strong financial position and cash flow, supplemented by the benefit of lower tax rates, we plan to make incremental research and development investments to continue to expand our market-leading position in public sector software and drive future growth. We expect to increase our R&D spend by more than 20 percent in 2018, while continuing to pursue strategic acquisitions at reasonable valuations,” said Marr.\nGuidance for 2018\nAs of February 21, 2018, Tyler Technologies is providing the guidance below for the full year 2018. This guidance reflects the preliminary estimated impact of ASC 606, which Tyler expects to adopt using the full retrospective method effective January 1, 2018.\nGAAP total revenues are expected to be in the range of $912 million to $928 million. Non-GAAP total revenues are expected to be in the range of $913 million to $929 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be approximately between $3.65 and $3.75 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option exercises on the GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be approximately between $4.73 and $4.83. Pretax non-cash, share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $49 million. Research and development expense is expected to be between $58 million and $60 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 40.0 million and 40.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 11 percent after discrete tax items and includes approximately $26 million of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be 24 percent. This was adjusted from 35 percent in 2017 primarily because of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $22 million and $25 million, including approximately $1 million related to real estate. Total depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $59 million, including approximately $35 million of amortization of acquisition intangibles.\nThe actual impact of ASC 606 is subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including the mix and timing of new contracts and specific terms contained in individual contracts. For comparison purposes, Tyler's guidance for 2018 under the prior ASC 605 basis would be as follows:\nGAAP total revenues would be expected to be in the range of $918 million to $934 million. Non-GAAP total revenues would be expected to be in the range of $919 million to $935 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share would be expected to be approximately between $3.75 and $3.85. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would be expected to be approximately between $4.81 and $4.91.\nGAAP to non-GAAP guidance reconciliation\nNon-GAAP total revenues is derived from adding back the estimated full year impact of write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and amortization of acquired leases of approximately $1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is derived by adding back the estimated full year impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense and employer portion of payroll tax related to employee stock transactions of approximately $49 million, and amortization of acquired software and intangible assets of approximately $35 million. Additionally, the non-GAAP tax rate of 24 percent is estimated periodically as described below under \" \" and excludes approximately $26 million of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation that are included in the GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate.\nConference Call\nTyler Technologies will hold a conference call on Thursday, February 22, at 10:00 a.m. EST to discuss the company’s results.

More information about Tyler Technologies, headquartered in Plano, Texas, can be found at www.tylertech.com .\nTyler Technologies has provided in this press release financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are therefore considered non-GAAP financial measures. This information includes non-GAAP revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Tyler’s ongoing operational performance because they provide additional insight in comparing results from period to period. Tyler believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above exclude write-downs of acquisition-related deferred revenue and acquired leases, share-based compensation expense, employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, acquisition-related costs, and expenses associated with amortization of intangibles arising from business combinations.\nHistorically, for the purpose of determining non-GAAP net income, Tyler has used a non-GAAP tax rate of 35 percent in its calculation of the tax impact related to certain non-GAAP adjustments. Beginning in 2017, Tyler is adjusting its non-GAAP pretax income using a tax rate equal to Tyler's annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on Tyler's estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating Tyler's non-GAAP income, as well as significant non-recurring tax adjustments. The non-GAAP tax rate used in future periods will be reviewed periodically to determine whether it remains appropriate in consideration of factors including Tyler's periodic effective tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP, changes resulting from tax legislation, changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses, and other factors deemed significant. Due to differences in tax treatment of items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as wells as the methodology applied to Tyler's estimated annual tax rate as described above, the estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income may differ from the GAAP tax rate and from Tyler's actual tax liabilities.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures used by Tyler Technologies may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis document contains “ ” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business.
