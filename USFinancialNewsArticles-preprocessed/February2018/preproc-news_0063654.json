    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today responded to Broadcom Limited's (NASDAQ: AVGO) misleading comments regarding Qualcomm's engagement with Broadcom in connection with its proposal to acquire Qualcomm:\n\"The latest statement issued by Broadcom is disingenuous and clearly intended to create a false impression about Qualcomm's level of engagement. In fact, Qualcomm has repeatedly attempted to engage with Broadcom on issues including price, including at meetings on February 14 and February 23. In each of those meetings, Broadcom has refused to engage on price.\nEarlier today, Qualcomm made a comprehensive proposal that addresses regulatory and other merger agreement issues in order to clear the way for a price discussion with Broadcom. The ball is in Broadcom's court to let us know whether it is willing to engage with us. Qualcomm's Board remains unanimous in its view that Broadcom's current offer of $79.00 per share, as well as the previous offer of $82.00 per share, materially undervalues the company.\nBroadcom's statements about Qualcomm considering moving the date of its annual meeting are false. Qualcomm has no intention of delaying the annual meeting and made that clear to Broadcom during our February 23 meeting.\"\nVOTE the WHITE proxy card today.\nRe-elect the Qualcomm Board online, by telephone, or by signing, dating and returning the WHITE proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.\nDISCARD any BLUE proxy cards you receive from Broadcom.\nVoting the BLUE proxy card, even if you \"withhold\" on all nominees, will revoke any vote you had previously submitted on Qualcomm's WHITE proxy card. You have every right to change your vote - only your latest-dated proxy will be counted at the 2018 Annual Meeting.\nIf you have questions, or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact:\nINNISFREE M&A INCORPORATED\nStockholders May Call:\nToll-Free (877) 456-3442 (from the U.S. and Canada)\n(412) 232-3651 (from other locations)\nBanks and Brokers May Call Collect: (212) 750-5833\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.
