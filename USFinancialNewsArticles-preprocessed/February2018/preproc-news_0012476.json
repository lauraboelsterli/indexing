    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Everest Re Group, Ltd. (NYSE: RE) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $571.0 million, or $13.85 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $373.6 million, or $9.08 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. After-tax operating income 1 , excluding realized capital gains and losses and the tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), was $556.0 million, or $13.48 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to after-tax operating income¹ of $363.4 million, or $8.83 per diluted common share, for the same period last year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $469.0 million, or $11.36 per diluted common share, compared to $996.3 million, or $23.68 per diluted common share, for 2016. After-tax operating income 1 , excluding realized capital gains and losses and the tax charge related to the enactment of the TCJA, was $375.4 million, or $9.10 per diluted common share, for the full year 2017, compared to $993.5 million or $23.61 per diluted common share, for 2016.\nCommenting on the Company’s results, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominic J. Addesso said, “Everest experienced an exceptional quarter with $556 million of net operating income, giving rise to a respectable year of earnings, despite 2017 being one of the most costly catastrophe loss years on record. The underlying results were quite strong with an attritional combined ratio for the year of 85.0%. More importantly is that all segments contributed to these positive results. For the full year, Everest generated a 6% ROE and reached a new milestone with premium of $7.2 billion.”\nOperating highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 included the following:\nGross written premiums for the quarter were $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, gross written premiums grew 19% to $7.2 billion. Eliminating reinstatement premiums and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, total premiums were actually up 16% for the year. Worldwide reinsurance premiums were up 17%, on this same basis, while direct insurance premiums were up 15% for the year. The combined ratio was 70.0% for the quarter and 103.5% for the year, compared to 82.1% and 87.0%, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. The quarter benefitted from net prior year reserve releases of $262.1 million and a net reduction to prior period catastrophe loss estimates of $132.7 million, including a $102.7 million reduction in the catastrophe loss estimates for the third quarter 2017 events. This was offset by $161.5 million for catastrophe losses that occurred in the quarter, including both the Northern and Southern California wildfires. For the full year, catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums, totaled $1.3 billion. Excluding catastrophe losses, reinstatement premiums and favorable prior year loss development, the calendar year attritional combined ratio was 85.0% compared to 85.5% for 2016. Net investment income amounted to $149.1 million for the quarter and $542.9 million for the full year 2017, up 15% over the full year 2016 results. Net after-tax realized capital gains totaled $23.2 million in the quarter. For the full year, realized capital gains, net of tax, amounted to $101.8 million, while unrealized capital losses, net of tax, were $71.3 million. Cash flow from operations was $118.5 million for the quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year 2017. This compared to $422.9 million and $1.4 billion for the same periods, respectively, in 2016. For the year, the after-tax operating income 1 return on average adjusted shareholders’ equity 2 was 4.6%. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) resulted in a charge of $8.2 million in the quarter, or $0.20 per diluted common share. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has proposed a change in accounting standards that, if adopted, would require certain income tax effects of the TCJA to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (OCI) to retained earnings. If the FASB adopts that proposal prior to the filing of the Company’s Form 10-K, the Company intends to “early adopt” the updated accounting standard and reflect it in the financial statements filed with its Form 10-K, resulting in an estimated $1.3 million decline in OCI with a corresponding increase in retained earnings. Further information about this proposed change in accounting standards is available in the Company’s Form 8-K filed in connection with this news release. During the quarter and for the full year, the Company purchased 236,493 shares for a total cost of $50 million. The repurchases were made pursuant to a share repurchase authorization, provided by the Company’s Board of Directors, under which there remains 1.8 million shares available. Shareholders’ equity ended the year at $8.4 billion. Book value per share increased 4% from $197.45 at year-end 2016 to $204.95 at December 31, 2017.\nThis news release contains within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

The supplemental financial information may also be obtained by contacting the Company directly.\n1 The Company generally uses after-tax operating income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its performance. After-tax operating income (loss) consists of net income (loss) excluding after-tax net realized capital gains (losses) and the tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) as the following reconciliation displays:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) (unaudited) Per Diluted Per Diluted Per Diluted Per Diluted Common Common Common Common Amount Share Amount Share Amount Share Amount Share Net income (loss) $ 571,025 $ 13.85 $ 373,572 $ 9.08 $ 468,968 $ 11.36 $ 996,344 $ 23.68 After-tax net realized capital gains (losses) 23,226 0.56 10,180 0.25 101,806 2.47 2,878 0.07 Impact of TCJA enactment (8,246 ) (0.20 ) - - (8,246 ) (0.20 ) - - After-tax operating income (loss) $ 556,045 $ 13.48 $ 363,392 $ 8.83 $ 375,408 $ 9.10 $ 993,466 $ 23.61 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Although net realized capital gains (losses) are an integral part of the Company’s insurance operations, the determination of net realized capital gains (losses) is independent of the insurance underwriting process. The Company believes that the level of net realized capital gains (losses) for any particular period is not indicative of the performance of the underlying business in that particular period. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it more difficult for users of the financial information to evaluate the Company’s success or failure in its basic business, and may lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The Company understands that the equity analysts who follow the Company focus on after-tax operating income (loss) in their analyses for the reasons discussed above. The Company provides after-tax operating income (loss) to investors so that they have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information concerning the Company’s performance.\n2 Adjusted shareholders’ equity excludes net after-tax unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of investments\n--Financial Details Follow--\nEVEREST RE GROUP, LTD.
