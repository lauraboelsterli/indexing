These terms are defined elsewhere in this release. Please see the schedules appearing later in this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nPreliminary Full-Year 2017 Operating Results\nAgent Count\nThe following table compares agent count as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nAs of December 31\nChange\n2017\n2016\n#\n%\nU.S.\n63,162\n61,730\n1,432\n2.3%\nCanada\n21,112\n20,672\n440\n2.1%\nSubtotal\n84,274\n82,402\n1,872\n2.3%\nOutside the U.S. & Canada\n34,767\n29,513\n5,254\n17.8%\nTotal\n119,041\n111,915\n7,126\n6.4%\nRevenue\nRE/MAX Holdings generated total revenue of $195.9 million for the full-year 2017, an increase of $19.6 million or 11.1% compared to $176.3 million in full-year 2016. Revenue increased 7.6% from the acquired independent regions, 3.3% from organic growth and 0.3% from foreign-currency movements. Organic growth was driven primarily by agent count increases, rising home prices, Motto expansion and fee increases in the Company-owned regions, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from preferred marketing arrangements. Full-year 2017 revenue would have been an estimated $197.9 million had approximately $2.0 million in fees for hurricane-impacted associates not been waived.\nRecurring revenue streams, which consist of continuing franchise fees and annual dues, increased $13.6 million or 12.0% over the full-year 2016 and accounted for 65.1% of revenue in 2017 compared to 64.6% in 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses were $95.7 million for the full-year 2017, a decrease of $8.2 million or 7.9% compared to the full-year 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $32.7 million gain resulting from the reduction in the Company's tax receivable agreement liability due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). Excluding this gain, operating expenses increased $24.5 million principally due to higher selling, operating and administrative expenses and increased depreciation and amortization.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the TCJA. The TCJA includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%. The Company estimates its effective U.S. GAAP tax rate attributable to RE/MAX Holdings to be between 14% and 17% starting in 2018 as a result of the TCJA.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the tax legislation was enacted, the Company's \"Deferred tax assets\" was reduced to reflect the impact of the lower tax rate, resulting in a charge to \"Provision for income taxes\" of $40.9 million. Correspondingly, the Company's \"Payable pursuant to tax receivable agreements\" liability was also reduced to reflect the impact of the tax rate change, resulting in a benefit to operating income of $32.7 million. The net effect on net income was a reduction of approximately $8.2 million.\nSelling, operating and administrative expenses were $107.3 million in the full-year 2017, an increase of $19.6 million or 22.4% compared to the full-year 2016 and represented 54.7% of revenue compared to 49.7% in the prior-year period. Expenses increased primarily due to a $3.7 million loss recognized on subleasing a portion of our corporate office; $2.6 million net cost incurred in connection with a litigation settlement related to our acquisition of the net assets of Tails, Inc. (\"Tails\"); $2.6 million of expenses incurred in connection with the investigation by a special committee (the \"Special Committee\") of our board of directors (\"special investigation expenses\"); investments in Motto and the acquired independent regions; as well as an increase in other litigation costs.\nNet Income and GAAP EPS\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings was $12.8 million for the full-year 2017, a decrease of $9.9 million or 43.6% from the full-year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the net impact from the enactment of the TCJA, the litigation settlement, increased depreciation and amortization expenses, the loss on the sublease, special investigation expenses, investments in Motto and the brand refresh, and increased other litigation costs, partially offset by contributions from the acquired independent regions and multiple organic growth contributors, including agent count growth. Reported basic and diluted GAAP EPS were each $0.72 per share for the full-year 2017. The net impact from the enactment of the TCJA reduced GAAP EPS by $0.46 per diluted share. Fees waived for hurricane-impacted associates reduced GAAP EPS by approximately $0.04 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted EBITDA was $103.9 million for the full-year 2017, an increase of $9.1 million or 9.6% compared to the full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA grew primarily due to contributions from the acquired independent regions, agent count growth, rising home prices, and fee increases in the Company-owned regions, partially offset by investments in Motto and the brand refresh and an increase in other litigation costs. Fees of approximately $2.0 million waived for hurricane-impacted associates reduced Adjusted EBITDA by the same amount. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.0% in 2017 compared to 53.7% in 2016.\nAdjusted basic and diluted EPS were each $1.87 for the full-year 2017. Fees waived for hurricane-impacted associates reduced full-year 2017 Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04 per diluted share. The ownership structure used to calculate Adjusted basic and diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 assumes RE/MAX Holdings owned 100% of RMCO, LLC (\"RMCO\"). The weighted average ownership RE/MAX Holdings had in RMCO was 58.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPreliminary Fourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nRE/MAX Holdings generated total revenue of $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $5.1 million or 11.4% compared to $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to contributions from the acquired independent regions, agent count growth, rising home prices and Motto expansion. Fourth quarter 2017 revenue would have been an estimated $49.8 million had approximately $0.3 million in fees for hurricane-impacted associates not been waived.\nTotal operating expenses were $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $29.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $32.7 million gain resulting from the reduction in the Company's tax receivable agreement liability due to the enactment of the TCJA. Excluding the impact of the TCJA, total operating expenses increased by $3.1 million due to an increase in selling, operating and administrative expenses, which were primarily driven by special investigation expenses and investments in Motto, as well as an increase in other litigation costs. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were higher as a result of the refinancing of the Company's debt agreement.\nNet loss attributable to RE/MAX Holdings was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a change of $7.4 million. Net income changed primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA. Reported basic and diluted GAAP loss per share were each $0.20 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The net impact from the enactment of the TCJA reduced GAAP EPS by $0.46 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $26.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.7 million or 16.0% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA grew primarily due to the acquired independent regions and multiple organic growth contributors. The fee waivers of approximately $0.3 million granted for hurricane-impacted associates reduced Adjusted EBITDA by the same amount during the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 51.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPreliminary Third Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nRE/MAX Holdings generated total revenue of $49.4 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.8 million or 8.4% compared to $45.6 million in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to contributions from the independent regions acquired in December 2016 and agent count growth. Third quarter 2017 revenue would have been an estimated $51.1 million had approximately $1.7 million in fees for hurricane-impacted associates not been waived.\nTotal operating expenses were $36.6 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $12.4 million or 51.1% compared to the third quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher selling, operating and administrative expenses, of which $3.7 million was related to a loss recognized on subleasing a portion of our corporate office building and a $2.6 million net cost incurred in connection with a litigation settlement related to our acquisition of the net assets of Tails.\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings was $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $3.1 million or 44.5% from the third quarter of 2016. Net income decreased primarily due to the loss on the sublease, litigation settlement related to our acquisition of the net assets of Tails, investments in Motto and the brand refresh, as well as an increase in other litigation costs, partially offset by contributions from the acquired independent regions and agent count growth. Reported basic and diluted GAAP EPS were each $0.22 per share for the third quarter of 2017. Fees waived for hurricane-impacted associates reduced third quarter 2017 GAAP EPS by approximately $0.03 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $25.8 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.1 million or 0.3% from the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA grew primarily due to contributions from the acquired independent regions and agent count growth, partially offset by investments in Motto and the brand refresh. The fee waivers of approximately $1.7 million granted for hurricane-impacted associates reduced Adjusted EBITDA by the same amount during the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52.2% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to 56.4% in the third quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted basic and diluted EPS were $0.47 and $0.46, respectively for the third quarter of 2017. Fees waived for hurricane-impacted associates reduced third quarter 2017 Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 per diluted share. The ownership structure used to calculate Adjusted basic and diluted EPS for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 assumes RE/MAX Holdings owned 100% of RMCO. The weighted average ownership RE/MAX Holdings had in RMCO was 58.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2017.\nPreliminary Balance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of $50.8 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, RE/MAX had $229.0 million of term loans outstanding, net of an unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, down slightly from last year-end's $230.8 million.\n\"We continue to deploy our capital strategically having recently acquired the master franchise rights to the Northern Illinois region,\" stated Karri Callahan, Chief Financial Officer. \"Acquiring independent regions has been a priority for RE/MAX and we have bought back seven regions, including Northern Illinois, in the last two years. The Northern Illinois region acquisition was funded using cash on hand.\"\nPreliminary Financial Information\nThe preliminary financial results and other information set forth in this press release related to the Company's third and fourth quarters of 2017 and full-year 2017 are unaudited preliminary numbers which are subject to change.

See \"Preliminary Financial Information\" above.\n(1)\nNon-GAAP measure. See elsewhere in this press release for definitions of Non-GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, such as Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios related thereto, Adjusted net income, Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) and Free cash flow. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA (consolidated net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and the provision for income taxes, adjusted for the impact of the following items that are either non-cash or that the Company does not consider representative of its ongoing operating performance: loss or gain on sale or disposition of assets and sublease, loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity-based compensation expense, professional fees and certain expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of Class A common stock as a result of RIHI's redemption of common units in RMCO, acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring items including the impact of the TCJA and the special investigation expenses. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company revised its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to better reflect the performance of the business and comply with SEC guidance. The Company now adjusts for equity-based compensation expense and no longer adjusts for straight-line rent expense and severance related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was revised in prior periods to reflect this change for consistency in presentation.\nBecause Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin omit certain non-cash items and other non-recurring cash charges or other items, the Company believes that each measure is less susceptible to variances that affect its operating performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other non-cash and non-recurring cash charges or other items. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA and the related Adjusted EBITDA margin because the Company believes they are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of its operating businesses and provides greater transparency into the Company's results of operations. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as factors in evaluating the performance of the business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing the Company's results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthese measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; these measures do not reflect the Company's interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on its debt; these measures do not reflect the Company's income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; these measures do not reflect the cash requirements to pay dividends to stockholders of the Company's Class A common stock and tax and other cash distributions to its non-controlling unitholders; these measures do not reflect the cash requirements to pay RIHI Inc. and Oberndorf pursuant to the tax receivable agreements; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; although equity-based compensation is a non-cash charge, the issuance of equity-based awards may have a dilutive impact on earnings per share; and other companies may calculate these measures differently so similarly named measures may not be comparable.\nThe Company's Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance does not include certain charges and costs. The adjustments to EBITDA margin in future periods are generally expected to be similar to the kinds of charges and costs excluded from Adjusted EBITDA margin in prior quarters, such as gain on sale or disposition of assets and sublease and acquisition related expenses, among others. The exclusion of these charges and costs in future periods will have a significant impact on the Company's Adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial guidance to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures without unreasonable effort because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of these future charges and costs.\nAdjusted net income is calculated as Net income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding non-controlling interests for shares of Class A common stock as of the beginning of the period (and the related increase to the provision for income taxes after such exchange), plus primarily non-cash items and other items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's operating performance (e.g., amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on sale or disposition of assets and sub-lease, loss on early debt extinguishment, public-offering related expenses, acquisition-related expenses, equity-based compensation expense, the impact of the TCJA, and special investigation expense).\nAdjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) are calculated as Adjusted net income (as defined above) divided by pro forma (assuming the full exchange of all outstanding non-controlling interests) basic and diluted weighted average shares, as applicable.\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS are supplemental measures of operating performance that management believes are useful measures to evaluate the Company's performance relative to the performance of its competitors as well as performance period over period. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding non-controlling interests, management believes these measures:\nfacilitate comparisons with other companies that do not have a low effective tax rate driven by a non-controlling interest on a pass-through entity; facilitate period over period comparisons because they eliminate the effect of changes in Net income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. driven by increases in its ownership of RMCO, LLC, which are unrelated to the Company's operating performance; and eliminate primarily non-cash and other items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's operating performance.\nFree cash flow is calculated as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, both as reported under GAAP, and quantifies how much cash a company has to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. The Company believes free cash flow is useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it calculates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, potential independent region and strategic acquisitions, dividend payments or other strategic uses of cash.\nFree cash flow after tax and non-dividend distributions to RIHI is calculated as free cash flow less tax and other non-dividend distributions paid to RIHI (the non-controlling interest holder) to enable RIHI to satisfy its income tax obligations. Similar payments would be made by the Company directly to federal and state taxing authorities as a component of the Company's consolidated provision for income taxes if a full exchange of non-controlling interests occurred in the future. As a result and given the significance of the Company's ongoing tax and non-dividend distribution obligations to its non-controlling interest, free cash flow after tax and non-dividend distributions, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful view of cash flow available to the Company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value.\nUnencumbered cash generated is calculated as free cash flow after tax and non-dividend distributions to RIHI less quarterly debt principal payments less annual excess cash flow payment on debt, as applicable. Given the significance of the Company's excess cash flow payment on debt, when applicable, unencumbered cash generated, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provides a meaningful view of the cash flow available to the Company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value after considering its debt service obligations.\nAPPENDIX:\nRE/MAX HOLDINGS REPORTS\nPRELIMINARY THIRD QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nTABLE 9\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc.\nPreliminary* Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenue:\nContinuing franchise fees\n$\n23,049\n$\n20,938\n$\n69,298\n$\n59,691\nAnnual dues\n8,592\n8,321\n25,148\n24,271\nBroker fees\n12,125\n10,517\n32,914\n28,102\nFranchise sales and other franchise revenue\n5,611\n5,783\n19,065\n19,704\nBrokerage revenue\n—\n—\n—\n112\nTotal revenue\n49,377\n45,559\n146,425\n131,880\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, operating and administrative expenses\n31,832\n20,325\n79,263\n62,399\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,286\n3,889\n15,678\n11,482\nLoss (gain) on sale or disposition of assets, net\n451\n(11)\n426\n85\nTotal operating expenses\n36,569\n24,203\n95,367\n73,966\nOperating income\n12,808\n21,356\n51,058\n57,914\nOther expenses, net:\nInterest expense\n(2,598)\n(2,121)\n(7,414)\n(6,493)\nInterest income\n145\n32\n195\n118\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses)\n273\n(115)\n289\n69\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n—\n(136)\nTotal other expenses, net\n(2,180)\n(2,204)\n(6,930)\n(6,442)\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n10,628\n19,152\n44,128\n51,472\nProvision for income taxes\n(3,091)\n(4,632)\n(10,883)\n(12,176)\nNet income\n$\n7,537\n$\n14,520\n$\n33,245\n$\n39,296\nLess: net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n3,702\n7,609\n16,968\n20,484\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.\n$\n3,835\n$\n6,911\n$\n16,277\n$\n18,812\nNet income attributable to RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. per share of Class A common stock\nBasic\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.92\n$\n1.07\nDiluted\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.39\n$\n0.92\n$\n1.06\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding\nBasic\n17,696,991\n17,645,696\n17,685,683\n17,622,298\nDiluted\n17,737,786\n17,691,641\n17,726,447\n17,666,740\nCash dividends declared per share of Class A common stock\n$\n0.18\n$\n0.15\n$\n0.54\n$\n0.45\n* Information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 is preliminary.
