    "text": "GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Townsquare Media, Inc. (NYSE: TSQ) (\"Townsquare\") today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire classic rock station WOUR-FM 96.9 (the \"Station\") in Utica, NY from Galaxy Communications, LLC (the \"Acquisition\"). In addition, pursuant to a Joint Sales Agreement, Townsquare will take over all sales efforts for the Station effective immediately.\n\"We are pleased to announce this strategic acquisition which will strengthen our market leading position in Utica, NY,\" commented Townsquare Co-Chief Executive Officer Bill Wilson. \"Our existing asset portfolio of three FM stations and one AM station currently captures the number one revenue and audience share in the market. Adding WOUR, the leading classic rock station in Utica, will expand the marketing solutions we offer our local clients while also significantly expanding our local audience and advertiser base. We are confident that our strong local team, led by Karen Carey, Market President/Chief Revenue Officer of Townsquare Utica, will drive continued success in the market.\"\nKaren Carey added, \"We are excited to add the powerful WOUR brand to our portfolio of top performing local stations, local digital platforms and local live events.

We feel that WOUR is the perfect complement to our existing brands (Big Frog 104, Lite 98.7, 96.1 The Eagle and WIBX) and will allow us to offer more robust marketing solutions to our clients.\"\nWOUR-FM will join Townsquare's existing Utica, NY stations: WFRG-FM 104.3, WLZW-FM 98.7, WODZ-FM 96.1 and WIBX-AM 950.
