(NYSE: TJX), the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide, today announced sales and earnings results for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018. Net sales for the 14-week fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 increased 16% to $11.0 billion. Consolidated comparable store sales on a 13-week basis increased 4%, compared to last year’s 3% increase. Net income for the 14-week fourth quarter was $877 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.37. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.19, a 16% increase over the prior year’s $1.03.\nFor the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, net sales were $35.9 billion, an 8% increase over last year’s 7% increase. Consolidated comparable store sales on a 52-week basis increased 2% over last year’s 5% increase. Net income for the 53-week fiscal year was $2.6 billion and diluted earnings per share were $4.04 versus $3.46 in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $3.85, a 9% increase over the prior year’s adjusted $3.53, which excluded a combined $.07 negative impact from a debt extinguishment charge and a pension settlement charge.\nErnie Herrman, Chief Executive Officer and President of The TJX Companies, Inc., stated, “We are very pleased with our strong finish to 2017! In the fourth quarter, our consolidated comp store sales increase of 4% and adjusted earnings per share both meaningfully exceeded our expectations. Once again, customer traffic was up overall and the primary driver of our comp sales increases at each of our four major divisions, as customers responded to our great brands and compelling, eclectic mix of merchandise at excellent values. We are also pleased with our full-year performance as we surpassed $35 billion in annual sales, an important milestone for our Company! Consolidated comp store sales were up 2% as we marked the 22 nd consecutive year of comp sales growth for TJX. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were also above our plan.”\nHerrman continued, “Looking ahead, 2018 is off to a solid start. We see abundant opportunities in the marketplace for major brands and high-quality merchandise and are pursuing numerous initiatives to keep driving sales and customer traffic. Our management team is laser focused on achieving our 2018 plans and, as always, passionate about surpassing them.”\nImpact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act)\nThe 2017 Tax Act benefited the Company in the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2018. The Company expects to continue to benefit from the 2017 Tax Act going forward, primarily due to the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. As a result of the estimated cash benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act, the Company is taking the following actions:\nAssociates\nA one-time, discretionary bonus to eligible, non-bonus-plan Associates, globally An incremental contribution to the Company’s defined contribution retirement plans for eligible Associates in the U.S. and internationally Instituting paid parental leave for eligible Associates in the U.S. Enhancing vacation benefits for certain U.S. Associates\nCommunities\nMade meaningful contributions to TJX’s charitable foundations around the world to further support TJX’s charitable giving\nShareholders\nPlanning a significant increase in shareholder distributions in Fiscal 2019, through both the Company’s dividend and share buyback programs (detailed below)\nRepatriation of Cash\nPlanning to repatriate more than $1 billion in cash from its TJX Canada division in Fiscal 2019\nErnie Herrman commented, “We are pleased to be utilizing the cash benefit from the 2017 Tax Act to make incremental investments in our Associates, our communities and shareholder distributions. Apart from the tax-related cash benefit, we plan to continue to re-invest in the business, including store growth, supply chain and infrastructure, technology, training our Associates, and upgrades to the shopping experience for customers. We are pleased to be in a position to do all of this while continuing to deliver great value to our customers and shareholders!”\nThe $.17 per share net benefit in the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2018 includes the benefit related to changes in the U.S. tax code as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by the Associate bonus, retirement plan contributions, and charitable foundation contributions mentioned above.\nShareholder Distributions\nThe Company intends to increase the regular quarterly dividend on its common stock to be declared in April 2018 and payable in June 2018 to $.39 per share, subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. This increase would represent a 25% increase in the current per share dividend and mark the 22 nd consecutive year that the Company has raised the dividend. Over this period of time, the Company’s dividend has grown at a compound annual rate of 23%.\nThe Company also announced today its plan to repurchase approximately $2.5 to $3.0 billion of TJX stock during the fiscal year ending February 2, 2019. With $1.1 billion remaining at Fiscal 2018 year end under the Company’s stock repurchase programs, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $3.0 billion of TJX common stock from time to time. The new authorization represents approximately 6% of the Company’s outstanding shares at current prices. The new stock repurchase program marks the 19 th program approved by the Board since 1997. Over this period, the Company has spent approximately $19.6 billion on the repurchase of TJX stock. During the fourth quarter, the Company spent a total of $405 million to repurchase TJX stock, retiring 5.4 million shares. In Fiscal 2018, the Company spent a total of $1.7 billion to repurchase TJX stock, retiring 22.3 million shares. Under the Company’s repurchase plans, share repurchases may be made from time to time in market or private transactions and may include derivative transactions. The repurchase program announced today has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nErnie Herrman commented, “Our business continues to generate tremendous amounts of cash and excellent financial returns. In addition, with the recent changes in U.S. federal tax law, we expect a significant increase in cash flow. A substantial use of this cash is reflected in our plan to increase our regular quarterly dividend and share buyback program while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. This underscores our confidence in our ability to continue delivering strong, profitable sales and cash flow that enables us to both fund our continued growth and return value to our shareholders.”\nSales by Business Segment\nThe Company’s comparable store sales and net sales by division for the fourth quarter and full year were as follows:\nFourth Quarter\nComparable Store Sales 1,2,3 Fourth Quarter\nNet Sales ($ in millions) 4,5 FY2018\n(13 weeks)\nFY2017\n(13 weeks)\nFY2018\n(14 weeks)\nFY2017\n(13 weeks)\nMarmaxx (U.S.) 6,7 +3% +3% $6,699 $6,029 HomeGoods (U.S.) 8 +3% +5% $1,610 $1,329 TJX Canada +7% +4% $1,088 $873 TJX International (Europe & Australia) +3% +2% $1,564 $1,236 TJX +4% +3% $10,961 $9,468 Full Year\nComparable Store Sales 1,2,3\nFull Year\nNet Sales ($ in millions) 4,5\nFY2018\n(52 weeks)\nFY2017\n(52 weeks)\nFY2018\n(53 weeks)\nFY2017\n(52 weeks)\nMarmaxx (U.S.) 6,7 +1% +5% $22,249 $21,246 HomeGoods (U.S.) 8 +4% +6% $5,116 $4,405 TJX Canada +5% +8% $3,642 $3,171 TJX International (Europe & Australia) +2% +2% $4,857 $4,362 TJX +2% +5% $35,865 $33,184\n1 Comparable store sales outside the U.S. calculated on a constant currency basis, which removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. For Q4 and FY2018, comparable store sales are for the 13-week and 52-week period ended January 27, 2018 respectively, versus the comparable period in FY2017. 2 Comparable store sales exclude Sierra Trading Post, tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com . 3 Q4 and FY2018 comparable store sales exclude 37 stores (primarily in Puerto Rico) that were significantly impacted by hurricanes during the year. 4 Net sales in TJX Canada and TJX International include the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. See below. 5 Figures may not foot due to rounding. 6 Combination of TJ Maxx and Marshalls. 7 Net sales include Sierra Trading Post. 8 Net sales in Q4 and FY2018 include Homesense stores in the U.S.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of sales and earnings of the Company’s international businesses into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, ordinary course, inventory-related hedging instruments are marked to market at the end of each quarter. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on the magnitude of these translations and adjustments when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates.\nFor the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a two percentage point positive impact on consolidated net sales growth. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.01 positive impact on fourth quarter Fiscal 2018 earnings per share, compared with a $.02 negative impact last year.\nThe movement in foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on consolidated net sales growth for the full Fiscal 2018 year versus the prior year. The overall net impact of foreign currency exchange rates had a $.02 positive impact on full year Fiscal 2018 earnings per share, compared with a $.02 negative impact last year.\nA table detailing the impact of foreign currency on TJX pretax earnings and margins, as well as those of its international businesses, can be found in the Investors section of tjx.com .\nThe foreign currency exchange rate impact to earnings per share does not include the impact currency exchange rates have on various transactions, which the Company refers to as “transactional foreign exchange.”\nSierra Trading Post Impairment Charge\nThe Company’s earnings per share in the fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2018 includes a $.10 impairment charge. This charge is related to goodwill as the estimated fair value of Sierra Trading Post (STP) fell below the carrying value due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates. This charge is included in the Marmaxx segment. As TJX continues transitioning this business to an off-price model, the Company saw improvement in the top line in the second half of Fiscal 2018. The Company remains confident in the potential of STP and believes it is well positioned for successful growth going forward.\nMargins\nFor the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company’s consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.1%, a 1.5 percentage point decrease compared with the prior year’s 11.6%. On an adjusted basis, the Company’s consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.5%, which excludes a 0.9 percentage point negative impact from the Sierra Trading Post impairment charge, a 0.9 percentage point negative impact from the Associate bonus, retirement plan contributions, and charitable foundation contributions (described above), and a benefit of approximately 0.4 percentage points from the extra week in the Company’s Fiscal 2018 fourth quarter calendar. This was a 0.1 percentage point decrease versus the prior year.\nGross profit margin for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 was 28.4%, up 0.1 percentage point versus the prior year. Excluding a benefit of approximately 0.4 percentage points from the extra week in the Company’s Fiscal 2018 calendar, adjusted gross margin was 27.9%, down 0.4 percentage points versus the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter were 17.3%, up 0.6 percentage points versus the prior year’s ratio. Excluding a 0.9 percentage point negative impact from the Associate bonus, retirement plan contributions, and charitable foundation contributions (described above), adjusted SG&A was 16.4%, down 0.3 percentage points versus the prior year.\nFor the full year Fiscal 2018, the Company’s consolidated pretax profit margin was 10.8%, a 0.4 percentage point decrease compared with the prior year’s 11.2%. On an adjusted basis, the Company’s consolidated pretax profit margin was 11.2%, which excludes a 0.3 percentage point negative impact from the Sierra Trading Post impairment charge, a 0.3 percentage point negative impact from the Associate bonus, retirement plan contributions, and charitable foundation contributions (described above), and a benefit of approximately 0.1 percentage point from the 53rd week in the Company’s Fiscal 2018 calendar. This was a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared with the prior year’s adjusted 11.5%, which excluded a debt extinguishment charge and a pension settlement charge.\nGross profit margin for Fiscal 2018 was 28.9%, down 0.1 percentage point versus the prior year. Excluding a benefit of approximately 0.1 percentage point from the 53 rd week in the Company’s Fiscal 2018 calendar, adjusted gross margin was 28.8%, down 0.2 percentage points versus the prior year. Merchandise margin remained strong on top of a significant increase in the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales for Fiscal 2018 were 17.8%, up 0.4 percentage points versus the prior year’s ratio. Excluding a 0.3 percentage point negative impact from the Associate bonus, retirement plan contributions, and charitable foundation contributions (described above), adjusted SG&A was 17.5%, up 0.1 percentage point versus the prior year.\nInventory\nTotal inventories as of February 3, 2018, were $4.2 billion, compared with $3.6 billion at the end of the prior fiscal year. Consolidated inventories on a per-store basis as of February 3, 2018, including the distribution centers, but excluding inventory in transit and the Company’s e-commerce businesses, were up 6% on a reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis, compared to down 4% on a constant currency basis in the prior year. The Company enters the new fiscal year well-positioned to ship fresh, spring merchandise to its stores and take advantage of the plentiful opportunities in the marketplace.\nFull Year and First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ending February 2, 2019, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.83, which represents a 17% to 20% increase over the prior year’s $4.04. The Company’s full-year guidance includes an expected benefit of approximately $.73 to $.75 per share due to items related to the 2017 Tax Act (primarily the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate). Excluding this benefit, the Company expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.08. This would represent a 4% to 6% increase over the prior year’s adjusted $3.85, which excludes the items described above. This guidance reflects an assumption that wage increases will negatively impact EPS growth by 2%. This EPS outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2%.\nFor the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.02, compared to $.82 last year. Excluding an expected benefit of approximately $.15 to $.16 per share due to the 2017 Tax Act (primarily the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate), the Company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $.85 to $.87. This guidance reflects an assumption that wage increases will negatively impact EPS growth by 2%. This EPS outlook is based upon estimated consolidated comparable store sales growth of 1% to 2%.\nThe Company’s earnings guidance for the full year and first quarter of Fiscal 2019 assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from the levels at the beginning of the first quarter.\nStores by Concept\nDuring the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, the Company increased its store count by 258 stores to a total of 4,070 stores. The Company increased square footage by 4% over the same period last year.\nStore Locations 1 Gross Square Feet 2 FY2018 FY2018 (in millions) Beginning End Beginning End In the U.S.: TJ Maxx 1,186 1,223 33.5 34.1 Marshalls 1,035 1,062 31.0 31.2 HomeGoods 579 667 14.2 15.8 Sierra Trading Post 12 27 0.3 0.6 Homesense 0 4 0.0 0.1 In Canada: Winners 255 264 7.2 7.4 HomeSense 106 117 2.5 2.7 Marshalls 57 73 1.7 2.0 In Europe: TK Maxx 503 540 15.0 15.8 Homesense 44 55 0.9 1.1 In Australia:\nTK Maxx 35 38 0.8 0.8 TJX 3,812 4,070 106.9 111.7 1\nStore counts above include both banners within a combo or a superstore. 2\nSquare feet figures may not foot due to rounding.

During the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018, TJX repurchased 5.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $405 million. For the twelve months ended February 3, 2018, TJX repurchased 22.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion. In February 2018, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved an additional $2.5 to $3.0 billion stock repurchase program. TJX records the repurchase of its stock on a cash basis, and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above amounts due to the timing of settlement of repurchases. 2. During the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018, the Company recorded a $99.3 million impairment charge, primarily goodwill, related to Sierra Trading Post. 3. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act) was enacted into law which among other things, includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. The change in the U.S. income tax rate also requires us to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Although we are still evaluating the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on TJX, the Company recorded an estimated reduction in our fourth quarter and full year tax provision of $173 million. The Company has reinvested a portion of these tax benefits by approving a discretionary bonus to eligible non-bonus plan Associates globally, providing an incremental contribution to the Company’s defined contribution retirement plans for eligible Associates in the U.S. and internationally, as well as making contributions to the Company’s charitable foundations. These initiatives reduced the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year pre-tax income by $100 million. The tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 Tax Act, offset by the after-tax impact of the fourth quarter charges, result in a net benefit to net income of $110 million, or $0.17 per share for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year.\n4. During the third quarter ended October 29, 2016, the Company redeemed its $375 million 6.95% notes prior to their scheduled maturity of April 15, 2019 and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of this debt of $51.8 million. 5. During the third quarter ended October 29, 2016, the Company offered eligible, former TJX Associates, who had not yet commenced receiving their pension benefit, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit. The payment and settlement of these pension benefits by the Company’s pension plan to participants who accepted this offer resulted in a non-cash settlement charge which reduced fiscal 2017 pre-tax income by $31.2 million.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228005785/en/\nThe TJX Companies, Inc.\nDebra McConnell\nGlobal Communications\n(508) 390-2323\nSource: The TJX Companies, Inc.",
