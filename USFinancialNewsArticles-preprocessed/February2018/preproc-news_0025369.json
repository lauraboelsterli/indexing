    "text": "FREEHOLD, N.J., Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- New Jersey Community Bank (OTCQB:NJCB) (the “Bank”) reported a net loss of $320 thousand, or ($0.17) per share for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $361 thousand, or ($0.19) per share for the same period in the prior year. For 2017, the Bank reported a net loss of $1.2 million, or ($0.63) per common share compared with a net loss of $1.6 million, or ($0.85) per common share for the year 2016. The losses for the year were negatively impacted largely due to one-time expenses associated with the anticipated merger with 1 st Constitution Bank, legal fees and certain other expenses. Without such one-time expenses, the Bank would have reported a net loss of $706 thousand for the year 2017.\nThe losses for the quarter and the year 2017 were, in part, further impacted by the increased cost of deposits as a result of increases in both average volume and interest rates when compared to the same periods in the prior year. Total interest income for the quarter increased primarily as a result of an increase in interest income on loans due to increased loans outstanding year over year complemented by additional yield related fee income on loans. Net interest margin for the quarter increased 37 basis points year over year primarily due to the improved net interest income during the quarter.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAt December 31, 2017, total assets were $103.1 million, a decrease of $2.0 million from December 31, 2016. Due from banks-time deposits decreased $3.2 million, and total investment securities decreased $1.0 million. These decreases were offset in part by an increase in loans. Loans totaled $79.0 million, increasing $2.2 million compared to year end 2016. The growth in loans was funded utilizing the available liquidity in due from banks-time deposits.\nTotal deposits decreased $842 thousand compared to the levels at year end 2016. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased $2.1 million; Savings, NOW and money market accounts decreased $3.5 million; these were substantially offset by a $4.8 million increase in total time deposits. Time deposits increased as a result of deposit promotions during the second half of 2017.\nShareholders' equity totaled $8.9 million at December 31, 2017, decreasing primarily due to the net losses reported during the year 2017. At December 31, 2017, the Bank reported a leverage ratio of 8.67%; both common equity tier 1 risk based capital and tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 11.19%; and a total risk based capital ratio of 12.45%. These ratios exceed those needed to be deemed a well-capitalized financial institution.\nResults of Operations\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net interest income totaled $872 thousand, increasing $121 thousand over the same period in the prior year, largely due to yield related fee income collected on loans. At December 31, 2017, the net interest margin was 3.55%, increasing 37 basis points compared to the same period a year ago. The yield on average earning assets increased 60 basis points to 4.57%. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 23 basis points to 1.17%, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to competitive market conditions.\nThe Bank did not record any provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter 2017 nor for the similar period in 2016. The allowance for loan losses at period-end was $1.5 million, or 1.90% of total loans. Management continues to monitor the asset quality and will take actions necessary to affect the provision for loan losses; however, the current level of the allowance for loan loss is considered to be more than adequate.\nNon-interest income totaled $56 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared with $59 thousand for the same quarter in the prior year, a moderate decrease compared to last year.\nNon-interest expense totaled $1.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, a moderate increase from a year-ago quarter. Of the total non-interest expenses, salaries and employee benefits is the largest component, increasing $73 thousand from a year-ago quarter primarily due to filling certain open positions coupled with utilizing certain temporary assistance. Occupancy and equipment expense increased slightly as a result of change in accounting for deferred rent liability. Professional and other fees declined $115 thousand, while the FDIC insurance assessment increased $36 thousand as a result of changes in quarterly assessment rates. The decline in professional and other fees resulted from reduced consulting and recruiting fees. All other components of total non-interest expenses showed moderate variances.\nFull Year 2017\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, net interest income totaled $3.1 million, almost unchanged over the full prior year. While total interest income increased $206 thousand year over year, the category was offset by a similar increase in interest paid on deposits resulting from both the increase in average balances as well as interest yields. On a year over year basis, the yield on interest earning assets increased 18 basis points while the yield on interest bearing deposits increased 19 basis points. Net interest margin for the year declined 3 basis points to 3.16% over prior year.\nThe Bank did not record any provision for loan losses during the year 2017 nor 2016. Management considers the current level of the allowance for loan loss to be more than adequate.\nNon-interest income totaled $238 thousand for the year 2017, reflecting a decrease of $51 thousand over the full year 2016, primarily as a direct result of a decrease in gain on sale of other real estate owned.\nNon-interest expense totaled $4.5 million for the full year 2017, a decrease of $470 thousand over prior full year, the majority of which was related to the consulting costs associated with compliance under the regulatory Consent Order and, in part, related to legal expenses in the prior year. Salaries and benefits expense and occupancy and equipment expense declined $23 thousand and $86 thousand respectively, largely due to the closure of the Cranbury branch location in July, 2016. The FDIC insurance assessment declined $47 thousand year over year primarily due to a reduction in premium in early 2017. During late 2017, the Bank incurred certain one-time expenses related to the anticipated merger with 1 st Constitution Bank and certain other expenses. Excluding the one-time expenses of approximately $500 thousand, total non-interest expense would have been $4.0 million, or $500 thousand below last year.\nThe Bank believes that the non-GAAP measurements disclosed within this document are useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate our results of operations and financial condition relative to other financial institutions. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude from corresponding GAAP measures the impact of certain elements that we do not believe are representative of our financial results, which we believe enhance an overall understanding of our performance. The one-time expenses of $500 thousand includes $180 thousand in merger related expenses, $225 thousand in litigation expenses, and $95 thousand in other professional fees.\nAbout the Bank\nNew Jersey Community Bank is a state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Freehold, New Jersey.
