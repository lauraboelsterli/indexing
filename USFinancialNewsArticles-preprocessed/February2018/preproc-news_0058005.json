    "text": "Hospital segment same-hospital admissions increased 0.2%, adjusted admissions increased 1.3%, and revenue per adjusted admission increased 4.8%, resulting in same-hospital net patient revenue growth of 6.1%. Ambulatory Care same-facility system-wide cases increased 4.6% and revenue per case increased 2.2%, resulting in revenue growth of 6.9%. Conifer’s revenues decreased 2.0% with revenue from third parties flat year-over-year. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Tenet recorded a $252 million non-cash partial write-down of the Company’s deferred tax assets and a $22 million increase in noncontrolling interest expense, which lowered net income by $274 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, the Company recorded a $99 million after-tax charge, primarily related to the write-down of assets held for sale in Chicago and employee severance. As a result, Tenet reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $230 million or $2.28 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. After adjusting for these items, which totaled $373 million or $3.68 per share, Tenet reported Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.40. Adjusted EBITDA was $840 million in the fourth quarter, consisting of $538 million in the Hospital segment, $223 million in the Ambulatory segment and $79 million in the Conifer segment. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.200 billion, a $642 million increase when compared to $558 million in 2016. Free Cash Flow was $493 million in 2017, an $810 million increase when compared to an outflow of $317 million in 2016. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $623 million in 2017, a $243 million increase when compared to $380 million in 2016. 2018 Outlook has been increased to reflect net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet common shareholders of $95 million to $105 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $2.500 billion to $2.600 billion, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.92 to $1.02 and Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.73 to $1.07.\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $230 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the items mentioned above, compared to a $79 million net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $840 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $650 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“Our results for the fourth quarter were strong in each of our business segments,” said Ronald A. Rittenmeyer, executive chairman and CEO. “Volume growth returned in our hospital and Ambulatory segments, cost controls were tight, and our financial results at USPI and Conifer were very strong. Our cost control program is off to a great start and, when combined with improved financial performance in the fourth quarter, we are raising our Outlook for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS for 2018.”\nHospital Operations and Other Segment\nNet operating revenues in the Hospital Operations and other segment was $4.184 billion, up 3.4 percent from $4.046 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016; in order to improve comparability, these revenue figures exclude revenue generated by the Company’s health plans in both periods since the Company is exiting this business.\nOn a same-hospital basis, patient revenue was $4.126 billion, up 6.1 percent from $3.889 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, with adjusted admissions up 1.3 percent and revenue per adjusted admission up 4.8 percent. The growth in revenue per adjusted admission was due to a $202 million increase in revenue from the California Provider Fee Program since the 2017 program was not approved until December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Tenet’s hospital segment was $538 million, representing an increase of $143 million or 36.2 percent as compared to $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The $143 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the hospital segment was primarily driven by: (i) $202 million increase in California Provider Fee revenue, with $267 million of revenue being under the program in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2016; (ii) $17 million unfavorable comparison due to the sale of the Company’s hospitals and related assets in Houston, effective August 1, 2017; (iii) $17 million of previously disclosed executive severance in the fourth quarter of 2017; and, (iv) an $8 million decline in electronic health record incentives.\nTenet’s health plan business was breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a loss of $29 million on the EBITDA line in the fourth quarter of 2016. The revenue and expenses associated with the Company’s health plan operations are included in Tenet’s consolidated statements of operations; however, the results are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA in both periods.\nSelected operating expenses in the segment, defined as the sum of salaries, wages and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses, increased 2.2 percent on a per adjusted admission basis in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nExchanges\nTenet’s same-hospital exchange admissions were 4,857 in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 0.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Same-hospital exchange outpatient visits were 51,451 in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 15.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nUncompensated Care\nTenet’s provision for doubtful accounts was $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a ratio of 6.1 percent of revenues before bad debt, as compared to $354 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, or 6.9 percent of revenues before bad debt (excluding health plan revenues from both periods). The decrease in the bad debt ratio was primarily attributable to a $15 million decrease in same-hospital self-pay revenues, revenue growth in our Ambulatory segment, the sale of our Houston hospitals in 2017, and a full year of the California Provider Fee revenue being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTenet’s uncompensated care costs, defined as the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, charity care write-offs and uninsured discounts, were $1.361 billion and $1.332 billion in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, including $1.036 billion and $978 million, respectively, of charity care write-offs and uninsured discounts that were offered through Tenet’s Compact with Uninsured Patients. Uncompensated care in the fourth quarter of 2017 represented 21.5 percent of revenue before bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care write-offs, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Nearly all of Tenet’s uncompensated care is associated with the Hospital Operations and other segment.\nUninsured plus charity admissions increased by 317 admissions, or 3.3 percent on a same-hospital basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Uninsured plus charity outpatient visits increased by 6,237 visits, or 5.6 percent, on a same-hospital basis.\nAmbulatory Care Segment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Ambulatory segment produced net operating revenues of $545 million, representing an increase of 14.0 percent as compared to $478 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, the Ambulatory segment generated Adjusted EBITDA of $223 million, up 21.9 percent from $183 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and Adjusted EBITDA less facility-level noncontrolling interest was $145 million, up 26.1 percent from $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe results of many of the facilities in which the Ambulatory segment has an investment are not consolidated by Tenet. To help analyze the segment’s results of operations, management uses system-wide measures, which include revenues and cases of both consolidated and unconsolidated facilities. On a same-facility system-wide basis, revenue in the Ambulatory segment increased 6.9 percent, with cases increasing 4.6 percent and revenue per case increasing 2.2 percent. The number of surgical days was the same in both periods and did not impact the year-over-year growth rates this quarter.\nConifer Segment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Conifer’s revenue decreased 2.0 percent to $394 million, down from $402 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from third party customers was flat at $239 million. Conifer generated $79 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 9.7 percent from $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet Income and Earnings Per Share\nTenet reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $230 million, or a loss of $2.28 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $79 million, or a loss of $0.79 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs shown on Table #2, the net loss from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of approximately $230 million included: (i) a $252 million non-cash partial write-down of the Company’s deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (ii) a $138 million pre-tax impairment and restructuring charge consisting of $73 million from the write-down of assets held for sale in the Chicago-area to their estimated fair value, $42 million of restructuring charges primarily related to employee severance associated with the Company’s cost reduction initiatives, and $23 million of other impairment and restructuring charges; and, (iii) $9 million of other items. These items collectively lowered pre-tax income by approximately $147 million and lowered after-tax income by approximately $350 million. In addition, there was a noncontrolling interest impact of $23 million substantially due to a non-cash reduction in the deferred tax liabilities of the Company’s Ambulatory segment. Collectively, these items lowered diluted earnings per share by approximately $3.68.\nAfter adjusting for the items listed on Table #2, Tenet recorded Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $143 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $23 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nA reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Tenet shareholders to Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders is contained in Table #2 at the end of this release.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nCash and cash equivalents were $611 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $429 million at September 30, 2017. The Company had no outstanding borrowings on its $1 billion credit line as of December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable days outstanding from continuing operations were 55.2 at December 31, 2017 compared to 55.6 at September 30, 2017 and 56.5 at December 31, 2016. The calculation of accounts receivable days outstanding from continuing operations: (i) includes the accounts receivable of the Company’s two hospitals in Philadelphia, the Company’s four hospitals in the Chicago-area, Des Peres Hospital in St. Louis, and the Aspen facilities in the United Kingdom, which have been classified in assets held for sale on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017; (ii) excludes revenue from our former hospitals and related assets in Houston, which were divested on August 1, 2017, from the 2016 and 2017 periods; (iii) excludes health plan revenues from the 2016 and 2017 periods; and (iv) excludes California Provider Fee revenues from both 2016 and 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was $1.200 billion, representing a $642 million increase compared to $558 million in 2016. After subtracting $707 million and $875 million of capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016, respectively, Free Cash Flow was $493 million in 2017, an $810 million improvement compared to an outflow of $317 million in 2016. Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $623 million in 2017, representing a $243 million increase from $380 million in 2016.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $21 million in 2017 compared to $430 million of net cash used in investing activities in 2016. The 2017 period included $827 million of proceeds from the sales of facilities and other assets, primarily from the sale of the Company’s Houston-area hospitals effective August 1, 2017 for net pre-tax proceeds of approximately $750 million; the 2016 period included $573 million of proceeds from the sale of the Company’s hospitals and related outpatient facilities in Georgia.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1.326 billion in 2017 compared to $232 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2016. The 2017 period included: (i) $729 million related to purchases of noncontrolling interests, primarily the Company’s purchase of an additional 23.7 percent of USPI, which increased Tenet’s ownership interest in the USPI joint venture to 80.0 percent; (ii) the refinancing activities that were completed in the second and third quarters of 2017; and (iii) the redemption of $250 million aggregate principal amount of Tenet’s 8.0 percent senior unsecured notes due 2020 on September 11, 2017.\nReconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to both Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are contained in Table #3 at the end of this release.\nOutlook\nThe Company’s revised Outlook for 2018 includes:\nRevenue of $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion, Net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet common shareholders of $95 million to $105 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $2.500 billion to $2.600 billion, Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.245 billion to $1.450 billion, Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $675 million to $875 million, Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders ranging from $0.92 to $1.02, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $0.73 to $1.07.\nThe Company raised the midpoint of its previous 2018 Adjusted EBITDA Outlook range $25 million to reflect: (i) higher expectations for Conifer; (ii) additional Medicaid DSH reimbursement since Medicaid DSH reimbursement cuts have been delayed in both federal fiscal years 2018 and 2019; (iii) greater than previously expected revenue from the California Provider Fee program in 2018; and (iv) a net reduction in estimated EBITDA from to-be-divested facilities in 2018.\nThe Outlook for 2018 assumes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $160 million to $170 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $415 million to $435 million and an average diluted share count of 103 million.\nThe Company’s Outlook for the first quarter of 2018 includes:\nRevenue of $4.45 billion to $4.65 billion, Net income from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $50 million to $70 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $580 million to $630 million, Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders of $0.49 to $0.69, and Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations attributable to Tenet shareholders ranging from a loss of $0.10 to earnings of $0.05.\nThe Outlook for the first quarter assumes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $30 million to $35 million, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $90 million to $100 million, and an average diluted share count of 102 million.\nAdditional details on Tenet’s Outlook for both the first quarter and calendar year 2018 are available in Tables #4 and #5 at the end of this press release and in an accompanying slide presentation that is accessible through the Company’s website at www.tenethealth.com/investors .\nManagement’s Webcast Discussion of Fourth Quarter Results\nTenet management will discuss the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 results on a webcast scheduled for 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time) on February 27, 2018.

To help analyze results of operations, management also uses system-wide operating measures such as system-wide revenue growth, which includes revenues of both consolidated and unconsolidated facilities. We control our remaining 227 facilities and account for these investments as consolidated subsidiaries. (3) During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $22 million of noncontrolling interests expense on a tax benefit of $109 million, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $14 million of noncontrolling interests expense related to a $33 million gain on the consolidation of facilities (the gain is not included in Adjusted EBITDA) and an associated $7 million income tax benefit, net of $26 million of impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs not included in Adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders before (1) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, (2) net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests, (3) income (loss) from discontinued operations, (4) income tax benefit (expense), (5) other non-operating income (expense), net, (6) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, (7) interest expense, (8) litigation and investigation (costs) benefit, net of insurance recoveries, (9) net gains (losses) on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities, (10) impairment and restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs, (11) depreciation and amortization and (12) income (loss) from divested operations and closed businesses (i.e., the Company’s health plan businesses). Litigation and investigation costs do not include ordinary course of business malpractice and other litigation and related expense.\nAdjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as net income (loss) attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders before (1) impairment and restructuring charges, and acquisition-related costs, (2) litigation and investigation costs, (3) gains on sales, consolidation and deconsolidation of facilities, (4) gain (loss) from early extinguishment of debt, (5) income (loss) from divested operations and closed businesses, (6) the associated impact of these five items on taxes and noncontrolling interests, and (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations. Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP term, is defined by the Company as Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Tenet Healthcare Corporation common shareholders divided by the weighted average primary or diluted shares outstanding in the reporting period.\nFree Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as (1) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less (2) purchases of property and equipment from continuing operations.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as (1) Adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations, less (2) purchases of property and equipment from continuing operations. Adjusted net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as cash provided by (used in) operating activities prior to (1) payments for restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs and litigation costs and settlements, and (2) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations.\nThe Company believes the foregoing non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts because they present additional information on the Company’s financial performance. Investors, analysts, Company management and the Company’s Board of Directors utilize these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP measures, to track the Company’s financial and operating performance and compare the Company’s performance to its peer companies, which utilize similar non-GAAP measures in their presentations. The Human Resources Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors also uses certain of these measures to evaluate management’s performance for the purpose of determining incentive compensation. Additional information regarding the purpose and utility of specific non-GAAP measures used in this release is set forth below.\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, in part, because certain investors and analysts use both historical and projected Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, as factors in determining the estimated fair value of shares of the Company’s common stock. Company management also regularly reviews the Adjusted EBITDA performance for each operating segment. The Company does not use Adjusted EBITDA to measure liquidity, but instead to measure operating performance.\nWe use, and we believe investors and analysts use, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as supplemental measures to analyze cash flows generated from our operations because we believe it is useful to investors in evaluating our ability to fund distributions paid to noncontrolling interests, acquisitions, purchasing equity interests in joint ventures or repaying debt.\nThese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Because these measures exclude many items that are included in our financial statements, they do not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. For example, the Company’s definitions of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not include other important uses of cash including (1) cash used to purchase businesses or joint venture interests, or (2) any items that are classified as Cash Flows From Financing Activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, including items such as (i) cash used to repay borrowings, (ii) distributions paid to noncontrolling interests, or (iii) payments under the Put/Call Agreement for USPI redeemable noncontrolling interest, which are recorded on the Statement of Cash Flows as the purchase of noncontrolling interest.
