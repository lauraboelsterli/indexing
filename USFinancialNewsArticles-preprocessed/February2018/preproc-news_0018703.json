    "text": "February 9, 2018 / 10:28 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Leicester's Mahrez returns to training Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Riyad Mahrez ended a 10-day standoff with Leicester City on Friday by training with his team mates ahead of Saturday’s Premier League match at Manchester City. \nThe Algerian boarded the team coach en route to Manchester despite manager Claude Puel saying on Thursday that the Algerian would definitely miss the game against the Premier League leaders. \nBritish media reported that Mahrez was “depressed” after Leicester rejected Manchester City’s deadline day bid to sign him. \nThe 26 year-old, who has two-and-a-half years remaining on his 100,000 pound ($138,000) a week contract, missed two games and six training sessions in apparent protest and had not been seen at the club since last month. \nBut after Puel appealed for his player “to get his head right and come back with us and work hard”, Mahrez arrived at Leicester’s training-ground on Friday morning. \n“Riyad remains a greatly valued member of Claude Puel’s squad and is focused, together with his team mates, on achieving further success with Leicester City,” the club said in a statement. \nHe trained with his team mates, apparently with no problems despite media reports that some resented the way he had attempted to force a move away from Leicester. \nIt was unclear if Mahrez was granted permission to be away from the club - or whether he has been fined for going missing - but he appears to have been reintegrated in the way Puel hoped. \n“Riyad is a magnificent player. He loves football, he loves his relationship with his team-mates, he enjoys his football. I think he needs to come back, to play and touch the ball,” Puel said on Thursday. “It is important he comes back.” \nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola, whose bid instigated the standoff last month, said on Friday he “hopes” Mahrez faces City on Saturday. \n“I hope he comes back soon to play football. We enjoy watching him.” \nThere was no confirmation from Leicester whether Mahrez will be included in the 18-man match-day squad.
