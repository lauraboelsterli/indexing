    "text": "IRVING, Texas, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vistra Energy (NYSE: VST):\nSummary of Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (in millions):\nOperating Revenues\n$ 5,430\nNet Income (Loss)\n$ (254)\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$ 1,455\nOperating Cash Flow\n$ 1,386\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow 1\n$ 831\n2017 Highlights:\nDelivered full-year adjusted EBITDA in top quartile of narrowed guidance range and adjusted free cash flow conversion ratio of nearly 60% Announced planned merger with Dynegy, creating the leading integrated power company; merger on track to close in the second quarter of 2018 Announced acquisition and development of Upton 2, one of the largest solar projects in Texas, and the acquisition of Odessa, a 1,054 MW CCGT with access to deeply discounted gas supply in West Texas Retired three uneconomic coal plants: Big Brown, Monticello, and Sandow totaling ~4,200 MW (the \"Retired Plants\"), while also receiving $237.5 million in cash from Alcoa in exchange for the early settlement of certain long-term agreements at the now-retired Sandow facility Exceeded support cost reduction target of $225 million by more than 10% and reduced 2017 capital expenditures by more than $90 million—a $15 million improvement over the $75 million target Identified an annualized $50 million of EBITDA enhancements via operations performance initiative Delivered 2017 realized prices 44% over settled prices Reduced annual residential customer net attrition to 0.4% – our lowest level since 2008 Reduced borrowing cost on credit facilities by approximately $66 million on an annualized basis through various repricing transactions executed from February 2017 through February 2018\nVistra Energy (NYSE: VST), the parent company for TXU Energy and Luminant, today reported financial results for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2017. Vistra reported a full year 2017 net loss of $254 million, primarily due to the $451 million write-down of its deferred tax asset balance as a result of tax reform's reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as the $206 million charge related to Vistra's decision in 2017 to retire three coal plants. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.386 billion for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $1.455 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $831 million.\nCurt Morgan, Vistra Energy's chief executive officer, commented, \"Our company delivered excellent results in 2017 in the face of fairly significant headwinds, including mild weather and a two-month unplanned outage at Comanche Peak Unit 2 in the summer of 2017. The fact that we were able to deliver adjusted EBITDA in the top quartile of our narrowed guidance range despite these headwinds speaks volumes about the performance of our business teams. Through disciplined cost management, continued customer satisfaction and retention efforts, and value-added execution from our commercial operations, we concluded the year delivering strong financial results, reducing 2017 support costs and capital expenditures by more than $40 million beyond our $300 million target, realizing wholesale prices 44% over settled prices, and reducing annual residential customer net attrition to 0.4%—our lowest level since 2008. I am proud of our employees for their work ethic and commitment, and I look forward to what we plan to achieve in 2018, starting with closing the anticipated merger with Dynegy and working to achieve or exceed the $350 million of projected synergies and operational improvements.\"\nSegment Results\nFor the full year, the Retail segment reported operating income of $461 million and adjusted EBITDA of $779 million, within its adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $760–$810 million. Results were driven by strong margin and cost management, coupled with favorable customer attrition and mix, all of which helped to offset abnormally mild weather in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Wholesale segment reported an operating loss of $186 million, including the $206 million charge related to the Retired Plants, and adjusted EBITDA of $696 million for 2017, exceeding the high end of its adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $630–$680 million. Results were driven by strong commercial performance and disciplined cost management throughout the year. Full-year performance was partially impacted by the Comanche Peak Unit 2 unplanned outage in the summer of 2017.\nPlant Retirements and Early Settlement of Sandow Agreements\nIn October 2017, Vistra Energy filed notices with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (\"ERCOT\") stating its plans to retire its Monticello, Sandow, and Big Brown generation plants. Late in 2017, Vistra received determinations from ERCOT that these retirements would not impact system reliability, and the company has since retired the plants as scheduled on Jan. 4, Jan. 11, and Feb. 12, 2018, respectively.\nAlso in October, Vistra and Alcoa entered into a contract termination agreement, resulting in an early settlement of certain power and mining agreements related to the Sandow facilities. In consideration for the early termination, Alcoa made a one-time cash payment to Luminant of $237.5 million.\nAsset Closure Segment\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, Vistra Energy will be reporting the financial results of a new segment titled \"Asset Closures,\" which will include the financial results related to the closure and remediation activities of its Retired Plants. Vistra's ongoing wholesale and retail operations will continue to be reported separately. Vistra is introducing the Asset Closure segment in 2018 to more closely align financial reporting with how management and the board of directors will be evaluating Vistra's business operations going forward, as well as to provide investors with a better understanding of the performance and earnings power of Vistra's ongoing operations.\nProposed Merger with Dynegy\nOn Oct. 30, 2017, Vistra Energy announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement with Dynegy, creating the leading integrated power company across the key competitive power markets in the United States. Vistra estimates the combination could create nearly $4 billion in equity value for the benefit of both companies' shareholders via expected EBITDA, free cash flow, and tax synergies, as well as operational improvements. The proposed company is also expected to benefit from geographic, fuel, market, and earnings diversification, while still maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile.\nVistra and Dynegy have each scheduled a special meeting of its stockholders on March 2, 2018 to vote on the approval of the merger. Assuming affirmation by both companies' stockholders and the timely receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, Vistra anticipates the merger will close in the second quarter of 2018.\nLiquidity\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, Vistra Energy had total available liquidity of approximately $2.328 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.487 billion, $7 million in available letter of credit capacity under its term loan C facility, and $834 million of availability under its revolving credit facility, which remained undrawn but had $26 million of letters of credit outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2017. Liquidity increased by approximately $244 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to the proceeds received from the Sandow contract settlement.\n2018 Guidance\nVistra Energy is not changing its 2018 stand-alone guidance at this time. However, in recent months forward power prices have improved and spark spreads in ERCOT have expanded for 2018 and 2019, as well as in key markets where Dynegy operates. Vistra Energy believes this recent upward movement in the various forward curves could provide an improved outlook for the combined entity in 2018 and 2019.\nVistra plans to provide 2018 guidance for the combined entity following the closing of the merger.\nEarnings Conference Call\nVistra Energy will host a conference call today, Feb. 26, 2018, beginning at 11 a.m. EST (10 a.m. CST) to discuss these results and related matters. The live, listen-only webcast of the conference call and the accompanying slides that will be discussed on the call can be accessed via the investor relations section of Vistra's website at www.vistraenergy.com . For those unable to participate in the live event, a replay of the call will be available on the Vistra website for one year following the call.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Items Affecting Comparability\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" (EBITDA as adjusted for unrealized gains or losses from hedging activities, tax receivable agreement obligations, reorganization items, and certain other items described from time to time in Vistra Energy's earnings releases) and \"adjusted free cash flow\" (cash from operating activities excluding changes in margin deposits and working capital and adjusted for capital expenditures, other net investment activities, preferred stock dividends, and other items described from time to time in Vistra Energy's earnings releases) are \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in Vistra Energy's consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Vistra Energy's non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nVistra Energy uses adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance and believes that analysis of its business by external users is enhanced by visibility to both net income prepared in accordance with GAAP and adjusted EBITDA. Vistra Energy uses adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity and believes that analysis of its ability to service its cash obligations is supported by disclosure of both cash provided by (used in) operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP as well as adjusted free cash flow. The schedules attached to this earnings release reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nMedia\nAllan Koenig\n214-875-8004\nMedia.Relations@vistraenergy.com\nAnalysts\nMolly Sorg\n214-812-0046\nInvestor@vistraenergy.com\nAbout Vistra Energy\nVistra Energy is a premier Texas-based energy company focused on the competitive energy and power generation markets through operation as the largest retailer and generator of electricity in the growing Texas market.
