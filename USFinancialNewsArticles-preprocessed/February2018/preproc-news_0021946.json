    "text": "Feb 9 (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures rose this week to their highest in almost a year after 10-year bond yields hit a three-year high on inflation worries, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 327,540 contracts on Feb. 6, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. This was the most speculative net shorts in 10-year T-note futures since 409,659 in the week of Feb. 28, 2017. A week earlier, speculators held 215,600 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures.
