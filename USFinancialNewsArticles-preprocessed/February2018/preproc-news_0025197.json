Tony currently serves as AFI's Vice Chair for Corporate Council. The Corporate Council is an esteemed group of business community leaders from across the nation dedicated to supporting the Institute's preservation and educational initiatives.\nJimenez explained the importance of his new role by saying \"Having the unique opportunity to support developmental initiatives, help safeguard America's filmmaking history, and help to preserve the heritage of the motion picture is an amazing honor.\" As a nonprofit educational arts organization, AFI provides leadership in film and television and is dedicated to initiatives that engage the past, the present and the future of the moving image arts.\nIn 2011, the AFI Board of Trustees established a National Council under the leadership of AFI Trustee Brad Anderson.

The Council represents the ideal upon which AFI was created in the White House Rose Garden nearly 50 years ago...that movies matter and is one of our country's most important art forms.\nAFI is America's promise to preserve the history of the motion picture, to honor the artists and their work and to educate the next generation of storytellers. The goal of the Council is to reflect the diversity of the nation and interest in the facets of AFI's mission: to preserve, to honor and to educate.\nAbout MicroTech : MicroTech, a Certified and Verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) certified by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), has had noteworthy success since its inception in 2004.
