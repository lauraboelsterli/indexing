    "text": "Industry veteran brings management and regulatory expertise to the extraction world\nSACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ISI Labs Inc. (\"ISI\" or the \"company\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of ISI Capital Inc., is pleased to announce that they have acquired RxOil, a premier California based producer of high quality cannabis extracts. The acquisition will combine ISI's management expertise and superior manufacturing processes with RxOil's proprietary technology and high-yield capabilities to create a preeminent global supplier of cannabis extracts.\n\"I've never been so excited in my life to be joining a team like this,\" said Brandon Kidd of RxOil. \"The company has proven itself to be a best-in-class operator within the industry, and the synergy amongst the team members is exceptional.\"\nKidd believes that with ISI's proprietary platform, RxOil will be able to realize its business plan and extend the reach of current products, develop new branded products for niche markets and vastly expand their extraction capabilities well beyond all legal states in the near future.\nISI Labs, Inc. is focused on becoming the largest extraction company in the world through the creation and management of numerous facilities and brands, including the newly acquired RxOil. They currently have multiple major projects in development, including a new California facility which the company expects to be up and running in the next 120 days, as well as a new facility in Colorado which is on schedule to open this summer. The company has several additional strategic locations planned that have yet to be announced.\nJason Roth, Managing Director of ISI Labs Inc., said, \"We have one simple missionâ€”we will become the largest extraction entity in the world. We have the strongest business plan, the right funding, the proper talent and the strategic processes necessary to not only achieve success in this industry, but to transform it forever. Our adherence to the highest standards cannot be replicated, and our partnership with RxOil offers us our first branded solution for the cannabis extraction space.\"\nThis partnership provides operators with the opportunity to become involved in a company that brings organization and experience to an industry that desperately needs it. All of the facilities managed by ISI Labs Inc. implement proprietary processes through proven quality control systems that follow the strictest regulatory guidelines, known or unknown, to ensure safety and consistency.\nISI Labs Inc. plans on executing a multi-national rollout of the new RxOil brand and product offerings later this season through the Cornerstone Marketing Agency lead by Head of Marketing, Roiby Gonzalez. The in-house agency is responsible for the branding and advertising of every product produced by the ISI companies, and provides effective marketing support to retailers who carry those products. The company believes that through ISI Lab Inc.'s experienced leadership, and Cornerstone Marketing Agency's industry leading branding and promotion, RxOil will reemerge as a key provider and influencer in the extracts market.\nAbout ISI Labs Inc.\nISI Labs Inc. owns and operates multiple cannabis extraction facilities in California and Colorado. They are their expanding capabilities within the coming months to focus on additional strategic locations. ISI Labs Inc. is part of the extended ISI Capital Inc. family. Lead by a team of highly-seasoned professionals with experience in medical device manufacturing, the company produced $8 million annual sales in 2017 through ancillary products and services for the legal cannabis industry under the brands #THISTHINGRIPS and STOK. ISI Labs Inc. is committed to generating growth and becoming the largest extraction company in the industry by influencing key markets in Colorado, California, Canada, Europe and beyond.\nAbout RxOil\nRxOil is a premier extraction brand that produces CO2 cannabis extract in the form of oils, capsules and their convenient squeeze tubes called \"Crowns.\" RxOil has the capabilities and expertise necessary to meet the increased expectations of a rapidly growing global market. By following best-in-class processes set forth by ISI Labs Inc., RxOil is able to offer an additional layer of protection, safety and quality to their customers.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: Certain statements made in this press release regarding the company and any other statements regarding the company's future expectations, beliefs, goals or prospects constitute forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
