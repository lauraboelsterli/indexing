    "text": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Full-year trading at British online estate agent Purplebricks Group remains in line with expectations, the company said on Friday after its share price was sent tumbling 7 percent on Thursday by a broker’s research note.\nThe company, which plans to enter the New York market in the second quarter of 2018, also said it achieved 6,160 instructions in January, up 66 percent from last year. Its financial year ends in April.\nPurplebricks said that Thursday’s 7.5 percent share price decline was attributable to the research note published by Jefferies International, with which it took issue.\nThe company said it did not agree with the findings of the Jefferies report and contested its estimation of Purplebricks’ completion rate.\nReporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman\n ",
