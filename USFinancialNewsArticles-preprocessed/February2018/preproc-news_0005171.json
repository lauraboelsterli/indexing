( mstr.cd/2nwXaUZ ) \nThe quarter included a one-time charge of $981 million, primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. \nExcluding items, Mastercard earned $1.2 billion, or $1.14 per share, beating analysts’ estimate of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company’s net revenue jumped 20.2 percent to $3.31 billion, helped by growth in payments volume and processed transactions. \nMore people used credit, debit and commercial prepaid cards across Mastercard’s global network pushing the value of transactions processed - also known as gross dollar volume - up 15.4 percent to $1.42 trillion. \nMastercard, which has a large international business, got a big boost from consumer spending outside the United States, with its cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by overseas cardholders - rising 22.4 percent on a U.S. dollar converted basis. \nTotal operating expenses rose 28.5 percent to $1.79 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Vocalink. \nMastercard’s bigger rival Visa Inc reports on Thursday, after markets close.
