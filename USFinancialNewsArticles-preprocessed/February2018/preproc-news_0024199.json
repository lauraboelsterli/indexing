Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net ETF, DARK POOL TRADING BALLOONED DURING SELL-OFF (0634 GMT) Stats from last week's sell-off reveal exchange-traded funds saw massive trading volumes on the London Stock Exchange, while the exchange's dark pool cleared record amounts of trades as investors sought to put through large block trades incognito. Last Tuesday was the strongest day of ETF trading activity ever on the LSE, a spokeswoman said, with some 1.3 billion pounds traded in ETFs. Dark pool Turquoise saw a record amount processed in its large block platform Plato Block Discovery, with 2.46 billion euros in trading over the week as investors sought to put through big trades without moving the market. Turquoise overall beat its previous weekly record by 18 percent, with 7.43 billion euros worth of trades executed in the dark. (Helen Reid)",
