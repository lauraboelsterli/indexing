    "text": "Board Reaffirms Commitment to Management’s Existing Strategic Plan\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amber Road, Inc. (NYSE: AMBR), a leading provider of cloud-based global trade management (GTM) solutions, today confirmed that it has received an unsolicited offer from E2open, LLC and Insight Venture Partners to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Amber Road for $10.50 per share.\nAfter a thorough evaluation and diligent discussion of the offer, the Board of Directors has unanimously concluded that it is not in the best interest of the Company’s stockholders to pursue E2open’s proposed business combination, whereby Amber Road would cease to operate as a publicly traded company.\nThe Company had originally planned to respond to the unsolicited offer in advance of the February 16 th deadline established by E2open, but the response timing has been accelerated in light of E2open’s unexpected decision to publicly disclose the previously private offer.\n“Consistent with our fiduciary duty, we routinely evaluate strategic options to maximize value for our stockholders, and we remain committed to considering any credible strategic alternative that would help achieve this objective,” said Barry Williams, Chairman of the Board. “While we welcome constructive input from all parties that share this goal, the unsolicited offer advanced by E2open is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. We continue to firmly believe that executing our existing strategic plan is the best means of maximizing value for our stockholders and satisfaction for our customers over the long term.”\nAbout Amber Road\nAmber Road’s (NYSE: AMBR) mission is to dramatically transform the way companies conduct global trade.
