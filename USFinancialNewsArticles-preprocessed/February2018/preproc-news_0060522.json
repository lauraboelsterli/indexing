Tequila growth was robust across our family of brands and we continue to enjoy accelerated growth across our premium brands that is driving higher average net sales per case, both in tequila and across our other spirits brands. Margin performance was equally noteworthy during the fourth quarter as we expanded gross margins and reported 25% EBITDA growth. We celebrated many accomplishments during 2017, including our initial public offering and our most recently announced acquisition of the Pendleton Whisky brand assets. We have built a global spirts business with an attractive growth profile and the financial assets to further expand our growth portfolio of brands.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, total volume growth was 4.3% to 6.4 million nine-liter cases driven by 0.9% growth in the United States and Canada, a 2.9% increase in sales volumes in Mexico and a 28.5% increase in the Rest of World (RoW) region. Volume growth in the Mexico benefited from strong growth in tequila and a successful holiday season.

We calculate EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, and interest expense, less interest income, plus foreign exchange loss (gain).\nEBITDA is not a IFRS measure of liquidity or performance, nor is EBITDA recognized financial measures under IFRS. We believe that EBITDA can be useful to facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods on a combined basis, but these metrics may be calculated differently by other issuers. EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to (i) net income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance or (ii) cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company’s liquidity.\nDisclaimer\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements which are based on Becle’s current expectations and observations.
