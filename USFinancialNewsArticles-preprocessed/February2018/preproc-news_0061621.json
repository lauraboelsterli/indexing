(the \"Company\" or \"IBP\") (NYSE:IBP), an industry-leading installer of insulation and complementary building products, today announced record results for the full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet revenue increased 28.2% to $299.9 million Net income was $10.8 million Adjusted EBITDA* increased 21.5% to $36.2 million Net income per diluted share was $0.34 Adjusted net income per diluted share* increased 18.2% to $0.52 In October 2017, acquired A+ Insulation, LLC, an insulation installer in Kansas City with annual revenues of $3.8 million In October 2017, acquired Building Solutions, LLC, an insulation installer in Oklahoma with annual revenues of approximately $2.0 million In December 2017, acquired Blind Ambitions, LLC, an installer of window blinds, shades and shutters in multiple locations throughout the Southeast with trailing-twelve month revenue of $9.4 million In December 2017, acquired Allpro Insulation Co, an insulation installer in Raleigh with trailing-twelve month revenue of $2.8 million\nRecent Developments\nIn January 2018, acquired Rocket Insulation & Coatings Inc., an insulation installer in New York with annual revenues of $5.4 million In January 2018, acquired Allstate Insulation, an insulation installer in Kentucky with annual revenues of approximately $1.5 million IBP’s Board of Directors authorized a $50 million stock repurchase program effective as of March 2, 2018 through February 28, 2019, unless extended by the Board of Directors\n“IBP’s record 2017 financial and operating results reflect the continued success of the Company’s growth-oriented business model, disciplined acquisition strategy, and service-oriented culture,” stated Jeff Edwards, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Since going public in February 2014, IBP has successfully grown revenues to a record $1.1 billion, a 162% increase from $431.9 million for the full year 2013. In addition, we have enhanced our business platform by diversifying our installation services and expanding our geographic footprint to many of the strongest U.S. housing markets. As a result, at December 31, 2017 67% of revenues were from insulation installation services versus 74% at December 31, 2013. This diversification and expansion strategy positions IBP to provide more installation services and deepens our relationships with builders across the country.\n“IBP’s growth over the past four years is a direct result of the commitment of our nearly 7,000 employees. During 2017, IBP began offering a financial wellness program to our employees, and I am extremely pleased that approximately 40% of our eligible employees took advantage of the program.\n“As we start the new year, there continues to be significant opportunities to meaningfully grow revenues and profitability. We remain focused on our core insulation installation business, while further diversifying our installation services to new geographies, end markets, and product lines. IBP has a strong platform, disciplined approach, and experienced team to successfully identify, execute, and integrate acquisitions, and during 2017 the Company completed 16 acquisitions representing $172 million of annual revenues. Our pipeline of potential acquisitions is robust and we expect 2018 will be another strong year of acquisition growth. IBP’s performance and growth over the past year is encouraging, and I am excited by future opportunities to grow and create value for our shareholders. Given the Company’s strong financial position and our commitment to generating shareholder value, I am pleased to announce that the Board has approved a $50 million stock buyback plan and encouraged us to opportunistically repurchase shares,” concluded Mr. Edwards.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results Overview\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net revenue was $299.9 million, an increase of 28.2% from $234.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a same branch basis, net revenue improved 9.4% from the prior year quarter, with approximately 60% of the increase attributable to growth in the number of completed jobs, and the remainder achieved through more favorable customer and product mix.\nGross profit improved 19.0% to $81.3 million from $68.4 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted gross profit* improved 23.2% to $84.2 million, adjusting for the Company’s share based compensation expense and financial wellness program.\nSelling and administrative expense, as a percentage of net revenue, was 19.2% compared to 19.8% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted selling and administrative expense*, as a percentage of net revenue, improved 70 basis points to 18.5% from 19.2%. Higher net revenue in the 2017 fourth quarter more than offset the higher costs needed to support the Company’s growth.\nNet income was $10.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was $16.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $13.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income adjusts for the impact of non-core items in both periods, includes an addback for non-cash amortization expense related to acquisitions, and a reduction of the Company’s deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $36.2 million, a 21.5% increase from $29.8 million in the prior year quarter, largely due to leveraging administrative expenses on increased revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of net revenue, was 12.1%, compared to 12.7% in the prior year quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Results Overview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenue was $1,132.9 million, an increase of 31.3% from $863.0 million in 2016. On a same branch basis, net revenue improved 9.8% from the prior year, with approximately 60% of the increase attributable to growth in the number of completed jobs and the remainder achieved through price gains and more favorable customer and product mix. Same branch residential revenue increased 11.3% as compared to an 8.8% increase in total U.S. housing completions.\nGross profit improved 28.4% to $324.0 million from $252.4 million in the prior year. Gross margin was 28.6%, compared to 29.3% in the prior year. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted for the Company’s share based compensation expense and financial wellness program improved 29.7% to $327.4 million for the full year.\nSelling and administrative expense, as a percentage of net revenue, was 19.7% compared to 20.3% in the prior year. Adjusted selling and administrative expense, as a percentage of net revenue, improved 90 basis points to 18.9% from 19.8%.\nNet income was $41.1 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to $38.4 million, or $1.23 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $65.0 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, compared to $48.4 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income adjusts for the impact of non-core items in both periods, includes an addback for non-cash amortization expense related to acquisitions, and a release of the Company’s deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nFor the full year of 2017, adjusted EBITDA was $141.1 million, a 34.6% increase from $104.8 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of net revenue, improved to 12.5%, or 40 basis points, compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Operating income was $74.3 million, a 12.4% increase from $66.1 million in the prior year. The incremental Adjusted EBITDA margin* on same branch revenue growth was 13.8% (please refer to the Supplementary Tables at the end of this Press Release).\nStock Repurchase Program\nIBP’s Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program, effective as of March 2, 2018, pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its outstanding common stock. The program will remain in effect until February 28, 2019, unless extended by the Board of Directors.\nUnder the repurchase program, the Company may purchase shares of its common stock through open market transactions, block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of any repurchases under this program will be determined by the Company’s management at its discretion based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, corporate considerations, general market and economic conditions, and legal requirements. The program may be modified, discontinued or suspended at any time or from time to time. The Company anticipates funding for this program to come from available corporate funds, including cash on hand and future cash flow.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on February 28, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.

We believe that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and us in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business.\nWe believe the Adjusted EBITDA measure is useful to investors and us as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period as it measures our changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that impact operating performance, and removes the effect of our capital structure (primarily interest expense), asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), items outside our control (primarily income taxes) and the volatility related to the timing and extent of other activities such as asset impairments and non-core income and expenses. Accordingly, we believe that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. In addition, we use various EBITDA-based measures in determining the achievement of awards under certain of our incentive compensation programs. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, our measure may not be directly comparable to measures of other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently for purposes of covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or any future facility.\nAlthough we use the Adjusted EBITDA measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of the measure is limited because it does not include certain material expenses, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, GAAP net (loss) income as a measure of performance. Our presentation of this measure should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. This measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, this measure is not intended as an alternative to net (loss) income as an indicator of our operating performance, as an alternative to any other measure of performance in conformity with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. You should therefore not place undue reliance on this measure or ratios calculated using this measure.\nWe also believe the Adjusted Net Income measure is useful to investors and us as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period as it measures our changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that impact operating performance, and removes the effect of certain non-core items such as discontinued operations, acquisition related expenses, amortization expense, the tax impact of these certain non-core items, and the volatility related to the timing and extent of other activities such as asset impairments and non-core income and expenses. To make the financial presentation more consistent with other public building products companies, beginning in the fourth quarter 2016 we included an addback for non-cash amortization expense related to acquisitions. Accordingly, we believe that this measure is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Other companies may define Adjusted Net Income differently and, as a result, our measure may not be directly comparable to measures of other companies. In addition, Adjusted Net Income may be defined differently for purposes of covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or any future facility.\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, for the periods presented therein.\nPer share figures may reflect rounding adjustments and consequently totals may not appear to sum.\nINSTALLED BUILDING PRODUCTS, INC.
