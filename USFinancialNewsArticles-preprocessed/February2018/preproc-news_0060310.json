    "text": "Charlie McAvoy scored the winner in a two-point game, and Riley Nash and Tommy Wingels also had a goal and an assist apiece as the Boston Bruins beat the visiting Carolina Hurricanes 4-3 in overtime on Tuesday night.\nMcAvoy ended overtime at the 1:08 mark when he raced down the ice during an odd-man rush and elected to shoot to the delight of the TD Garden crowd. Nash, who took the place of the injured Patrice Bergeron on the top line, assisted on the winner. Bergeron is on the shelf after sustaining a broken foot on the weekend.\nBoston goalie Tuukka Rask regrouped from a spotty opening period and made 29 saves in the win that snapped the Bruins’ two-game losing skid.\nCarolina’s Brock McGinn opened the scoring with a power-play marker at 10:01 of the first period. McGinn batted out of the air a rebound attempt.\nHowever, Boston’s Rick Nash evened the game at the 11:41 mark. Nash was alone at the front of the net when he received a pass from David Krejci and buried the chance on Carolina goalie Scott Darling for his 800th career point.\nTeuvo Teravainen netted Carolina’s second power-play goal of the game at 13:09 of the wild opening frame, burying a glove-side shot from the right circle to restore the Hurricanes’ lead.\nSebastian Aho made it a 3-1 lead for the visitors with 55 seconds remaining in the first period. Aho was unchecked as he went to the net, and he completed a perfect deke after taking a pass from Teravainen.\nWith 2.9 seconds remaining in the period, though, Riley Nash made it a one-goal game. Wingels, making his Bruins debut after being acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks, set up Nash in the slot.\nWingels took his turn lighting the lamp at the 5:34 mark of the second period to even the game at 3-3. After taking a cross-ice pass from Jake DeBrusk (two assists) during a rush, Wingels ripped a blocker-side shot.\nDarling stopped 28 shots for the Hurricanes, who have lost six straight (0-4-2). Carolina’s Justin Faulk logged two assists.\nThe Hurricanes were without Jordan Staal, who missed a third straight game due to the death of his infant daughter, Hannah.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
