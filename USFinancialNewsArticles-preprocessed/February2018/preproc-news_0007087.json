Arguments over the wall and Lebanon’s plans to explore for offshore oil and gas in disputed waters have elevated tensions between them. \n“This wall, if it is built, will be considered an assault on Lebanese land,” the secretary general of Lebanon’s Higher Defence Council said in a statement after meeting senior government and military officials.

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo \n“The Higher Defence Council has given its instructions to confront this aggression to prevent Israel from building (the wall) on Lebanese territory,” it said, without elaborating. \nIsraeli officials did not immediately respond. Israel has previously said that the wall, and a disputed Mediterranean gas field, were on its territory. \nCalm has largely prevailed along the frontier since 2006, when Israel fought a war with Lebanon’s heavily-armed Shi‘ite Hezbollah movement. \nThe month-long conflict killed about 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 Israelis, most of them troops. There has been no major confrontation between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah since. Reporting by Ellen Francis; additional reporting by Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Editing by Janet Lawrence",
