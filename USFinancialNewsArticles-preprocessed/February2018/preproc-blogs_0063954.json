    "text": "February 28, 2018 / 1:03 PM / in 6 hours SAP CEO likely top earner among German blue-chip executives Reuters Staff 1 Min Read FRANKFURT (Reuters) - SAP Chief Executive Bill McDermott was awarded total 2017 benefits of 21.8 million euros ($26.7 million), according to the software maker’s compensation report, which could mean he topped the executive pay rankings at German blue-chips. The paycheck includes multi-year variable compensation and compares with a 15.6 million euro payout a year earlier. Carmaker Daimler’s Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche by comparison took home 13 million euros for 2017, likely making him the second-best paid German blue-chip manager. Many German companies have not yet published their compensation reports. Reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Maria Sheahan",
