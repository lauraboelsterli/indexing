    "text": "fall@ (Compares first-quarter forecast with estimates, adds analyst comment; updates share move)\nFeb 26 (Reuters) - Wearable device maker Fitbit Inc on Monday forecast current-quarter profit and revenue below Wall Street estimates and predicted lower revenue from newly launched products such Ionic and Alta HR.\nFitbit shares fell 11.3 percent to $4.93 in after-market trading after the company's fourth-quarter results also missed estimates due to an about 17 percent drop in sale of its fitness trackers in the holiday quarter.\nRevenue fell 0.5 percent to $570.8 million in the quarter and missed the average analyst estimate of $588.9 million.\nFitbit has been under pressure from rivals such as Apple Inc , Samsung Electronics, Xiaomi Inc and Garmin Ltd that have been gaining ground in a fast saturating wearables market.\nFor the first quarter, the company said it expects adjusted loss per share in the range of 18 cents to 21 cents and revenue of $240 million to $255 million. Analysts on average expected a loss of 9 cents on revenue of $340.3 million.\n\"Guidance is disappointing relative to our estimates and consensus. The press release indicates that demand for its Ionic smartwatch is strong, but isn't enough to offset the decline in demand for all of its older fitness trackers,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese said.\nThe company's net loss narrowed to $45.5 million, or 19 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $146.3 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the San Francisco, California-based company reported a loss of 2 cents per share. Analysts on average expected the company to report a break-even, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n(Reporting by Shariq Khan in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",
