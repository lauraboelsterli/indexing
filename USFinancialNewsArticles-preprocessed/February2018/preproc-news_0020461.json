During the fourth quarter, Regency acquired two shopping centers for approximately $150 million and sold five shopping centers for approximately $103 million. On February 6, 2018, Regency’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock of $0.555 per share, an annualized increase of 5.7%.\n“Regency’s unequaled combination of strategic advantages allowed for another remarkable year of performance, including strong levels of percent leased and same property NOI growth at or above 3.5% for the sixth consecutive year,” stated Martin E. “Hap” Stein, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our successes in 2017 and over the last six years demonstrate our ability to continually execute on our commitment to being best-in-class and realize our strategic objectives by delivering superior NOI, net asset value and earnings growth while creating long term value for our shareholders.”\nFinancial Results\nRegency reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of $85.1 million, or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $55.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Net Income was $159.9 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to $143.9 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.\nThe Company reported NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter of $161.4 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to $83.1 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.

The Company’s full year 2017 NAREIT FFO includes costs of $80.7 million associated with the merger of Regency and Equity One. No additional merger related costs are anticipated in 2018.\nCore FFO for the fourth quarter was $157.9 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $89.9 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Core FFO was $592.1 million, or $3.69 per diluted share, compared to $334.0 million, or $3.29 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.\nOperating Results\nFourth quarter same property NOI as adjusted, excluding termination fees, increased 2.7% compared to the same period in 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, same property NOI as adjusted, excluding termination fees, increased 3.6% compared to the same period in 2016 driven by base rent growth of 3.5%. In light of the merger with Equity One on March 1, 2017, same property NOI as adjusted is presented on a pro forma basis as if the merger had occurred January 1, 2016. Please refer to the Company’s supplemental package for additional details.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Regency’s wholly owned portfolio plus its pro-rata share of co-investment partnerships was 95.5% leased. The same property portfolio was 96.3% leased, which is an increase of 30 basis points sequentially and from the same period in 2016 when adjusted for the current same property pool. Within the same property portfolio, Small Shops were 92.5% leased, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and an increase of 40 basis points from the same period in 2016 when adjusted for the current same property pool. Within the same property portfolio, spaces greater than or equal to 10,000 square feet (“Anchors”) were 98.6% leased, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially and from the same period in 2016 when adjusted for the current same property pool.\nRegency executed approximately 1.8 million square feet of comparable new and renewal leases during the quarter at blended rent spreads of 6.0%. New leasing represented approximately 443,000 square feet, with Anchors representing nearly 60% of new activity, which compares to an average of 30% in the eight quarters prior. This significant contribution in new Anchor leasing drove higher committed tenant improvements for the quarter when compared to prior quarters. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company executed approximately 6.3 million square feet of comparable new and renewal leases at blended rent spreads of 7.8%.\nInvestments\nProperty Transactions\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company closed on approximately $150 million of acquisitions, and approximately $103 million of dispositions.\nScripps Ranch Marketplace (San Diego, CA) – In December, Regency acquired Scripps Ranch Marketplace, a 132,000 square foot neighborhood shopping center anchored by Vons for $81.6 million.

There have been no changes to the previously released guidance. Please refer to the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 supplemental information package for a complete list of guidance.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (“Net Income”) $1.47 - $1.56 NAREIT Funds From Operations (“NAREIT FFO”) per diluted share $3.73 - $3.82 Operating Funds From Operations (“Operating FFO”) per diluted\nshare\n$3.48 - $3.54 Same Property Net Operating Income (“SPNOI”) Growth excluding\ntermination fees (pro-rata)\n2.25% - 3.25% Acquisitions ($ thousands) +/- $150,000 Cap Rate (weighted average) +/- 4.75% Dispositions ($ thousands) +/- $150,000 Cap Rate (weighted average) +/- 7.25% Conference Call Information\nTo discuss Regency’s fourth quarter results, the Company will host a conference call on Friday, February 9, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET. Dial-in and webcast information is listed below.\nFourth Quarter Conference Call\nDate: Friday, February 9, 2018 Time: 11:00 a.m. ET Dial#: 877-407-0789 or 201-689-8562 Webcast: investors.regencycenters.com\nReplay\nWebcast Archive: Investor Relations page under Events & Webcasts\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to the required GAAP presentations, as it believes these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results. Regency manages its entire real estate portfolio without regard to ownership structure, although certain decisions impacting properties owned through partnerships require partner approval. Therefore, the Company believes presenting its pro-rata share of operating results regardless of ownership structure, along with other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of other REITs' operating results to the Company's more meaningful. Management continually evaluates the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of the Company’s reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\nNAREIT FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from dispositions of depreciable property, net of tax, excluding operating real estate impairments, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes NAREIT FFO for all periods presented in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Many companies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions. Since NAREIT FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from depreciable property dispositions, and impairments, it can provide a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, NAREIT FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. Core FFO is an additional performance measure used by Regency as the computation of NAREIT FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance. Core FFO excludes from NAREIT FFO: (a) transaction related income or expenses; (b) impairments on land; (c) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (d) development pursuit costs; and (e) other non-comparable amounts as they occur. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to NAREIT FFO and Core FFO for actual results. Operating FFO is an additional performance measure that excludes from Core FFO: (a) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and includes (b) development pursuit costs. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Operating FFO per diluted share for forward looking guidance.\nReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to NAREIT FFO and Core FFO - Actual (in thousands) For the Periods Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Three Months Ended\nYear to Date\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of Net Income to NAREIT FFO: Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 85,139 55,869 $ 159,949 143,860 Adjustments to reconcile to NAREIT Funds From Operations(1): Depreciation and amortization (excluding FF&E) 98,036 50,077 364,908 193,451 Provision for impairment to operating properties - 2,500 - 3,159 Gain on sale of operating properties (21,988 ) (25,410 ) (30,402 ) (63,426 ) Exchangeable operating partnership units 171 92 388 257 NAREIT Funds From Operations $ 161,358 83,128 $ 494,843 277,301 Reconciliation of NAREIT FFO to Core FFO: NAREIT Funds From Operations $ 161,358 83,128 $ 494,843 277,301 Adjustments to reconcile to Core Funds From Operations(1): Acquisition pursuit and closing costs - 242 138 2,007 Development pursuit costs 1,047 596 1,569 1,503 Income tax benefit (9,737 ) - (9,737 ) - Gain on sale of land (654 ) (883 ) (3,623 ) (8,769 ) Provision for impairment to land - 33 - 580 Loss on derivative instruments and hedge ineffectiveness (2 ) (1 ) (15 ) 40,589 Early extinguishment of debt 46 250 12,449 14,207 Merger related costs 5,131 6,539 80,715 6,539 Merger related debt offering interest - - 975 - Preferred redemption costs - - 12,227 - Hurricane losses 744 - 2,596 - Core Funds From Operations $ 157,933 89,904 $ 592,137 333,957 Weighted Average Shares For Diluted Earnings per Share 170,855 104,971 159,960 101,285 Weighted Average Shares For Diluted FFO and Core FFO per Share 171,205 105,125 160,255 101,439 (1) Includes pro-rata share of unconsolidated co-investment partnerships, net of pro-rata share attributable to noncontrolling interests.
