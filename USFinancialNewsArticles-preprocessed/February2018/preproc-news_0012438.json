Some assets had reached very high prices and there is therefore a correction on stock markets.” \n“At the last IMF (International Monetary Fund) meeting in Washington several people, including me, had said that asset prices, as well as the abundance of liquidity, were a concern. So a correction was something to be expected.” Reporting by Ingrid Melander; editing by Michel Rose",
