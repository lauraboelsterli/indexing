    "text": "DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sierra Leone has banned female genital mutilation (FGM) until after its March elections to stop candidates buying votes by paying for cutting ceremonies, the government said on Monday.\nFGM in the West African nation is widely practised as part of girls’ initiation into powerful secret societies - led by women - which wield significant political clout.\nThe government last month banned initiations to prevent the societies from intimidating people during campaigning ahead of elections on March 7, and to stop candidates swaying voters by paying for ceremonies, said state spokesman Cornelius Deveaux.\n“So many politicians use initiation into secret society during campaigns to gain votes, especially those of women,” said anti-FGM campaigner Rugiatu Neneh Turay, formerly the deputy minister of social welfare, gender and children’s affairs.\nPeople seeking office at all levels commonly contribute to FGM ceremonies, which often cost up to $200 with food, music, and the cutter’s fee taken into account, said Aminata Koroma, secretary of Sierra Leone’s Forum Against Harmful Practices.\nWith nine in 10 girls cut, Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of FGM in Africa, according to U.N. data, and is one of only a handful of African countries which has not outlawed the internationally condemned practice.\nThe ritual typically involves the partial or total removal of the female genitalia and can cause serious health problems.\nThe ban is the first of its kind during an election season and applies until March 31, according to Maya Kaikai, Sierra Leone’s minister of local government and rural development.\nFormer minister Turay said she hoped the ban would pave the way for activists to work with the government to stamp out FGM.\nBut global human rights group Equality Now and aid agency ActionAid, which are both working to eradicate FGM in Sierra Leone, said they did not see the ban as a sign of progress.\n“This is just a political move,” Felister Gitonga of Equality Now told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It has nothing to do with protecting the rights of women.”\nSierra Leone also banned FGM in 2014 during the height of the Ebola crisis amid fears that cutting rituals would exacerbate the spread of the disease. Although the practice dropped off at the time, campaigners say it has since rebounded.\nLast month neighboring Liberia banned FGM for a year under an executive order signed by outgoing president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Activists have urged new President George Weah to push for a permanent law against the practice.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Kieran Guilbert; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
