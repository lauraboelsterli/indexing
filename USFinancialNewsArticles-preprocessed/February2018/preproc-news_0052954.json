Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2017 was primarily driven by the strong performance at Altus Analytics, and the year-over-year improvements at Geomatics. Exchange rate movements against the Canadian dollar impacted revenues by (1.4%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (1.1%). Acquisitions contributed 1.8% to revenues and 1.1% to Adjusted EBITDA. Indicative of the Company’s global growth initiatives, 55% of Altus Group’s revenues were derived from outside of Canada in 2017, compared to 54% in 2016.\nConsolidated profit, in accordance with IFRS, was $110.1 million, up 671.4% from $14.3 million in 2016. On a per share basis, it was $2.89 per share basic, and $2.85 per share diluted, compared to $0.39 and $0.38 respectively in 2016. In addition to the continued growth in Adjusted EBITDA, profit also benefitted from a favourable change in the fair value of interest rate swaps compared to the same period in 2016 and a material net accounting gain of $115.2 million on the partial deemed dispositions and re-measurement of retained interest in the Company’s investment in Real Matters Inc.\nAdjusted EPS was $1.13, down 1.7% from $1.15 in 2016.\nAltus Analytics sustained its continued growth, increasing revenues by 11.7% to $169.2 million, with a 5.2% increase in recurring revenues to $117.8 million on increases in subscriptions and appraisal management, partly offset by lower software maintenance revenues for the DCF product, following the end of support of the DCF product on June 30, 2017. Non-recurring revenues grew by 30.1% driven by solid ARGUS Enterprise (“AE”) license sales, increased software services revenues and strong growth in due diligence assignments. For the year, AE license sales benefitted from customers adding more licenses and functionality, new clients, and continued client conversions to AE. Growth from the acquisition of EstateMaster contributed 2.6% to revenues. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 18.1% to $48.4 million, reflecting the higher revenues, partly offset by higher expenses as we made investments for ARGUS product development activities. Altus Analytics Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 28.6% from 27.1% in 2016. Changes in the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar impacted revenues by (2.3%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (1.2%).\nThe CRE Consulting business segment also experienced growth in 2017. CRE Consulting revenues grew by 5.6% to $261.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.5% to $52.4 million. Despite the U.S. and U.K. currency headwinds, Property Tax revenues increased by 5.0% to $158.7 million, while Valuation and Cost Advisory revenues were up by 6.7% to $102.5 million, primarily due to performance from the global Cost practice. Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.5% to $52.4 million, with Property Tax Adjusted EBITDA increasing 0.6% to $40.3 million, and Valuation and Cost Advisory Adjusted EBITDA decreasing 0.2% to $12.0 million. Changes in the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar impacted revenues by (1.1%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (0.6%).\nGeomatics’ revenues increased by 7.7% to $48.5 million as a result of increased activity levels encouraged by higher oil prices during 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 502.4% to $3.5 million due to improved market conditions, and as a result of right-sizing initiatives.\nCorporate costs were $22.1 million in 2017, compared to $18.2 million in 2016. The increase in corporate costs is primarily due to higher compensation as investments are being made in people and systems to modernize our corporate functions in information technology and human resources.\nAt the end of the year, Altus Group’s balance sheet remained strong, giving the Company financial flexibility to pursue its growth strategy. The Company’s bank debt was $150.4 million, representing a funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.84 times, compared to 1.53 times at the end of 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Review:\nOn a consolidated basis, fourth quarter revenues increased 6.4% to $122.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 7.9% to $20.4 million. Exchange rate movements against the Canadian dollar impacted consolidated revenues by (1.8%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (2.3%). Acquisitions contributed 3.2% to revenues and (3.6%) to Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter.\nConsolidated profit, in accordance with IFRS, was $(3.4) million or $(0.09) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to $8.9 million and $0.24 per share basic and $0.23 per share diluted during the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted EPS was $0.15 in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAltus Analytics revenues were lower by 0.8% at $41.9 million. Recurring revenues grew by 2.8% (or 6.5% without the impact of foreign exchange) on increases in subscriptions from ARGUS products as well as a healthy increase from Altus Data Solutions products in Canada. Non-recurring revenues declined by 8.9% (or declined by 5.3% without the impact of foreign exchange) following a strong Q3 in which we experienced an increase of 45.5%. The decline in non-recurring revenues was due to lower AE license sales. AE license sales were moderately lower in the quarter but were expected following the double-digit strength of the third quarter. We continued to see in the fourth quarter increases in AE license sales from existing customers adding more licenses and modules as well as sales to new clients. Growth from the acquisition of EstateMaster contributed 2.7% to revenues. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 39.4% to $7.2 million, as a result of lower revenues, higher expenses as we made investments for ARGUS product development activities and higher variable compensation in the quarter as a result of much stronger annual performance. Changes in the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar impacted revenues by (3.7%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (4.2%).\nThe CRE Consulting revenues increased 12.4% to $69.4 million, including a 15.0% increase to $42.0 million at Property Tax, and an 8.6% increase to $27.4 million at Valuation and Cost Advisory. Property Tax experienced a strong finish in North America, driven by a significant win in the U.S. transaction tax practice, the start of a new cycle in Manitoba for the Canadian business and the acquisition of CVS in the U.K., which provided acquisitive growth of 6.9% on Property Tax revenues in the quarter. Valuation and Cost Advisory revenues increased by 8.6% on stronger performance from the global Cost practice, which experienced solid growth in Canada and Australia. Adjusted EBITDA for CRE Consulting increased by 21.5% to $7.9 million, driven by a 18.4% increase to $5.1 million at Property Tax and a 27.4% increase to $2.8 million at Valuation and Cost Advisory. The increase in Property Tax earnings was driven by increased earnings from the North American operations. Changes in exchange rates impacted revenues by (0.9%) and Adjusted EBITDA by (0.2%).\nGeomatics’ revenues were relatively flat at $11.6 million, while Adjusted EBITDA declined marginally by $0.16 million to $0.03 million.\nCorporate costs (recovery) were $(5.3) million in the fourth quarter, compared to $(3.6) million in the same period in 2016. In the first three quarters of the year, bonuses were accrued in the Corporate segment, subject to the overall finalization of bonuses at year-end. In the fourth quarter, bonuses were allocated to the business units which led to the recovery. The increase in corporate recoveries was primarily due to higher variable compensation that was allocated to the business units.\nQ4 & FY 2017 Results Conference Call & Webcast Date: Thursday, February 22, 2018 Time: 5:00 p.m. (ET) Webcast: altusgroup.com (under the Investors tab) Live Call: 1-800-273-9672 (toll-free) or 416-340-2218 (Toronto area) Replay: A replay of the call will be available via the webcast at altusgroup.com\nAbout Altus Group Limited\nAltus Group Limited is a leading provider of independent advisory services, software and data solutions to the global commercial real estate industry.
