CAS Series 2018-C01, a $1.494 billion note offering, is scheduled to settle on February 14, 2018. CAS is Fannie Mae's benchmark issuance program designed to share credit risk on its single-family conventional guaranty book of business.\n\"Our first transaction of 2018 was met with solid demand as we continue to attract a diversified base of investors drawn to the consistency and liquidity of our program,\" said Laurel Davis, vice president of credit risk transfer, Fannie Mae. \"Per our published deal calendar, we expect to return to the market with our next CAS deal, 2018-C02, in early March, which will reference loans with loan-to-value ratios between 80 and 97 percent.\"\nThe reference pool for CAS Series 2018-C01 consists of more than 186,000 single-family mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of approximately $44.9 billion.
