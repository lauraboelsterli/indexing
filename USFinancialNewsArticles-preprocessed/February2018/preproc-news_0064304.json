    "text": "* Prices fall for second day\n* Brent, WTI down around 0.6 pct\nU.S. stocks of crude, gasoline rise\n* (Adds graphic, comment, updates prices)\nBy Aaron Sheldrick\nTOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices extended declines into a second day on Wednesday as the dollar gained and industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles, with surging production in the country hampering OPEC attempts to end a global glut.\n  37 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $62.64 by 0142     down 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $66.23 a barrel. On Tuesday, the contract fell 87 cents to close at $66.63 a barrel.\n\"There is ongoing pressure, largely coming from a stronger U.S. dollar,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\nThe dollar rose 0.1 percent to against the Japanese yen to 107.43 yen. A stronger greenback makes oil more expensive for other currency holders as crude is usually priced in dollars.\nU.S. crude stockpiles climbed last week as imports increased, while gasoline inventories climbed and distillate stocks were drawn down, industry group   said on Tuesday.\nCrude inventories   421.2 million, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.1 million barrels.\nCrude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 1.3 million barrels, the API said. Refinery   day, API data showed.\nOfficial data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due out later on Wednesday.\nSoaring U.S. production has pressured oil futures at a time when members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia have reduced output in an attempt to support prices.\n\"Production numbers and rig counts are just as important at this stage, particularly with U.S. production breaking through the 10 million barrel per day level,\" said McCarthy.\n\"Further increases there and further rigs coming on, where we have seen an acceleration in recent weeks, could also add to pressure on the oil complex,\" he said.\nThe United States will overtake Russia as the world's biggest oil producer by 2019, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday.\n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick Editing by Joseph Radford and Richard Pullin)",
