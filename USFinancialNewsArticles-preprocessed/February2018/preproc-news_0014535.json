    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Shanghai nickel rose sharply on Friday after a rollercoaster week, tracking an overnight jump in London prices as investors took up new long positions. FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE NICKEL: The most traded May nickel contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) was up 2.7 percent at 105,140 yuan ($16,741.77) a tonne at 0215 GMT, reversing three straight days of losses. The metal, which opened up 3 percent, is on course for a weekly gain of 1 percent. [nL8N1PR401 * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded March copper contract on the ShFE was down 0.2 percent at 53,050 yuan a tonne, as the dollar edged upward. A stronger dollar makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies. * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was unchanged at $7,119 a tonne, after ending flat in the previous session. * CHILE: The powerful union at BHP's Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, on Wednesday cast doubt on chances of starting talks on a new labour agreement with the company before formal negotiations scheduled for June. * ANGOLA: Australia's VDM Group said it has signed a heads of agreement with Jiangxi Copper regarding the latter's participation in the Cachoeiras do Binga copper project in Angola. * SOUTH AFRICA: Glencore on Thursday said copper output in 2018 should rise to nearly 1.5 million tonnes as its Katanga mine in Democratic Republic of Congo ramps up to add roughly 150,000 tonnes, as well as 11,600 tonnes of cobalt. * MADAGASCAR: Japan's Sumitomo Corp said on Thursday it has resumed production at the Ambatovy nickel-cobalt project in Madagascar from end-January after halting operations earlier last month due to damages caused by cyclone. * BAUXITE: Guinean bauxite mining company La Guineenne des Mines (GDM) shipped the first ore from its project in the western Boke region on Thursday and will target exports of 2 to 4 million tonnes this year, its chief executive said.
