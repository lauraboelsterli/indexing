These modifications were designed to further improve the performance and reliability of MosaiQ, which has been demonstrated with our latest performance evaluation data. In the next several days we expect to resume the V&V study for blood grouping, which is the final step prior to commencing our European field trials.” Mr. Cowan added “the improved manufacturing processes are expected to benefit the performance of the expanded assay menu to be incorporated into the MosaiQ IH II Microarray, which is currently moving from development into manufacturing. MosaiQ will deliver the benefits of high throughput automation with the ease of use and cost efficiency of a single universal testing platform, providing our customers with the capability to fully characterize and screen each unit of donated blood in a single testing event.”\nMosaiQ IH Microarray - Antigen Typing\nA summary of the latest performance evaluation data for antigen typing, following the recent manufacturing process changes, is set out below:\nBlood Group Antigen A B D C c E e Cw K k Concordance 100.0 % 100.0 % 99.6 % 100.0 % 99.9 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % In this study 766 donor samples were tested and the results compared with predicate technologies.\nMosaiQ IH Microarray - Antibody Detection\nThe latest performance evaluation data for antibody detection continues to indicate performance at 99.0% concordance compared with the predicate technology.\nMosaiQ SDS Microarray\nThe latest process validation data for the initial disease screening microarray (to detect CMV and Syphilis) supports the decision to move into a formal V&V study for this product. The most recent performance evaluation data are summarized below:\nPathogen Sensitivity Specificity CMV 100.0 % 99.5 % Syphilis 100.0 % 99.4 % In this study a total of 548 known positive and negative samples were tested. 59% of samples tested for CMV were positive and 35% of samples tested for Syphilis were positive.\nUpcoming Regulatory and Commercial Milestones\nBuilding on these recent achievements Quotient expects a number of key development, regulatory and commercial milestones to be achieved during calendar 2018, which include:\nCompletion of EU field trials and regulatory approval for the MosaiQ IH Microarray, the MosaiQ IH II Microarray (incorporating the extended antigen typing panel for donor testing) and the MosaiQ SDS Microarray (for CMV and Syphilis) European Commercialization – Quotient has commenced the commercialization of MosaiQ in Europe, where it has already been invited to participate in tenders by European donor testing agencies Completion of U.S. Field Trials for the MosaiQ IH II Microarray and the MosaiQ SDS Microarray (for CMV and Syphilis) Completion of development for the MosaiQ IH III Microarray (for patient testing) and the MosaiQ SDS II Micorarray encompassing the full serological disease screening panel for donor disease screening (for red cells and plasma)\nMosaiQ Platform\nMosaiQ, Quotient's next-generation platform is designed to deliver fast, comprehensive antigen typing, antibody detection and disease screening results, using a single low volume sample in a high throughput automated format. MosaiQ represents a transformative and highly disruptive unified testing platform for transfusion diagnostics. Feasibility has also been demonstrated with respect to the detection of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) using the MosaiQ platform. Through MosaiQ, Quotient expects to deliver substantial value to donor testing laboratories worldwide by providing affordable, routine comprehensive characterization and screening of blood products, on a single automated instrument platform designed to radically reduce labor costs and complexity associated with existing practice.\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results\n“During the third quarter, strong revenue growth was generated by all key categories of our conventional reagent business. Both our OEM and U.S. direct businesses had another very strong quarterly performance, which contributed to year over year growth in product sales and gross profit from product sales of 17% and 49% respectively, ” said Paul Cowan.\nKey revenue and profit results are summarized below (expressed in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue: Product sales —OEM Customers $ 3,829 $ 3,502 $ 12,625 $ 10,860 Product sales — direct customers and distributors 1,824 1,339 5,164 4,541 Other revenues 206 — 806 1,300 Total revenue $ 5,859 $ 4,841 $ 18,595 $ 16,701 Product sales from standing orders (%) 76 % 75 % 75 % 75 % Gross profit $ 3,534 $ 2,239 $ 10,652 $ 8,247 Gross profit as a % of total revenue 60.3 % 46.3 % 57.3 % 49.4 % Gross margin on product sales (%) 58.9 % 46.3 % 55.3 % 45.1 % Operating (loss) $ (17,095 ) $ (22,430 ) $ (52,062 ) $ (56,321 ) Net cash used in operating activities totaled $20.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (“3QFY18”), compared with $13.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (“3QFY17”). Capital expenditures totaled $5.1 million in 3QFY18, compared with $5.8 million in 3QFY17, largely reflecting expenditures in connection with the construction of the Company’s conventional reagent manufacturing facility near Edinburgh, Scotland. Quotient ended 3QFY18 with $34 million in cash and other short-term investments.\nDuring the quarter the Company completed a private placement of 7,864,683 ordinary shares and 550,000 pre-paid warrants, together with warrants for the purchase of a further 8,414,683 ordinary shares at $5.80 per share, prior to July 31, 2018, which were issued at a purchase price of $0.125 per warrant. The initial sale of ordinary shares and warrants generated proceeds of approximately $40 million.\nOutlook for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2018\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 is now expected to be in the range of $24.1 to $24.6 million. Total revenue expectations now include other revenue of $0.8 which was formerly expected to be $2 million, due to lower than anticipated product development fee resulting from a delay in the regulatory approval of certain liquid reagent products. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was $22.2 million, including product development fees of $2.1 million. Product sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 are now expected to be $23.3 to $23.8 million, compared with Product sales of $20.1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Operating loss in the range of $70.0 to $75.0 million, including non-cash items of $20.0 to $21.0 million.\nProduct sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 are expected to be within the range of $5.5 to $6.0 million, compared with $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nQuarterly product sales can fluctuate depending upon the shipment cycles for red blood cell based products, which account for approximately two-thirds of our current product sales. These products typically experience 13 shipment cycles per year, equating to three shipments of each product per quarter, except for one quarter per year when four shipments occur. The timing of shipment of bulk antisera products to OEM customers may also move revenues from quarter to quarter. Some seasonality in demand is also experienced around holiday periods in both Europe and the United States. As a result of these factors, Quotient expects to continue to see seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variations in product sales. The timing of product development fees included in other revenues is mostly dependent upon the achievement of pre-negotiated project milestones.\nConference Call\nQuotient will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 6 th at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2018 financial results.
