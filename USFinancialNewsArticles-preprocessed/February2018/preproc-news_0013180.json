    "text": "COEUR D’ALENE, Idaho, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jack W. Gustavel, Executive Chairman of Idaho Independent Bank (“IIB” or the “Bank”) (OTC Pink:IIBK), announced IIB’s unaudited, consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Pre-tax income for 2017 was $7.5 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 53.0%, over the $4.9 million earned in 2016. “The improvement was primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth and an increase in the Bank’s net interest margin,” Chairman Gustavel stated.\nGustavel noted that when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law on December 22, 2017, IIB revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates. Consequently, income tax expense for the Bank’s fourth quarter of 2017 was increased by a one-time, noncash charge of $1.7 million. Because of the $1.7 million revaluation, IIB posted an after-tax loss of $.3 million for the fourth quarter, or a loss of $0.04 per diluted share, compared to after-tax income of $1.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. After-tax income for the full year, including the revaluation, was $3.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $4.1 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for 2016. Mr. Gustavel said that “The new law will be good for IIB over the long-term, as the Bank will benefit from the top corporate tax rate being lowered from 35% to 21%.”\nAt December 31, 2017, the Bank's total assets were $692.9 million, an increase of $74.1 million, or 12.0%, when compared to December 31, 2016. Total loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $41.3 million, or 12.7%, to $365.9 million; while deposits and repurchase agreements increased $69.4 million, or 12.9%, to $608.3 million over the same timeframe. As of December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $6.5 million, or 1.8% of total loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, and nonperforming assets continued to be less than 0.2% of total assets.\nAs of quarter end, the Bank’s stockholders' equity to average total assets was 9.7%, and IIB’s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory thresholds required to be considered “Well-Capitalized.” During the fourth quarter, the Bank purchased 43,949 shares of its common stock at a cost of $495,469. IIB may still purchase shares worth up to $820,000 under its current buyback approval.\nIIB filed its Consolidated Report of Condition and Income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, (\"Call Report\") with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on January 29, 2018, and is available on the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council website at http://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/ .\nAbout IIB\nIIB was established in 1993 as an Idaho state-chartered, commercial bank that operates branches in Boise (3), Caldwell, Coeur d’Alene, Hayden, Meridian, Mountain Home, Nampa, Star, and Ketchum/Sun Valley, Idaho.
