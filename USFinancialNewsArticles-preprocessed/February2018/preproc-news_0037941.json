    "text": "February 19, 2018 / 10:13 AM / Updated 7 hours ago British police arrest woman over 'move your van' note on ambulance Reuters Staff 2   A woman who left an angry note on an ambulance responding to an emergency call telling the paramedics to “move your van” has been arrested, British police said on Monday. The handwritten message was left on the vehicle which as left in a parking space outside a home in Stoke-on-Trent, central England, while the crew attended to the incident on Sunday. “If this van is for anyone but Number 14 then you have no right to be parked here,” the note said. “I couldn’t give a shit if the whole street collapsed. Now move your van from outside my home.” The note drew widespread condemnation in Britain after it was posted on social media by a local paramedic mentor and the local police commander said a 26-year-old woman had been arrested for public order offences. “Emergency Services must be able to carry out their roles without fear of abuse/intimidation of any kind,” Chief Inspector John Owen wrote on Twitter. “To avoid any confusion, the arrest relates to matters of verbal abuse that could constitute an offence under the Public Order Act. It does not relate solely to the note.” Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Guy Faulconbridge",
