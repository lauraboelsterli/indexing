    "text": "Feb 20 (Reuters) - The worldâ€™s biggest miner BHP said on Tuesday its underlying half-year profit rose 25 percent, helped by robust commodity prices.\nUnderlying profit for the half year ended Dec. 31 rose to $4.05 billion from $3.24 billion a year ago. That missed a forecast of $4.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe miner declared an interim dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.40 a share last year.
