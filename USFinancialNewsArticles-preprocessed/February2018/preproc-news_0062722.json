    "text": "1 COMMENTS An ethical misstep by a National Labor Relations Board member has caused the body overseeing union-employer disputes to vacate one of the most significant decisions it made last year.\nThe board on Monday withdrew a December decision that had overturned an Obama-era ruling that could have made it easier for contractors and workers at franchised businesses to form unions and collectively bargain with big corporations.\nThe board’s ethics officer has determined that William Emanuel, a Republican nominated by President Donald Trump to the body last year, should have been disqualified from participating in the proceeding. \nMr. Emanuel’s former law firm, Littler Mendelson P.C., represented Leadpoint, a staffing services firm that was party to the 2015 case that was overturned.\nEarlier in February, the board’s inspector general had issued a memorandum finding “a serious and flagrant problem ” with the December ruling, saying Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself from the case. \nAt the time, Mr. Emanuel was one of three Republicans on the five-member board. The two Democrats on the board dissented on the ruling.\nThe board was controlled by Democrats in 2015 when it found Leadpoint workers at a recycling center in California were effectively employees of Browning-Ferris Industries , the waste-management company that hired the staffing firm. The ruling made it possible for workers at Leadpoint to unionize and bargain with the large waste-management company.\nThe original decision had opened the door wider for workers at staffing firms and business franchises to unionize. The Browning-Ferris case was thus thought to have implications for McDonald’s , Subway and other brands with many franchised locations.\nThe December decision to overturn the ruling was widely praised by business groups and decried by unions and workers’ advocates. It found that workers could only be recognized as employees when a firm had direct control over them, making it harder for contractors or those at franchises to organize.\nThe implications of vacating the December ruling are unclear. The Republican-controlled NLRB could choose not to enforce the older ruling.\nStill, business groups said the vacated ruling increases uncertainty for employers. The International Franchise Association has called on Congress to pass a law to clarify the joint-employment standard.\nWrite to Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com",
