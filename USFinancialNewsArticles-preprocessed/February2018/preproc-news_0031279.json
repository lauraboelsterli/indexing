On Monday, the company, which is owned by SoftBank , showed its SpotMini bot opening a door using its extendable arm/neck. The robot made its debut in a video last year, sorting through recycling, putting away dishes and climbing stairs of a home. At just over two and a half feet tall, it’s the smaller version of the company’s Spot robot, which was introduced in 2015. It still doesn’t know how to unlock your door — yet. ",
