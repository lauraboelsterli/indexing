Effective January 1, 2018, Alarm.com will capitalize a portion of its commission costs as an incremental cost of obtaining a contract. Previously, Alarm.com expensed commission costs as incurred. Alarm.com does not believe the capitalization of commission costs will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn order to facilitate comparison of Alarm.com's fourth quarter financial results to prior periods, the table below summarizes the impact of (i) the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”), (ii) treatment of tax windfall benefits under the newly adopted accounting standard (ASU 2016-09), and (iii) other non-GAAP adjustments as described in further detail below:\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results (in thousands, except per share data) As Reported\n(GAAP) As Adjusted\n(non-GAAP)\n(1) Total revenue $ 88,793 $ 88,793 Income before income taxes $ 12,291 $ 20,139 (2) Provision for income taxes $ 11,971 $ 7,109 (3) Net income $ 320 $ 13,030 (2) (3) Net income per share - diluted $ 0.01 $ 0.26 (2) (3) (1) See the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures section below for detail on the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results.

For more information, please visit www.alarm.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with GAAP, this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted income before income taxes, non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted income attributable to common stockholders before income taxes, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share. We have included non-GAAP measures in this press release because they are financial and operating measures used by our management to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP measures of our financial results provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, business trends and financial condition. While we believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and management in analyzing our financial performance, non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts and transactions that are included in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures do not serve as an alternative to GAAP nor do we consider our non-GAAP measures in isolation, accordingly we present non-GAAP financial measures only in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to consider non-GAAP measures only in conjunction with our GAAP financials and to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures which are included in this press release.\nWith respect to our expectations under “Financial Outlook” above, reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures, in particular, non-ordinary course litigation expense, acquisition-related expense and tax windfall adjustments can have unpredictable fluctuations based on unforeseen activity that is out of our control and/or cannot reasonably be predicted. We expect the above charges to have a significant and potentially highly variable impact on our future GAAP financial results. The litigation expense we exclude from this calculation relates to non-ordinary course litigation expenses, including those expenses resulting from ongoing intellectual property litigation. Notably, we do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses, including those expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nWe exclude one or more of the following items from non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense: We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which relates to stock options and other forms of equity incentives primarily awarded to employees of Alarm.com, because they are non-cash charges that we do not consider when assessing the operating performance of our business. Additionally, the determination of stock-based compensation expense can be calculated using various methodologies and is dependent upon subjective assumptions and other factors that vary on a company by company basis. Therefore, we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures improves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry.\nLitigation expense: We exclude non-ordinary course litigation expense because we do not consider legal costs incurred in litigation and litigation-related matters of non-ordinary course lawsuits, particularly costs incurred in ongoing intellectual property litigation, to be indicative of our core operating performance. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses, including those expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nAcquisition-related expense: Included in operating expenses are external incremental costs directly related to completing the acquisition and integration of the Connect and Piper business units from Icontrol Networks, Inc. We exclude acquisition-related expense from our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of this transaction and its integration costs on our total operating expenses.\nDepreciation expense: We record depreciation primarily for investments in property and equipment. We exclude depreciation in calculating adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider depreciation when we evaluate our ongoing business operations. For non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, basic and diluted, we do not exclude depreciation.\nAmortization expense: GAAP requires that operating expenses include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which principally include acquired customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. We exclude amortization of intangibles from our non-GAAP financial measures because we do not consider amortization expense when we evaluate our ongoing business operations, nor do we factor amortization expense into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or our measurement of the performance of those acquisitions. We believe that the exclusion of amortization expense enables the comparison of our performance to other companies in our industry as other companies may be more or less acquisitive than us and therefore, amortization expense may vary significantly by company based on their acquisition history.\nInterest expense: We record interest expense primarily related to our debt facility. We exclude interest expense in calculating our adjusted EBITDA calculation. For non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, basic and diluted, we do not exclude interest expense.\nOther income, net: We exclude other income, net from our non-GAAP financial measures because we do not consider it part of our ongoing results of operations.\nIncome taxes : We exclude the impact related to income taxes from our adjusted EBITDA calculation. We also exclude the impact related to (i) the adoption of the new accounting standard for employee share-based transactions and (ii) the impact related to the tax reform enacted in December 2017, from our provision for income taxes within our non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, basic and diluted. We do not consider these tax adjustments to be part of our ongoing results of operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
