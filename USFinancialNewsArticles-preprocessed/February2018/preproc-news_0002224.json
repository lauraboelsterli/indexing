    "text": "(Corrects official’s affiliation in 2nd paragraph to Dalian exchange, not securities regulator)\n* Details of Dalian exchange contract still to worked out\n* Contract to allow hedging against volatility - exchange\nBEIJING, Feb 6 (Reuters) - China’s securities regulator has approved an application from the Dalian Commodity Exchange to launch a hog futures contract, the exchange said in a statement late on Monday, paving the way for major changes to trading in the world’s top pork market.\nDetails on the type of contract and timing for the launch have yet to be decided, an official at the exchange told Reuters.\nThe exchange has spent more than a decade researching the feasibility of hog futures, which will complete Dalian’s hedging offering for the whole meat industry supply chain, including soybean, soymeal and corn futures. It submitted a formal application to operate a live hog contract early last year.\nThe hog futures approval also comes ahead of a long-awaited crude oil futures contract, for which regulatory approval is expected soon.\nChina consumes about 55 million tonnes of pork a year, half of the global total, but production is highly cyclical. Futures will help pig farmers hedge the risks of price swings in the highly volatile market, the exchange said in its statement.\nRapid industrialisation in pig farming in China is giving way to larger, more standardised producers, which will make it easier to develop a contract based on the live animal.\nAround 200 companies were producing more than 50,000 hogs a year in 2016, it said, about 8 percent of the national output.\nThe Dalian exchange will still need a final go-ahead from the State Council, or Chinese cabinet, before commencing trading.
