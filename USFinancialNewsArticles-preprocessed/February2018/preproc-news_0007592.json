    "text": "Blackstone Why Blackstone Billionaire Tony James Expects Stocks to Drop 20% This Year Tony James, president and chief operating officer of Blackstone Group LP, listens during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Monday, May 1, 2017. The conference is a unique setting that convenes individuals with the capital, power and influence to move the world forward meet face-to-face with those whose expertise and creativity are reinventing industry, philanthropy and media.

Fallon—Bloomberg/Getty Images By Bloomberg 11:38 AM EST \nEquity markets could fall as much as 20 percent this year, Blackstone Group LP President Tony James said. \n“Every historic norm says that stocks are very, very fully valued,” James said Monday in an interview on CNBC, adding that the market decline could be 10 percent to 20 percent. \nGlobal stocks on Monday extended the biggest selloff since 2016, with U.S. shares continuing last week’s decline and European and Asian equities falling. The slump was sparked by U.S. wage data Friday that pointed to quickening inflation, which would lead to higher rates and therefore rising borrowing costs for companies. \nThe U.S. economy has been picking up for a while and further stimulus from recent tax cuts may not have been necessary, James said. \n“If you’re worried about interest rates and inflation, the stimulus could be the thing that tips us over into a rate spike,” the billionaire said. \nJames said that in addition to investing his personal money in New York-based Blackstone’s products, he holds floating-rate senior secured debt instruments including bank loans and mortgages, which he said are yielding about 6 percent. \nBlackstone last week said its fourth-quarter profit rose 4.8 percent as holdings appreciated amid widespread market gains.
