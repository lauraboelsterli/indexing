Highlights Include:\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 20.7 percent over 2016 to $5.8 billion. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 41.5 percent over 2016 to $110.2 million. Segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 3.0 percent over 2016 to $310.9 million. Adjusted net income for the full year ended December 31, 2017 increased 32.2 percent over 2016 to $144.8 million. Unrestricted cash and investments were $261.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Approximately $143.9 million of the unrestricted cash and investments related to excess capital and undistributed earnings held at regulated entities. On October 31, 2017, the Company closed on its acquisition of Senior Whole Health. As of January 1, 2018, the Company completed the rollout in the remaining regions in the Commonwealth Coordinated Care Plus Program in Virginia.\n“I am pleased with the execution and progress against our strategic initiatives during 2017. We have made major strides against our stated growth objectives and have repositioned ourselves for long-term sustained growth with our two platforms – healthcare and pharmacy management,” said Barry M. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of Magellan Health. “As we move forward in 2018, we will continue to be the nation’s leader in addressing complex, high-cost special populations through the development of innovative products that demonstrate improved outcomes and reduce costs while empowering members within our communities to live healthy, vibrant lives.”\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $5.8 billion, which represents an increase of 20.7 percent over the same period in 2016. This increase was mainly driven by net business growth and acquisition revenue.\nSegment Profit\nSegment profit was $310.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $301.8 million in the prior year.\nHealthcare segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $202.7 million, which represents an increase of 3.7 percent over 2016 excluding the impact of the Health Insurer Fee moratorium. This increase was driven by net growth, acquisitions and improved results for Magellan Complete Care of Florida, partially offset by start-up costs for Magellan Complete Care of Virginia and isolated costs pressure in two of our Commercial accounts in early 2017. Pharmacy segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $139.9 million, which was an increase of 14.0 percent from the 2016. The increase was primarily due to net growth within our PBM business and the full year inclusion of results from the Veridicus acquisition. Corporate costs, inclusive of eliminations but excluding stock compensation expense, were $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, versus $33.9 million for the prior year. This decrease was mainly due to the lower discretionary benefits in 2017.\nCash Flow & Balance Sheet\nCash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $162.3 million, as compared to cash flow from operations of $66.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The prior year was impacted by the initial build-up of Medicare Part D receivables.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s unrestricted cash and investments totaled $261.2 million versus $293.9 million at December 31, 2016. Approximately $143.9 million of the unrestricted cash and investments at December 31, 2017, related to excess capital and undistributed earnings held at regulated entities.\nRestricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2017, increased to $465.4 million versus $315.9 million at December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Senior Whole Health.\nOutlook\nThe Company revised its 2018 full year guidance, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThe Company now estimates net income to be in the range of $125 million to $149 million with adjusted net income in the range of $163 million to $183 million. The full year 2018 segment profit guidance is expected to be in the range of $390 million to $410 million. The Company is maintaining its revenue range at $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion.\nThe Company now expects fully diluted EPS to be between $4.88 and $5.82 and fully diluted adjusted EPS to be between $6.37 and $7.15, based on average fully diluted shares of 25.6 million. This updated fully diluted share count reflects share repurchases and option exercises through February 23 rd , but excludes any potential future activity.\n“We are updating our 2018 guidance due to the lower corporate tax rate, the corresponding impact on the Health Insurer Fee revenue, and additional investments within our businesses,” said Jonathan N. Rubin, chief financial officer of Magellan Health. “We are also updating guidance to reflect the final amortization of the Senior Whole Health intangible assets as well as our final analysis of the impact of the new revenue recognition rules under ASU 606 going into effect in 2018.”\n2018 Guidance Current Prior Low\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nNet revenue $ 7,500.0 $ 7,800.0 $ 7,500.0 $ 7,800.0 Income before income taxes $ 186.0 $ 224.0 $ 215.0 $ 255.0 Net income $ 125.0 $ 149.0 $ 114.0 $ 138.0 Segment Profit [1] $ 390.0 $ 410.0 $ 414.0 $ 436.0 Adjusted net income [1] $ 163.0 $ 183.0 $ 143.0 $ 163.0 Per share results: Earnings per share [2] $ 4.88 $ 5.82 $ 4.52 $ 5.48 Adjusted earnings per share [1][2] $ 6.37 $ 7.15 $ 5.68 $ 6.47 [1] Refer to the Basis of Presentation for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. [2] 2018 EPS and Adjusted EPS guidance includes share repurchases and option exercises through the close of business February 23, 2018, but excludes the impact of any potential future activity.

Following is a description of these important non-GAAP measures.\nSegment profit is equal to net revenues less the sum of cost of care, cost of goods sold, direct service costs and other operating expenses, and includes income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, but excludes segment profit or loss from non-controlling interests held by other parties, stock compensation expense, special charges or benefits, as well as changes in the fair value of contingent consideration recorded in relation to acquisitions.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share reflect certain adjustments made for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2013 to exclude non-cash stock compensation expense resulting from restricted stock purchases by sellers, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, amortization of identified acquisition intangibles, as well as impairment of identified acquisition intangibles.\nIncluded in the tables issued with this press release are the reconciliations from GAAP measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.\nAbout Magellan Health\nMagellan Health, Inc. is a leader in managing the fastest growing, most complex areas of health, including special populations, complete pharmacy benefits and other specialty areas of healthcare.
