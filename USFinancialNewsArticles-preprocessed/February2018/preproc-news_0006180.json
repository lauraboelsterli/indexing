    "text": "TORONTO, Great Lakes Graphite Inc. (“ GLK ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX-V:GLK) (OTCQB:GLKIF) (FWB:8GL) is pleased to announce that Todd Jorn has been appointed to the position of Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately.\nGreat Lakes Graphite CEO Paul Gorman said, “Todd Jorn has worked with the Company in an informal advisory capacity over the past several months. In that time, Todd has made key contributions and demonstrated a serious level of commitment. Todd brings with him a well-established network that provided us with Brett Clark, the most recent addition to our Board of Directors.”\nTodd Jorn added, “Great Lakes Graphite has a unique and exciting opportunity in battery materials given the strong demand outlook for electric vehicles and stationary storage for the foreseeable future. I am excited about joining the Great Lakes team and believe that my financial background is directly relevant to the Company’s current needs and that having a New York City presence will provide improved visibility and access to key constituencies for both business development and investment related activities. In addition to assisting with day to day operations of the Company, I have responsibility for managing specific strategic partner relationships which were initiated through my efforts and network contacts. We will be providing details on those partnerships through news releases planned for distribution over the coming weeks.”\nMr. Jorn has spent approximately 35 years in the investment banking industry holding a variety of senior producing and management positions. Most recently, Mr. Jorn was a Managing Director at The Seaport Group, a New York based broker dealer and investment bank. Mr. Jorn ran the firms' insurance markets business from May 2010 until January 2013. Mr. Jorn also served on the firm's Management Committee and organized the company's initial effort to establish a fixed asset finance and trading business, focused on shipping and commodities. Prior to joining Seaport, Mr. Jorn, along with John Thomas, was a founding partner of Pfife Hudson Group (2005-2009); a Managing Director of The Provident Group (2003-2005); the founding partner of PFI Capital (2002-2003); and from 1984-2002, a Managing Director of Fixed Income and a member of the Fixed Income Operating Committee at Lehman Brothers where he held senior positions in Sales, Sales Management, Trading and Research.
