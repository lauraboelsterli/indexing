    "text": "PITTSBURGH, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Global safety equipment manufacturer MSA Safety Incorporated (NYSE: MSA) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nQuarterly Highlights\nReported revenue was $346 million, increasing 17 percent from a year ago on a reported basis and 14 percent on a constant currency basis.\nQuarterly GAAP loss from continuing operations was $33 million or $0.87 per basic share, compared to earnings of $25 million or $0.67 per basic share in the same period a year ago. The decline in GAAP earnings is attributable to a $93 million non-cash pre-tax charge related primarily to increasing the cumulative trauma product liability reserve for estimated unasserted, or incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\"), claims, net of expected insurance collections, and a $20 million income tax charge associated with U.S. Tax Reform.\nAdjusted earnings increased 69 percent to $51 million or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $30 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the same period a year ago, on strong revenue growth throughout MSA's core product portfolio, the company's 2017 acquisition of firefighter protective clothing manufacturer Globe Manufacturing, and a streamlined cost structure.\nAnnual Highlights\nReported revenue was $1.197 billion, increasing 4 percent from a year ago on a reported basis and 3 percent on a constant currency basis.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses declined $8 million on a reported basis and $16 million on an organic constant currency basis, exceeding the company's full year cost savings target of $10 million.\nGAAP earnings from continuing operations were $26 million, or $0.68 per basic share, compared to $93 million, or $2.47 per basic share, in the same period a year ago. The decline in GAAP earnings is attributable to a $126 million pre-tax charge associated with increasing the company's cumulative trauma product liability reserve for asserted claims in the second quarter and IBNR claims in the fourth quarter, net of expected insurance collections, and a $20 million income tax charge associated with U.S. Tax Reform.\nAdjusted earnings increased 34 percent to $141 million, or $3.65 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $105 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. The acquisition of Globe, a streamlined cost structure, and a lower effective tax rate were the key drivers of earnings growth in 2017.\nCash flow from operating activities was $230 million compared to $135 million in the same period a year ago, reflecting higher collections of insurance receivables partially offset by higher levels of working capital to support elevated demand across the company's core product portfolio. In 2017, the company invested $216 million in the acquisition of Globe and returned $70 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of common stock.\nCumulative Trauma Product Liability Charge\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company in consultation with an outside valuation consultant and outside legal counsel, performed a review for IBNR cumulative trauma product liability claims. Based on that review process, it was determined that a reasonable estimate for the liability of its IBNR claims was $111 million through the year 2060. The reserve is not discounted to present value.\nThe company's fourth quarter GAAP results include a $93 million non-cash pre-tax charge, or $63 million after tax ($1.65 per diluted share), which primarily reflects the increase to the cumulative trauma product liability reserve for IBNR claims, net of expected insurance collections.\nThe ability to make a reasonable estimate of the potential liability for IBNR cumulative trauma product liability claims reflects stabilization of a number of factors which are important to the estimation process. This stabilization has enabled greater predictability of potential cumulative trauma product liability related to IBNR claims.\nThe company's cumulative trauma product liability reserve balance was $181 million at the end of the quarter, which includes reserves for both asserted and IBNR claims. The company has insurance and notes receivable totaling $212 million.\nComments from Management\n\"Our fourth quarter results reflect improving macro conditions across many of our key end markets and geographies, as well as returns on investments made in strategic acquisitions and cost reduction programs,\" said William M. Lambert, MSA Chairman and CEO. \"Our quarterly revenue reflected record performance for MSA and increased 14 percent in constant currency from a year ago, or 6 percent excluding Globe. Additionally, our streamlined cost structure provided support to leverage our revenue growth into a 69 percent increase in adjusted earnings.\"\nMr. Lambert noted that the company finished the year with a backlog pipeline that is trending approximately 10 percent higher than the end of the third quarter on strong demand for industrial products and self-contained breathing apparatus for the fire service market. \"Typically, we see a seasonal decline in backlog during the fourth quarter. The solid quarterly revenue growth coupled with an elevated level of backlog at year end highlights the positive momentum we see occurring in many of our end markets,\" Mr. Lambert commented.\nRegarding the increase to the company's product liability reserve, Mr. Lambert noted the reserve relates to products sold many years ago that are no longer part of the MSA portfolio. \"For more than a decade, we have funded product liability settlements from operating cash flow,\" Mr. Lambert explained. \"Through the ongoing successful resolution of insurance litigation, we continue to make good progress collecting insurance proceeds and establishing cash flow streams for the future, which I expect will allow us to fund these liabilities without a material impact on our capital allocation priorities.\"\n\"As we look ahead to 2018, we are highly focused on generating revenue growth and investing in the programs, people and technology that will help us reach our growth and profitability targets. With an expected tailwind from U.S. tax reform, combined with healthy conditions in our end markets and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to create value for our stakeholders in 2018 and beyond,\" he concluded.\nMSA Safety Incorporated\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months

January 1, 2016. The Americas segment is comprised of our operations in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. The International segment is comprised of our operations in all other parts of the world including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, China, South East Asia and Australia. Certain global expenses are allocated to each segment in a manner consistent with where the benefits from the expenses are derived.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are the measures used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. As such, management believes that adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are useful metrics for investors. Adjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income excluding restructuring, currency exchange gains (losses) and other operating expense. Adjusted operating margin is defined as adjusted operating income (loss) divided by segment sales to external customers. Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and therefore do not purport to be alternatives to operating income or operating margin as a measure of operating performance. The Company's definition of adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to consider operating income determined on a GAAP basis in addition to these non-GAAP measures.\nMSA Safety Incorporated\nReconciliation of As Reported Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nConstant currency revenue growth (Unaudited)\nOrganic constant currency revenue growth (Unaudited)\nConsolidated\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nBreathing\nApparatus\nFirefighter\nHelmets\nand\nProtective\nApparel (b)\nIndustrial\nHead\nProtection\nPortable\nGas\nDetection\nFixed Gas\nand Flame\nDetection\nFall\nProtection\nCore\nSales\nNon-\nCore\nSales\nNet Sales\nGAAP reported sales change\n9\n%\n236\n%\n9\n%\n14\n%\n11\n%\n8\n%\n22\n%\n(10)\n%\n17\n%\nPlus: Currency translation effects\n(2)\n%\n(7)\n%\n(2)\n%\n(2)\n%\n(5)\n%\n(4)\n%\n(3)\n%\n(3)\n%\n(3)\n%\nConstant currency sales change\n7\n%\n229\n%\n7\n%\n12\n%\n6\n%\n4\n%\n19\n%\n(13)\n%\n14\n%\nLess: Acquisitions\n—\n%\n207\n%\n—\n%\n—\n%\n(4)\n%\n—\n%\n10\n%\n—\n%\n8\n%\nOrganic constant currency change\n7\n%\n22\n%\n7\n%\n12\n%\n10\n%\n4\n%\n9\n%\n(13)\n%\n6\n%\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nBreathing\nApparatus\nFirefighter\nHelmets\nand\nProtective\nApparel (b)\nIndustrial\nHead\nProtection\nPortable\nGas\nDetection\nFixed Gas\nand Flame\nDetection\nFall\nProtection\nCore\nSales\nNon-\nCore\nSales\nNet Sales\nGAAP reported sales change\n(4)\n%\n97\n%\n13\n%\n4\n%\n4\n%\n2\n%\n8\n%\n(12)\n%\n4\n%\nPlus: Currency translation effects\n—\n%\n(1)\n%\n(2)\n%\n—\n%\n(2)\n%\n2\n%\n(1)\n%\n(2)\n%\n(1)\n%\nConstant currency sales change\n(4)\n%\n96\n%\n11\n%\n4\n%\n2\n%\n4\n%\n7\n%\n(14)\n%\n3\n%\nLess: Acquisitions\n—\n%\n89\n%\n—\n%\n—\n%\n—\n%\n—\n%\n5\n%\n—\n%\n4\n%\nOrganic constant currency change\n(4)\n%\n7\n%\n11\n%\n4\n%\n2\n%\n4\n%\n2\n%\n(14)\n%\n(1)\n%\n(b) Firefighter helmets and protective apparel includes the impact of the Globe acquisition, completed on July 31, 2017.\nManagement believes that constant currency revenue growth is a useful metric for investors, as foreign currency translation can have a material impact on revenue growth trends.

Management believes that organic constant currency revenue growth is a useful measure for investors to provide an understanding of MSA's standalone results. There can be no assurances that MSA's definition of constant currency revenue growth or organic constant currency revenue growth is consistent with that of other companies. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to consider revenue growth determined on a GAAP basis in addition to these non-GAAP financial measures.\nMSA Safety Incorporated\nSupplemental Segment Information (Unaudited)\nSummary of constant currency revenue growth by segment and product group\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated\nAmericas\nInternational\nFirefighter Helmets and Protective Apparel (b)\n229\n%\n583\n%\n20\n%\nPortable Gas Detection\n12\n%\n11\n%\n13\n%\nIndustrial Head Protection\n7\n%\n9\n%\n2\n%\nBreathing Apparatus\n7\n%\n10\n%\n2\n%\nFixed Gas and Flame Detection\n6\n%\n4\n%\n9\n%\nFall Protection\n4\n%\n18\n%\n(10)\n%\nCore Sales\n19\n%\n28\n%\n6\n%\nCore excluding Acquisitions\n9\n%\n10\n%\n8\n%\nNon-Core Sales\n(13)\n%\n(6)\n%\n(20)\n%\nNet Sales\n14\n%\n24\n%\n1\n%\nNet Sales excluding Acquisitions\n6\n%\n8\n%\n3\n%\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nConsolidated\nAmericas\nInternational\nFirefighter Helmets and Protective Apparel (b)\n96\n%\n219\n%\n8\n%\nPortable Gas Detection\n4\n%\n8\n%\n(4)\n%\nIndustrial Head Protection\n11\n%\n10\n%\n17\n%\nBreathing Apparatus\n(4)\n%\n(4)\n%\n(5)\n%\nFixed Gas and Flame Detection\n2\n%\n(2)\n%\n7\n%\nFall Protection\n4\n%\n22\n%\n(12)\n%\nCore Sales\n7\n%\n11\n%\n—\n%\nCore excluding Acquisitions\n2\n%\n3\n%\n—\n%\nNon-Core Sales\n(14)\n%\n(8)\n%\n(20)\n%\nNet Sales\n3\n%\n8\n%\n(4)\n%\nNet Sales excluding Acquisitions\n(1)\n%\n1\n%\n(4)\n%\n(b) Firefighter helmets and protective apparel includes the impact of the Globe acquisition,\ncompleted on July 31, 2017.\nMSA Safety Incorporated\nReconciliation of As Reported Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOrganic constant currency SG&A expense (Unaudited)\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\nGAAP reported SG&A expense\n$\n75,467\n$\n78,288\n(4)%\n$\n297,801\n$\n306,144\n(3)%\nPlus: currency translation effects\n—\n2,334\n—\n2,279\nConstant currency SG&A expense\n75,467\n80,622\n(6)%\n297,801\n308,423\n(3)%\nLess: Acquisitions and strategic transaction costs\n2,957\n3,173\n9,783\n3,994\nOrganic constant currency SG&A expense\n72,510\n77,449\n(6)%\n288,018\n304,429\n(5)%\nManagement believes that organic constant currency SG&A expense is a useful metric for investors to measure the effectiveness of the company's cost reduction programs. Constant currency SG&A expense highlights spending patterns excluding fluctuating foreign currencies. Organic constant currency SG&A expense highlights the impact of acquisitions and strategic transaction costs. These metrics provide investors with a greater level of clarity into spending levels on a year-over-year basis. There can be no assurances that MSA's definition of organic constant currency SG&A expense is consistent with that of other companies. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to consider SG&A expense determined on a GAAP basis in addition to this non-GAAP financial measure.\nMSA Safety Incorporated\nReconciliation of As Reported Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted earnings (Unaudited)\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n2017\n2016\n%\nChange\n(Loss) income from continuing operations attributable to MSA Safety Inc.\n$\n(32,984)\n$\n25,216\n(231)%\n$\n26,027\n$\n92,691\n(72)%\nTax charges associated with U.S. Tax Reform\n19,817\n—\n19,817\nTax (benefit) associated with ASU 2016-09: Improvements to employee\nshare-based payment accounting\n(1,413)\n—\n(8,323)\n—\nTax (benefits) charges associated with European reorganization\n(30)\n2,873\n(2,504)\n6,473\nSubtotal\n(14,610)\n28,089\n(152)%\n35,017\n99,164\n(65)%\nSelf-insured legal settlements and defense costs (a)\n93,476\n26\n126,432\n341\nCurrency exchange losses (gains), net\n1,133\n(1,732)\n5,127\n766\nStrategic transaction costs\n860\n1,710\n4,225\n2,531\nRestructuring charges\n712\n1,997\n17,632\n5,694\nAsset related losses and other, net\n492\n847\n678\n32\nIncome tax expense on adjustments\n(31,443)\n(1,038)\n(47,810)\n(3,161)\nAdjusted earnings\n50,620\n29,899\n69%\n141,301\n105,367\n34%\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share\n$\n1.31\n$\n0.78\n68%\n$\n3.65\n$\n2.77\n32%\n(a) Year to date amount is primarily associated with increasing the company's cumulative trauma product liability reserve for asserted and IBNR claims.\nManagement believes that adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share are useful measures for investors, as management uses these measures to internally assess the company's performance and ongoing operating trends. There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods, nor that MSA's definition of adjusted earnings is consistent with that of other companies. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both net income determined on a GAAP basis as well as adjusted earnings.\nAbout MSA:\nEstablished in 1914, MSA Safety Incorporated is the global leader in the development, manufacture and supply of safety products that protect people and facility infrastructures.
