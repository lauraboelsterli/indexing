    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) today announced results of operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which included net income attributable to the Company of $32.8 million or $.23 per share-diluted for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income attributable to the Company for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $37.1 million or $.26 per share-diluted.

Net income and FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 included a $14.5 million re-valuation reduction of a deferred tax asset as a result of the lower federal corporate income tax rates adopted by Congress in December, 2017. A description and reconciliation of EPS per share-diluted to FFO per share-diluted is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nResults and Capital Highlights\nMall tenant annual sales per square foot for the portfolio increased by 4.8% to $660 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $630 for the year ended December 31, 2016.

(the \"Operating Partnership\" or the \"OP\") has operating partnership units (\"OP units\"). OP units can be converted into shares of Company common stock. Conversion of the OP units not owned by the Company has been assumed for purposes of calculating FFO per share and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The computation of average shares for FFO - diluted includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans, stock warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes conversion ofMACWH, LP preferred and common units to the extent they are dilutive to the calculation.\n(c)\nThe Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.\nFFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods.This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other real estate investment trusts (\"REITs\"). The Company believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. The Company further believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.\nTHE MACERICH COMPANY\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nReconciliation of net income attributable to the Company to FFO attributable to common\nstockholders and unit holders -

Management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps investors understand the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. The Company also cautions that Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurementsreported by other companies.\n(e)\nThe Company presents Same Center NOI because the Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate the operating performance of comparable centers. Same Center NOI is calculated using total Adjusted EBITDA and eliminating the impact of the management companies' revenues and operating expenses, the Company's general and administrative expenses and the straight-line and above/below market adjustments to minimum rents and subtracting out NOI from non-Same Centers.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/macerich-announces-quarterly-results-300593691.html\nSOURCE Macerich Company",
