Matthieu Reeb, Secretary General of the Court of Arbitration for Sport arrives for a news conference in Pyeongchang, South Korea, February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski \nEleven other athletes were confirmed by CAS to have committed doping violations. However, the CAS reduced their lifetime Olympic bans to a ban from this month’s Winter Games in Pyeongchang. \nThe IOC has banned Russia from the Pyeongchang Winter Games next month as a result of its “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system. \nHowever, individual Russian athletes will be able to compete as neutrals if they can prove their anti-doping credentials. Related Coverage Russia to continue legal measures to fight Olympic bans: Kremlin \nRussia has repeatedly denied any state involvement in the doping which was exposed by an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). \nCAS said its mandate was “not to determine generally whether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples....but was strictly limited to dealing with 39 individual cases and to assess the evidence applicable to each athlete on an individual basis.” Reporting by Brian Homewood; Editing by Toby Chopra",
