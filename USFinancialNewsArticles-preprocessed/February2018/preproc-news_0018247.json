    "text": "WALL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, New Jersey Resources (NYSE: NJR) reported results for the first-quarter of fiscal 2018. Highlights include:\nConsolidated net income was $123.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $34.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2017. This includes an estimated benefit from tax reform of $57.6 million due to revaluation of deferred taxes recognized during this quarter. Consolidated net financial earnings (NFE), a non-GAAP financial measure, were $135.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $40.4 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. NJR raised its fiscal 2018 NFE guidance to $2.55 to $2.65 from $1.75 to $1.85 per share. Long-term annual NFE per share growth rate range adjusted to 6 to 8 percent. Energy Services reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 NFE of $20.3 million, compared with $3.5 million during the same period in fiscal 2017, driven by strong market demand due to colder weather in December 2017.\n“Our strong performance this quarter was led by Energy Services, benefits from tax reform and solid contributions from our regulated businesses,\" Laurence M. Downes, chairman and CEO of New Jersey Resources, said. \"We remain focused on executing our natural gas, clean energy and energy efficiency strategy to best serve our customers, and generate returns for our shareowners.\"\nFirst-quarter fiscal 2018 net income totaled $123.7 million, or $1.42 per share, compared with $34.9 million, or $.41 per share, during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, NFE totaled $135.3 million, or $1.56 per share, compared with NFE of $40.4 million, or $.47 per share, during the same period last year.\nA reconciliation of net income to NFE for the three months ended December 31 of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2017 2016 Net income* $ 123,699 $ 34,929 Add: Unrealized loss on derivative instruments and related transactions 34,855 28,302 Tax effect (8,059 ) (9,757 ) Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory (25,387 ) (17,939 ) Tax effect 8,244 6,204 Net income to NFE tax adjustment 1,981 (1,356 ) Net financial earnings $ 135,333 $ 40,383 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding Basic 86,996 86,084 Diluted 87,347 86,855 Basic earnings per share $ 1.42 $ 0.41 Add: Unrealized loss on derivative instruments and related transactions 0.40 0.33 Tax effect (0.09 ) (0.11 ) Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory (0.29 ) (0.21 ) Tax effect 0.10 0.07 Net income to NFE tax adjustment 0.02 (0.02 ) Basic net financial earnings per share $ 1.56 $ 0.47 * Includes an estimated income tax benefit of $57.6 million due to tax reform.\nNFE is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the United States. It is a measure of earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, net of applicable tax adjustments, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas, Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and foreign currency contracts. NFE eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments in the current period. For further discussion of this financial measure, please see the explanation below under “Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nA table summarizing our key performance metrics for the three months ended December 31 of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nThree Months Ended December 31, ($ in Thousands) 2017 2016 Net income $ 123,699 $ 34,929 EPS $ 1.42 $ 0.41 NFE $ 135,333 $ 40,383 Basic net financial earnings per share $ 1.56 $ 0.47 A table detailing NFE for the three months ended December 31 of fiscal years 2018 and 2017 is provided below.\nThree Months Ended December 31, (Thousands) 2017 2016 Net financial earnings (loss) New Jersey Natural Gas $ 34,109 $ 30,348 Midstream 17,511 2,387 Subtotal Regulated 51,620 32,735 Clean Energy Ventures 71,250 2,842 Energy Services 20,274 3,487 Home Services and Other (7,716 ) 1,542 Subtotal Non-Regulated 83,808 7,871 Subtotal 135,428 40,606 Eliminations (95 ) (223 ) Total $ 135,333 $ 40,383 NJR Increases Fiscal 2018 NFE Guidance:\nNJR increased fiscal 2018 NFE guidance to $2.55 to $2.65 from a previously announced range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share, subject to the risks and uncertainties identified below under “Forward-Looking Statements.” NJR expects its regulated businesses to generate between 40 to 55 percent of total NFE, with New Jersey Natural Gas (NJNG) continuing to be the largest contributor, excluding the impacts of tax reform. The following chart represents NJR’s current expected contributions from its subsidiaries, and the estimated benefits as a result of the revaluation of deferred taxes due to tax reform for fiscal 2018:\nCompany Expected Fiscal 2018\nNet Financial Earnings Contribution New Jersey Natural Gas 35 to 45 percent Midstream 5 to 10 percent Total Regulated 40 to 55 percent Clean Energy Ventures 5 to 10 percent Energy Services 20 to 30 percent Home Services 1 to 3 percent Total Non-regulated 26 to 43 percent NFE contribution from the revaluation of deferred taxes due to tax reform 20 to 25 percent In providing fiscal 2018 NFE guidance, management is aware there could be differences between reported GAAP earnings and NFE due to matters such as, but not limited to, the positions of our energy-related derivatives. Management is not able to reasonably estimate the aggregate impact or significance of these items on reported earnings and, therefore, is not able to provide a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance without unreasonable efforts.\nTax Reform Update:\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the \"Tax Act,\" formerly known as \"The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\" The law includes several changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent that became effective January 1, 2018 being the most impactful to NJR.\nAs a result of the changes associated with the Tax Act, NJR revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of the enactment. The primary impact to deferred tax attributes was associated with depreciation timing differences for its utility plant and equipment, as well as property-related items in its non-regulated entities.\nNJNG recorded a regulatory liability of $228 million, which includes $164.3 million for the revaluation of its deferred income taxes and $63.7 million for the accounting of the income tax effects on the revaluation. Due to IRS normalization rules, the excess deferred tax attributes for property-related items are amortized over the remaining life of the utility plant. The net decrease of the deferred tax liability for the remaining entities resulted in an income tax benefit, estimated to be $57.6 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nA table summarizing the decrease of our net deferred tax liability recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2017 is provided below:\nThree Months Ended\n(Thousands) December 31, 2017\nIncome tax (benefit) provision Clean Energy Ventures $ (62,657 ) Energy Services 9,107 Midstream (13,989 ) Home Services and Other 9,974 Total $ (57,565 ) Effective Tax Rate:\nDue to recently enacted tax reform legislation, NJR’s estimated annual effective tax rate increased from 8.7 percent in fiscal 2017 to 13.9 percent in fiscal 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $11.6 million related to tax credits, net of deferred taxes, were recognized, compared with $7.5 million during the same period last year.\nFor NFE purposes, the effective tax rate also increased from 14.7 percent to 16.3 percent, and NJR recognized $11.6 million in tax credits, net of deferred taxes. Further detail can be found in Note 11 “Income Taxes” within our 10-Q filing.\nRegulated Business Update:\nNew Jersey Natural Gas\nReported first-quarter fiscal 2018 NFE of $34.1 million, compared with $30.3 million, during the same period in fiscal 2017. Results for the quarter were driven by increased utility gross margin from new customer additions, primarily in the new residential construction market, and a higher basic gas supply service (BGSS) incentive margin.\nOn January 31, 2018, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) issued an Order directing NJNG to submit a filing by March 2, 2018, proposing the prospective change in rates as a result of the Tax Act. Included in the filing will be the amount, as well as the method, by which the rate difference collected from January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2018 will be returned to customers. Also, the filing will address how excess deferred taxes collected will be returned to customers.\nCustomer Growth:\nAdded 2,637 new customers during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 1,866 last year. These new customer additions, and those customers who added additional natural gas services to their premises, are expected to contribute $1.5 million annually to utility gross margin. NJNG expects to invest approximately $40 million annually in capital expenditures to support new customer growth through fiscal 2020. NJNG expects to add between 26,000 to 28,000 new customers through fiscal 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 1.7 percent and a cumulative increase in utility gross margin of approximately $16 million. For more information on utility gross margin, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below.\nInfrastructure Update:\nThe Southern Reliability Link (SRL) will provide a secondary interstate feed into the southern end of NJNG’s delivery system. Once the remaining easement and road-opening permits are obtained, construction will begin. NJNG expects the SRL to be in service in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nNew Jersey Reinvestment in System Enhancement (NJ RISE) program is a five-year, $102.5 million investment that began in 2014. Work to install a secondary natural gas distribution main in the northern section of the Seaside barrier island in Ocean County, New Jersey has begun, along with improving associated regulator stations.\nSafety Acceleration and Facilities Enhancement (SAFE) II is a five-year program designed to replace the remaining 276 miles of unprotected steel main and associated services in NJNG’s distribution system. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, $8.9 million was invested to replace 10 miles of unprotected steel main and services.\nBasic Gas Supply Service Incentive Programs:\nContributed $4.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 to utility gross margin, compared with $3.8 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. The higher results were attributed to improved margins in off-system sales and storage incentive programs.\nEnergy Efficiency:\nThe SAVEGREEN Project ® , NJNG’s energy efficiency program, invested $3.4 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in grants and financing options designed to help customers with energy efficiency upgrades for their homes and businesses.\nMidstream\nReported first-quarter 2018 NFE of $17.5 million, compared with $2.4 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. Improved performance was primarily due to an estimated benefit of $14 million based on the revaluation of deferred income taxes recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to tax reform. Other factors included an increase in Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) from the PennEast project, an increase in the equity in earnings of affiliates, and a lower tax rate in fiscal 2018.\nInfrastructure projects continue to move forward to benefit our customers and shareowners. Highlights include:\nOn January 19, 2018, PennEast received final approval of its Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PennEast expects the project to be in service in 2019. On October 27, 2017, Adelphia Gateway, LLC, a subsidiary of NJR, entered into an agreement to acquire an existing 84-mile pipeline in southeastern Pennsylvania, pending receipt of all of the necessary permits and regulatory actions. Recent milestones include the successful conclusion of its binding open season in December, and the January filing of an application with FERC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Adelphia Gateway expects the project to be in service in 2019.\nNon-Regulated Business Update:\nEnergy Services\nReported first-quarter 2018 NFE of $20.3 million, compared with $3.5 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. The increase in NFE was due primarily to colder weather in December 2017, resulting in increased storage withdrawals due to higher demand coupled with higher volatility allowing Energy Services to capture additional margin from natural gas price spreads. Results include an estimated charge of $9.1 million based on the revaluation of deferred income taxes recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to tax reform.\nClean Energy Ventures\nReported NFE of $71.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $2.8 million in the same period in fiscal 2017. The improved results were due primarily to an estimated benefit of $62.7 million based on the revaluation of deferred income taxes recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to tax reform. Highlights include:\nTwo commercial solar projects are currently under construction and expected to be placed into service during fiscal 2018. The projects, Old Bridge Solar and Raritan Solar, represent 20.7 megawatts (MWs) of capacity and an approximate investment of $43.9 million. Solar-related capital expenditures for projects eligible for Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $5.9 million, compared with $8.9 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. The decrease was due primarily to the timing of commercial projects placed into service.\nHome Services and Other Operations\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Home Services, the company’s non-regulated retail and appliance service subsidiary, and other operations reported a net financial loss of $7.7 million, compared with NFE of $1.5 million during the same period last year. The decrease was due to an estimated $10 million charge primarily attributed to other operations based on the revaluation of deferred income taxes recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to tax reform.\nHome Services reported a net financial loss of $3.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with a net financial loss of $848,000 during the same period last year. Decreased results were due primarily to an estimated $2.8 million charge based on the revaluation of deferred taxes recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to tax reform.\nCommercial Realty and Resources (CR&R), the commercial real estate subsidiary of NJR, includes undeveloped land, as well as investments in other energy-related ventures that were fully divested during the first quarter. In the first three months of fiscal 2018, CR&R recorded a pretax gain of $5.3 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities, compared with $2.6 million during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nCapital Expenditures and Cash Flows:\nNJR is committed to maintaining a strong financial profile while continuing to invest capital in regulated and non-regulated projects.\nNJR used operating cash flows of $23.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $46.1 million during the same period in fiscal 2017. First-quarter fiscal 2018 capital expenditures were $73 million, of which $47.1 million were related to regulated assets, compared with $126.2 million, of which $42 million were related to regulated assets during the same period in fiscal 2017. NJR reported aggregate capital expenditures of $84.3 million and dividend payments of $23.6 million, and used $32 million in operating and other activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, of which $113.3 million was funded from other proceeds from debt and $26.5 million from equity issuances.\nWebcast Information:\nNJR will host a live webcast to discuss its financial results today at 10 a.m. EST.

The aforementioned factors are detailed in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Form 10-K that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 21, 2017, which is available on the SEC’s Web site at sec.gov . Information included in this release is representative as of today only, and while NJR periodically reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting NJR’s results of operations and financial condition in connection with its preparation of management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contained in its Quarterly and Annual Reports filed with the SEC, NJR does not, by including this statement, assume any obligation to review or revise any particular forward-looking statement referenced herein in light of future events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information:\nThis release includes the non-GAAP financial measures NFE (losses) and utility gross margin. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP can be found below. As an indicator of NJR’s operating performance, these measures should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or operating revenues as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information has been provided pursuant to the requirements of SEC Regulation G.\nNFE (losses) excludes unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments related to the company’s unregulated subsidiaries and certain realized gains and losses on derivative instruments related to natural gas that has been placed into storage at Energy Services, net of applicable tax adjustments as described below. Volatility associated with the change in value of these financial instruments and physical commodity contracts is reported on the income statement in the current period. In order to manage its business, NJR views its results without the impacts of the unrealized gains and losses, and certain realized gains and losses, caused by changes in value of these financial instruments and physical commodity contracts prior to the completion of the planned transaction because it shows changes in value currently instead of when the planned transaction ultimately is settled. An annual estimated effective tax rate is calculated for NFE purposes and any necessary quarterly tax adjustment is applied to Clean Energy Ventures, as such adjustment is related to tax credits generated by Clean Energy Ventures.\nNJNG’s utility gross margin represents the results of revenues less natural gas costs, sales, expenses and other taxes and regulatory rider expenses, which are key components of NJR’s operations that move in relation to each other. Natural gas costs, sales, expenses and other taxes and regulatory rider expenses are passed through to customers and, therefore, have no effect on gross margin. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures to other GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of NJR’s performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are more reflective of NJR’s business model, provide transparency to investors and enable period-to-period comparability of financial performance. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP can be found below. For a full discussion of NJR’s non-GAAP financial measures, please see NJR’s 2017 Form 10-K, Item 7.\nAbout New Jersey Resources\nNew Jersey Resources (NYSE: NJR) is a Fortune 1000 company that, through its subsidiaries, provides safe and reliable natural gas and clean energy services, including transportation, distribution, asset management and home services.
