Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. \nThe Times \nBarclays Plc has offered a concession to angry pension fund members, saying that its core British retail banking operation may be able to continue guaranteeing their retirement promises after all. bit.ly/2EpqSpl \nEmma Walmsley, the head of GlaxoSmithKline Plc, has urged the government to sign a two-year Brexit transition deal within two months to minimise disruption to medicine supplies. bit.ly/2EqQvpT \nThe Guardian \nFormer executives of Carillion Plc have been accused by one of the defunct construction firm's largest customers of giving misleading evidence to a parliamentary inquiry this week. bit.ly/2EulmSF \nGambling companies have defied calls to stamp out sexism at an industry conference, with guests being entertained by pole dancers and a Playboy-themed show, and hostesses claiming to have been harassed and propositioned. bit.ly/2EqPEWd \nThe Telegraph \nGeorge Soros is one of three senior figures linked to the Remain-supporting campaign group Best for Britain who plan to launch a nationwide advertising campaign this month, which they hope will lead to a second referendum to keep Britain in the EU. bit.ly/2Eth260 \nThe government has begun work on new laws to force Channel 4 to relocate outside London, in an attempt to pressure the broadcaster's new chief executive Alex Mahon to agree a voluntary move soon. bit.ly/2EsLInY \nSky News \nToys R Us Inc is seeking offers for its loss-making UK arm before the end of this week as fears grow for the fate of one of the high street's best-known retailers - and the jobs of more than 3,000 workers. bit.ly/2EsOAB4 \nBritain's retail sector could be hit by a 20 percent rise in costs after Brexit -- while car makers could see a 13 percent rise in manufacturing costs outside the EU -- according to the government's own internal estimates, seen by Sky News. bit.ly/2EphD8B \nThe Independent \nBritain-based banks looking to maintain their access to the euro zone after Brexit are running out of time and should not count on a deal about a transition period, European Central Bank board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said on Wednesday. ind.pn/2EsN9mm (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom)",
