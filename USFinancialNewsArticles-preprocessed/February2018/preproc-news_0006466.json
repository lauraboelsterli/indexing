Slideshow (12 Images) \nLille are 17th on 25 points, one point above safety. \nPSG went ahead in the 45th minute when Berchiche netted with a low shot after the Lille defence had failed to clear Edinson Cavaniâ€™s cross. \nNeymar, who was doubtful after taking a knock earlier this week, doubled the tally with a 17-metre free kick into the top corner. \nLo Celso then scored his first Ligue 1 goal with a fine lob over Mike Maignan in the 87th.
