    "text": "PHOENIX, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (Nasdaq:SFM) today reported results for the 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week year ended December 31, 2017. The company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the company to repurchase, on a discretionary basis, up to an additional $350 million of its outstanding common stock through December 2019.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nNet sales of $1.1 billion; a 16% increase from the same period in 2016\nComparable store sales growth of 4.6% and two-year comparable store sales growth of 5.3%\nNet income of $40 million; a 133% increase from the same period in 2016\nDiluted earnings per share of $0.29; a 142% increase from the same period in 2016\nExcluding the non-cash benefit of $18.7 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1) , diluted earnings per share of $0.16; a 33% increase from the same period in 2016\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights:\nNet sales of $4.7 billion; a 15% increase from the same period in 2016\nComparable store sales growth of 2.9% and two-year comparable store sales growth of 5.6%\nNet income of $158 million; a 27% increase from the same period in 2016\nDiluted earnings per share of $1.15; a 39% increase from the same period in 2016\nExcluding the non-cash benefit of $18.7 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1) , diluted earnings per share of $1.01; a 22% increase from the same period in 2016\nRepurchased 9.7 million common shares in fiscal 2017 for a total investment of $203 million\n“Sprouts’ position of strength continues to grow, demonstrated by 4.6% comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 2017 and exceptional EPS growth of 22% for the year,” said Amin Maredia, chief executive officer of Sprouts Farmers Market. “This is an exciting time for Sprouts, as we continue to capitalize on our differentiations of health and value while expanding on our opportunities in product innovation, in-store and digital customer experiences, team member development and technology initiatives to drive operational efficiencies.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.1 billion, a 16% increase compared to the same period in 2016. Net sales growth was driven by a 4.6% increase in comparable store sales and strong performance in new stores opened.\nGross profit for the quarter increased 17% to $324 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 28.4%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the same period in 2016. This improvement was primarily driven by cycling a heightened promotional environment in the fourth quarter of 2016, in addition to leverage from increased comparable store sales.\nDirect store expense (“DSE”) for the quarter increased 17% to $248 million, or 21.6% of sales, compared to 21.4% in the same period in 2016. This deleverage is primarily driven by higher benefit costs and depreciation, partially offset by labor productivity improvement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the quarter increased 8% to $38 million, or 3.3% of sales, compared to 3.6% in the same period in 2016. This primarily reflects cycling the costs in 2016 associated with our former Executive Chairman of the Board’s retirement and higher bonus expense.\nNet income for the quarter was $40 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.29. During the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded $18.7 million of income tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1) . Excluding this benefit, net income was $21 million, a 24% increase compared to net income for the same period in 2016 and diluted earnings per share was $0.16, an increase of $0.04 or 33%, as compared to diluted earnings per share for the same period in 2016. This increase was driven by higher sales and margins, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding due to our repurchase program.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales for the fiscal year 2017 were $4.7 billion, a 15% increase compared to 2016. Net sales growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comparable store sales and strong performance in new stores opened.\nGross profit for the year increased 14% to $1.4 billion, resulting in a gross profit margin of 28.9%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to 2016. This primarily reflects the competitive environment earlier in the year as well as higher occupancy costs, partially offset by leverage from increased comparable store sales.\nDSE for the year increased 16% to $963 million, or 20.6% of sales, compared to 20.5% in 2016. This primarily reflects higher benefit costs and depreciation, partially offset by labor productivity improvement and operating efficiencies.\nSG&A for the year increased 17% to $148 million, or 3.2% of sales, compared to 3.1% in 2016. This primarily reflects higher bonus expense due to improved company performance.\nNet income for the year was $158 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.15. During the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded $18.7 million of income tax benefit related to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1) . Excluding this benefit, net income was $140 million, a 12% increase compared to net income for 2016 and diluted earnings per share was $1.01, an increase of $0.18 or 22%, as compared to diluted earnings per share for 2016. This increase was driven by higher sales and margins, a lower effective tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding due to our repurchase program.\nGrowth and Development\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we opened 3 new stores, all in California. For fiscal 2017, we opened 32 new stores which resulted in a total of 285 stores in 15 states as of December 31, 2017.\nLeverage and Liquidity\nWe generated cash from operations of $310 million in fiscal 2017 and invested $186 million in capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursement, primarily for new stores. In addition, we repurchased 9.7 million shares of common stock for a total investment of $203 million in fiscal 2017. We ended the year with a $348 million balance on our revolving credit facility, $28 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility, $19 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $127 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. Subsequent to the end of the year and through February 20, 2018, we have repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for a total investment of $30 million. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase, on a discretionary basis, up to an additional $350 million of our outstanding common stock through December, 2019 for an aggregate authorization of $447 million.\n2018 Outlook\nWith the savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (1) , we will be investing $10 million, or approximately one third of our tax savings in team member wages and benefits. The following provides information on our guidance for 2018:\nFull-Year 2018\nCurrent Guidance Net sales growth 11.5% to 12.5% Unit growth Approximately 30 stores Comparable store sales growth 2.5% to 3.5% Diluted earnings per share $1.22 to $1.28 Effective tax rate 19% to 20% (2) Capital expenditures $165M to $170M (net of landlord reimbursements) Footnotes\n(1) The legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowers U.S. corporate income tax. The estimated fourth quarter 2017 impact of the Tax Act was a benefit to income tax expense of $18.7 million. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made by Sprouts, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and actions that Sprouts may take. For a reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share to net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the one-time benefit of the Tax Act, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table below. (2) The lower effective tax rate is due to the Tax Act and the 2017 change in accounting standards related to the recognition of excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation and the associated effect of actual and estimated option exercises for the year. Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nWe will hold a conference call at 8 a.m. Mountain Standard Time (10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) on Thursday, February 22, 2018, during which Sprouts executives will further discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results.\nA webcast of the conference call will be available through Sprouts’ investor webpage located at investors.sprouts.com .

This measure is not in accordance with, and is not intended as an alternative to, GAAP. The company's management believes that this presentation provides useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses this measure for reviewing the financial results of the company and as a component of incentive compensation. The company defines EBITDA as net income before interest expense, provision for income tax, and depreciation, amortization and accretion.\nIn addition, the Company has presented net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the one-time benefit of the Tax Act.\nNon-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meanings prescribed by GAAP. Use of these terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. Because of their limitations, non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to reinvest in the growth of the company’s business, or as a measure of cash that will be available to meet the company’s obligations. Each non-GAAP measure has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 and a reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share to net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the one-time benefit of the Tax Act for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2017:\nSPROUTS FARMERS MARKET, INC.

The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made by Sprouts, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and actions that Sprouts may take.\nInvestor Contact: Media Contact: Susannah Livingston Donna Egan (602) 682-1584 (602) 682-3152 susannahlivingston@sprouts.com media@sprouts.com\nSource:Sprouts Farmers Market",
