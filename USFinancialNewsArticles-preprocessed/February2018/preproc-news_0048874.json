    "text": "Taxes Insiders: Russia troll farm even zanier than indictment says The U.S. indictment centered on a Russian troll farm only scratches the surface of the agency that allegedly produced content to sway the presidential election — and glosses over how unconvincing some of its stunts could be. Many of the more eye-popping accounts of the Internet Research Agency's activities have come from former employees. Published Updated Moments Ago The Associated Press Robyn Beck | AFP | Getty Images Barack Obama hugs US Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the third night of the Democratic National Convention at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, July 27, 2016. \nA Clinton-Obama sex tape using body doubles. A Facebook page promoting Texas independence riddled with grammatical mistakes. \nThe U.S. indictment centered on a Russian troll farm only scratches the surface of the agency that allegedly produced content to sway the presidential election — and glosses over how unconvincing some of its stunts could be. \nMany of the more eye-popping accounts of the Internet Research Agency's activities have come from former employees. \nOne, Alan Baskaev, told Russian television channel Rain that the agency made a video that looked like a U.S. soldier shooting a Quran and hired actors in an abortive bid to fake a sex tape of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \nThe AP couldn't confirm Baskaev's sex tape story. A video of a purported soldier firing at a Quran was posted to an American gun forum in 2015. ",
