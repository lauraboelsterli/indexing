(Nasdaq:SNI) today reported operating results for the full year and fourth quarter 2017.\nIn 2017, HGTV was ranked the No. 1 ad-supported cable network for upscale women 25-54 in sales prime for the eleventh consecutive year and was the No. 2 cable network for women 25-54. Food Network finished 2017 as the No. 8 cable network for women 25-54, and Travel Channel delivered a 5% improvement in its adult 25-54 sales prime ratings. TVN, a leading multi-platform media business in Poland, grew its share of audience by 5% for viewers 16-49 in 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, both HGTV and Food Network ranked in the top-10 for advertising supported cable networks for women 25-54 in sales prime, and Travel Channel delivered a 5% improvement in its adult 25-54 sales prime ratings. TVN was the No. 1 media company for the 16-49 demographic for the fourth quarter, growing its audience share by 2%.\nScripps Lifestyle Studios, the digital content division of Scripps Networks Interactive, delivered a record-breaking year, generating more than 19 billion global video views on various digital platforms, nearly three times more than the previous year. Video views benefited in part from the inclusion of millennial-targeted food content brand, Spoon University, the launch of the new food-focused digital brand, Genius Kitchen, and expansion of the Scripps Lifestyle Studios offering to international markets.\nKenneth W. Lowe, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Scripps Networks Interactive finished a pivotal 2017 year with a strong fourth quarter, executing on our strategic objectives and delivering financially with record revenue and growing segment profit. We reached new consumers through the thousands of compelling experiences created by Scripps Lifestyle Studios. We invested in our core business as well as our fast-growing digital offerings, allowing us to capitalize on the popularity of our powerful lifestyle brands across the globe. And, of course, we announced our merger with Discovery Communications, creating an unmatched opportunity to deliver our real-life content to a greater number of audiences.”\nLowe continued, “We have great momentum as we head into 2018. Our incredible teams remain intently focused on doing what we do best: creating great lifestyle content that connects with audiences through ideas, information and inspiration. We are excited about the prospects for the combination with Discovery and are diligently working toward finalizing the transaction to bring these two great companies together.”\nFull Year 2017 Consolidated Results\nConsolidated operating revenues for 2017 were $3.6 billion, an increase of 4.7% compared with the prior year.

The improvement in consolidated income from operations before income taxes reflects an increase in operating revenues, higher foreign currency transaction gains, lower interest expense and a decline in goodwill and other intangible asset write-downs compared with the prior year. These favorable variances were partially offset by increased investments in programming, marketing and data as well as merger related expenses.\nConsolidated net income attributable to Scripps Networks Interactive for 2017 decreased 7.4% to $623.9 million, or $4.76 per diluted share, compared with the prior year, primarily driven by the negative variances mentioned in the prior paragraph as well as a higher effective tax rate driven by the impact of tax law changes enacted in the U.S. and Poland.

Consolidated segment profit (loss) is the aggregate of the segment profit for each of our two reportable segments. Segment profit (loss) is defined as income (loss) from operations before income taxes, excluding depreciation, amortization, goodwill write-down, interest expense, net, equity in earnings of affiliates, gain (loss) on derivatives, gain (loss) on sale of investments, other miscellaneous non-operating expenses and income taxes, which are included in net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company uses segment profit (loss) to assess the operating results and performance of its businesses and makes decisions about the allocation of resources to businesses using this financial measure. The company believes segment profit (loss) is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze and evaluate the operating performance of its segments consistent with management. Depreciation and amortization charges are a result of decisions made in prior periods regarding the allocation of resources and are, therefore, excluded from segment profit (loss). Also excluded from segment profit (loss) are financing, tax structuring and acquisition and divestiture decisions, which are generally made by corporate executives. Excluding these items from the performance measure of our businesses enables management to evaluate operating performance based on current economic conditions and decisions made by the managers of the businesses in the current period.\nThe company defines consolidated adjusted segment profit (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) as segment profit (loss) and net income (loss), respectively, excluding the impact of items not routine in nature and defines adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share as net income (loss) per diluted share, excluding the impact of items not routine in nature. The company believes consolidated adjusted segment profit (loss), adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share are relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the performance of segments excluding the impact of items not routine in nature or core to regular business operations.\nThe company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less dividends paid to non-controlling interests and additions to property and equipment. The company measures free cash flow as believes it is an important indicator for management and investors as to its liquidity, including the ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to shareholders.\nConsolidated segment profit (loss), consolidated adjusted segment profit (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, income (loss) from operations before income taxes, net income (loss), net income (loss) per diluted share, cash flow from operating activities and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Since consolidated segment profit (loss), consolidated adjusted segment profit (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. Supplemental schedules providing a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to its respective most comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP are included within this press release on the following pages.\nSegment Profit and Adjusted Segment Profit -
