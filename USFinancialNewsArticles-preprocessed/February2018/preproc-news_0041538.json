    "text": " 37 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Rugby - England's Haskell, Marler in squad to face Scots after suspension Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - England loose forward James Haskell and prop Joe Marler both returned to the squad after suspension as they were named by coach Eddie Jones on Sunday in a 29-man squad for the Six Nations match against Scotland on Saturday. Haskell was suspended for four weeks following a high tackle in a match for Wasps against Harlequins, while Marler was given a six-week ban for striking with the shoulder in an illegal clear out playing for Harlequins against Sale Sharks. England under-20 wing Gabriel Ibitoye has been named as an ‘apprentice’ in the squad which means he gets the experience of being involved in training and preparation for the match.
