    "text": "USDA secretary wants separate immigration program for ag workers Published 9 Hours Ago Reuters \nARLINGTON, Va., Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said on Thursday the government wants a separate immigration program for agricultural workers. \nSpeaking on the first day of the annual USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum, he said agriculture is caught in the crossfire of the immigration debate. The people who come to America to work on farms and ranches are not taking jobs from Americans, Perdue said. They are not the ones putting a burden on criminal justice system or welfare system.
