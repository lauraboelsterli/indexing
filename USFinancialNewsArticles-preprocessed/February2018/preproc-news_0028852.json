The most significant impact of the standard relates to the potential deferral of sales commissions and contract costs.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance: Management expects revenues for the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of $63.4 million to $64.1 million, representing 19% to 21% growth over the same quarter in 2017. GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.15, which assumes an effective income tax rate of 27%. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.34, which assumes an effective non-GAAP income tax rate of 23%. First quarter 2018 EPS estimates are based on approximately 41.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance: Management expects revenues for the full year 2018 to be in the range of $275.5 million to $278.5 million, representing 19% to 21% growth over 2017. GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.76, which assumes an effective income tax rate of 27%. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.44, which assumes an effective non-GAAP income tax rate of 23%. Full year 2018 EPS estimates are based on approximately 42.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nInvestor Conference Call\nQualys will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) on Monday, Feb. 12, 2018.

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements related to: acceleration of our product roadmap with the signing of a term sheet to acquire a company in India which has developed agent technology for mobile platforms which we plan to integrate into our platform; our ability to maintain leadership in securing global IT environments and helping customers secure their digital transformation initiatives; the growth of our business, including adoption of our existing solutions and our new offerings to both existing and new customers; our expectations regarding the introduction of new solutions; the capabilities of our platform; the expansion of our partnerships and the related benefits of such partnerships; our strategy and our business model and our ability to execute such strategy; our share repurchase program and allocation of cash for venture investments; our guidance for revenues, GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter and full year 2018, and our expectations for the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding and effective income tax rate for the first quarter and full year 2018. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our ability to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement to acquire the aforementioned company in India which has developed agent technology for mobile platforms, and to consummate such transaction and successfully integrate this company; our ability to continue to develop platform capabilities and solutions; the ability of our platform and solutions to perform as intended; customer acceptance and purchase of our existing solutions and new solutions; real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services; our ability to retain existing customers and generate new customers; the budgeting cycles, seasonal buying patterns and length of our sales cycle; our ability to manage costs as we increase our customer base and the number of our platform solutions; the market for cloud solutions for IT security and compliance not increasing at the rate we expect; competition from other products and services; fluctuations in currency exchange rates, unexpected fluctuations in our effective tax rate on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth and our ability to anticipate future market needs and opportunities; any unanticipated accounting charges; and general market, political, economic and business conditions in the United States as well as globally. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 2017.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to Qualys as of the date hereof, and Qualys disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Qualys monitors operating measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. In computing these non-GAAP financial measures, Qualys excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses and acquisition-related expenses that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business. Qualys also monitors Adjusted EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, other (income) expense, net, non-recurring expenses, and acquisition-related expenses that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business). Estimated impact of the MSSP contract signed in February 2016 refers to the difference between the estimated revenue recognized under the new terms in the MSSP contract and the estimated revenue that would have been recognized without the MSSP contract, assuming an appropriate renewal rate. The percentage impact is the net benefit, only in the contract year in which it occurred. Qualys believes that these non-GAAP operating metrics help illustrate underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses, as well as the related tax effects, that are excluded in non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA.\nFurthermore, Qualys uses these operating measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business and evaluating its performance. Qualys believes that non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional tools for investors to use in comparing its recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 excludes $0.7 million of non-recurring expenses related to the remittance of payroll taxes from year 2013 through May 2016. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 excludes $0.5 million of amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of Nevis Networks and NetWatcher and $0.1 million of compensation expense from the acquisition of NetWatcher that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business. During this same period, the Company has not excluded amounts related to other non-recurring items from non-GAAP net income because the Company has considered such amounts to be immaterial in any given quarter during such period.\nQualys has not reconciled non-GAAP net income per diluted share guidance to GAAP net income per diluted share because Qualys does not provide guidance on the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income (i.e., stock-based compensation and non-recurring expenses). The actual dollar amount of reconciling items in the first quarter and full year 2018 is likely to have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP net income per diluted share in the first quarter and full year 2018. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP net income per diluted share guidance to the GAAP net income per diluted share guidance is not available without unreasonable effort.\nIn order to provide a more complete picture of recurring core operating business results, the Company's non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share include tax adjustments required to achieve the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which could differ from the GAAP effective tax rate. The Company's non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35% for the full year 2017 (estimated rate was calculated as 36% in each of our first three quarters of fiscal 2017). The Company believes its estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% in 2018 is a reasonable estimate under its global operating structure. The Company intends to re-evaluate the non-GAAP effective tax rate on an annual basis. However, it may adjust this rate during the year to take into account events or trends that it believes materially impact the estimated annual rate. The non-GAAP effective tax rate could be subject to change for a number of reasons, including but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other significant events.\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included with the financial statements contained in this press release. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating its business internally and as such has determined that it is important to provide this information to investors.\nQualys, Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember
