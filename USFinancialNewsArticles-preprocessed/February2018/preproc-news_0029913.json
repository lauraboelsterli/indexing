    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — In a twist on Washington's truism about presidential budgets being D.O.A., President Donald Trump's 2019 fiscal plan due Monday is dead even before arrival.\nThe original plan was for Trump's new budget to slash domestic agencies even further than last year's proposal, but instead it will land in Congress three days after he signed a two-year spending agreement that wholly rewrites both last year's budget and the one to be released Monday.\n \nTrump's latest submission was completed before the budget pact delivered the nearly $300 billion increase above prior \"caps\" on spending. The $4 trillion-plus  \nTrump     time, though unlike last year's submission, it wouldn't promise to balance the federal ledger eventually.\n\"The budget does bend the trajectory down, it does move us back towards balance. It does get us away from trillion-dollar deficits,\" Mulvaney said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" ''Just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone. We do have a chance still to change the trajectory. And that is what the budget will show tomorrow.\"\n \nTrump's infrastructure  \nThe budget's call for increased border security funding would probably depend on Congress passing legislation to deal with young immigrants brought to the country illegally. The Senate was set Monday to begin debate on immigration policy, the fate of the so-called Dreamers a central question.\nThe White House budget office said Friday that Monday's submission would reflect stringent limits on appropriated spending — that's the more than $1 trillion spent each year for agency operations — that were the hangover from a failed 2011 budget deal. Last year, Trump promised a $54 billion, 10 percent increase for the Pentagon, financed by an equal cut to foreign aid and domestic agencies.\nWhat Congress instead delivered on Friday was a budget law would instead increase defense by $80 billion this year and boost nondefense appropriations by $63 billion. For the 2019 budget year submitted on Monday — and Trump's plan as originally devised would adhere to the old limits — Congress has already shattered the spending cap by $153 billion.\n\"Our leadership caved. The swamp won. And the American taxpayer lost,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., on CBS' \"Face The Nation.\"\nPresidential budgets tend to reprise many of the same elements year after year. While details aren't out yet, Trump's budget is likely to curb crop insurance costs, cut student loan subsidies, reduce pension benefits for federal workers and cut food stamps, among other proposals.\nSuch cuts went nowhere in Congress last year as Republicans focused on trying to repeal and replace Obama's Affordable Care Act and, after that failed, turned their sights to a successful rewrite of the tax code.\nBut the election in December of Alabama Democrat Doug Jones to the Senate seat cut the GOP's margin of control to 51-49. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says the chamber won't tackle politically toxic cuts to so-called mandatory programs.",
