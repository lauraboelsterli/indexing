McMaster speaks Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. \nBy Julian E. Barnes \nMUNICH—Amid growing allegations of Russian interference in western elections, U.S. and Russian officials sparred over a federal grand jury’s indictment of 13 Russians accused of using disinformation to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign . Evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election in the U.S. is ‘really incontrovertible.’ H.R. McMaster, U.S. national-security adviser \nThe to-and-fro throughout the day provided high-stakes drama for world leaders and security officials attending the Munich Security Conference, which in recent years has become a forum for the U.S. and Russia to air grievances about each other. \nSpeaking in Munich Saturday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he had seen little evidence of Russian interference in the U.S. campaign or in European elections. “Until we see the facts, everything else is just blabber,” he said. \nTaking the stage next, U.S. national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said the indictment provided “really incontrovertible” evidence that Russia interfered. “Now that this is in the arena of a law-enforcement investigation, it will be very apparent to everyone,” he said, in a rebuttal that riveted the audience. ‘We never got involved as a government in the political life in the United States. I have never done anything of this sort nor did my embassy.’ Former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, now Russia’s foreign minister \nThe general, author of a new security strategy emphasizing that the U.S. must focus on military and economic competition with the rising powers of Moscow and Beijing, has established himself as an administration hardliner against Russia.",
