    "text": "Net Sales Increase 5.3% Driven by Growth in Food Distribution and Military Segments\nReported Fourth Quarter EPS from Continuing Operations of $0.94 per Diluted Share; Adjusted Fourth Quarter EPS from Continuing Operations of $0.41 per Diluted Share\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SpartanNash Company (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SPTN) today reported financial results for the 12-week fourth quarter and 52-week year ended December 30, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased $96.0 million, or 5.3%, to $1.92 billion from $1.83 billion in the prior year quarter. The increase in net sales was driven by sales growth in the food distribution segment, primarily due to contributions from the Caito Foods Service (“Caito”) acquisition and organic growth of 3.2%, as well as a continuation of improved sales trends in the military commissary business, partially offset by lower sales at retail.\n“Our fourth quarter capped a year of continued progress against our key strategic initiatives,” said David Staples, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our strong sales growth in food distribution demonstrates our ability to both expand our relationships with existing independent customers and drive new business. We achieved sales growth in our military segment in the second half of the year, consistent with our expectations, and experienced a strong sequential quarterly improvement as we continue to partner with DeCA (Defense Commissary Agency) on its key initiatives. During the fourth quarter, we remodeled several retail locations under our refreshed Family Fare brand positioning, which provides customers with a more experiential and unique shopping experience. We continue to pilot and test numerous innovative concepts and incorporate these learnings into our retail operations and distribution customer offerings. We are confident that these strategies and investments will serve to strengthen our competitive positioning in 2018.”\nGross profit fiscal 2017 was $254.8 million, or 13.2% of net sales, compared to $259.3 million, or 14.2% of net sales, in the prior year quarter. The lower gross profit was due to several factors, most notably the impact that modest inflation had on LIFO, which resulted in fourth quarter LIFO expense of $0.4 million compared to a $4.0 million benefit in the prior year quarter. The margin rate was also impacted by the increased mix of food distribution sales as a percentage of total sales, margin investments at retail and industry-wide transportation cost challenges, particularly as it pertains to in-bound freight costs.\nReported operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $235.9 million, or 12.3% of net sales, compared to $234.6 million, or 12.8% of net sales, in the prior year quarter. The decrease in expenses as a rate to sales was primarily attributable to the mix of business operations, the absence of asset impairment charges and lower incentive compensation compared to the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher costs associated with Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities, as well as increased health care and transportation costs. Fourth quarter operating expenses would have been $227.9 million, or 11.8% of net sales, compared to $223.5 million, or 12.2% of net sales, in the prior year quarter, if adjustments primarily related to expenses associated with tax planning strategies, restructuring activities and Caito Fresh Kitchen start-up costs were excluded in the current year, and asset impairment charges, restructuring activities and acquisition costs were excluded in the prior year quarter.\nThe Company reported operating earnings of $18.9 million compared to earnings of $24.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to the margin impacts noted previously, particularly the LIFO benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, as well as incremental expenses associated with Caito, healthcare and transportation, partially offset by the absence of asset impairment charges and lower incentive compensation expense compared to the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted operating earnings (1) were $28.3 million compared to $35.8 million in the prior year quarter due to the factors mentioned previously, as well as the asset impairment charges incurred in the prior year quarter. Please see the financial tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) was $48.3 million compared to $50.8 million in the prior year quarter due to the factors mentioned above.\nThe Company reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $34.7 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, which includes a $0.71 tax benefit related to the Company’s re-measurement of its deferred taxes under the newly enacted federal tax legislation. The Company’s prior year fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $12.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, and includes a $0.02 per diluted share benefit associated with certain tax credits. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations (3) for the fourth quarter were $15.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $20.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Current year adjusted earnings from continuing operations exclude a net after-tax benefit of $0.53 per diluted share primarily related to the previously mentioned tax benefit and other adjustments. Prior year fourth quarter adjusted earnings from continuing operations exclude net after-tax charges of $0.19 per diluted share primarily related to the previously mentioned adjustments.\nFood Distribution Segment\nNet sales for the food distribution segment increased $111.6 million, or 13.3%, to $950.2 million from $838.6 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to contributions from the Caito acquisition and organic sales growth from existing customers.\nReported operating earnings for the food distribution segment were $14.4 million compared to $21.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in reported operating earnings was primarily attributable to Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities, and higher LIFO, healthcare and transportation-related expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings (4) were $18.9 million compared to $23.9 million in the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings exclude $4.5 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to Fresh Kitchen start-up costs and expenses associated with tax planning strategies in the current year, and $2.8 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to acquisition costs in the prior year quarter.\nMilitary Segment\nNet sales for the military segment increased $13.6 million, or 2.7%, to $524.0 million from $510.4 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to new commissary business in the Southwest and incremental volume from the private brand program, partially offset by lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations.\nReported operating earnings for the military segment were $2.5 million compared to $3.4 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to LIFO expense, as well as higher transportation and warehousing costs associated with the onboarding of new business and industry-wide transportation cost challenges, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and margin improvements. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings (4) increased to $3.2 million from $3.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nRetail Segment\nNet sales for the retail segment were $450.0 million in the fourth quarter compared to $479.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to $18.0 million in lower sales resulting from the closure and sale of retail stores as well as a 3.2% decrease in comparable store sales, which exclude fuel, partially offset by higher fuel prices compared to the prior year.\nReported operating earnings for the retail segment improved to $2.0 million from $0.2 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in reported operating earnings was primarily attributable to the absence of asset impairment charges and lower incentive compensation and depreciation compared to the prior year quarter, which more than offset the impact of lower sales and margin reflecting the challenging retail environment and higher LIFO expense. Adjusted operating earnings (4) were $6.3 million compared to $8.7 million in the prior year quarter due to the factors mentioned previously. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings (4) exclude $4.3 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to restructuring activities and expenses associated with tax planning strategies in the current year, and $8.5 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to asset impairment and restructuring activities in the prior year quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter, as part of its store rationalization plan, the Company closed one retail store and sold another to an existing food distribution customer, ending the quarter with 145 corporate owned retail stores compared to 157 stores in the prior year quarter. Early in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company closed two retail stores in connection with its store rationalization plan.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 was $52.8 million, compared to $157.2 million in fiscal 2016. The change was primarily due to the timing of working capital requirements, particularly higher accounts receivable and inventory balances associated with new distribution business and incremental sales to certain high-growth distribution customers. The timing of year-end payments impacting accounts payable balances also contributed to the change in cash flows, which was partly offset by lower customer advances compared to the prior year period. Shortly after the fiscal year end, working capital improved significantly as inventories and accounts payable balances began to return to more normalized levels.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company paid a cash dividend of $0.165 per share for a total of $6.1 million and repurchased 505,290 shares of its common stock for approximately $12.5 million. For the full year of fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased 1,367,432 shares for approximately $35.0 million. As of December 30, 2017, the Company has $65.0 million available for future repurchases under its two $50.0 million share repurchase programs.\nDuring the fourth quarter, and in connection with securing a long-term supply arrangement, the Company also invested $14.8 million in the purchase of real property and began leasing the related assets to an independent retailer.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nConsolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $393.5 million, or 5.1%, to $8.13 billion from $7.73 billion in the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to contributions from the Caito acquisition, organic growth of 3.7% in the food distribution segment, new military commissary business in the Southwest in the second half of the year and increased contributions from the DeCA private brand program, partly offset by lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations and lower sales at retail resulting from the closure and sale of retail stores and a 2.4% decrease in comparable store sales.\nThe Company reported a loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 of $52.6 million, or $(1.41) per diluted share, compared to reported earnings from continuing operations of $57.1 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to current year non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $222.7 million, predominantly related to the retail segment, higher costs associated with Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities as well as increased LIFO and health care expenses, partly offset by the previously mentioned tax benefit and lower incentive compensation costs. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations (3) for fiscal 2017 were $78.6 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $82.2 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower retail operating earnings reflecting the challenging operating environment, higher costs associated with Caito operations, LIFO and healthcare, as well as reduced earnings in the military segment due to both a challenging first half of 2017 with respect to military commissary sales and higher costs associated with onboarding significant new business. These declines were largely offset by lower incentive compensation costs and organic growth in food distribution. Fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations exclude $131.2 million of net after-tax charges primarily related to goodwill and asset impairment, the previously mentioned tax benefit and Caito Fresh Kitchen start-up and acquisition costs. Fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations exclude $25.1 million of net after-tax charges primarily related to asset impairment and restructuring charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) for fiscal 2017 improved to $236.4 million from $231.0 million in fiscal 2016, representing 2.9% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 3.0% of net sales in fiscal 2016.\nFor fiscal 2017, capital expenditures were $71.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense was $83.2 million and interest expense totaled $25.3 million.\nOutlook\nMr. Staples continued, “We ended 2017 with the Company positioned for growth despite the ever-evolving retail landscape. During the year, we expanded our food distribution customer base and private brand offerings, diversified our sales channels, continued optimizing certain aspects of our supply chain, and invested in both the Caito management team and our retail store base. While the retail environment remains challenging, we are focused on capitalizing on our growth opportunities and leveraging our differentiated business model to drive sales and profitability. We continue to take actions that we believe will enhance the convenience and value that we provide our customers and continue to see positive results from our investments. To enhance this momentum, we intend to invest approximately 50% of our tax reform savings in our associates and programs designed to improve our competitive position.”\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company anticipates year-over-year sales growth to continue in the food distribution segment driven primarily by incremental sales to high-growth customers as well as contributions from Caito’s Fresh Kitchen facility. New military commissary business in the Southwest, which will benefit sales comparisons for the first half of 2018, and contributions from the ongoing expansion of the DeCA private brand program should continue to drive sales growth in the military segment. The Company expects that its retail stores’ comparable sales will improve to slightly negative to flat by the end of the year as the stores benefit from the Company’s new positioning of its offerings. The sales outlook takes into consideration the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018 will reduce fiscal 2017 net sales by approximately $160 million as certain food distribution contracts that are currently reported on a gross basis will be reported on a net basis as the Company concluded that it does not control the goods or services prior to transfer to the customer. The Company anticipates adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations (5) of approximately $2.20 to $2.32, excluding merger/acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring charges and other adjusted items, compared to $2.10 in the prior year. The Company anticipates that reported earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of approximately $2.02 to $2.09 per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $(1.41) per diluted share in the prior year. The adjusted and reported guidance reflects an effective tax rate of 23% to 24% for fiscal 2018 and estimates that approximately half of the tax savings associated with new federal tax legislation will directly benefit earnings.\nFor the first half of fiscal 2018, the Company expects adjusted earnings per share to be flat to modestly below the prior year, driven primarily by sequential improvements in Caito operations and cycling certain vendor programs. These items are expected to be partially offset by the Company’s overall sales growth and the benefits of tax reform.\nThe Company expects capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be in the range of $60.0 million to $70.0 million, with depreciation and amortization of approximately $80.0 million to $88.0 million, and total interest expense of approximately $24.0 million to $28.0 million.\nConference Call\nA telephone conference call to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 financial results is scheduled for Thursday, February 22, 2017 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

88,732 Notes: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as net earnings plus interest, discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash items including deferred (stock) compensation, the LIFO provision, as well as adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted EBITDA as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted EBITDA is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered “non-operating” or “non-core” in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted EBITDA format.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company’s definitions of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTable 3: Reconciliation of Operating (Loss) Earnings to Adjusted Operating Earnings (A Non-GAAP Financial Measure) (Unaudited)\n12 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended December 30, December 31, December 30, December 31, (In thousands)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating earnings (loss) $ 18,940 $ 24,620 $ (106,316 ) $ 108,767 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 1,071 2,723 8,101 6,959 Restructuring charges and goodwill/asset impairment 2,799 8,402 228,459 32,116 Fresh Kitchen start-up costs 1,394 — 8,082 — Expenses associated with tax planning strategies 3,798 — 3,798 — Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — — 1,172 — Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 340 19 368 859 Adjusted operating earnings $ 28,342 $ 35,764 $ 143,664 $ 148,701 Reconciliation of operating earnings (loss) to adjusted operating earnings by segment: Food Distribution: Operating earnings $ 14,428 $ 21,053 $ 83,296 $ 85,093 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 990 2,503 6,244 3,703 Restructuring charges and asset impairment 37 319 1,317 5,068 Expenses associated with tax planning strategies 1,744 — 1,744 — Fresh Kitchen start-up costs 1,394 — 8,082 — Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — — 591 — Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 315 11 342 229 Adjusted operating earnings $ 18,908 $ 23,886 $ 101,616 $ 94,093 Military: Operating earnings $ 2,497 $ 3,368 $ 7,014 $ 12,160 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 67 — 1,522 1 Restructuring (gains) charges — (232 ) 500 (473 ) Expenses associated with tax planning strategies 593 — 593 — Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — — 147 — Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 6 3 7 245 Adjusted operating earnings $ 3,163 $ 3,139 $ 9,783 $ 11,933 Retail: Operating earnings (loss) $ 2,015 $ 199 $ (196,626 ) $ 11,514 Adjustments: Merger/acquisition and integration 14 220 335 3,255 Restructuring charges and goodwill/asset impairment 2,762 8,315 226,642 27,521 Expenses associated with tax planning strategies 1,461 — 1,461 — Stock compensation associated with executive retirement — — 434 — Severance associated with cost reduction initiatives 19 5 19 385 Adjusted operating earnings $ 6,271 $ 8,739 $ 32,265 $ 42,675 Notes: Adjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as operating earnings plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted operating earnings provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments.

Notes: Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as earnings from continuing operations plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted earnings from continuing operations provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company. The Company considers adjusted earnings from continuing operations as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis.
