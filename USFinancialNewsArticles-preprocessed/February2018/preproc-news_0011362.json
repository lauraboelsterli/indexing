But the currency has failed to gain on economic news that points to tighter monetary policy.\n“In order to make the case for a sustainable upturn in the dollar, you need to see a real change in capital flows,” Oliveri said, noting that data on those flows pointed to a stronger euro, which has gained 7.2 percent against the dollar since early November.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood little changed at 89.202 on Monday after gaining 0.6 percent on Friday.\nLatest positioning data showed net short positions swelled to $17.5 billion last week, just shy of a five-year high.\nAgainst the euro, the dollar hovered at $1.2455, against the three-year low of $1.2538 it reached last week.\nThe euro was unmoved by a survey showing that euro zone businesses began 2018 by increasing activity faster than at any time in well over a decade as new orders surged.\nThe dollar struggled to hold on to gains against the yen, falling 0.4 percent to 109.74 yen after reaching 110.485 yen on Friday. The U.S. currency remains higher than a four-month low of 108.280 yen reached on Jan. 26.\nWhile analysts broadly expect the euro to gain against the dollar, some see the return of the greenback’s sensitivity to domestic economic news.\n“Will the market really recognise the error of its ways - i.e., the excessive dollar weakness - and correct it all of a sudden? That would be too good to be true,” Commerzbank analysts said. “However, following the wake-up call of the labour market report, the market might at least focus more on US economic data again.”\nWorries about Britain’s impending exit from the European Union rattled sterling investors, with the euro up 0.5 percent against the pound. The dollar was also up half a percent against the British currency.\nThe Australian dollar rose to $0.7932 after touching $0.7891, its lowest in three weeks following a 1.5 percent decline on Friday. The Aussie had advanced to $0.8136 late in January, its highest in more than two years.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets\nEditing by Saikat Chatterjee and Larry King\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
