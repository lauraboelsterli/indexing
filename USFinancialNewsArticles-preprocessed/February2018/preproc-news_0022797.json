    "text": "LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Carmaker Nissan said it and other Japanese companies would meet Prime Minister Theresa May and Finance Minister Philip Hammond on Thursday to discuss their business in the country, as concerns about Brexit mount.\nJapanese firms have spent billions of dollars in Britain over recent decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.\nCarmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain’s 1.67 million cars, the vast majority of which were exported overseas.\nBut like the rest of the industry, they are concerned that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10 percent and be subject to lengthy customs delays after Brexit.\n“Nissan Europe Chairman Paul Willcox will join representatives from other Japanese companies in meeting the Prime Minister and Chancellor on Thursday to discuss our operations and investments in the UK,” the firm said in a statement.\n“We will not be disclosing details of the discussions.” (Reporting by Costas Pitas, editing by Guy Faulconbridge)\n ",
