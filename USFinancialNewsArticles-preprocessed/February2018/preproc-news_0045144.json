    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--Global Payout, Inc. (OTCPink:GOHE) (\"Global\") is pleased to announce that the CEO of its majority owned subsidiary, MoneyTrac Technology, Inc. (\"MTRAC\", the \"Company\"), Vanessa Luna has opted on her own accord to indefinitely suspend her salary effective March 1, 2018. The intent of this move is to contribute to the acceleration of the Company's current vision and objectives which involve leveraging the many different strategic partnerships they have established towards bringing the Company to a point of positive revenue.\nThe end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018 has proven to be a very active and successful period for MoneyTrac. The acquisition of PotSaver at the end of last year brought MTRAC a well-established network of businesses throughout the various verticals that are emerging across the cannabis industry. Banking and financial compliance are among the most underserved of these vertical markets and MTRAC will leverage its network of dispensaries to bring its mission of \"BANKING THE UNBANKABLE\" to fruition in 2018.\nThe indefinite deferment of Ms. Luna's salary will offer the Company the opportunity to earmark additional funds and resources for the specific use of supporting existing endeavors such as the MTRAC-Token. The barriers surrounding payments in the cannabis industry have proven to be significant, and the Company is using the current industry traction to launch this token in an effort to solve this problem.\n\"This moment is pivotal for MoneyTrac's growth and development.\" said MTRAC CEO, Vanessa Luna. \"Our Company has dedicated a tremendous amount of time, effort, and resources, both financial and otherwise, over the past year to put us in the enviable position we are in today within this industry. It is my hope that my willingness to forego my salary for an indefinite period of time will be viewed as a testament to the unwavering confidence and faith I have in the future success of MoneyTrac Technology.\"\nAbout Global Payout, Inc. (OTC Pink:GOHE)\nSince the Company's inception in 2009, Global Payout, Inc. has been a leading provider of comprehensive and customized prepaid payment solutions for domestic and international organizations distributing money worldwide. In 2014, Global introduced its first online payment platform called the Consolidated Payment Gateway (CPG), which allowed its enterprise clients to transfer money to international bank accounts, mobile accounts, and prepaid card accounts. The development of the CPG became the foundation for the introduction of its new, state of the art FINTECH payment system in 2017, for both online and mobile applications to allow account holders to maximize an expanded suite of financial services and minimize operational costs. Global will continue to offer their FINTECH payment system to many vertical markets for support of foreign currency exchange and digital currency, including ongoing support of the banking industry and international governments.\nAbout MoneyTrac Technology\nMoneyTrac Technology, Inc. is a pioneer in offering a full-service solution for alternative banking and electronic financial solutions and provides all aspects of financial technology including E-Wallet and mobile apps services for businesses and companies in various \"high-risk\" industries. MoneyTrac's technology platform allows for its clients to access their financial information from anywhere in the world, in addition to providing tracking and compliance to help them manage and control the flow of all revenue through their business.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer:\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
