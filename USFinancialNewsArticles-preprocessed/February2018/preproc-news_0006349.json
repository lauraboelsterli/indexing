    "text": " 36 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago Unilever fourth-quarter sales better than expected Reuters Staff   Unilever ( ULVR.L )( UNc.AS ) reported a bigger-than-expected acceleration in fourth-quarter sales growth on Thursday helped by a step-up in emerging markets that saw the consumer goods maker end its tumultuous year on a higher note. \nThe maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerryâ€™s ice cream - which spent most of last year reviewing its business after rebuffing a $143 billion takeover bid in February - said underlying sales rose 4 percent. Analysts on average were expecting 3.7 percent, according to a company-supplied consensus. \nThat marks an improvement from 3 percent in the first half and 2.6 percent in the third quarter.
