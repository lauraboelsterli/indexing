    "text": "MUMBAI, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India said late on Monday it was withdrawing all its existing mechanisms for tackling bad debt at Indian banks and replacing them with a harmonised and simplified generic framework for resolving stressed assets.\nThe new system will force lenders to identify and tackle any stressed-asset accounts more rapidly, the regulator said.\nLast year, India tweaked its laws to give the central bank more authority to push lenders to deal with the nearly $150 billion in troubled debt at banks, which has choked off new lending and slowed the economy.
