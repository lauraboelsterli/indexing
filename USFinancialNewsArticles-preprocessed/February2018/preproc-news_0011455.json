    "text": "AURORA, Ohio, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TCP International Holdings, Ltd. (TCP) today announced that both of the nation's leading independent proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass, Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis), recommend that TCP shareholders vote \"FOR\" approval of the merger agreement with Quality Light Source GmbH, an entity affiliated with Ellis Yan and Solomon Yan. Under the terms of the merger agreement, TCP shareholders will receive $1.00 in cash per share.\nISS and Glass Lewis provide independent proxy voting advice to thousands of institutional investors, including mutual funds, pension funds and other fiduciaries.\nIn its January 31, 2018 report, ISS stated:\nTake private transactions that include members of a company's founding management team may draw additional scrutiny from investors than arm's-length transactions due to the heightened risks of conflicts of interest.\nIn this case, the company recently received a default notice, the company's business condition was deteriorating at an increasing rate, and the controlling shareholders opposed a third-party takeover. For these reasons, in addition to the premium being offered in cash consideration, a vote FOR the merger is warranted.\n\"We are appreciative of the proxy advisory firms' votes of confidence in the proposed merger,\" said Brian Catlett, CEO of TCP. \"We urge all of TCP's shareholders to follow the recommendations of these independent authorities and the independent TCP board by voting \"FOR\" the approval of the merger agreement, as a failure to vote is the equivalent of a vote against the merger.\"\nAn extraordinary general meeting of TCP shareholders to consider and vote upon the merger agreement will be held on February 13, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Central European Time, at the offices of Lenz & Staehelin at Brandschenkestrasse 24, CH-8027 Zürich, Switzerland. All TCP shareholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2018 are entitled to vote.\nVoting is currently open and TCP shareholders who have questions about the merger or who need assistance in submitting their proxy or voting their shares should contact the company's proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at 1 (888) 750-5834 (toll-free from the U.S. and Canada) or 1 (412) 232-3651 (from other locations).\nAbout TCP\nTCP International Holdings, Ltd (OTC: TCPIF), is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of energy efficient lighting technologies.
