    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Global Payout, Inc. (OTC Pink:GOHE) is pleased to announce the appointment of Bill Rochfort, as President & EVP Sales to its newly formed logistics subsidiary, SecurCapital Corp . headquartered in Los Angeles, a leading international commerce gateway. SecurCapital will focus on logistics supply chain finance services introducing a disruptive \"one-click solution\" offering Fintech and Blockchain services in the underserved trillion-dollar logistics marketplace.\n\"We're very excited to have Bill join our senior team of logisticians at SecurCapital at this pivotal time as the company launches its SecurCloud Platform,\" said Global Payout CEO, James Hancock. \"Clearly, there has been a monumental paradigm shift in the underserved supply chain finance industry attempting to incorporate a wide breath of Fintech and Blockchain alternatives. Traditional financial institutions are not positioned to serve the industry payment requirements for secure access, integrated foreign exchange, speed, international payments or access to adequate working capital. Leveraging years of international finance experience, Bill will be instrumental in driving the SecurCapital value proposition to our customers,\" Hancock added.\n\"This is just an extraordinary time to merge innovations for security, speed, access to capital and cost savings within our Fintech platform with the global logistics industry,\" said Bill Rochfort. \"We are very excited to launch the SecurCloud Platform as a first to market innovative Supply Chain Finance solution. Research shows that there is not only a lack of innovation, but also a lack of understanding of what Fintech is and its potential impact on logistics,\" said Rochfort.\nBill Rochfort is a 25-year Fintech industry veteran experienced in freight payment, foreign exchange, e-wallet platforms and global banking. He was an early adopter of cloud architecture and an officer with Premier Global Services, Intermedia, Sprint and Cbeyond.\nThe SecurCloud Platform (\"SCP\"), which the Company has developed through the technology available in its Consolidated Payment Gateway (\"CPG\"), is a fully configurable, \"banking-in-a-box\" cloud-based platform. The overall design is a \"closed proprietary ecosystem\" (e.g. intranet) so that each client has maximum control and security over any internal employees, partners, vendors, and contractors for bilateral payments and improved security.\nAbout Global Payout, Inc. (OTC Pink:GOHE)\nSince the Company's inception in 2009, Global Payout, Inc. has been a leading provider of comprehensive and customized prepaid payment solutions for domestic and international organizations distributing money worldwide. In 2014, Global introduced its first online payment platform called the Consolidated Payment Gateway (CPG), which allowed its enterprise clients to transfer money to international bank accounts, mobile accounts, and prepaid card accounts. The development of the CPG became the foundation for the introduction of its new, state of the art FINTECH payment system in 2017, for both online and mobile applications to allow account holders to maximize an expanded suite of financial services and minimize operational costs. Global will continue to offer their FINTECH payment system to many vertical markets for support of foreign currency exchange and digital currency, including ongoing support of the banking industry and international governments.\nAbout SecurCapital Corporation\nSecurCapital is a Fintech supply chain finance company offering premier payment and working capital solutions for the logistics industry. The SecurCloud Platform ('SCP') provides an integrated system for global payments, foreign exchange, and accounts receivable financing services through a proprietary ecosystem controlled by the client. The dashboard user environment allows the client to optimize cash flow management through document delivery of invoices, proof of delivery, and payment transactions to global vendors.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
