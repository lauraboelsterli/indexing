    "text": "Fourth quarter results include Operating Income of $11.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $58.5 million\nCDA notes maturity extended and outstanding principal reduced\nOVERLAND PARK, Kan., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YRC Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ:YRCW) reported consolidated operating revenue for fourth quarter 2017 of $1.209 billion and consolidated operating income of $11.3 million, which included a $3.6 million gain on property disposals. As a comparison, for the fourth quarter 2016, the Company reported consolidated operating revenue of $1.148 billion and consolidated operating income of $14.9 million, which included a $3.4 million gain on property disposals.\nConsolidated operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.891 billion with consolidated operating income of $98.4 million, which included a $0.6 million gain on property disposals. This compares to full-year 2016 consolidated operating revenue of $4.698 billion with consolidated operating income of $124.3 million, which included a $14.6 million gain on property disposals.\nIn January 2018, the Company extended the maturity of its contribution deferral agreement (CDA) notes from December 2019 to December 2022. As part of the extension, the Company paid $25 million that reduced the outstanding principal of the CDA notes to $75.1 million. Over the past five quarters, outstanding debt at YRC Worldwide has been reduced by $129.3 million.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe fourth quarter 2017 net loss was $7.5 million compared to a net loss of $7.5 million in fourth quarter 2016. For full-year 2017, the net loss was $10.8 million compared to net income of $21.5 million in 2016. The fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results were impacted by a $7.6 million non-union pension settlement charge.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the Company generated consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $58.5 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared to $57.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter (as detailed in the reconciliation below). Last twelve month (LTM) consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $274.2 million compared to $297.5 million in 2016.\nThe total debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio for fourth quarter 2017 was 3.38 times compared to 3.40 times for fourth quarter 2016.\nThe fourth quarter 2017 results include increases in short-term rental expense of $4.1 million and local purchased transportation expense of $3.0 million when compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The increases were primarily due to a shortage of revenue equipment and a demand for drivers.\nThe fourth quarter 2017 results include a non-union pension settlement charge at YRC Freight of $7.6 million. The pension settlement charge was triggered due to the amount of lump sum benefit payments distributed from plan assets in 2017. The lump sum benefit payments reduce pension obligations and are funded from existing pension plan assets and therefore do not impact the Company’s cash balance nor liquidity. The non-cash expense is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the Company’s term loan agreement.\nThe fourth quarter 2017 was unfavorably impacted by approximately $4.0 million in legal expenses due to adverse developments at the Regional segment when compared to the fourth quarter 2016.\nReinvestment in the business continued in 2017 with $103.3 million in capital expenditures and new operating leases for revenue equipment with a capital value equivalent of $133.8 million, for a total of $237.0 million. This compares to a total of $253.1 million invested in 2016. The majority of the investment was in tractors, trailers and technology.\nOperational Highlights\nThe consolidated operating ratio for fourth quarter 2017 was 99.1 compared to 98.7 in fourth quarter 2016. The operating ratio at YRC Freight improved to 99.5 compared to 100.0 for the same period in 2016. The Regional segment’s fourth quarter 2017 operating ratio was 98.0 compared to 96.1 a year ago.\nFourth quarter 2017 tonnage per day decreased 0.5% at YRC Freight and increased 3.9% at the Regional segment compared to fourth quarter 2016.\nAt YRC Freight, including fuel surcharge, fourth quarter 2017 revenue per hundredweight increased 4.4% and revenue per shipment increased 4.9% when compared to the same period in 2016. Excluding fuel surcharge, revenue per hundredweight increased 2.6% and revenue per shipment increased 3.1%.\nAt the Regional segment, including fuel surcharge, fourth quarter 2017 revenue per hundredweight increased 1.2% and revenue per shipment increased 4.6% when compared to the same period in 2016. Excluding fuel surcharge, revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.4% and revenue per shipment increased 2.9%.\nLiquidity Update\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and Managed Accessibility (as defined in the company’s most recently filed periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q) under its ABL facility totaling $118.3 million compared to $181.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFor full-year 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $60.7 million compared to $103.1 million in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s outstanding debt was $926.1 million, a decrease of $84.2 million compared to $1.010 billion as of December 31, 2016.\n“In the fourth quarter 2017, we continued to see yield improvement at YRC Freight as it reported the largest year-over-year increase in revenue per hundredweight since the fourth quarter 2014,” stated James Welch, chief executive officer of YRC Worldwide. “Collectively, the Regional companies reported strong year-over-year increases in revenue per shipment, tonnage per day and weight per shipment.\n“Our fourth quarter results were lower than our previously released projections primarily due to purchased transportation expense being unfavorably impacted by a shortage of revenue equipment and a demand for drivers. These factors contributed to an increase in local purchased transportation and short-term rental expense including the impact from approximately 2,000 rented tractors and trailers. Going forward these expenses can be mitigated by continuing to upgrade our fleet, hiring additional pick-up and delivery drivers and improving productivities. During the fourth quarter we took delivery of more than 450 tractors with approximately another 900 scheduled for delivery in the first two quarters of 2018. We also took delivery of more than 1,900 trailers with approximately another 450 expected to be delivered in the first half of 2018.\n“We successfully extended the term loan and most recently the CDA notes to minimize near-term refinancing risk. We believe these efforts significantly improve our capital structure and positions YRC Freight, Holland, Reddaway and New Penn well for the long term.\n“As we enter 2018, positive pricing and demand trends suggest the outlook for the trucking industry remains positive. The dynamics of the industry, including the planned progression of ELD enforcement and an ongoing shortage of qualified drivers, could restrict capacity further. With the revenue equipment and technology investments that we are making plus our initiative to grow yield, we’re excited about 2018 and the opportunity we have in front of us to improve the business,” concluded Welch.\nKey Segment Information – fourth quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016\nYRC Freight 2017 2016 Percent\nChange (a) Workdays 61.5 61.0 Operating revenue (in millions) $ 761.7 $ 730.3 4.3% Operating income (in millions) $ 3.6 $ (0.1 ) NM (b) Operating ratio 99.5 100.0 0.5pp Total tonnage per day (in thousands) 24.80 24.92 (0.5)% Total shipments per day (in thousands) 40.48 40.86 (0.9)% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight incl FSC $ 24.52 $ 23.48 4.4% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight excl FSC $ 21.71 $ 21.16 2.6% Total picked up revenue per shipment incl FSC $ 300 $ 286 4.9% Total picked up revenue per shipment excl FSC $ 266 $ 258 3.1% Total weight/shipment (in pounds) 1,225 1,220 0.5%\nRegional Transportation 2017 2016 Percent\nChange (a) Workdays 61.5 60.5 Operating revenue (in millions) $ 446.9 $ 418.0 6.9% Operating income (in millions) $ 8.9 $ 16.4 (45.7)% Operating ratio 98.0 96.1 (1.9)pp Total tonnage per day (in thousands) 30.76 29.60 3.9% Total shipments per day (in thousands) 40.14 39.92 0.6% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight incl FSC $ 11.79 $ 11.64 1.2% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight excl FSC $ 10.45 $ 10.49 (0.4)%\nTotal picked up revenue per shipment incl FSC $ 181 $ 173 4.6% Total picked up revenue per shipment excl FSC $ 160 $ 156 2.9% Total weight/shipment (in pounds) 1,532 1,483 3.3% Key Segment Information – full-year 2017 compared to full-year 2016\nYRC Freight 2017 2016 Percent\nChange (a)\nWorkdays 251.5 252.5 Operating revenue (in millions) $ 3,067.9 $ 2,958.9 3.7% Operating income (in millions) $ 41.4 $ 53.2 (22.1)% Operating ratio 98.7 98.2 (0.5)pp Total tonnage per day (in thousands) 25.01 24.64 1.5% Total shipments per day (in thousands) 41.61 41.06 1.3% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight incl FSC $ 24.11 $ 23.49 2.6% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight excl FSC\n$ 21.53\n$ 21.30\n1.1%\nTotal picked up revenue per shipment incl FSC $ 290 $ 282 2.8% Total picked up revenue per shipment excl FSC $ 259 $ 256 1.3% Total weight/shipment (in pounds) 1,202 1,200 0.2%\nRegional Transportation 2017 2016 Percent\nChange (a)\nWorkdays 251.5 252.0 Operating revenue (in millions) $ 1,823.4 $ 1,739.3 4.8% Operating income (in millions) $ 67.9 $ 81.3 (16.5)% Operating ratio 96.3 95.3 (1.0)pp Total tonnage per day (in thousands) 31.12 30.10 3.4% Total shipments per day (in thousands) 41.23 40.84 1.0% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight incl FSC $ 11.66 $ 11.47 1.6% Total picked up revenue per hundredweight excl FSC $ 10.44 $ 10.42 0.1% Total picked up revenue per shipment incl FSC\n$ 176\n$ 169\n4.0%\nTotal picked up revenue per shipment excl FSC $ 158 $ 154 2.5% Total weight/shipment (in pounds) 1,510 1,474 2.4% (a) Percent change based on unrounded figures and not the rounded figures presented\n(b) Not meaningful\nReview of Financial Results\nYRC Worldwide Inc. will host a conference call with the investment community today, Thursday, February 1, 2018, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET.\nA live audio webcast of the conference call and presentation slides will be available on YRC Worldwide Inc.’s website www.yrcw.com . A replay of the webcast will also be available at www.yrcw.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that reflects the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA (defined in our credit facilities as Consolidated EBITDA) is a non-GAAP measure that reflects the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, and further adjusted for letter of credit fees, equity-based compensation expense, net gains or losses on property disposals, restructuring professional fees, nonrecurring consulting fees, expenses associated with certain lump sum payments to our union employees and gains or losses from permitted dispositions and discontinued operations, among other items, as defined in the company’s credit facilities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used for internal management purposes as a financial measure that reflects the company’s core operating performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure compliance with financial covenants in the company’s credit facilities and to pay certain executive bonus compensation. We believe our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users as these measures represent key supplemental information our management uses to compare and evaluate our core underlying business results both on a consolidated basis and across our business segments, particularly in light of our leverage position and the capital-intensive nature of our business. Further, EBITDA is a measure that is commonly used by other companies in our industry and provides a comparison for investors to evaluate the performance of the companies in the industry. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA helps investors to understand how the company is tracking against our financial covenants in our term loan credit agreement as this measure is calculated as prescribed in our term loan credit agreement and serves as a driving component of key financial covenants. However, these financial measures should not be construed as better measurements than net income, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have the following limitations:\nEBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or fund principal payments on our outstanding debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to fund restructuring professional fees and other transaction costs related to issuances of debt, nonrecurring consulting fees, letter of credit fees, service interest, principal payments on our outstanding debt or lump sum payments to our union employees required under the ratified Memorandum of Understanding; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; Equity-based compensation is an element of our long-term incentive compensation program, although Adjusted EBITDA excludes employee equity-based compensation expense when presenting our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, our non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our non-GAAP measures as secondary measures. The company has provided reconciliations of its non-GAAP measures to GAAP net income (loss) and operating income (loss) within the supplemental financial information in this release.\n* * * * *\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.
