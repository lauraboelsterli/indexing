    "text": " 47 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago Qualcomm says Broadcom deal may lead to loss of two major customers Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 9 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Friday that it might lose two major customers if the revised $121 billion deal with chipmaker Broadcom Ltd goes forward. \n\"Two customers providing Qualcomm chipset revenues in excess of $1 billion each per year have stated that they are likely to move designs away from Qualcomm in the event that this transaction moves forward,\" according to a filing. ( bit.ly/2nVvbOU ) \n“This is due to their lack of confidence in Broadcom’s ability to continue to lead in technology.” \nQualcomm on Thursday rejected Broadcom’s revised buyout offer, but proposed a meeting with the company to see whether they can address what it called the bid’s “serious deficiencies in value and certainty”.
