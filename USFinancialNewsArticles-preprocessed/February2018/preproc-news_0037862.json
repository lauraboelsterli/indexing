    "text": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s largest pipeline operator Enbridge Inc reported a smaller quarterly profit on Friday as it took a charge in its gas transmission and midstream business.\nThe Calgary-based company’s net income fell to C$207 million, or 13 Canadian cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from C$365 million, or 39 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nEnbridge said it took a C$4.55 billion charge related to the write-down of some assets in the gas transmission and midstream business.
