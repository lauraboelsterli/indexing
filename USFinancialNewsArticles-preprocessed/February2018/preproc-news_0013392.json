It’s not a big advantage and there’s still a long way to go in the tie,” Barca coach Ernesto Valverde told reporters. \nValencia were trounced 7-0 on their last Cup visit to Barcelona when Gary Neville was in charge and coach Marcelino opted for a cautious approach, with his side having under 20 percent possession at one point in the game.

We’re going to fight with all our strength to win the tie. It might seem impossible but we’ll try and pull off a miracle.” Reporting by Richard Martin, editing by Ed Osmond",
