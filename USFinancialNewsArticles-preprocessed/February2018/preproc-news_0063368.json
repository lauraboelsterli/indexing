    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Saul Centers, Inc. (NYSE: BFS), an equity real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), announced its operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (\"2017 Quarter\"). Total revenue for the 2017 Quarter increased to $56.7 million from $54.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (\"2016 Quarter\"). Operating income, which is net income before the impact of the change in fair value of derivatives, loss on early extinguishment of debt, gains on sales of property and gains on casualty settlements, increased to $14.4 million for the 2017 Quarter from $13.4 million for the 2016 Quarter.\nNet income available to common stockholders was $8.5 million ($0.38 per diluted share) for the 2017 Quarter compared to $8.4 million ($0.38 per diluted share) for the 2016 Quarter. The increase in net income available to common stockholders was primarily due to (a) higher property operating income ($1.6 million), partially offset by (b) lower gain on sale of properties ($1.0 million) and (c) higher depreciation and amortization ($0.4 million).\nSame property revenue increased 3.5% and same property operating income increased 2.2% for the 2017 Quarter compared to the 2016 Quarter. Same property operating income equals property revenue minus the sum of (a) property operating expenses, (b) provision for credit losses and (c) real estate taxes. The comparison excludes the results of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods. Shopping Center same property operating income increased 1.6% and Mixed-Use same property operating income increased 4.1%. The increase in Shopping Center same property operating income was primarily the result of higher base rent. The increase in Mixed-Use same property operating income was the result of (a) higher base rent ($0.8 million), partially offset by (b) lower other income ($0.2 million) and (c) higher provision for credit losses ($0.2 million).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 (\"2017 Period\"), total revenue increased to $227.3 million from $217.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (\"2016 Period\"). Operating income was $60.6 million for the 2017 Period compared to $55.7 million for the 2016 Period. Operating income for the 2017 Period increased primarily due to (a) $8.3 million of increased property operating income, partially offset by (b) $1.5 million of higher interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs, (c) $1.3 million of higher depreciation expense and (d) $0.7 million of higher general and administrative expenses.\nNet income available to common stockholders was $35.9 million ($1.63 per diluted share) for the 2017 Period compared to $32.9 million ($1.52 per diluted share) for the 2016 Period. Net income available to common stockholders for the 2017 Period increased primarily due to (a) $8.3 million of increased property operating income, partially offset by (b) $1.5 million of higher interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs, (c) $1.3 million of higher depreciation expense, (d) lower gain on sale of property ($1.0 million), (e) higher noncontrolling interest ($1.0 million) and (f) $0.7 million of higher general and administrative expenses.\nSame property revenue increased 0.9% and same property operating income increased 0.7% for the 2017 Period compared to the 2016 Period. Shopping Center same property operating income increased 2.1% and Mixed-Use same property operating income decreased 4.2%. Shopping Center same property operating income increased $2.6 million primarily due to (a) higher base rent ($1.5 million), exclusive of the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike, (b) the net impact of a 2017 lease termination at Broadlands and a 2016 lease termination at 11503 Rockville Pike ($0.1 million), (c) higher operating expense recoveries, net of expenses ($0.4 million), (d) lower provision for credit losses ($0.3 million) and (e) higher termination fees throughout the portfolio ($0.3 million). Mixed-Use same property operating income decreased $1.5 million primarily due to (a) lower termination fee income ($0.9 million) and (b) lower parking revenue as a result of a garage refurbishment ($0.3 million).\nAs of December 31, 2017, 94.3% of the commercial portfolio was leased (all properties except the apartments at Clarendon Center and Park Van Ness), compared to 95.4% at December 31, 2016. On a same property basis, 94.2% of the portfolio was leased at December 31, 2017, compared to 95.5% at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the apartments at Clarendon Center were 96.7% leased compared to 97.1% leased at December 31, 2016, and the apartments at Park Van Ness were 95.9% leased compared to 72.7% leased at December 31, 2016.\nFunds From Operations (\"FFO\") available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests (after deducting preferred stock dividends and preferred stock redemption charges) increased to $22.7 million ($0.76 per diluted share) in the 2017 Quarter from $21.2 million ($0.73 per diluted share) in the 2016 Quarter. FFO, a widely accepted non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance for REITs, is defined as net income plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding gains and losses from property dispositions, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and extraordinary items. The increase in FFO available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests for the 2017 Quarter was primarily due to higher property operating income ($1.6 million).\nFFO available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests (after deducting preferred stock dividends and preferred stock redemptions) increased 7.1% to $94.0 million ($3.18 per diluted share) in the 2017 Period from $87.7 million ($3.03 per diluted share) in the 2016 Period. FFO available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests for the 2017 Period increased primarily due to (a) higher overall property operating income ($8.3 million), partially offset by (b) higher interest expense and amortization of debt expense ($1.5 million) and (c) higher general and administrative expenses ($0.7 million).\nSaul Centers is a self-managed, self-administered equity REIT headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. Saul Centers currently operates and manages a real estate portfolio comprised of 58 properties which includes (a) 55 community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties with approximately 9.2 million square feet of leasable area and (b) three land and development properties. Over 85% of the Company's property operating income is generated from properties in the metropolitan Washington, DC/Baltimore area.\nSaul Centers, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nAssets\nReal estate investments\nLand\n$\n450,256\n$\n422,546\nBuildings and equipment\n1,261,830\n1,214,697\nConstruction in progress\n91,114\n63,570\n1,803,200\n1,700,813\nAccumulated depreciation\n(488,166)\n(458,279)\n1,315,034\n1,242,534\nCash and cash equivalents\n10,908\n8,322\nAccounts receivable and accrued income, net\n54,057\n52,774\nDeferred leasing costs, net\n27,255\n25,983\nPrepaid expenses, net\n5,248\n5,057\nOther assets\n9,950\n8,355\nTotal assets\n$\n1,422,452\n$\n1,343,025\nLiabilities\nMortgage notes payable\n$\n897,888\n$\n783,400\nRevolving credit facility payable\n60,734\n48,217\nConstruction loan payable\n—\n68,672\nDividends and distributions payable\n18,520\n17,953\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\n23,123\n20,838\nDeferred income\n29,084\n30,696\nTotal liabilities\n1,029,349\n969,776\nEquity\nPreferred stock\n180,000\n180,000\nCommon stock\n221\n217\nAdditional paid-in capital\n352,590\n328,171\nAccumulated deficit and other comprehensive loss\n(198,406)\n(189,883)\nTotal Saul Centers, Inc. equity\n334,405\n318,505\nNoncontrolling interests\n58,698\n54,744\nTotal equity\n393,103\n373,249\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n1,422,452\n$\n1,343,025\nSaul Centers, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands,\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(unaudited)\nRevenue\nBase rent\n$\n45,705\n$\n44,043\n$\n181,141\n$\n172,381\nExpense recoveries\n8,969\n8,258\n35,347\n34,269\nPercentage rent\n490\n363\n1,458\n1,379\nOther\n1,511\n1,537\n9,339\n9,041\nTotal revenue\n56,675\n54,201\n227,285\n217,070\nOperating expenses\nProperty operating expenses\n7,146\n6,787\n27,689\n27,527\nProvision for credit losses\n304\n287\n906\n1,494\nReal estate taxes\n6,873\n6,414\n26,997\n24,680\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred\ndebt costs\n11,640\n11,415\n47,225\n45,683\n of deferred leasing costs\n11,298\n10,939\n45,694\n44,417\nGeneral and administrative\n4,998\n4,996\n18,176\n17,496\nAcquisition related costs\n—\n3\n—\n60\nTotal operating expenses\n42,259\n40,841\n166,687\n161,357\nOperating income\n14,416\n13,360\n60,598\n55,713\nChange in fair value of derivatives\n72\n3\n70\n(6)\nGain on sale of property\n—\n1,013\n—\n1,013\nNet Income\n14,488\n14,376\n60,668\n56,720\nIncome attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(2,928)\n(2,911)\n(12,411)\n(11,441)\nNet income attributable to Saul Centers, Inc.\n11,560\n11,465\n48,257\n45,279\nPreferred stock dividends\n(3,094)\n(3,094)\n(12,375)\n(12,375)\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n8,466\n$\n8,371\n$\n35,882\n$\n32,904\nPer share net income available to common stockholders\nDiluted\n$\n0.38\n$\n0.38\n$\n1.63\n$\n1.52\nWeighted Average Common Stock:\nCommon stock\n22,072\n21,674\n21,901\n21,505\nEffect of dilutive options\n114\n154\n107\n110\nDiluted weighted average common stock\n22,186\n21,828\n22,008\n21,615\nReconciliation of net income to FFO available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests (1)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n14,488\n$\n14,376\n$\n60,668\n$\n56,720\nSubtract:\nGain on sale of property\n—\n(1,013)\n—\n(1,013)\nAdd:\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n11,298\n10,939\n45,694\n44,417\nFFO\n25,786\n24,302\n106,362\n100,124\nSubtract:\nPreferred stock dividends\n(3,094)\n(3,094)\n(12,375)\n(12,375)\nFFO available to common stockholders and noncontrolling\ninterests\n$\n22,692\n$\n21,208\n$\n93,987\n$\n87,749\nWeighted average shares:\nDiluted weighted average common stock\n22,186\n21,828\n22,008\n21,615\nConvertible limited partnership units\n7,536\n7,420\n7,503\n7,375\nAverage shares and units used to compute FFO per share\n29,722\n29,248\n29,511\n28,990\nFFO per share available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests\n$\n0.76\n$\n0.73\n$\n3.18\n$\n3.03\n(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) developed FFO as a relative non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity\nREIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by\nNAREIT as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding extraordinary items, impairment\ncharges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from property dispositions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in\naccordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, which is disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements\nof Cash Flows for the applicable periods. There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of FFO. FFO should not be considered as an\nalternative to net income, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or as an alternative to cash\nflows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers FFO a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the\nassumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time (i.e. depreciation), which is contrary to what the Company believes occurs\nwith its assets, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed\nby other REITs.\nReconciliation of revenue to same property revenue\n(in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal revenue\n$\n56,675\n$\n54,201\n$\n227,285\n$\n217,070\nLess: Interest income\n(49)\n(15)\n(80)\n(52)\nLess: Acquisitions, dispositions and development\nproperties\n(1,175)\n(605)\n(13,746)\n(5,364)\nTotal same property revenue\n$\n55,451\n$\n53,581\n$\n213,459\n$\n211,654\nShopping Centers\n$\n39,824\n$\n38,883\n$\n160,393\n$\n158,044\nMixed-Use properties\n15,627\n14,698\n53,066\n53,610\nTotal same property revenue\n$\n55,451\n$\n53,581\n$\n213,459\n$\n211,654\nReconciliation of net income to same property operating income\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n14,488\n$\n14,376\n$\n60,668\n$\n56,720\nAdd: Interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs\n11,640\n11,415\n47,225\n45,683\nAdd: of deferred leasing costs\n11,298\n10,939\n45,694\n44,417\nAdd: General and administrative\n4,998\n4,996\n18,176\n17,496\nAdd: Acquisition related costs\n—\n3\n—\n60\nAdd: Change in fair value of derivatives\n(72)\n(3)\n(70)\n6\nLess: Gains on property dispositions\n—\n(1,013)\n—\n(1,013)\nLess: Interest income\n(49)\n(15)\n(80)\n(52)\nProperty operating income\n42,303\n40,698\n171,613\n163,317\nLess: Acquisitions, dispositions & development property\n(948)\n(238)\n(8,978)\n(1,760)\nTotal same property operating income\n$\n41,355\n$\n40,460\n$\n162,635\n$\n161,557\nShopping centers\n$\n31,230\n$\n30,737\n$\n127,096\n$\n124,470\nMixed-Use properties\n10,125\n9,723\n35,539\n37,087\nTotal same property operating income\n$\n41,355\n$\n40,460\n$\n162,635\n$\n161,557\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saul-centers-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-earnings-300605317.html\nSOURCE Saul Centers, Inc.",
