The Company generated strong results across a number of measures in the quarter and for the year, including sales volume, income and operating cash flow.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nSales up 24% versus prior year, including 9% volume increase, 3% favorable impact of market-based pricing, and 12% higher raw material pass-through pricing Net Income of $146.7 million, an increase of $112.6 million versus the prior year; 2017 results include an approximately $53 million one-time net tax benefit primarily related to re-measurement of net deferred tax liability at a lower corporate tax rate EBITDA of $200.8 million, an increase of $104.9 million or 109% versus the prior year EBITDA Margin of 13.6%, up 550 bps versus the prior year Cash Flow from Operations of $134.6 million, an increase of $20.9 million versus the prior year Free Cash Flow of $48.2 million, an increase of $18.4 million versus the prior year\nSummary full year 2017 financial results for the Company are below:\nFull Year 2017 Results\n($ in Thousands, Except Earnings Per Share) FY 2017 FY 2016 Sales $1,475,194 $1,191,524 Net Income 146,699 34,147 Earnings Per Share (Diluted) $4.72 $1.12 EBITDA (1) 200,803 95,951 EBITDA Margin % (1) 13.6% 8.1% Cash Flow from Operations 134,607 113,740 Free Cash Flow (1)(2) 48,169 29,731 (1)\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” included in this press release for non-GAAP reconciliations\n(2)\nNet cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures\n“AdvanSix delivered another strong quarter to finish our first full year as a standalone public company. Production output, margin expansion, earnings growth and cash flow generation all improved significantly in 2017, demonstrating the value proposition of our operational excellence and global cost advantage. Ongoing high plant utilization rates and an improved supply and demand environment supported a 9% sales volume increase and EBITDA that more than doubled the prior year's results. We successfully completed our 2017 planned plant turnarounds on time and on budget, and set production records across various unit operations while achieving record safety performance,” said Erin Kane, president and CEO of AdvanSix.\nSummary fourth quarter 2017 financial results for the Company are included below:\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\n($ in Thousands, Except Earnings Per Share) 4Q 2017 4Q 2016 Sales $370,389 $259,323 Net Income 72,366 (24,714) Earnings Per Share (Diluted) $2.31 ($0.81) EBITDA (1) 38,770 (29,586) EBITDA Margin % (1) 10.5% (11.4%) Cash Flow from Operations 36,136 47,273 Free Cash Flow (1)(2) 16,904 20,123 (1)\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” included in this press release for non-GAAP reconciliations\n(2)\nNet cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures\nSales volume in the quarter increased 25% versus the prior year due to continued high utilization rates at our manufacturing sites and the impact of unplanned plant outages in the prior year period. Pricing overall increased 18% versus the prior year, including a 16% favorable impact from raw material pass-through pricing driven by increases in benzene and propylene (inputs to cumene which is a key feedstock to our products) costs. Market-based pricing was favorable by 2% compared to the prior year with improved industry supply and demand dynamics in our nylon, caprolactam, and chemical intermediate product lines.\nSales by product line represented the following approximate percentage of our total sales:\n4Q 2017 4Q 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Nylon 28% 26% 29% 28% Caprolactam 20% 17% 19% 17% Ammonium Sulfate Fertilizers 16% 24% 19% 24% Chemical Intermediates 36% 33% 33% 31% EBITDA of $38.8 million in the quarter increased $68.4 million from prior year loss of $29.6 million. Fourth quarter 2016 results included an unfavorable $44 million pre-tax income impact related to unplanned outages. The remaining approximately $24.4 million EBITDA increase was primarily due to improved production and sales volume, the favorable impact of market-based pricing, and a non-cash LIFO inventory reserve adjustment ($4.4 million favorable pre-tax income impact realized in fourth quarter 2017).\nCash flow from operations of $36.1 million in the quarter decreased $11.1 million versus the prior year as an increase in working capital, primarily related to the fourth quarter 2016 unplanned outages, more than offset higher net income. Capital expenditures of $19.2 million in the quarter decreased $7.9 million versus the prior year.\nThe Company recorded an approximately $53 million one-time net tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") primarily related to re-measurement of the net deferred tax liability at a lower corporate tax rate.\nOutlook\n2017 Tax Act expected to have favorable impact on net income and cash flow - 2018 estimated effective tax rate of approximately 25% Approximately $30 million unfavorable impact to pre-tax income in 1Q 2018 as a result of weather-related temporary production issue at Hopewell, VA facility - at lower end of the previously communicated range Full year 2018 planned plant turnarounds expected to be consistent with historical levels in total ($30 to $35 million pre-tax income impact) 2018 global nylon and chemical intermediates industry conditions expected to be similar to 2017; Remain cautious on agriculture fundamentals through 2018 spring planting season Capital Expenditures expected to be $110 to $120 million for the full year 2018, including $20 to $30 million incremental investments in high-return growth and cost savings projects On February 21, 2018, the Company entered into an amended credit facility with an all-revolver structure at lower borrowing costs reflecting more favorable credit market conditions\n“The weather-related temporary production issues that we faced in early 2018 were resolved as expected, and we continue to drive robust operational performance across our organization. We are investing in high-return growth and cost savings projects, optimizing production output, maximizing higher value product mix and benefiting from the passage of tax reform. We have built a solid foundation for ongoing value creation; 2017 was a terrific year and we remain confident that AdvanSix is well positioned over the long term,” added Kane.\nConference Call Information\nAdvanSix will discuss its results during its investor conference call today starting at 9:00 a.m. ET.
