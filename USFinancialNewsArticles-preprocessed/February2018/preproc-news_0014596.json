    "text": "Houston, TX, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nHalcón Resources Corporation (NYSE: HK) (“Halcón” or the “Company”) today announced that it has priced an additional $200 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “Additional Senior Notes”) in a private offering at an issue price of 103% of par and a yield to worst of 6.046%. The Additional Senior Notes are being offered as additional notes to the 6.75% senior notes due 2025 that the Company sold in a private placement that settled on February 16, 2017 (the “Existing Senior Notes”), of which approximately $425 million is currently outstanding. The Additional Senior Notes and the Existing Senior Notes will be treated as a single class of debt securities and will have identical terms, other than the issue date and issue price, except that the Additional Senior Notes will initially be subject to restrictions on transfer under applicable securities laws.\nHalcón intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and to fund a portion of the acquisition purchase price for its recently announced acquisitions of Southern Delaware Basin assets (the “Acquisition”). The offering is not conditioned upon the closing of the Acquisition.\nThe Additional Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by each of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s senior secured revolving credit facility. The securities were offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A and to certain persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S, each under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company expects to close the offering on or about February 15, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe securities offered by Halcón in the private placement have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities.\nAbout Halcón Resources\nHalcón Resources Corporation is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, production, exploration and development of onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release may contain within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
