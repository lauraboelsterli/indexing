    "text": "SAN RAMON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Five9, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVN), a leading provider of cloud software for the enterprise contact center market, announced today that CRN ® , a brand of The Channel Company , has named Wendell Black, vice president of global channel and international business, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation.\nSince joining Five9 in October 2015, Black has led the Five9 channel team to accelerate partner-related business year over year. Since Black’s Channel Chief award in 2017, his role has expanded to include the Five9 global partner network to support business growth.\n“One of the biggest drivers aiding our expansion is the disruption in the historical partner relationships from companies in bankruptcy or acquisition transitions,” says Wendell Black, vice president global channel and international business, Five9. “These risks have motivated the partner community to build new relationships with proven technology providers like Five9. Coupled with this is the desire of end users to move to the cloud and adopt CCaaS options. The migration from CPE to cloud is therefore fueling partner’s interest in the solutions Five9 provides to meet end user objectives.”\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nAbout Five9\nFive9 is a leading provider of cloud software for the enterprise contact center market, bringing the power of the cloud to thousands of customers and facilitating more than three billion customer interactions annually.
