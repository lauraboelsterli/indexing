    "text": "MILAN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Italian eyewear group Safilo said on Tuesday it would ask its board at a March 13 meeting to approve booking a goodwill impairment of between 190-200 million euros into last year’s accounts.\nThe move comes after Safilo said earlier this month it was replacing Chief Executive Luisa Delgado with Angelo Trocchia, a former Unilever executive.\nSafilo warned in January its 2017 adjusted core profit would halve from a year earlier after fourth-quarter sales dropped more than expected as the loss of its Gucci licence continued to bite and an IT-related disruption hurt deliveries.\nSafilo, the world’s second biggest eyewear manufacture behind domestic rival Luxottica, is suffering following Gucci-owner Kering’s decision to turn a 350 million euro licence accord into a four-year production deal as it set up its own spectacles business.
