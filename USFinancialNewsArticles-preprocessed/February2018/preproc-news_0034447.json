    "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine Airlines is looking at adding the largest version of Airbus’s A350 series to its fleet, the flag carrier’s president said on Thursday.\nThe Southeast Asian nation’s first airline is undergoing a $2 billion expansion program to make its fleet one of the youngest in Asia.\n“It is one airplane we can consider. It is a bigger version of the A350-900,” Jaime Bautista, president of the airline’s operator, PAL Holdings Inc, told reporters before an A350-1000 test flight in the capital Manila.\nThere is commonality in spare parts between the A350-900 and the A350-1000 and Philippine Airlines’ pilots can fly both aircraft, Bautista added.\nIn 2016, Philippine Airlines ordered six wide-body A350-900 jets worth about $1.8 billion at list prices to help the company expand its lucrative international network. The flag carrier expects to take delivery of 15 planes this year, including four Airbus A350s.\nThe A350-1000 is the largest version of the A350 series, and was launched to compete against Boeing’s 777s in the up to 400-seat market. Airbus will deliver this month the first A350-1000 jet to an airline, Qatar Airways.\nPhilippine Airlines expects to carry about 16.5 million passengers this year, up from last year’s total of almost 15 million.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
