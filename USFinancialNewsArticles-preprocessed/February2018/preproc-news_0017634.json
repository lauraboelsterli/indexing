    "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alico, Inc. (“Alico” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ALCO) today announces financial results for the first quarter ended December 31, 2017. For the quarter ended, the Company recorded net income of $8.7 million and earnings of $1.05 per diluted common share, compared to a net loss of $1.7 million and a loss of $0.21 per diluted common share in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily resulted from a deferred tax benefit of $11.3 million recorded to adjust the Company's net deferred tax liabilities to the recently enacted 21% federal corporate tax rate. When both periods are adjusted for non-recurring items related to transaction costs, consulting fees, gains on sale of real estate and property and equipment, net deferred tax and other asset valuation adjustments and employee stock compensation expense, the Company incurred a loss of $0.42 per diluted common share in the first quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a loss of $0.22 per diluted common share in first quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nThese results reflect the seasonal nature of the Company’s business. The majority of our citrus crop is harvested in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year; consequently, most of the Company's profit and cash flows from operating activities is typically recognized in those quarters and our working capital requirements are greater in the first and fourth quarters.\nThe Company reported the following financial results:\n(in thousands except for per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Change Net income (loss) $ 8,738 $ (1,743 ) $ 10,481 NM EBITDA (1) $ 2,074 $ 3,235 $ (1,161 ) (35.9 )% Earnings (loss) per diluted common share (1) $ 1.05 $ (0.21 ) $ 1.26 NM Net cash used in operating activities $ (9,689 ) $ (17,437 ) $ 7,748 (44.4 )% (1) See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this earnings release for details regarding these measures.\nNM = Not Meaningful\nOn November 16, 2017, Alico announced the Alico 2.0 Modernization Program. The program is focused on aggressively improving the operations of the Company and optimizing its return on capital employed through cost reductions, increased efficiencies and disposition of non-performing assets. Every aspect of Alico’s citrus and ranch operations, all back office support activities, and the productivity of all assets were analyzed to determine how to eliminate costs that will not negatively affect citrus production and also to improve performance throughout the Company. The changes required to realize those improvements have now been implemented.\nAlico Citrus Division Results\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Alico Citrus’s Early and Mid-season boxes processed increased by 18.0%, and pound solids increased by 11.6% as a result of harvesting beginning approximately one month earlier than in the prior year due to Hurricane Irma. Harvesting will be completed earlier this season for the Early and Mid-season crop, and we anticipate operating revenues to be less in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nAs previously announced, Alico continues to estimate its total number of boxes harvested per acre for fiscal year 2018 will decrease by approximately 40-45%. We expect operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 will remain consistent with fiscal year 2017 on a per acre basis, and the benefits of Alico 2.0 will be realized in fiscal year 2019 because our growing costs incurred in fiscal 2018 are capitalized then expensed in the following crop season when fruit is harvested and sold.\nCitrus production for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized in the following table.\n(boxes and pound solids in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Change 2017 2016 Unit % Boxes Harvested: Early and Mid-Season 1,214 1,029 185 18.0 % Total Processed 1,214 1,029 185 18.0 % Fresh Fruit 73 129 (56 ) (43.4 )% Total 1,287 1,158 129 11.1 % Pound Solids Produced: Early and Mid-Season 6,069 5,440 629 11.6 % Total 6,069 5,440 629 11.6 % Average Pound Solids Per Box 5.00 5.29 (0.29 ) (5.5 )% Price per Pound Solids: Early and Mid-Season $ 2.54 $ 2.51 $ 0.03 1.2 % Alico Citrus cost of sales increased to $11.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily relates to the timing of the harvesting of the Early and Mid-Season fruit, as well as costs incurred for clean up and repairs as a result of Hurricane Irma.\nConservation and Environmental Resources Division Results\nThe operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were consistent with those from the three months ended December 31, 2016, as a minimal loss was recognized in both periods.\nIn January 2018, the Company sold its breeding herd and leased grazing rights on the Alico Ranch to a third party operator, 5F Cattle LLC. The Company continues to own the property and conduct its long-term water dispersement program and wildlife management programs.\nOther Corporate Financial Information\nGeneral and Administrative expenses increased by $0.1 million to $3.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase primarily related to separation expenses, accruals for paid time-off, and audit and tax fees. In the first quarter of December 2016, there were significant G&A expenses related to consulting services.\nOther expense, net was $0.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease of $1.6 million is primarily attributable to a $1.3 million increase in gain on sale of real estate and property and equipment.\nThe Company paid a first quarter cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its outstanding common stock on January 16, 2018 to shareholders of record at December 29, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017 the Company had working capital of $54.0 million and had net term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, of $184.4 million.\nAbout Alico\nAlico, Inc. is a holding company with assets and related operations in agriculture and environmental resources, including citrus, wildlife management, and water management.

Due to significant depreciable assets associated with the nature of our operations and, to a lesser extent, interest costs associated with our capital structure, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Common Share, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are important measures to evaluate our results of operations between periods on a more comparable basis and to help investors analyze underlying trends in our business, evaluate the performance of our business both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and the broader market, provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and operational strength of our business and helps investors evaluate our ability to service our debt. Such measurements are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP information provided is unique to Alico and may not be consistent with methodologies used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) before interest expense, benefit for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization adjusted for non-recurring transactions or transactions that are not indicative of our core operating results, such as gains or losses on sales of real estate and property and equipment. Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Common Share is defined as earnings adjusted for non-recurring transactions divided by diluted common shares. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as cash used in operating activities adjusted for non-recurring transactions less capital expenditures. The Company uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow to evaluate its business and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company's liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, and pay dividends to common stockholders. The Company’s definition of Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary spending.\nSource:Alico, Inc.",
