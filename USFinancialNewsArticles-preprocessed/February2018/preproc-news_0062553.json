At the close of 2017 GICSA had a total of 73 million of visitors in the shopping malls of the stabilized properties, an increase of 6.37% compared to 4Q16.\nFinancial\nNet operating income (NOI) of the stabilized and under development portfolio reached Ps. 2,961 million, an increase of 4.09% compared to 2016.

Consolidated debt in 2017 was Ps. 22,152 million; while GICSA’s proportional debt was Ps. 16,939 million. During the preparation of the 2017 financial information, the Company identified the need to reclassify certain line items under Non-Current Assets. These do not affect results for the period, nor stockholders’ equity nor Total Current Assets and Non-Current Assets previously reported during the first, second, and third quarter of 2017 and for the full year period ended December 31, 2016. This situation has been discussed with the Audit Committee and with our external auditors. For more information, please see the financial statements section of this report.\nPipeline\nAs of December 31, 2017, the commercialization of properties under development reached an advance of 285,387 square meters of GLA under contract. This represents 53.26% of the total space comprising projects in construction, an increase of 426 basis points compared to 4Q16. During 4Q17, we began the delivery of spaces at Interlomas expansion, La Isla Merida and Paseo Queretaro.\nCorporate\nRecently, GICSA received the Socially Responsible Company (ESR) certification, which accredits us as an organization voluntarily and publicly committed with a management that is socially responsible and of continuous improvement, as part of our culture and business strategy. On February 26, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the direct and independent development of project Cero5Cien, without detracting the focus away from our core business, particularly in the mixed-use segments, shopping centers and corporate office spaces. We believe that this project will not require additional CAPEX as it is funded from pre-sales. As of December 31, 2017, 38 units had been sold.\n***\nFor a full version of GICSA’s Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release, please visit: http://www.gicsa.com.mx/inversionistas?id=1\nConference Call\nGICSA cordially invites you to its Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call\nWednesday, February 28, 2018\n11:00 AM Eastern Time 10:00 AM Mexico City Time Presenting for GICSA:\nMr. Diódoro Batalla, Chief Financial Officer Mr. Rodrigo Assam Bejos – Financial Planning and Investor Relations Officer To access the call, please dial:\n1 (877) 888 4291 U.S. participants 1 (785) 424 1878 International participants Passcode: 44272\nAbout the Company\nGICSA is a leading company in the development, investment, commercialization and operation of shopping malls, corporate offices and industrial warehouses well known for their high quality standards, which transform and create new development spaces, lifestyles and employment in Mexico, in accordance to its history and executed projects.
