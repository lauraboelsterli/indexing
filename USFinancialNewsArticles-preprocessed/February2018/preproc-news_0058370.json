    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, February 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nAbattis Bioceuticals Corp. (the \" Company \" or \" Abattis \") (CSE: ATT) (CSE: ATT.CN) (OTC: ATTBF) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement (the \" Definitive Agreement \") to acquire (the \" Acquisition \") a 90% ownership interest in Gabriola Green Farms Inc. (\" Gabriola \").\nGabriola is a privately held British Columbia company that has applied for a license to produce (an \" LP \") under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (the \" ACMPR \") on Gabriola Island, one of the gulf islands located in the Strait of Georgia off the coast of British Columbia. Gabriola Island has a consistent temperature and humidity level, which makes it well suited to greenhouse growing.\n\"This is one of the most significant steps our Company has taken towards becoming a full service cannabis company,\" stated Rob Abenante, Abattis President and CEO. \"After successfully obtaining a license through Gabriola, we intend to not only cultivate marijuana, but more importantly sell extracted cannabis products, which will complete our full downstream service offerings.\"\nThe Definitive Agreement comes following a series of rapid acquisitions, capital raises, investments and joint-ventures for the Company, which include the acquisition of a cash flowing vaporizer company, investment into a cutting-edge Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and several collaborations with respected organizations, including the University of British Columbia.\nPursuant to the Definitive Agreement, in exchange for a 90% ownership interest in Gabriola, Abattis will issue an aggregate of 59,760,956 common shares of the Company (each, a \" Share \"), at a deemed price of $0.3765 per share, and pay an aggregate of $2.5 million in cash to the shareholders of Gabriola, with the exception of CannaNUMUS Blockchain Inc. (\" CannaNUMUS \"), a company in which Abattis owns a 49% stake, which will retain its 10% ownership stake in Gabriola. In addition, Abattis will make milestone-based payments (the \" Milestone Payments \") to such shareholders of Gabriola of (i) $5 million upon Gabriola's receipt of a cultivation license under the ACMPR and (ii) $5 million upon Gabriola's receipt of a sales license under the ACMPR. The Milestone Payments will be satisfied through the issuance of shares. Closing of the acquisition is subject to, among other things, completion of due diligence by Abattis and the receipt of any required consents, including that of the Canadian Securities Exchange.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, Abattis has also secured (i) a right of first refusal on the remaining 10% ownership interest in Gabriola from CannaNUMUS and (ii) an option to acquire the lands on which Gabriola's operations are conducted for $7 million until February 27, 2023 from an unrelated third-party.\n\"Our acquisition of Gabriola will round out our product offerings and complement our existing offerings in the cannabis products, technologies and services space. With its production facility located on ideal Gabriola Island, Gabriola has the potential to become a significant producer upon receipt of an LP,\" stated Rob Abenante. \"With our powerful cash position and liquidity, as well as our experience across various domains in the cannabis space, we are well positioned to support Gabriola's expansion\".\nAbout Abattis Bioceuticals Corp.\nAbattis is a life sciences and biotechnology company which aggregates, integrates, and invests in cannabis technologies and biotechnology services for the legal cannabis industry developing in Canada.

Forward-looking statements in this press release include statements regarding: the Acquisition, including the consideration payable thereunder; Gabriola's application for an LP; Abattis's intention, upon Gabriola's receipt of an LP, to not only cultivate marijuana, but also sell extracted cannabis products, and that such activities will complete Abattis's full downstream service offerings; the Acquisition rounding out Abattis's product offerings and complementing its existing offerings across the cannabis technologies and services space; that Gabriola has the potential to become a significant producer upon receipt of an LP; and the fact that, with its powerful cash position and liquidity, as well as its experience across various domains in the cannabis space, Abattis is well positioned to support Gabriola's expansion. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.
