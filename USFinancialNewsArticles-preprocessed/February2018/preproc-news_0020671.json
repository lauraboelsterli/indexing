    "text": "AKRON, Ohio, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ: GT) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2017.\n\"Our fourth-quarter results were highlighted by our performance in the 17-inch-and-larger segment in consumer replacement, which delivered nearly double the industry growth in the U.S. and Europe,\" said Richard J. Kramer, chairman, chief executive officer and president. \"Our strong volume recovery in the quarter gives us positive momentum as we head into 2018.\"\n\"These results reflect the power of the Goodyear brand across all of our regions,\" Kramer added. \"Our strong global brand is integral to Goodyear's connected business model which combines innovation and technology leadership, industry-leading products, aligned wholesale and retail distribution and provides us with a competitive advantage.\"\n\"Looking ahead to 2020, I am very confident in our capability to execute our long-term strategy to capture profitable growth in key market segments and deliver significant growth in earnings,\" he added.\nGoodyear's fourth quarter 2017 sales were $4.1 billion, up 9 percent from $3.7 billion a year ago, driven by improved price/mix, favorable currency translation and volume. Excluding currency translation, global revenue per tire increased 5 percent.\nTire unit volumes totaled 42 million, up 2 percent from 2016. Replacement tire shipments were up 3 percent. Original equipment unit volume was down 1 percent.\nGoodyear reported a net loss of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (39 cents per share) compared to net income of $561 million ($2.14 per share) in the year-ago quarter, that was driven by a $299 million one-time, non-cash tax charge related to U.S. tax reform. In addition, the company recognized discrete tax benefits of $331 million in 2016 primarily due to the release of foreign valuation allowances. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share was 99 cents, compared to 95 cents in 2016. Per share amounts are diluted.\nThe company reported fourth quarter segment operating income of $419 million in 2017, down from $479 million a year ago. The decrease reflects higher raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of lower production on cost, which were partially offset by improved price/mix, net cost savings and higher volume.\nFull-Year Results\nGoodyear's 2017 sales were $15.4 billion, up 1 percent from 2016, reflecting an increase in price/mix, favorable foreign currency translation and higher sales in other tire-related businesses, which were partially offset by lower volume.\nTire unit volumes totaled 159.2 million, down 4 percent from 2016. Replacement tire shipments were down 3 percent. Original equipment unit volume was down 6 percent.\nGoodyear's 2017 net income of $346 million ($1.37 per share) is down from $1,264 million ($4.74 per share) in 2016. The decrease was driven by increased income tax expense, which was primarily due to the recognition of a one-time, non-cash tax charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017, and lower segment operating income. In addition, the company recognized discrete tax benefits in 2016, primarily due to the release of foreign valuation allowances. Full-year adjusted earnings per share for 2017 was $3.12, compared to $4.00 a year ago.\nThe company reported 2017 segment operating income of $1,522 million in 2017, down 23 percent from $1,985 million a year ago. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased raw material costs and the effect of lower volume, which were partially offset by price/mix improvements.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSee the note at the end of this release for further explanation and reconciliation tables for Segment Operating Income and Margin; Adjusted Net Income; and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, reflecting the impact of certain significant items on the 2017 and 2016 periods.\nBusiness Segment Results\nAmericas\nFourth Quarter\nTwelve Months\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTire Units\n19.5\n18.7\n70.9\n74.1\nSales\n$ 2,184\n$ 2,061\n$ 8,212\n$ 8,172\nSegment Operating Income\n209\n295\n825\n1,151\nSegment Operating Margin\n9.6%\n14.3%\n10.0%\n14.1%\nAmericas' fourth quarter 2017 sales increased 6 percent from last year to $2.2 billion. Sales reflect a 4 percent increase in tire unit volume and favorable price/mix. Replacement tire shipments were up 5 percent, driven by an increase of 8 percent in U.S. consumer replacement. Original equipment unit volume was flat.\nFourth quarter 2017 segment operating income of $209 million was down 29 percent from the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher raw material costs and increased costs due to lower production, which were partially offset by improved price/mix and higher volume.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nFourth Quarter\nTwelve Months\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTire Units\n13.7\n14.1\n57.1\n61.1\nSales\n$ 1,264\n$ 1,132\n$ 4,928\n$ 4,880\nSegment Operating Income\n93\n81\n355\n461\nSegment Operating Margin\n7.4%\n7.2%\n7.2%\n9.4%\nEurope, Middle East and Africa's fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion were up 12 percent from the prior year, which was driven by foreign currency translation and improved price/mix. Replacement tire shipments were up 2 percent. OE tire volume decreased 12 percent.\nFourth quarter 2017 segment operating income of $93 million was 15 percent above the prior year. The increase was driven by improved price/mix and cost savings actions, which were partially offset by increased raw material costs.\nAsia Pacific\nFourth Quarter\nTwelve Months\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTire Units\n8.8\n8.4\n31.2\n30.9\nSales\n$ 623\n$ 548\n$ 2,237\n$ 2,106\nSegment Operating Income\n117\n103\n342\n373\nSegment Operating Margin\n18.8%\n18.8%\n15.3%\n17.7%\nAsia Pacific's fourth quarter 2017 sales increased 14 percent from last year to $623 million, reflecting improved price/mix and higher volume. Tire unit volumes were a record for any quarter and up 5 percent. Replacement tire shipments were flat. Original equipment unit volume was up 12 percent.\nFourth quarter 2017 segment operating income of $117 million was up 14 percent from last year and a record for any quarter, driven by improved price/mix and volume, and partially offset by increased raw material costs.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIncome tax expense in 2017 was $513 million on income before income taxes of $878 million. In 2017, tax expense included a $299 million one-time, non-cash charge primarily driven by the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets to the lower tax rate effective under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Given its significant deferred tax assets, the company had not expected to pay cash taxes in the U.S. through 2020. With the change in the corporate tax rate, this time period extends through 2025.\nFinancial Targets\nThe company expects its full-year 2018 segment operating income to be between $1.8 and $1.9 billion. The company also has updated its 2020 segment operating income target and capital allocation plan:\nSegment operating income target in 2020 of $2.0 to $2.4 billion. The company's capital allocation plan includes growth capital, restructuring, debt/pension payments and a shareholder return program.\nSee the note at the end of this release for further explanation of forward-looking total segment operating income.\nShareholder Return Program\nThe company paid a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share of common stock on December 1, 2017. The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share payable March 1, 2018, to shareholders of record on February 1, 2018.\nAs a part of its previously announced $2.1 billion share repurchase program, the company repurchased 6.3 million shares of its common stock for $195 million during the fourth quarter. For the full year, the company repurchased 12.8 million shares for $400 million.\nSince 2013, purchases under the program total 44 million shares for $1.3 billion. There is $0.8 billion remaining under the outstanding authorization through 2019.\nConference Call\nGoodyear will hold an investor conference call at 8:30 a.m. today.

Total Segment Operating Margin is Total Segment Operating Income divided by Net Sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Total Segment Operating Income and Margin are useful because they represent the aggregate value of income created by the company's SBUs and exclude items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes.\nThe most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Total Segment Operating Income is Goodyear Net Income and to Total Segment Operating Margin is Goodyear Net Income as a percent of Sales (which is calculated by dividing Goodyear Net Income by Net Sales).\nAdjusted Net Income is Goodyear Net Income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP adjusted for certain significant items. Adjusted Diluted EPS is the company's Adjusted Net Income divided by Weighted Average Shares Outstanding-Diluted as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are useful because they represent how management reviews the operating results of the company excluding the impacts of rationalizations, asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation, asset sales and certain other significant items.\nIt should be noted that other companies may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently and, as a result, the measures presented herein may not be comparable to such similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, Total Segment Operating Income, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, Goodyear Net Income, because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of Goodyear Net Income without unreasonable effort. Goodyear Net Income includes several significant items that are not included in Total Segment Operating Income, such as rationalization charges, other (income) expense, pension curtailments and settlements, and income taxes. The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of these and other similar non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the company's business, acquisitions and dispositions, foreign currency exchange gains and losses, financing fees, actions taken to manage the company's pension liabilities, and the recording or release of tax valuation allowances, are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to that unpredictability and the related difficulty in assessing the potential financial impact of the non-GAAP adjustments. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to the company's future financial results.\nSee the tables below for reconciliations of historical Total Segment Operating Income and Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Reconciliation Table\nThree Months\nEnded\nTwelve Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal Segment Operating Income\n$419\n$479\n$1,522\n$1,985\nRationalizations\n33\n16\n135\n210\nInterest Expense\n75\n87\n335\n372\nOther (Income) Expense\n(1)\n(13)\n8\n(10)\nAsset Write-offs and Accelerated Depreciation\n1\n10\n40\n20\nCorporate Incentive Compensation Plans\n6\n16\n33\n76\nPension Curtailments/Settlements\n6\n2\n19\n16\nIntercompany Profit Elimination\n(14)\n(5)\n2\n2\nRetained Expenses of Divested Operations\n4\n6\n13\n18\nOther\n22\n31\n59\n74\nIncome before Income Taxes\n$287\n$329\n$878\n$1,207\nUnited States and Foreign Taxes Expense (Benefit)\n377\n(238)\n513\n(77)\nLess: Minority Shareholders Net Income\n6\n6\n19\n20\nGoodyear Net Income (Loss)\n$(96)\n$561\n$346\n$1,264\nSales\n$4,071\n$3,741\n$15,377\n$15,158\nGoodyear Net Income (Loss) as a Percent of Sales\n(2.4)%\n15.0%\n2.3%\n8.3%\nTotal Segment Operating Margin\n10.3%\n12.8%\n9.9%\n13.1%\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share Reconciliation Table\nFourth Quarter 2017\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nTaxes\nMinority\nInterest\nGoodyear\nNet Income\n(Loss)\nWeighted\nAverage Shares\nOutstanding-\nDiluted *\nDiluted EPS\n(In millions, except EPS)\nAs Reported\n$287\n$377\n$ 6\n$ (96)\n244\n$ (0.39)\nSignificant Items:\nDiscrete Tax Items\n(315)\n315\n1.28\nRationalizations, Asset Write-offs,\nand Accelerated Depreciation\nCharges\n34\n11\n23\n0.09\nPension Settlements\n6\n3\n3\n0.01\n40\n(301)\n341\n$ 1.38\nAs Adjusted\n$327\n$ 76\n$ 6\n$ 245\n248\n$ 0.99\nFourth Quarter 2016\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nTaxes\nMinority\nInterest\nGoodyear\nNet Income\nWeighted\nAverage Shares\nOutstanding-\nDiluted\nDiluted EPS\n(In millions, except EPS)\nAs Reported\n$ 329\n$ (238)\n$ 6\n$561\n262\n$ 2.14\nSignificant Items:\nRationalizations, Asset Write-offs,\nand Accelerated Depreciation\nCharges\n26\n2\n1\n23\n0.09\nLegal Claims Unrelated to Operations\n10\n4\n6\n0.02\nPension Settlements\n3\n3\n0.01\nDiscrete Tax Items\n331\n1\n(332)\n(1.26)\nInsurance Recoveries – Discontinued\nProducts\n(17)\n(7)\n(10)\n(0.04)\nNet Gains on Asset Sales\n(3)\n(1)\n(2)\n(0.01)\n19\n329\n2\n(312)\n$ (1.19)\nAs Adjusted\n$ 348\n$ 91\n$ 8\n$ 249\n262\n$ 0.95\n* Weighted Average Shares Outstanding – Diluted for the calculation of as-reported diluted EPS excludes 4 million weighted average shares outstanding for stock options and other securities that were anti-dilutive.\nFull-Year 2017\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nTaxes\nMinority\nInterest\nGoodyear\nNet Income\nWeighted\nAverage Shares\nOutstanding-\nDiluted\nDiluted EPS\n(In millions, except EPS)\nAs Reported\n$ 878\n$ 513\n$ 19\n$346\n253\n$ 1.37\nSignificant Items:\nDiscrete Tax Items\n(2)\n(294)\n292\n1.14\nRationalizations, Asset Write-offs,\nand Accelerated Depreciation\nCharges\n175\n53\n1\n121\n0.48\nDebt Redemption Charges\n31\n12\n19\n0.08\nHurricane Effect\n18\n2\n16\n0.06\nPension Settlements\n19\n7\n12\n0.05\nNet Gains on Asset Sales\n(14)\n(1)\n(13)\n(0.05)\nInsurance Recoveries – Discontinued\nProducts\n(5)\n(2)\n(3)\n(0.01)\n222\n(223)\n1\n444\n$ 1.75\nAs Adjusted\n$1,100\n$ 290\n$ 20\n$790\n253\n$ 3.12\nFull-Year 2016\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nTaxes\nMinority\nInterest\nGoodyear\nNet Income\nWeighted\nAverage Shares\nOutstanding-\nDiluted\nDiluted EPS\n(In millions, except EPS)\nAs Reported\n$ 1,207\n$ (77)\n$ 20\n$1,264\n266\n$ 4.74\nSignificant Items:\nRationalizations, Asset Write-offs,\nand Accelerated Depreciation\nCharges\n230\n11\n1\n218\n0.82\nDebt Redemption Charges\n65\n20\n45\n0.17\nAmericas Intracompany Profit\nElimination Adjustment\n24\n9\n15\n0.06\nPension Settlements\n17\n17\n0.06\nLegal Claims Unrelated to Operations\n10\n4\n6\n0.02\nDiscrete Tax Items\n2\n458\n2\n(458)\n(1.71)\nNet Gains on Asset Sales\n(31)\n(5)\n(26)\n(0.10)\nInsurance Recoveries – Discontinued\nProducts\n(24)\n(9)\n(15)\n(0.06)\n293\n488\n3\n(198)\n$ (0.74)\nAs Adjusted\n$ 1,500\n$ 411\n$ 23\n$1,066\n266\n$ 4.00\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goodyear-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2017-results-company-outlines-financial-targets-capital-allocation-plan-300595414.html\nSOURCE The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company",
