Huron provides full year 2018 earnings guidance, including revenue expectations in a range of $720.0 million to $760.0 million.\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global professional services firm Huron (NASDAQ: HURN) today announced financial results from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\n“Our fourth quarter results were slightly below our expectations, with mixed results across segments. We have made significant progress in the operational turnaround of our Healthcare business, growing segment revenues 20% sequentially in the fourth quarter,” said James H. Roth , chief executive officer and president of Huron . “The Education segment performed well throughout the year and finished the fourth quarter consistent with our expectations. The Business Advisory segment had a softer fourth quarter, but we believe they are positioned for growth in 2018.”\n“While we are encouraged by the strengthening in demand in the healthcare market in the fourth quarter, we remain cautious about predicting our performance in 2018. Nevertheless, I am confident in our strategic direction and believe we have repositioned our company to return to sustainable organic growth in the years ahead,” added Roth .\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nRevenues increased 4.4% to $185.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $178.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 revenues included $9.8 million from Huron's 2017 acquisitions of Innosight Holdings, LLC (Innosight) and Pope Woodhead and Associates Limited (Pope Woodhead). Fourth quarter 2017 revenues also included revenues from Huron's 2017 acquisition of the international assets of ADI Strategies, which has since been fully integrated into the Business Advisory segment.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $29.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income from continuing operations of $4.2 million for the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2017 results reflect a non-cash pretax charge of $45.0 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the company's Business Advisory segment. The impairment charge is non-cash in nature and does not affect the company's liquidity or debt covenants. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $1.36 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.19 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") (6) was $14.6 million, compared to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $20.7 million in the same period last year.\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Amortization of intangible assets $ 8,595 $ 8,739 Restructuring charges $ 951 $ 5,463 Other losses (gains), net $ 1,333 $ (2,484 ) Goodwill impairment charges $ 43,493 $ — Non-cash interest on convertible notes $ 1,998 $ 1,906 Other non-operating expense $ 235 $ — Foreign currency transaction losses $ 15 $ 259 Tax effect $ (21,195\n) $ (5,354 ) Tax expense related to the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 $ 8,762\n$ — Tax benefit related to \"check-the-box\" election $ 20 $ — The company has excluded the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, to permit comparability with prior periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA (6) was $31.5 million, or 16.9% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.9 million, or 13.4% of revenues, in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations (6) was $14.9 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, 2016.\nThe average number of full-time billable consultants (2) increased 7.1% to 2,140 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 1,998 in the same quarter last year.

Revenues for full year 2017 also included a full period impact of Huron's acquisition of the U.S. assets of ADI Strategies and revenues from the acquisition of the international assets of ADI Strategies. These acquisitions were completed in May 2016 and Apr. 2017, respectively, and have been fully integrated into the Business Advisory segment.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $170.5 million for full year 2017 compared to net income from continuing operations of $39.5 million for full year 2016. Results for full year 2017 reflect non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charges of $253.1 million related to the company's Healthcare and Business Advisory segments. The impairment charges are non-cash in nature and do not affect the company's liquidity or debt covenants. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $7.95 for the full year 2017, compared to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.84 for full year 2016.\nLoss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (6) for the full year 2017 was $154.7 million, compared to EBITDA of $122.1 million for full year 2016.\nIn addition to using EBITDA to evaluate the company’s financial performance, management uses other non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of the following items (in thousands):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Amortization of intangible assets $ 35,027 $ 33,108 Restructuring charges $ 6,246 $ 9,592 Other losses (gains), net $ 1,111 $ (1,990 ) Goodwill impairment charges $ 253,093 $ — Non-cash interest on convertible notes $ 7,851 $ 7,488 Other non-operating expense (income) $ (696 ) $ — Foreign currency transaction gains, net $ (434 ) $ (11 ) Tax effect $ (91,557\n) $ (18,942 ) Tax expense related to the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 $ 8,762\n$ — Tax benefit related to \"check-the-box\" election $ (2,728 ) $ — The company has excluded the effect of a $2.7 million tax benefit, recorded in the third quarter of 2017, from recognizing a previously unrecognized tax benefit from a \"check-the-box\" election made in 2014 to treat one of the company's wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe company has also excluded the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, to permit comparability with prior periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA (6) was $104.6 million, or 14.3% of revenues, for the full year of 2017, compared to $129.7 million, or 17.9% of revenues, for the full year 2016. Adjusted net income from continuing operations (6) was $46.6 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, for the full year 2017, compared to $68.7 million, or $3.21 per diluted share, for the full year 2016.\nThe average number of full-time billable consultants (2) increased 6.5% to 2,045 for the full year 2017 compared to 1,921 in the same period last year. Full-time billable consultant utilization rate (3) was 74.5% for the full year 2017 compared to 74.6% during the same period last year. Average billing rate per hour for full-time billable consultants (4) was $203 for the full year 2017 compared to $212 for the full year 2016. The average number of full-time equivalent professionals (5) was 268 for full year 2017 compared to 261 for the full year 2016.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nHuron’s results reflect a portfolio of service offerings focused on helping clients address complex business challenges.\nThe company’s full year 2017 revenues by operating segment as a percentage of total company revenues are as follows: Healthcare (49%); Education (23%); and Business Advisory (28%). Financial results by segment are included in the attached schedules and in Huron's forthcoming Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\nOUTLOOK FOR 2018 (8)\nBased on currently available information, the company provided guidance for full year 2018 of revenues before reimbursable expenses in a range of $720.0 million to $760.0 million. The company anticipates net income in a range of $23.0 million to $29.5 million, and both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $86.5 million to $98.5 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected in a range of $1.05 to $1.35, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected in a range of $2.10 to $2.40.\nManagement will provide a more detailed discussion of its outlook during the company’s earnings conference call webcast.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 WEBCAST\nThe company will host a webcast to discuss its financial results today, Feb. 27, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (4:00 p.m. Central Time). The conference call is being webcast by NASDAQ and can be accessed at Huron's website at http://ir.huronconsultinggroup.com . A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the webcast and for 90 days thereafter.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (6)\nIn evaluating the company’s financial performance and outlook, management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations, and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, which are non-GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing their business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nABOUT HURON\nHuron is a global professional services firm committed to achieving sustainable results in partnership with its clients.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to gain an understanding of the company's comparative operating performance (when comparing such results with previous periods or forecasts). These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management in their financial and operating decision making because management believes they reflect the company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures when publicly providing the company's business outlook, for internal management purposes, and as a basis for evaluating potential acquisitions and dispositions. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Huron’s current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose, and in comparing in a consistent manner Huron’s current financial results with Huron’s past financial results. Investors should recognize that these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. (7)\nAs the company reported a net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding equals the basic weighted average shares outstanding for that period. The non-GAAP adjustments described above resulted in adjusted net income from continuing operations for those periods. Therefore, dilutive common stock equivalents have been included in the calculation of adjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding. HURON CONSULTING GROUP INC.
