Green Dot also reported adjusted EBITDA 1 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share 1 of $32.1 million and $0.29, respectively.\nSaid Green Dot Founder and CEO, Steve Streit, “Q4 was yet another very strong quarter for Green Dot, capping a year that, on many levels, was the finest year in Green Dot’s history to date. We beat our financial expectations with four consecutive quarters of accelerating financial results and achieved record total operating revenues, record profits and expanding margins. Furthermore, we saw the return to organic active account growth in our Account Services operating segment, had multiple new \"Banking as a Service\" program wins with world-class partners and made two strategic acquisitions. We obviously feel great about our financial results for both Q4 and the full year; but are even more pleased with how our unique and compelling Products and Platform model is generating business momentum across both our reporting segments and each of our revenue divisions, which gives us the foundation for our optimism regarding growth into 2018 and beyond.”\nGAAP financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016:\nTotal operating revenues on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis were $213.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $162.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a year-over-year increase of 31%. GAAP net income was $12.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from a net loss of $1.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a year-over-year increase of 1,009%. GAAP diluted earnings per common share was $0.23 for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from loss per common share of $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a year-over-year increase of 867%.\nNon-GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016: 1\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $32.1 million, or 15.1% of total operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $21.8 million, or 13.4% of total operating revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a year-over-year increase of 47% and margin expansion of 170 basis points. Non-GAAP net income 1 was $15.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $9.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a year-over-year increase of 64%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 1 was $0.29 for the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $0.19 for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a year-over-year increase of 53%.\nThe following table shows the Company's quarterly key business metrics for each of the last eight calendar quarters. Please refer to the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the key business metrics.\n2017 2016 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 (In millions) Number of cash transfers 9.95 9.80 9.55 9.30 9.37 9.36 9.35 9.71 Number of tax refunds processed 0.06 0.10 2.41 8.60 0.06 0.10 2.18 8.18 Number of active cards at quarter end 5.26 5.23 5.15 5.05 4.13 4.09 4.28 4.75 Gross dollar volume $ 8,556 $ 7,856 $ 7,687 $ 7,707 $ 5,681 $ 5,338 $ 5,372 $ 6,569 Purchase volume $ 5,645 $ 5,206 $ 5,226 $ 5,503 $ 4,012 $ 3,759 $ 3,863 $ 4,708 Said Mark Shifke, Green Dot’s Chief Financial Officer, “Our strong Q4 results capped a year of tremendous performance across practically every revenue division in the company. For full year 2017, Green Dot delivered total operating revenues of $890 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24%; adjusted EBITDA of $206 million, representing year over year growth of 32% and reflecting year-over-year margin expansion of 140 basis points; and non-GAAP EPS of $2.16, representing year-over-year growth of 48%. Green Dot generated cash flow from operations of $55 million during the quarter and $218 million for the full year, with nearly $49 million of unencumbered cash on our balance sheet as of year-end. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we expect that, in 2018, our effective tax rate will decline to approximately 25%, generating at the mid-point of our 2018 guidance an incremental $0.41 of earnings per share, or approximately $22 million of incremental after tax earnings.”\nOutlook for 2018\nGreen Dot has provided its outlook for 2018. Green Dot’s outlook is based on a number of assumptions that management believes are reasonable at the time of this earnings release. Information regarding potential risks that could cause the actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements is set forth below and in Green Dot's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTotal Operating Revenues\nGreen Dot expects its full year total operating revenues to be between $982 million and $997 million. For Q1, Green Dot expects total operating revenues to be between $295 million and $300 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\nGreen Dot expects its full year adjusted EBITDA 2 to be between $236 million and $241 million.\nNon-GAAP EPS 2\nGreen Dot expects its full year non-GAAP EPS 2 to be between $2.81 and $2.88.\nThe components of Green Dot's non-GAAP EPS 2 guidance range are as follows:\nRange Low High (In millions except per share data) Adjusted EBITDA $ 236.0 $ 241.0 Depreciation and amortization* (40.0 ) (40.0 ) Net interest income ** 8.5 8.5 Non-GAAP pre-tax income $ 204.5 $ 209.5 Tax impact*** (51.1 ) (52.4 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 153.4 $ 157.1 Diluted weighted-average shares issued and outstanding 54.5 54.5 Non-GAAP earnings per share $ 2.81 $ 2.88 * Excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets ** Excludes the impact of amortization of deferred financing costs *** Assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 25% for full year. This rate reflects the expected impact of the new tax law (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) 1 Reconciliations of net income to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and net income to adjusted EBITDA, respectively, are provided in the tables immediately following the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about the Company's non-GAAP financial measures can be found under the caption “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 2 Reconciliations of forward-looking guidance for these non-GAAP financial measures to their respective, most directly comparable projected GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables immediately following the reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA. Starting in 2019, Green Dot intends to make the following revisions to its GAAP and non-GAAP financial presentations:\nFirst, for its GAAP reporting beginning in 2019, Green Dot intends to present net interest income generated at Green Dot Bank from the investment of customer deposits as a component of consolidated GAAP total operating revenues; whereas today, that item is reported below operating income and is consolidated along with net interest income generated by other entities within the consolidated enterprise. Net interest income at Green Dot Bank is becoming an increasingly important revenue component for Green Dot because the ability to invest growing customer balances is a truly unique and compelling advantage of Green Dot as a regulated bank. It is also becoming a more important element in its economic relationships with BaaS partners. For these reasons, Green Dot believes including this item in total operating revenues is the most accurate presentation of its evolving business. All other non-operating net interest income generated by other entities within the consolidated enterprise will continue to be reported below operating income.\nSecond, starting at the same time in 2019, Green Dot intends to present a new non-GAAP revenue figure that reduces GAAP total operating revenue by commissions and certain processing-related costs associated with certain BaaS partner programs where the partner, not Green Dot, controls customer acquisition. Green Dot believes that as these kinds of partnerships become more material, continuing to report the associated revenue on a gross basis could have the unintentional effect of overstating Green Dot’s revenue from such programs; and therefore, also have the effect of understating the associated consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins. Green Dot's reporting of GAAP revenues from those selected BaaS program revenue will continue to be on a gross basis. The prospective presentation revisions starting in 2019 will not impact the calculation or presentation of GAAP or non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nGreen Dot will continue to guide and report results throughout 2018 using its current GAAP and non-GAAP presentation format. However, to aid in a smooth transition, Green Dot will also provide supplemental reporting throughout 2018 reflecting its results under the new 2019 GAAP and non-GAAP presentations. In this way, investors will have the opportunity to become familiar with those revised presentations well before official deployment in 2019.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 financial results today at 5:00 p.m. ET.

(1) To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses measures of operating results that are adjusted to exclude various, primarily non-cash, expenses and charges. These financial measures are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to or substitutes for operating revenues, operating income, net income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate their measures in the same manner as the Company does. These financial measures are adjusted to eliminate the impact of items that the Company does not consider indicative of its core operating performance. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company considers them appropriate. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures it presents are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance for the following reasons: • the Company records employee stock-based compensation from period to period, and recorded employee stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $13.4 million and $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. By comparing the Company’s adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in different historical periods, investors can evaluate the Company’s operating results without the additional variations caused by employee stock-based compensation expense, which may not be comparable from period to period due to changes in the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock (which is influenced by external factors like the volatility of public markets and the financial performance of the Company’s peers) and is not a key measure of the Company’s operations;\n• adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items, such as net interest income and expense, income tax benefit and expense, depreciation and amortization, employee stock-based compensation expense, incremental expenses related to the delay in migration of the Company’s remaining customer accounts from its former processor to its new processor, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, transaction costs, impairment charges, severance costs related to extraordinary personnel reductions, legal settlement expenses, and other charges and income that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their respective financing structures and accounting policies, the book values of their assets, their capital structures and the methods by which their assets were acquired; and\n• securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies.\nThe Company’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measures: • as measures of operating performance, because they exclude the impact of items not directly resulting from the Company’s core operations;\n• for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget;\n• to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of the Company’s business;\n• to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s business strategies;\n• to establish metrics for variable compensation; and\n• in communications with the Company’s board of directors concerning the Company’s financial performance.\nThe Company understands that, although adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, these measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results of operations as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: • that these measures do not reflect the Company’s capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments;\n• that these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs;\n• that these measures do not reflect interest expense or interest income;\n• that these measures do not reflect cash requirements for income taxes;\n• that, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and\n• that other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these measures differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\n(2) The Company does not include any income tax impact of the associated non-GAAP adjustment to adjusted EBITDA, as the case may be, because each of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided before income tax expense. (3) This expense consists primarily of expenses for employee stock options and restricted stock units (including performance-based restricted stock units). Employee stock-based compensation expense is not comparable from period to period due to changes in the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock (which is influenced by external factors like the volatility of public markets and the financial performance of the Company’s peers) and is not a key measure of the Company’s operations. The Company excludes employee stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because it consists of non-cash expenses that the Company does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Further, the Company believes that it is not useful to investors to understand the impact of employee stock-based compensation to its results of operations. This expense is included as a component of compensation and benefits expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. (4) The Company excludes certain income and expenses that are the result of acquisitions. These acquisition related adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, settlements of contingencies established at time of acquisition and other acquisition related charges, such as integration charges and professional and legal fees, which result in the Company recording expenses or fair value adjustments in its GAAP financial statements. The Company analyzes the performance of its operations without regard to these adjustments. In determining whether any acquisition related adjustment is appropriate, the Company takes into consideration, among other things, how such adjustments would or would not aid in the understanding of the performance of its operations. These items are included as a component of other general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. (5) The Company excludes certain income and expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. It is difficult to estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in the Company's GAAP financial statements, the Company excludes them in its non-GAAP financial measures because the Company believes these items may limit the comparability of ongoing operations with prior and future periods. These adjustments include amortization attributable to deferred financing costs, impairment charges related to internal-use software, legal settlement expenses and other charges, which consists of expenses incurred with our proxy contest. In determining whether any such adjustment is appropriate, the Company takes into consideration, among other things, how such adjustments would or would not aid in the understanding of the performance of its operations. These items, except for amortization of deferred financing costs, which is included as a component of interest expense, are included within other general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. (6) During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded charges of $0.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for severance costs related to extraordinary personnel reductions. Although severance expenses are an ordinary part of its operations, the magnitude and scale of the reduction in workforce the Company began to implement in the three months ended September 30, 2016 is not expected to be repeated. This expense is included as a component of compensation and benefits expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. (7) Represents the tax effect for the related non-GAAP measure adjustments using the Company's year to date non-GAAP effective tax rate. It also excludes the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and one-time favorable adjustments to the Company’s deferred taxes assets and liabilities, including the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company’s tax benefit is provisional based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. Changes to these estimates or new guidance issued by regulators may materially impact the Company’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. The Company expects to complete its accounting for the tax effects in the short term. (8) Represents the net incremental expenses associated with the Company's need to continue to support customer accounts on its legacy transaction processor that it had intended to migrate to its new processing platform in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company received $6.5 million as a partial recovery of these costs. (9) These amounts represent estimated adjustments for net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, employee stock-based compensation expense, contingent consideration, transaction costs, impairment charges, severance costs related to extraordinary personnel reductions, legal settlement expenses, and other income and expenses. Employee stock-based compensation expense includes assumptions about the future fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock (which is influenced by external factors like the volatility of public markets and the financial performance of the Company’s peers).\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006375/en/\nFor Green Dot Corporation\nInvestor Relations\nIR@greendot.com\nor\nMedia Relations\nBrian Ruby, 203-682-8286\nBrian.Ruby@icrinc.com\nSource: Green Dot Corporation",
