    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (NYSE: MIC) today reported financial results for full year 2017 that included growth investments of more than $625.0 million and a cash dividend of $1.44 per share for the fourth quarter.\n\"The performance of our businesses in the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 resulted in year over year growth in cash generation of 8.2%, including the impact of a 2.9% increase in the weighted number of shares outstanding,\" said Christopher Frost, chief executive officer of MIC. \"Effective deployment of a substantial amount of growth capital offset a slightly weaker than anticipated rate of organic growth. With the increase in cash generation, we are pleased to announce that the MIC board has approved a cash dividend for the fourth quarter that raises the total distribution for 2017 to $5.56 per share, consistent with our guidance for a year over year increase of 10%.\"\n\"While our results for 2017 were solid, in an effort to improve MIC's overall mix of business we are undertaking a review of strategic options available to us with respect to the Bayonne Energy Center, OMI Environmental Solutions and other smaller businesses in our portfolio,\" Frost noted. \"Having largely completed the development of the Bayonne Energy Center as envisioned when we acquired the business in 2015, we believe now may be an opportune time to monetize a portion of it. To address changing demand drivers for certain liquid products, as we have in the past, we intend to repurpose certain of the assets of our bulk liquid terminals business as well. We believe these actions will position MIC to continue to deliver attractive total shareholder returns.\"\n\"In addition, we have made the decision to reduce our 2018 dividend in favor of internally funding the repurposing of the assets at International-Matex Tank Terminals and to take advantage of the incentives to invest in growth projects that are a part of recent tax reform,\" Frost added. \"We believe that our guidance for a dividend of $1.00 per share, per quarter, in 2018 strikes a balance between continuing to return the majority of our Free Cash Flow to shareholders in the form of a dividend and strengthening our balance sheet in support of future dividend growth.\"\nMIC reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 net income of $361.3 million and $456.1 million, respectively, an increase of 408% and 195% compared with $71.1 million and $154.9 million in the comparable periods in 2016. The increases in net income were primarily the result of changes in U.S. tax law that went into effect with the signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\") in December of 2017. A reduction in the Company's net Deferred Tax Liability to reflect a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate constituted the largest portion of the benefit.\nNet income before taxes decreased to $61.8 million and $222.0 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year in 2017, compared with $82.0 million and $226.1 million in comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in pre-tax net income reflects primarily higher interest expense in the fourth quarter and a decrease in other income related to the absence of insurance recoveries in 2017 in the full year period.\nThe Company reported generation of cash from operating activities of $131.8 million and $529.5 million in the quarter and full-year periods , respectively, compared with $123.3 million and $560.3 million in the comparable periods in 2016. Cash from operating activities declined primarily as a result of changes in working capital related to fluctuations in the price of jet fuel and gas sold by certain of MIC's businesses.\nMIC produced $135.5 million and $568.0 million of Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter and full year periods in 2017, respectively, up from $118.6 million and $510.2 million in the comparable periods in 2016. The aggregate increase in Adjusted Free Cash Flow of 14.2% and 11.3% for the quarter and full-year, respectively, was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average number of shares of MIC outstanding.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Dividend\nThe MIC board of directors has authorized a cash dividend of $1.44 per share for 2017. The dividend will be payable March 8, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 5, 2018. Including the dividend of $1.44, MIC will have distributed approximately 81.4% of the Adjusted Free Cash Flow generated during 2017 for a dividend coverage ratio of approximately 1.2 times.\nOutlook\nTaking into consideration the planned repurposing of certain of the assets of International-Matex Tank Terminals (\"IMTT\"), MIC is forecasting generation of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") excluding non-cash items in a range of between $690.0 million and $720.0 million in 2018. The year over year decline reflects a decrease in EBITDA generated by IMTT, offset by continued increases at Atlantic Aviation, Contracted Power and MIC Hawaii. Atlantic Aviation is expected to benefit from ongoing increases in flight activity while Contracted Power is expected to benefit from the completion of the BEC II expansion project.\nWith respect to the Company's preliminary outlook for EBITDA excluding non-cash items in 2018, a reconciliation to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, is not available without unreasonable effort due to the Company's limited visibility into and inability to make accurate projections and estimates of items including management fees, hedging agreements, depreciation and any (benefit) provision for income taxes. These items may vary greatly from year to year and could significantly impact MIC's results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\nMIC expects Free Cash Flow produced in 2018 to decline by between 8% and 10% versus 2017 including the impact of expected share issuance. The Company's forecast reflects primarily a reduction in cash generation by IMTT, increased interest expense and the near-term impact of tax reform. IMTT is forecast to generate a reduced amount of cash in 2018 as consequence of global shifts in refined petroleum product production and consumption that have reduced demand for residual and heavy oil and trading activity related to those products. IMTT's cash generating capacity will be lower while certain of its tanks are out of service for cleaning and repurposing.\nOffsetting a portion of the anticipated decline in Free Cash Flow are contributions from the more than $625.0 million deployed in growth investments in 2017, together with the partial year impact of the pending Hawaii Gas rate case and potential capital deployment in 2018. The primary components of the 2017 capital deployment activity were:\nInvestments by Atlantic Aviation of approximately $230.0 million including acquisitions of FBOs in Oxford, CT and Opa-Locka, FL totaling $155.0 million; Investments by IMTT of approximately $220.0 million including the acquisition of Epic Midstream Terminals for $171.5 million; Investments within Contracted Power of approximately $140.0 million including construction of the Bayonne Energy Center Phase II (\"BEC II\") and related projects of approximately $120.0 million; and Investments within MIC Hawaii of approximately $25.0 million.\nMIC believes that the contribution to EBITDA from these investments will be approximately $60.0 million on an annualized basis.\n\"We believe that MIC's performance will continue to reflect the generally strong demand for the products and services its businesses provide,\" Frost said. \"While we foresee a temporary downturn in the contribution from IMTT tied primarily to reduced demand for storage and handling of residual and heavy oil, we have a clear repurposing strategy with respect to capitalizing on our preeminent locations in the Lower Mississippi River and New York Harbor markets and taking advantage of positive demand trends in other products and segments of the bulk liquid marketplace.\"\nThe Company anticipates deploying approximately $350.0 million of growth capital per year in each of the next several years. Approximately half of the expected deployments in 2018 relate to residual expenditures for initiatives including previously granted lease extensions at Atlantic Aviation and the completion of BEC II. MIC anticipates funding the entirety of its planned 2018 deployments using internally generated resources including capital retained as a consequence of the dividend reduction, and potential proceeds from sales of non-core assets.\n\"We remain confident in our prospects and our ability to drive value for our shareholders. We have the financial and human capital to deploy in the construction or acquisition of quality, cash generative opportunities in each of our segments and look forward to making the most of favorable trends in those in 2018 and beyond,\" said Frost.\n2017 Segment Cash Generation\nMIC's fourth quarter and full-year results reflected continued strong performance by its airport services business, Atlantic Aviation, including contributions from two acquisitions completed in 2017. In May, Atlantic Aviation acquired the fixed base operator at Waterbury-Oxford Airport in Oxford, CT and acquired a fixed base operator at Miami Opa-Locka airport in Opa-Locka, FL in September. Excluding interest rate swap breakage fees and the premium paid on an interest rate cap associated with the refinancing of the business in 2016, Free Cash Flow generated by Atlantic Aviation decreased by 2.3% in the fourth quarter and increased 9.5% for the full year versus the prior comparable periods. The period over period decrease in Free Cash Flow generation in the fourth quarter was attributable in part to the timing of certain state income tax payments. Atlantic Aviation's performance was underpinned by growth in general aviation flight activity in the U.S. of approximately 3.6% in 2017.\nThe Company's bulk liquid terminals business, IMTT, benefitted from an acquisition of a portfolio of seven terminals in August of 2017 and generated increases in Free Cash Flow of 7.6% and 9.4%, respectively, in the fourth quarter and full year periods versus the comparable periods in 2016. Contributions from the acquired terminals helped offset non-renewal of a small number of primarily residual and heavy oil contracts late in the year and a full-year loss at IMTT subsidiary OMI Environmental Services, Inc. (\"OMI\"). OMI generates revenue primarily from oil spill clean-up and tank cleaning and inspection activities.\nMIC's Contracted Power segment includes a thermal facility in Bayonne, NJ, the Bayonne Energy Center (\"BEC\"), and a portfolio of renewable facilities primarily in the southwest U.S. Together, these produced growth in segment Free Cash Flow of 15.7% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year versus the prior comparable periods. The increases in cash generation were the result of a full-year contribution from the acquisition of a renewable facility in 2016 and additional tariff-based services completed in 2017, together with receipt of development profits related to the sale of wind projects during the year. The increases were offset by higher interest expense and by mild weather in the Northeast that reduced demand for power from BEC as well as unplanned outages that had an adverse impact on portions of the renewables portfolio.\nMIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas, a mechanical contractor and several renewable power facilities, all located in Hawaii. Free Cash Flow produced by the segment increased by 8.0% in the fourth quarter and by 6.6% for the full year compared with 2016. The increases were attributable to a reduction in maintenance capital expenditures and the absence of a cash pension contribution, partially offset by negative Free Cash Flow generation by the mechanical contracting business reflecting primarily cost overruns on projects with fixed revenue.\nMIC's Corporate and Other segment comprises primarily interest expense on holding company level debt, investments in various development platforms and costs not otherwise covered by the fee paid to MIC's external manager. The segment recorded positive Free Cash Flow in $2.4 million compared with negative Free Cash Flow of $5.2 million in the prior comparable quarter primarily as a result of a current federal income tax benefit that reflects tax sharing payments made to MIC by its subsidiaries. For the full year 2017, the Corporate and Other segment recorded negative Free Cash Flow of $21.0 million compared with negative Free Cash Flow of $15.3 million in 2016 as a result of increased costs related to both acquisitions and the implementation of the Company's shared services center.\n\"Each of our larger businesses produced solid growth in cash generation including the impact of capital deployed in 2017,\" noted Frost. \"Portfolio wide, aggregate same store growth in Free Cash Flow was approximately 3% for the year with capital deployment contributing the balance. The deployment of growth capital relatively late in the year and in some case into projects that will not be in service until this year means that those deployments will have a larger impact on our 2018 results.\"\nImpact of Tax Reform\nAt year-end 2016, MIC had gross Net Operating Loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards of approximately $400.0 million. At year-end 2017, MIC's gross NOL was approximately $350.0 million with $50.0 million having been used to offset current federal income taxes of approximately $63.0 million. As a consequence of the recent reforms to the U.S. Tax Code and their impact on the utilization of NOLs, MIC does not foresee having a material federal income tax liability prior to 2020.\nThe Tax Act includes a provision that allows for immediate expensing, or bonus depreciation, of investments in qualifying capital assets. MIC expects a substantial portion of its approximately $350.0 million per year of growth capital deployments over the 2018 – 2021 time period will be into qualifying assets. If the Company is successful in these efforts, it expects they will shield it from any material federal income tax liability until 2022.\nThe enactment of the Tax Act has an immediate impact on two of MIC's businesses. Although the regulated portion of MIC's Hawaii Gas business is expected to realize a year over year increase in revenue as a result of the pending rate case, any increase will be partially offset as a consequence of the business collecting a smaller amount of federal taxes. The revenue reduction will be offset by a corresponding decrease in Hawaii Gas' standalone federal income tax liability. Tax reform should have a positive impact on the unregulated portion of MIC Hawaii.\nSecond, IMTT has been capitalized in part using tax exempt bonds. The indenture agreements related to those bonds provide that the bondholder must be compensated for a reduction in federal tax rates. As a result, the interest on the bonds will increase by approximately 0.6% to compensate the bondholders for the reduced tax advantage under the new federal income tax regime.\nSummary Financial Information\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\nFavorable/(Unfavorable)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\nFavorable/(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\n$\n%\n2017\n2016\n$\n%\n($ In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data) (Unaudited)\nGAAP Metrics\nNet income\n$\n361,276\n$\n71,131\n290,145\nNM\n$\n456,112\n$\n154,869\n301,243\n194.5\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding: basic\n84,572,725\n81,853,027\n2,719,698\n3.3\n83,204,404\n80,892,654\n2,311,750\n2.9\nNet income per share attributable to MIC\n$\n4.13\n$\n0.89\n3.24\nNM\n$\n5.42\n$\n1.93\n3.49\n180.8\nCash provided by operating activities\n131,790\n123,332\n8,458\n6.9\n529,459\n560,320\n(30,861)\n(5.5)\nMIC Non-GAAP Metrics\nEBITDA excluding non-cash items (1)(2)\n$\n177,980\n$\n166,006\n11,974\n7.2\n$\n711,903\n$\n695,588\n16,315\n2.3\nShared service implementation costs (3)\n1,655\n—\n1,655\nNM\n8,502\n—\n8,502\nNM\nInvestment and acquisition costs (3)\n1,381\n—\n1,381\nNM\n9,254\n—\n9,254\nNM\nAdjusted EBITDA excluding non-cash items (2)(3)\n$\n181,016\n$\n166,006\n15,010\n9.0\n$\n729,659\n$\n695,588\n34,071\n4.9\nCash interest (4)\n$\n(28,106)\n$\n(25,922)\n(2,184)\n(8.4)\n$\n(107,541)\n$\n(107,930)\n389\n0.4\nCash taxes\n(2,667)\n(2,027)\n(640)\n(31.6)\n(11,160)\n(7,310)\n(3,850)\n(52.7)\nCash pension contribution\n—\n(3,500)\n3,500\n100.0\n—\n(3,500)\n3,500\n100.0\nMaintenance capital expenditures (5)\n(12,140)\n(13,478)\n1,338\n9.9\n(35,202)\n(58,203)\n23,001\n39.5\nNoncontrolling interest (6)\n(2,583)\n(2,446)\n(137)\n(5.6)\n(7,806)\n(8,400)\n594\n7.1\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow (3)(4)\n$\n135,520\n$\n118,633\n16,887\n14.2\n$\n567,950\n$\n510,245\n57,705\n11.3\nNM — Not meaningful\n(1) EBITDA excluding non-cash items is calculated as net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, management fees, pension expense and other non-cash (income) expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

Its businesses consist of a bulk liquid terminals business, International-Matex Tank Terminals, an airport services business, Atlantic Aviation, entities comprising an energy services, production and distribution segment, MIC Hawaii, and entities comprising a Contracted Power segment. For additional information, please visit the MIC website at www.macquarie.com/mic . MIC-G\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and Proportionately Combined Metrics\nIn addition to MIC's results under U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures to assess the performance and prospects of its businesses. In particular, MIC uses EBITDA excluding non-cash items, Free Cash Flow and certain proportionately combined financial metrics. Proportionately combined financial metrics reflect the Company's proportionate interest in its wind and solar facilities.\nMIC measures EBITDA excluding non-cash items as a reflection of its businesses' ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided, the operating margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses. The Company believes investors use EBITDA excluding non-cash items primarily as a measure to assess the operating performance of its businesses and to make comparisons with the operating performance of other businesses whose depreciation and amortization expense may vary widely from MIC's, particularly where acquisitions and other non-operating factors are involved. MIC defines EBITDA excluding non-cash items as net income (loss) or earnings — the most comparable GAAP measure — before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash items including impairments, unrealized derivative gains and losses, adjustments for other non-cash items and pension expenses reflected in the statements of operations. EBITDA excluding non-cash items also excludes base management fees and performance fees, if any, whether paid in cash or stock.\nGiven MIC's varied ownership levels in its Contracted Power and MIC Hawaii segments, together with obligations to report the results of these businesses on a consolidated basis, GAAP measures such as net income (loss) do not fully reflect all of the items management considers in assessing the amount of cash generated based on its proportionate interest in its wind and solar facilities. The Company notes that the proportionately combined metrics used may be calculated in a different manner by other companies and may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure. Therefore, proportionately combined metrics should be used as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of its financial results reported under GAAP.\nThe Company's businesses are characteristically owners of high-value, long-lived assets capable of generating substantial Free Cash Flow. MIC defines Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities — the most comparable GAAP measure — which includes cash paid for interest, taxes and pension contributions, less maintenance capital expenditures, which includes principal repayments on capital lease obligations used to fund maintenance capital expenditures, and excludes changes in working capital.\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow as a measure of its ability to provide investors with an attractive risk-adjusted total return by sustaining and potentially increasing MIC's quarterly cash dividend and funding a portion of the Company's growth. GAAP metrics such as net income (loss) do not provide MIC management with the same level of visibility into the performance and prospects of the business as a result of: (i) the capital intensive nature of MIC's businesses and the generation of non-cash depreciation and amortization; (ii) shares issued to the Company's external manager under the Management Services Agreement; (iii) the Company's ability to defer all or a portion of current federal income taxes; (iv) non-cash unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments; (v) amortization of tolling liabilities; (vi) gains (losses) on disposal of assets; and (vii) pension expenses. Pension expenses primarily consist of interest expense, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial and performance gains and losses. Any cash contributions to pension plans are reflected as a reduction to Free Cash Flow. Management believes that external consumers of its financial statements, including investors and research analysts, use Free Cash Flow both to assess the Company's performance and as an indicator of its success in generating an attractive risk-adjusted total return.\nIn its Report on Form 10-K, the Company has disclosed Free Cash Flow on a consolidated basis and for each of its operating segments and MIC Corporate. Management believes that both EBITDA excluding non-cash items and Free Cash Flow support a more complete and accurate understanding of the financial and operating performance of its businesses than would otherwise be achieved using GAAP results alone.\nFree Cash Flow does not take into consideration required payments on indebtedness and other fixed obligations or other cash items that are excluded from MIC's definition of Free Cash Flow. Management notes that Free Cash Flow may be calculated differently by other companies thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Free Cash Flow should be used as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of its financial results reported under GAAP.\nSee also \"Reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA excluding non-cash items and a Reconciliation from Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\" below.\nClassification of Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Growth Capital Expenditures\nMIC categorizes capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures or growth capital expenditures. As neither maintenance capital expenditure nor growth capital expenditure is a GAAP term, the Company has adopted a framework to categorize specific capital expenditures. In broad terms, maintenance capital expenditures primarily maintain MIC's businesses at current levels of operations, capability, profitability or cash flow, while growth capital expenditures primarily provide new or enhanced levels of operations, capability, profitability or cash flow. Management considers a number of factors in determining whether a specific capital expenditure will be classified as maintenance or growth.\nMIC does not bifurcate specific capital expenditures into maintenance and growth components. Each discrete capital expenditure is considered within the above framework and the entire capital expenditure is classified as either maintenance or growth.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains .
