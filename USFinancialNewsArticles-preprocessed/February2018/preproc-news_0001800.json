This compared with a discount of $3 last week.\nThe domestic price includes a 10 percent import tax.\nLocal gold prices jumped to 30,720 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, the highest level since Nov. 9, 2016.\n“For last few months investment demand was weak as gold was giving negative returns and rupee was appreciating,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank.\n“But now, the rupee has started depreciating due to fiscal deficit concerns. It could attract investors towards gold.”\nMeanwhile, in top consumer China, demand remained muted ahead of the Chinese New Year, which kicks off on Feb. 16.\nChinese premiums ranged between $6 and $8 an ounce versus $7 last week, while in Hong Kong, premiums of 60 cents-$1 were being charged, as against 60 cents-$1.20 previously.\n“Physical demand in China should slow from now until the Chinese new year ... but after that, the physical market is expected to firm,” said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.\nHigh prices were also a deterrent for demand.\n“I think when prices come down to $1,320 or $1,330 an ounce, we might see some buying there,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.\nBenchmark spot gold fell 0.3 percent to $1,345.22 per ounce at 1030 GMT and was down 0.4 percent for the week so far.\nIn Singapore, premiums remained unchanged this week at 60-80 cents amid steady demand.\n“We do see good demand (in the region) this week as we approach the Chinese New Year. I think the slight (price) pullback could see some clients come and pick up physical gold,” said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.\nIn Japan, gold continued to be sold at a 50 cent discount, the same as last week amid weak demand, a Tokyo-based trader said.
