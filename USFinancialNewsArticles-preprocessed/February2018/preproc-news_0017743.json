    "text": "WHITTIER, Calif., Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Friendly Hills Bank (the “Company”) (OTCBB:FHLB) reported results for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor the twelve month period ending December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $596,000 or $0.31 per diluted share of common stock. This figure includes a $130,000 increase in deferred tax and AOCI tax bill adjustments as the result of a change in the federal tax rate which was recognized as additional income tax expense in December, 2017. The Company reported net income of $705,000 or $0.36 per diluted share of common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This figure includes a $200,000 tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the Company’s deferred tax valuation allowance and a $36,000 net gain on securities sold.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company reported total assets of $154.5 million, an 8% increase from $142.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company’s loan portfolio, net of unearned income, increased 3% from $75.0 million as of December 31, 2016, to $77.3 million as of December 31, 2017. The portfolio remains diversified with $27.0 million or 35% in Commercial & Industrial Loans to local businesses (including $16.6 million in Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate Loans), $19.6 million or 25% in Residential Real Estate Loans to investors and $24.0 million or 31% in Commercial Real Estate Loans to investors. The Company has an additional $26.4 million in unfunded loan commitments.\nThe Company’s overall deposit base has decreased 1% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $115.5 million as of December 31, 2016, to $113.9 million as of December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing deposits continue to form a substantial part of the deposit base (41%), decreasing from $47.5 million to $47.1 million as of December 31, 2017. During the same time period interest-bearing deposits decreased from $68.0 million to $66.9 million on December 31, 2017. The Company has no deposits which were sourced through brokers or other wholesale funding sources.\nAt December 31, 2017, shareholders’ equity was $16.3 million and the Company’s total risk-based capital ratio was 18%, significantly exceeding the “well-capitalized” level of 10% prescribed under regulatory requirements. The Company also continues to maintain a substantial liquidity position supplemented by the availability of collateralized borrowings and other potential sources of liquidity.\n“We are pleased to report another strong year of performance for the company with a 46% increase in Pretax Income which was attributable to increases in both Net Interest Income and Fee Income,” commented Jeffrey K. Ball, Chief Executive Officer. “We continued to experience higher than normal volatility in our deposit base which we attribute to our large concentration in core deposits and increased economic activity in our region. We manage that volatility with strong overall liquidity and diverse sources of funding. Meanwhile asset quality continues to be strong with a capital base that is sufficient to support the continued growth of the company.”\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that Jeffrey K. Ball, President and Chief Executive Officer, was recently appointed to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLBSF”). Mr. Ball was appointed by the Board of Directors of the FHLBSF to complete the remaining three years of a four year term for a director who recently retired. The FHLBSF is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks which provides wholesale funding for its members and targeted grant and loan programs targeting affordable housing and economic development.\nCompany Profile:\nFriendly Hills Bank is a community Bank which was formed to primarily serve the Southern California communities of eastern Los Angeles County and northern Orange County.
