    "text": "Despite an apparent \"breakthrough\" in Germany's government coalition talks a few weeks ago, the euro zone's largest economy and defacto leader is facing much more political uncertainty and tumult on a number of fronts.\nHere are five reasons why the current state of German politics is concerning:\nGrand coalition deal on the line Markets appeared to breathe a sigh of relief several weeks ago when Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian alliance, the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union (CDU-CSU), came to an agreement with the Social Democrats (SPD) to form another power-sharing government, called a \"grand coalition.\"\nThe agreement needs the approval of the majority of SPD's 464,000-strong membership, who are having their say in a postal vote beginning Tuesday, with a result expected on March 4.\nAround two-thirds are expected to approve the deal, although some influential members are protesting against it, calling for the SPD to stay in opposition.\nTomasz Wieladek, senior international economist at Barclays, said in a note Monday that the \"grand coalition treaty is on thin ice and that a 'no' vote could lead to either a minority government or new elections.\"\n\"The latest official poll shows record-low SPD support and that voters believe that the SPD cared more about ministries than content,\" he said. \"This suggests significant risks around the SPD's membership approval vote. Moreover, Angela Merkel's approval ratings have also declined significantly since the election.\"\nSPD leadership uncertainty In addition to the membership ballot, there are SPD leadership changes afoot that are likely to bring about a change of approach and uncertainty over whether Merkel will see out a fourth term as chancellor (more on that below).\nSPD leader Martin Schulz resigned last week following criticism of his agreement to serve as foreign minister in a future coalition government after previously saying the party would stay in opposition.",
