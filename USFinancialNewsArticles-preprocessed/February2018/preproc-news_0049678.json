Our direct sales jumped to over 60% of total revenue in 2017 and we expect direct sales to reach over 70% of total revenue in 2018. We finished the year strong, with an outstanding quarter in terms of revenue growth, order demand and margin expansion. Our bioprocessing diversification and technology leadership strategy has truly taken hold and we are enthusiastic about the opportunities we see to continue building value for our customers and shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Snapshot\nTotal revenue increased by 63% year-over-year, to $41.6 million Spectrum product sales contributed $11.8 million, a pro forma increase of 19% year-over-year GAAP gross margin was 54% and adjusted gross margin expanded by 380 bps to 57.1% GAAP fully-diluted EPS increased 88% to $0.27, including the positive $0.22 impact of tax reform, versus $0.15 for the fourth quarter of 2016 Adjusted (non-GAAP) EPS increased 116% to $0.20 versus $0.09 for the fourth quarter of 2016\nFull Year 2017 Snapshot\nTotal revenue increased by 35% to $141.2 million Organic growth was 9% overall, 19% for direct-to-customer products Spectrum products contributed revenue of $19.4 million for first 5 months ownership, a pro forma increase of 24% year-over-year Sales of products sold direct to customers increased to 62% of revenue, from 48% in 2016 GAAP fully-diluted EPS more than doubled to $0.72, including the positive $0.24 impact of tax reform, versus $0.34 for the year 2016 Adjusted (non-GAAP) EPS increased 41% to $0.69 versus $0.49 for the year 2016\nFinancial Details for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017\nREVENUE\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $41.6 million compared to $25.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a year-over-year gain of 63% as reported, or 61% at constant currency.\nTotal revenue for the year 2017 increased to $141.2 million compared to $104.5 million for the year 2016, an increase of 35% as reported, or 36% at constant currency.\nIncluding the impact of acquisitions, our direct-to-customer revenue for the year 2017 was $87.3 million, reflecting year-on-year growth of 75% as reported and at constant currency.

This guidance is based on expectations for our existing business and does not include the financial impact of potential new acquisitions or future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur guidance for 2018 includes the first full year of sales following our acquisition of Spectrum on August 1, 2017.\nYEAR 2018 GUIDANCE:\nTotal revenue is projected to be $180-$186 million, reflecting growth of 27%-32% or 26%-31% at constant currency. This includes an organic growth projection of 10%-14% before any impact of foreign currency. Gross margin is expected to be 55.5%-56.5% on a GAAP basis, and adjusted gross margin is expected to be 56%-57%. Income from operations is expected to be $26.5-$28.5 million on a GAAP basis, and adjusted income from operations is expected to be $40-$42 million. We expect an income tax rate of approximately 28% on a GAAP basis and an income tax rate of approximately 19% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income is expected to be $14-$15.5 million on a GAAP basis, and adjusted net income is expected to be $30.5-$32 million. Fully diluted GAAP EPS for the year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $0.31-$0.35 and adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.68-$0.72.\nOur non-GAAP guidance for the year 2018 excludes the following items:\n$10.7 million estimated intangible amortization expense; $0.6 million in cost of goods and $10.1 million in G&A. $2.7 million estimated acquisition and integration expenses (G&A) associated with the Spectrum acquisition. $4.2 million of non-cash interest expense (Other Income/Expense) related to our debt financing.\nOur non-GAAP guidance for the year 2018 includes:\nAn income tax increase of $1.2 million, representing the tax impact of acquisition costs and intangible amortization.\nAll reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted (non-GAAP) guidance are detailed in the tables included later in this press release.\nConference Call\nRepligen will host a conference call and webcast today, February 22, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EST, to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and corporate developments. The conference call will be accessible by dialing toll-free (866) 777-2509 for domestic callers or (412) 317-5413 for international callers. No passcode is required for the live call. In addition, a webcast will be accessible via the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website. Both the conference call and webcast will be archived for a period of time following the live event. The replay dial-in numbers are (877) 344-7529 from the U.S., (855)-669-9658 from Canada and (412) 317-0088 for international callers. Replay listeners must provide the passcode 10117070.\nN on-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release: revenue growth rate at constant currency, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, adjusted income from operations and adjusted operating margin, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted other expense, adjusted income tax benefit and adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS). The Company provides revenue growth rates in constant currency to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation in order to facilitate a comparison of its current revenue performance to its past revenue performance. To calculate revenue growth rates in constant currency, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period.\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial results and/or non-GAAP guidance exclude the impact of: contingent consideration related to the Company’s June 2014 asset purchase agreement with Refine Technology (Refine contingent consideration was triggered by the achievement of annual XCell™ ATF system sales milestones through the year 2016) and its April 2016 acquisition of Atoll GmbH, acquisition costs related to the Company’s acquisitions of Atoll GmbH, TangenX Technology Corporation, and Spectrum Lifesciences, LLC (formerly known as Spectrum, Inc., inventory step-up charges related to the acquisition of Spectrum, intangible amortization costs, non-cash interest expense, and in the case of EBITDA, cash interest expense related to the Company’s May 2016 convertible debt issuance. Also excluded are tax benefits associated with valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, the impact on tax of intangible amortization, tax benefits associated with variable integration expenses and tax benefits associated with tax reform. These costs are excluded because management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financial measures is included as an attachment to this press release. When analyzing the Company’s operating performance and guidance investors should not consider non-GAAP measures as substitutable for the comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Repligen Corporation\nRepligen Corporation (NASDAQ:RGEN) is a global bioprocessing company that develops and commercializes highly innovative products that deliver cost and process efficiencies to biological drug manufacturers worldwide.
