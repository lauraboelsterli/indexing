Two-year yields touched new nine-year peaks.\nThat weighed on euro zone yields, with the German 10-year benchmark down one basis point. Yields were also dampened by data showing German business confidence fell more than expected in February, though Europe’s biggest economy is clearly set for solid growth.\nThe next hurdle for markets will be minutes from the European Central Bank’s last meeting at 1230 GMT, with investors keen to see if there was more talk of an eventual unwinding of stimulus.\nThe “transatlantic spread” between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs widened to near a year high at 220 bps, reflecting the diverging monetary policy expectations between the two countries.\nBritain however confirmed itself as one of the weak spots in the world economy, with data showing below-forecast 0.4 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. That pushed sterling 0.2 percent lower against the dollar, a one-week low.\nThe firmer dollar pummelled commodities too - Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent while gold and copper prices also fell .\nReporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by Hugh Lawson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
