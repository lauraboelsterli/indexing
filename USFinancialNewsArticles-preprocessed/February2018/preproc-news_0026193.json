(NASDAQ:ARCT), a leading RNA medicines company, today announced that Dr. Christine Esau, Senior Director of Translational Research, has been appointed as Vice President of Research and Development, effective immediately.\nConcurrently, Dr. Pad Chivukula is stepping down as Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Operating Officer and will serve as a Scientific Advisor to the Company.\n“Christine brings more than a decade of experience in microRNA drug discovery, development and commercialization,” said Mark R. Herbert, Interim President. “Given her experience with Arcturus over the past several years, we are confident that in this new role, Christine will immediately contribute to the progress we are making in developing innovative RNA medicines with the potential to transform the lives of patients with serious diseases. We are pleased Dr. Chivukula will serve as a Scientific Advisor to the Company.”\n“It has been a privilege to be a part of the Arcturus team, and I am proud of our extraordinary innovations and accomplishments in advancing our diverse pipeline of RNA therapeutics and the many partnerships we have garnered thus far,” said Dr. Chivukula. “I look forward to following the Company’s ongoing success as Arcturus continues to progress its preclinical programs.”\nAbout Christine Esau\nDr. Esau joined Arcturus in 2015, and most recently served as Senior Director of Translational Research. Dr. Esau was previously lead biologist at Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Regulus Therapeutics and served as Chief Scientific Officer of AptamiR Therapeutics. She has performed pioneering work in microRNA biology and anti-miRNA targeting technology development, resulting in landmark, highly cited papers and early patent filings. As lead biologist for the anti-miR-122 program for treatment of HCV with Regulus, she moved the program from discovery biology to lead compound selection, directing pharmacology, PK/PD, safety, and mechanism of action studies. At Regulus, she led exploratory efforts to identify novel microRNA targets for metabolic diseases, in the process establishing an extensive network of academic collaborators.

While Chief Scientific Officer of AptamiR Therapeutics, Dr. Esau worked to develop a microRNA based therapy for the treatment of obesity. Dr. Esau earned a B.S. degree in biology from the California Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nAbout Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd.\nFounded in 2013 and based in San Diego, Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd.
