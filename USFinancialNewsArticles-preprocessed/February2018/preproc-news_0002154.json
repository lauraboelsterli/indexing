    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Enova International (NYSE: ENVA), a leading financial technology company offering consumer and small business loans and financing, today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We are pleased to report record fourth quarter results, which were driven by strong demand and solid credit performance across our businesses,\" said David Fisher, Enova's CEO. \"We've made significant progress in transforming our business since our spin-off three years ago. We've entered new markets, launched multiple new products, substantially diversified our revenue and navigated significant regulatory changes. Furthermore, we've diversified our marketing channels and demonstrated our ability to grow our market share and generate sustainable growth. These efforts, combined with our highly scalable and flexible technology, provide a lot of tailwind as we head into 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Summary\nTotal revenue of $243.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 20.4% from $202.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 51.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by growth in the installment loan and receivables purchase agreement segment as well as a higher mix of new customers, which requires higher loan loss provisions. Net income was $6.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $8.7 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $38.1 million, a non-GAAP measure, increased from $35.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income of $8.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, a non-GAAP measure, in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased from adjusted net income of $8.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Summary\nTotal revenue of $843.7 million in 2017 increased 13.2% from $745.6 million in 2016. Gross profit margin was 53.0% in 2017 compared to 56.0% in 2016. Net income was $29.2 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in 2017 compared to net income of $34.6 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $157.8 million, a non-GAAP measure, increased from $142.3 million in 2016. Adjusted net income of $46.9 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, a non-GAAP measure, in 2017 increased from adjusted net income of $37.5 million, or $1.12 per diluted share in 2016.\n\"We are pleased that we have been able to consistently deliver strong quarterly results,\" said Steve Cunningham, CFO of Enova. \"Our performance measures this quarter met or exceeded our expectations, driven by strong new customer growth, the operating leverage inherent in our model and the positive impacts of tax reform. Credit quality remains in-line with our expectations and the business continues to generate considerable operating cash flow.\"\nEnova ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $68.7 million. As of December 31, 2017, the company had total debt outstanding of $788.5 million, which included $211.4 million outstanding under Enova's $295 million securitization facilities. During the fourth quarter, Enova generated $135.9 million of cash flow from operations.\nOutlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Enova expects total revenue of $220 million to $240 million, GAAP results of $0.44 diluted earnings per share to $0.65 diluted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $60 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.81. For the full year 2018, Enova expects total revenue of $940 million to $1 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.51 to $2.04, adjusted EBITDA of $175 million to $200 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.83 to $2.37.\nFor information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nConference Call\nEnova will host a conference call to discuss its results at 4 p.m. Central Time / 5 p.m. Eastern Time today, Thursday, February 1 st .

These forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events and reflect the views and assumptions of Enova's senior management with respect to the business, financial condition and prospects of Enova as of the date of this release and are not guarantees of future performance. The actual results of Enova could differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties applicable to Enova's business, including, without limitation, those risks and uncertainties indicated in Enova's filings Commission (\"SEC\"), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and current reports on Forms 8-K. These risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of Enova to control, and, in many cases, Enova cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements. When used in this release, the words \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates\" and similar expressions or variations as they relate to Enova or its management are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Enova cautions you not to put undue reliance on these statements. Enova disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Enova provides historical non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of Enova's operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Enova's business that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nManagement provides non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of Enova's GAAP consolidated financial statements. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, Enova's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nCombined Loans and Finance Receivables\nEnova has provided combined loans and finance receivables, which is a non-GAAP measure. Enova also reports allowances and liabilities for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables individually and on a combined basis, which are GAAP measures that are included in Enova's financial statements. Management believes these measures provide investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential cost of revenue and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loan and finance receivables portfolio on an aggregate basis. Management believes that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the residual amount on Enova's balance sheet since both revenue and the cost of revenue for loans and finance receivables are impacted by the aggregate amount of loans and finance receivables owned by Enova and those guaranteed by Enova as reflected in its financial statements.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, Enova has provided adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of Enova's financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. Management also believes that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as the Adjusted Earnings Measures, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in Enova's business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, management believes that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare Enova's financial results during the periods shown without the effect of certain expense items.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that Enova defines as earnings excluding depreciation, amortization, interest, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, taxes, stock-based compensation, loss on early extinguishment of debt and acquisition related costs, and Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that Enova defines as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate Enova's ability to incur and service debt and Enova's capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are also useful to investors to help assess Enova's estimated enterprise value. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as presented below may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies.\nENOVA INTERNATIONAL, INC.
