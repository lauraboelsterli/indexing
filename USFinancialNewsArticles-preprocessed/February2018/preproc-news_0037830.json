    "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga., Feb. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Insurance Designers of America, LLC announced today that J. Craig Collins has joined the firm as President. In his role, Collins will direct general business development including creating strategic business initiatives and expanding sales and marketing activity for the organization. Additionally, he will have primary responsibility for managing relationships with partner insurance carriers. For more information about Insurance Designers, visit https://www.ida-national.com .\n\"We are thrilled to have Craig join our team,\" said Craig Waldenmaier, Chairman of the Board at Insurance Designers. \"He is widely known and respected in our industry. His leadership will be invaluable. Craig's tireless energy, passion for the insurance business and his vast knowledge and experience will enhance our efforts to grow our business from independent producers and institutional clients.\"\nWith more than 40 years experience, Collins brings broad-based knowledge of the financial services industry and leadership experience in managing and developing independent distribution. He comes to Insurance Designers from Highland Capital Brokerage where he was Senior Vice President, Business Development and Head of HighCap Financial, an elite producer group. He previously served as Senior Vice President at Voya Financial (formerly ING US) and was responsible for Independent Life Insurance sales, Voya's largest life insurance distribution channel. Mr. Collins began his insurance career as an agent in 1977 and held several positions with major U.S. insurance companies. He has been actively involved in the industry including participation in several associations. He was a long-standing member of LIMRA's Brokerage Committee, which he chaired in 2010 and 2011, LIMRA's Distribution Leaders Round Table, NAILBA and AALU. He studied Business Administration at the University of Kentucky and holds FINRA series 6 and 26 license.\n\"I am honored and excited to be with Insurance Designers,\" noted Collins. \"I have enjoyed a great relationship and been very familiar with the organization and it's members for many years. They are highly respected in our industry for their professionalism and integrity. As one of the largest Insurance Marketing Organizations they are recognized for their superior support of their distribution partners. I am looking forward to working with the membership.\"\nCollins will be replacing Dick Schuettner who will be retiring March 31. Greg Patterson, Principal at Advisors Financial Group and immediate past Chairman at Insurance Designers commented, \"Dick has done an excellent job during his time with us. We are grateful for his contributions as Dick has been instrumental in helping to lay a foundation for Craig and our membership to continue on our growth trajectory.\"\nAbout Insurance Designers of America\nFormed in 1986, IDA is among the oldest, largest and most well-respected Insurance Marketing Organizations (IMOs) in the country. Founded by former agency heads of a national insurance carrier that was exiting the agency distribution system, IDA was conceived to fill the distribution void as insurance companies narrowed their scope solely to the manufacture of products.\nToday, IDA has over 50 member agencies across the country and is a leading distributor of life insurance, annuities and related products, all of which help give IDA the scale and resources necessary to help over 30,000 financial professionals with their client's insurance needs.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/insurance-designers-of-america-announces-j-craig-collins-as-president-300599823.html\nSOURCE Insurance Designers of America",
