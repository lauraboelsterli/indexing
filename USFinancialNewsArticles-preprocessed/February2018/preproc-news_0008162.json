    "text": "EditorsNote: adds “in Newark, N.J.” in lede\nNico Hischier redirected a shot past Philadelphia goalie Alex Lyon with 1:27 left to give the New Jersey Devils a 4-3 victory over the Flyers on Thursday in Newark, N.J.\nBlake Coleman sent the puck toward the goal from the right side, and Hischier, despite having to battle against being checked, reached out and redirected the puck. It snuck between Lyon’s legs and slowly trickled into the goal.\nHischier recorded his first goal since Jan. 2, and it handed the Flyers a third straight loss.\nIt also gave Lyon a sad ending to his first NHL start. He made five saves Wednesday in the Flyers’ 5-3 loss at Washington, where he played the last nine minutes.\nLyon appeared in line for his first NHL victory Thursday as the Flyers held a 3-2 lead after two periods. However, the Devils beat the rookie twice in the third period.\nHe finished with 18 saves in the loss.\nThe Flyers also saw the five-game goal-scoring streak of Travis Konecny end in this defeat.\nOn the other side, the Devils’ Taylor Hall extended his point streak to nine straight games with an assist.\nFor the Flyers, Jakub Voracek added two assists and now has 50 this season. Pavel Zacha had two assists for New Jersey.\nNew Jersey goalie Keith Kinkaid finished with 22 saves and blanked Philadelphia in the third period, helping the Devils rally.\nThe first period was all about the power play as each team scored two extra-man goals and the Devils and Flyers were even at two after one.\nKyle Palmieri and Drew Stafford scored for the Devils, who took leads of 1-0 and 2-1 with those goals before the Flyers twice tied it thanks to goals from Claude Giroux and Wayne Simmonds.\nThe Flyers then took the lead on the goal from Shayne Gostisbehere at 7:01 of the second period. A puck from the right side deflected off a skate and over to Gostisbehere near the left side of the cage, and he put it in for a 3-2 lead.\nPhiladelphia’s Damon Severson tied it with nine minutes remaining, setting up Hischier’s late-game heroics.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
