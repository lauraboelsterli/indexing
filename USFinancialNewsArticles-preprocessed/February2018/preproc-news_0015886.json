    "text": " 41 PM / in 8 minutes Baltic index rises for third day on higher capesize rates Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 8 (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchangeâ€™s main sea freight index inched up for the third straight session on Thursday as higher capesize rates offset weakness across all other vessel segments. \n* The overall index, which factors in rates for capesize, panamax, supramax and handysize shipping vessels that ferry dry bulk commodities, was up 9 points, or 0.82 percent, at 1,106 points. \n* The capesize index gained 84 points, or 5.32 percent, at 1,662 points. \n* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which typically transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, rose $737 to $13,208. \n* The panamax index dropped 30 points, or 2.32 percent, to 1,263 points. It was down for the ninth straight session. \n* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which usually carry coal or grain cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes, dropped $237 to $10,134. \n* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index eased 11 points to 833 points, and the handysize index shed 3 points to 529 points.
