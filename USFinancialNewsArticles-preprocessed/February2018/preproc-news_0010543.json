Therefore, for the base year of 2017 (accrual), the Company's stockholders will receive R$ 2.7127 per share, which totals R$ 17.6 billion in dividends and interest on capital (net of income tax), which is equivalent to 70.6% of the consolidated recurring net income for 2017, representing an increase of 75.6% from 2016.\nAdditionally, taking into considerations the repurchase of its own shares in 2017, the payout reaches 83.0% of consolidated recurring net income for 2017.\nSão Paulo (SP), February 5, 2018.\nALEXSANDRO BROEDEL LOPES\nGroup Executive Finance Director and Investor Relations Officer\n(*) As previously informed by the Company, the total amount to be distributed every year will be established by the Board of Directors, taking into consideration, among other factors: (1) the level of the Company's capitalization in accordance with the rules determined by the Central Bank of Brazil; (2) the minimum level established by the Board of Directors (CET1 = 13.5%); (3) profitability for the year; (4) the expectations of capital usage due to the growth expected from business, stock buyback programs, mergers and acquisitions and regulatory changes that may change capital requirements; and (5) tax changes.
