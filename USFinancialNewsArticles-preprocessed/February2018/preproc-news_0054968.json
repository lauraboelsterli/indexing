    "text": "0 COMMENTS Jude Boudreaux is partner and senior financial planner at the Planning Center in New Orleans. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Jacob Meade.\nMr. Boudreaux on the value of understanding the role of play: When people get clear about what is truly fun and restorative to them, they tend to spend money less mindlessly elsewhere Photo: The Planning Center Dr. Stuart Brown, founder of the National Institute for Play, has defined seven characteristics of play, including that it’s a voluntary activity with no apparent purpose for survival. It’s not until a person lacks any significant kind of play that its importance can be seen. Dr. Brown points out that when people lose their connection to play, they pay a high price. “The opposite of play is not work—the opposite of play is depression,” he says.\nThis is why advisers at my firm work with our busy clients to make sure they prioritize the role of play in their lives. Each person’s definition of play can vary—whether it’s travel, fishing, yoga or another activity. We try to get clients to understand that by investing time and money in their interests, they will be happier and have more energy for other tasks, and can even turn play into a financial gain.\nAdvisers can promote play to clients by giving them “permission” to engage in it from a financial standpoint. And the way to arrive at permission is by gaining a strong grasp of the person’s cash flow. Today many advisers’ discussions with clients are very future- and savings-oriented, and that’s great. But if we want to make a change in people’s attitudes toward play, we need to do a better job helping clients know their daily spending, and how spending on a sport or hobby can fit into that.\nMore Voices\nHow Advisers Can Guide Clients in Launching Side Businesses (Feb. 20, 2018) Helping Clients With Concentrated Portfolios (Feb. 12, 2018) Why It Pays to Learn Clients’ Money Stories (Feb. 8, 2018) How Zero-Based Budgeting Can Help Clients (Feb. 5, 2018) An Advisory’s ‘10-Year Rule’: Keeping Emotion Out of Investing Decisions (Feb. 1, 2018) Investment Planning After the Tax Overhaul (Jan. 29, 2018) The Do’s and Don’ts of Working With Surviving Spouses (Jan. 25, 2018) Guiding Clients’ Post-Business Philanthropic Efforts (Jan. 22, 2018) A Millennial Adviser on Working With Millennial Clients (Jan. 18, 2018) Rethinking the Annual Performance Review (Jan. 16, 2018) What to Do When Clients Obsess Over Beating the Market (Jan. 11, 2018) When clients are empowered to spend on play, they become more content in their daily lives and can be more engaged as far as their relationships with friends and family. One client of ours had a longtime interest in taking art classes, but she was reluctant to take time away from work. Through a spending analysis we were able to show that she could afford to take a day off per week from her practice as a physician and use that time toward her artistic pursuits. The move did bring her compensation down a bit, but more important, it has made a big difference in her personal happiness while not threatening her overall financial goals.\nIn other cases, a greater focus on play can benefit the client’s bottom line. That’s because when people get clear about what is truly fun and restorative to them, they tend to spend money less mindlessly elsewhere. For instance, a family planning a vacation might lean toward Disney World simply because it’s an expected destination. But if they approach it with a clear idea of what play means to them, they may find a cheaper week spent at the beach would be more fun for everyone.\nAs advisers, we can do clients a lot of good (both financially and emotionally) by getting them to define a “play criteria” and adopt a mindset toward spending on activities that are most meaningful to them.",
