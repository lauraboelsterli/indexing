They were chosen for helping clients resolve their most significant supply chain challenges through innovative digital transformation solutions and a next-generation digital platform that lowers working capital costs, streamlines operations and drives efficiencies.\n“Supply chain executives want to increase their digital transformation efforts across their supply chains to gain intelligent visibility, which leads to greater efficiencies, less risk, and improved profits,” said John Blyzinskyj, CEO of Elemica. “These three executives are leading clients on their digital transformation journey with Elemica solutions that promote reduced cost of operations, faster process execution, and automation of key business processes between trading partners.
