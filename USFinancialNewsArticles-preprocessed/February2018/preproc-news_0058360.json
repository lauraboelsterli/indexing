    "text": "MADISON, N.J., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Realogy Holdings Corp. (NYSE: RLGY), the largest full-service residential real estate services company in the United States, today reported financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2017, including the following highlights:\nRevenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 5% compared to 2016, driven by increases in homesale transaction volume (transaction sides multiplied by average sale price). Realogy grew its U.S. market share of existing homesale transaction volume to 15.9%, up from 15.7% in 2016. Combined 2017 homesale transaction volume for Realogy increased 7% year-over-year, which exceeded the National Association of Realtors reported annual industry volume increase of 6% in 2017. Net income was $431 million for 2017, compared to $213 million for 2016. Basic earnings per share was $3.15 compared with basic earnings per share of $1.47 in 2016. This reflects the recognition of a $216 million tax benefit, most of which is due to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduces Realogy's effective tax rate from an estimated 41% to an estimated 29%. Adjusted net income per share for 2017 was $1.59 compared with $1.64 for 2016. (See Table 1a). 1 Free Cash Flow for 2017 was $559 million compared with $456 million for 2016, an increase of $103 million. (See Table 7). 3 Free Cash Flow for 2017 includes $27 million relating to the transition to a new mortgage joint venture partner. Operating EBITDA for 2017 was $732 million, compared with $770 million for 2016. (See Table 5). 2 The 5% decline was primarily attributable to higher agent commission rates, reduced earnings in our relocation segment, and several non-recurring charges. In 2017, Realogy returned $325 million of capital to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n\"Realogy is at the heart of the attractive U.S. residential real estate market, and I believe we have a compelling combination of critical and unique advantages as the market leader,\" said Ryan Schneider, Realogy's new chief executive officer and president. \"Success requires that we deliver better business results, and we are moving quickly to drive change to enhance shareholder value. Our strategy is anchored by an aggressive focus on serving and supporting agents to help them become more successful, in large part by leveraging our technology and data scale.\"\n\"During the past three years, Realogy has generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow,\" said Anthony E. Hull, Realogy's executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer. \"The majority of our strong cash flow was allocated to repurchase shares, pay dividends and reduce debt. We expect to continue this capital management strategy going forward.\"\nIn 2017, RFG and NRT's 192,000 U.S.-based affiliated sales agents helped consumers with 1.5 million homesale transactions. In aggregate, Realogy achieved homesale transaction volume of approximately $508 billion, an increase of 7% compared with 2016. NRT average homesale price increased 5% and homesale transaction sides increased 3%, while RFG reported an average homesale price increase of 6% and a homesale transaction sides increase of 1%.\nIn the title and settlement services sector, TRG was involved in the closing of approximately 188,000 transactions in 2017, reflecting a 4% increase in purchase units compared with 2016, and notwithstanding a 44% decrease in refinance units, which is consistent with industry trends.\nIn the relocation segment, Cartus' results in 2017 decreased from the prior year due to reductions in their global relocation activity and lower overall volume. Cartus continues to be an important part of the Company's value proposition, generating highly qualified leads for its network of affiliated agents and helping them to build their businesses. Cartus generated referral opportunities to agents that resulted in approximately 76,000 in-network homesale closings for Realogy and its brands in 2017.\nCapital Allocation, Quarterly Dividend and New Share Repurchase Authorization\nSince the share repurchase program's inception in February 2016, the Company has repurchased approximately 18 million shares at an average price of $28.60 for $515 million in the aggregate, thereby reducing its share count by 11% in that time period. As a result, Realogy had approximately 130.2 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 23, 2018.\nRealogy today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $350 million of the Company's common stock. This is in addition to the $60 million remaining under the current $300 million share repurchase authorization announced in February 2017. Repurchases may be made at management's discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on price, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of the Company's common stock. This dividend payment will be made on March 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2018.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $227 million. Total long-term corporate debt, including the short-term portion, net of cash and cash equivalents (net corporate debt), totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The Company's net debt leverage ratio 4 was 3.9 times at December 31, 2017.\nIn February 2018, the Company announced that it had completed the refinancing of its senior secured credit facilities and extended its maturity dates.\nSpecifically, the Company made the following changes:\nincreased its revolving credit facility by $350 million to a $1.4 billion total facility and extended its maturity by three years to February 2023; combined its existing two tranches of term loan A and term loan A-1 into a new single tranche of $750 million and extended the current maturities to February 2023; and extended the maturity of its approximately $1.1 billion term loan B by three years to February 2025.\n\"We have decreased our debt from $3.9 billion at the end of 2013 to $3.3 billion at the end of 2017,\" added Hull. \"The refinancing of our term loan facilities increased our revolver capacity to $1.4 billion and furthered our capital structure strategy of creating a staggered maturity profile on our debt structure.\"\nAt year end, the Company's net operating loss carryforwards were $1.0 billion, which it expects will allow it to continue to pay minimal cash taxes through 2019.\nA consolidated balance sheet is included as Table 2 of this press release.\nInvestor Conference Call\nToday, February 27, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT), Realogy will hold a conference call via webcast to review its full year 2017 results. The webcast will be hosted by Ryan Schneider, chief executive officer and president, and Anthony E.

The senior secured leverage ratio is measured by dividing Realogy Group LLC's total senior secured net debt by the trailing twelve-month EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, as those terms are defined in the senior secured credit facilities*. Total senior secured net debt does not include unsecured indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes*, or the securitization obligations. EBITDA calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, as defined in the senior secured credit facilities, includes adjustments to EBITDA for restructuring costs, former parent legacy cost (benefit) items, net, loss on the early extinguishment of debt, non-cash charges and incremental securitization interest costs, as well as pro forma cost savings for restructuring initiatives, the pro forma effect of business optimization initiatives and the pro forma effect of acquisitions and new franchisees, in each case calculated as of the beginning of the twelve-month period. The Company was in compliance with the senior secured leverage ratio covenant at December 31, 2017 with a ratio of 2.19 to 1.00.\nA reconciliation of net income attributable to Realogy Group to EBITDA, Operating EBITDA and EBITDA as defined by the senior secured credit facilities for the year ended December 31, 2017 are set forth in the following table:\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet income attributable to Realogy Group\n$\n431\nIncome tax benefit\n(65)\nIncome before income taxes\n366\nInterest expense, net\n158\nDepreciation and amortization (a)\n201\nEBITDA\n725\nEBITDA adjustments:\nRestructuring costs\n12\nFormer parent legacy benefit, net\n(10)\nLoss on the early extinguishment of debt\n5\nOperating EBITDA\n732\nBank covenant adjustments:\nPro forma effect of business optimization initiatives (b)\n21\nNon-cash charges (c)\n40\nPro forma effect of acquisitions and new franchisees (d)\n8\nIncremental securitization interest costs (e)\n3\nEBITDA as defined by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities\n$\n804\nTotal senior secured net debt (f)\n$\n1,764\nSenior secured leverage ratio\n2.19\nx\n(a)\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $3 million of amortization expense related to Guaranteed Rate Affinity's purchase accounting included in the \"Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities\" line on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n(b)\nRepresents the twelve-month pro forma effect of business optimization initiatives.\n(c)\nRepresents the elimination of non-cash expenses, including $52 million of stock-based compensation expense less $11 million for the change in the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes reserves and $1 million of foreign exchange benefits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(d)\nRepresents the estimated impact of acquisitions and franchise sales activity, net of brokerages that exited our franchise system as if these changes had occurred on January 1, 2017. Franchisee sales activity is comprised of new franchise agreements as well as growth through acquisitions and independent sales agent recruitment by existing franchisees with our assistance. We have made a number of assumptions in calculating such estimates and there can be no assurance that we would have generated the projected levels of EBITDA had we owned the acquired entities or entered into the franchise contracts as of January 1, 2017.\n(e)\nIncremental borrowing costs incurred as a result of the securitization facilities refinancing for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(f)\nRepresents total borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities and borrowings secured by a first priority lien on our assets of $1,886 million plus $29 million of capital lease obligations less $151 million of readily available cash as of December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facilities, total senior secured net debt does not include our securitization obligations or unsecured indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes.\n*\nOur senior secured credit facilities include the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 5, 2013, as amended, and the Term Loan A Agreement dated as of October 23, 2015, as amended, which was amended and restated in its entirety as of February 8, 2018. Our Unsecured Notes include our 4.50% Senior Notes due 2019, our 5.25% Senior Notes due 2021 and our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION - NET DEBT LEVERAGE RATIO\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017\n(In millions)\nNet corporate debt divided by EBITDA, as defined by the senior secured credit facilities, for the year ended December 31, 2017 (referred to as net debt leverage ratio) is set forth in the following table:\nAs of December 31,\n2017\nRevolver\n$\n70\nTerm Loan A\n391\nTerm Loan A-1\n342\nTerm Loan B\n1,083\nSenior Notes\n450\nSenior Notes\n550\nSenior Notes\n500\nTotal Debt (excluding securitizations)\n$\n3,386\nLess: Cash and Cash Equivalents\n227\nNet Corporate Debt\n$\n3,159\nEBITDA as defined by the Senior Secured Credit Facility\n$\n804\nNet Debt Leverage Ratio\n3.9\nx\nTable 9\nNon-GAAP Definitions\nAdjusted net income (loss) is defined by us as net income (loss) before mark-to-market interest rate adjustments, former parent legacy items, restructuring charges, the loss on the early extinguishment of debt, the tax effect of the foregoing adjustments and the impact of the 2017 Tax Act and adjustments to the reserve for uncertain tax positions. The gross amounts for these items as well as the adjustment for income taxes are presented. Adjusted earnings (loss) per share is Adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding. We present Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share because we believe these measures are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provides greater transparency into our operating results.\nEBITDA is defined by us as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net (other than relocation services interest for securitization assets and securitization obligations) and income taxes and is our primary non-GAAP measure. Operating EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA before restructuring, loss on the early extinguishment of debt and former parent legacy items and is used as a supplementary financial measure.\nWe present EBITDA and Operating EBITDA because we believe they are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provide greater transparency into our results of operations. Our management, including our chief operating decision maker, uses EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of our business. EBITDA and Operating EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net interest expense), taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the amortization of intangibles, which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. We further believe that EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an EBITDA measure when reporting their results.\nEBITDA and Operating EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider EBITDA and Operating EBITDA either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthese measures do not reflect changes in, or cash required for, our working capital needs; these measures do not reflect our interest expense (except for interest related to our securitization obligations), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; these measures do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; these measures do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies may calculate these measures differently so they may not be comparable.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Realogy before income tax expense (benefit), net of payments, interest expense, net, cash interest payments, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and former parent legacy costs (benefits), net of payments, loss on the early extinguishment of debt, working capital adjustments and relocation assets, net of change in securitization obligations. We use Free Cash Flow in our internal evaluation of operating effectiveness and decisions regarding the allocation of resources, as well as measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. Since Free Cash Flow can be viewed as both a performance measure and a cash flow measure, the Company has provided a reconciliation to both net income attributable to Realogy Holdings and net cash provided by operating activities. Free Cash Flow is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity. Free Cash Flow may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/realogy-reports-financial-results-for-full-year-2017-300604315.html\nSOURCE Realogy Holdings Corp.",
