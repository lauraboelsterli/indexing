    "text": "VIENNA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Austrian lender BAWAG is looking at takeover targets in Germany and Austria with a combined balance sheet size of around 25 billion euros ($31 billion), its chief executive said on Tuesday.\n“We have a pretty robust M&A pipeline,” Anas Abuzaakouk told Reuters. “We are looking at a number of deals, primarily in Germany, but a few in Austria... The total balance sheet size is roundabout 25 billion (euros).”\nUnlike Austrian rivals Erste Group, Raiffeisen Bank International and UniCredit Bank Austria , BAWAG withdrew from central and eastern Europe to focus on Austria, Germany and Switzerland.\nLast year, Austria’s fourth-biggest bank bought German regional lender Suedwestbank and Austrian credit card issuer PayLife and agreed to take over German building society bank Deutscher Ring Bausparkasse.\nAbuzaakouk said in December that BAWAG was involved in four to five potential acquisitions in Germany.
