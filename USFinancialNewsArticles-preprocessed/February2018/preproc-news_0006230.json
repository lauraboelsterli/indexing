Dakota Mathias added 11 points for the Boilermakers, who extended their school record winning streak to 18 games.\nVincent Edwards contributed eight points and a team-high 11 rebounds for Purdue (22-2, 11-0 Big Ten).\nFreshman forward Bruno Fernando had a double-double with 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting and 10 rebounds for Maryland (15-9, 4-7). Kevin Huerter scored 16 points, hitting 4 of 10 3-point shots for the Terrapins, while Darryl Morsell added 13 points and Anthony Cowan had 11.\nHuerter hit three 3-pointers in a row for Maryland, which used a 9-2 run to close the deficit to 55-52 with 9:19 to go.\nFollowing a timeout, Purdue produced a 7-0 run to regain command at 62-52.\nMaryland was forced to play without Michal Cekovsky, who was sidelined because of a heel injury. Cekovsky was injured in practice.\nSeveral Terrapins were hampered by foul trouble, and reserve center Sean Obi fouled out with 10-plus minutes to go.\nPurdue sank 16 of 21 free throws while Maryland was 12 of 15. The Terrapins shot 45.3 percent from the field while the Boilermakers shot 44.8 percent.\nDespite hitting just 12 of 34 shots, Purdue led 35-24 at halftime.
