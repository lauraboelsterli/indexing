Gabriel was called to appear in the Supreme Court on charges of sedition and rebellion surrounding her alleged part in Catalonia’s illegal independence referendum and subsequent secession declaration in October. On Tuesday, Gabriel said from Switzerland she would not travel to Madrid to face the charges as she did not believe she would have a fair trial.
