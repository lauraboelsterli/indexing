    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Devon Energy Corp on Tuesday reported quarterly results that fell short of analyst profit estimates on weaker than expected production.\nThe Oklahoma City-based company reported profit of 35 cents a share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to analystsâ€™ forecasts for 60 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Devon said its oil production missed its own forecasts during the period on delayed well tie-ins in the United States and steam-plant problems in its Canadian operations.
