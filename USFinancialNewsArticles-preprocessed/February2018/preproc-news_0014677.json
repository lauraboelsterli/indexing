    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The White House is “very comfortable” with where the economy is, despite recent stock market volatility, a White House spokeswoman said on Tuesday.\n“Look, the economy is incredibly strong right now. The president’s focus continues to be on the long-term economic fundamentals which ... are very strong in this country. ... There’s nothing that’s taken place over the last couple of days in our economy that’s fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago and we’re very comfortable with where we are right now,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a regular news briefing when asked about recent volatility.
