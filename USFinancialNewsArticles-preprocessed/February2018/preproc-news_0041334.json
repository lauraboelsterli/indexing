GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. Senate rejects immigration bills, leaves Dreamers in limbo The U.S. Senate rejected a series of bills to protect \"Dreamer\" immigrants on Thursday, leaving in limbo the future of 1.8 million young adults brought to the United States illegally as children. • Japan govt reappoints Kuroda as BOJ chief, picks reflationist academic as deputy Japan's government on Friday reappointed Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for another term and chose an advocate of bolder monetary easing as one of his deputies, a sign the central bank will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus programme. • Ramaphosa elected president of South Africa, vows anti-corruption fight Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as South Africa's president in a parliamentary vote on Thursday and pledged to tackle endemic corruption after scandal-ridden Jacob Zuma resigned on orders from the ruling African National Congress. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,587.50, up 0.31 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely open slightly higher against the dollar, as the greenback continued to trend down even after the U.S. reported upbeat economic numbers that raised bets of faster rate hikes. • Indian sovereign bonds are likely to edge lower in early session amid lack of fresh triggers in the domestic market, even as U.S. Treasury yields stay elevated. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.54 percent-7.60 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street surged on Thursday to notch its fifth straight session of gains, led by Apple and other technology stocks as investors shrugged off recent inflation worries that sent the market into a sell-off at the start of the month. • Asian shares extended their recovery from two-month lows into a fifth day as the Wall Street market volatility gauge fell, while the U.S. dollar was undermined by various worries including rising inflation. • The dollar slipped to a three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday, headed for its biggest weekly loss in two years, as bearish factors offset support the U.S. currency could take from rising Treasury yields. • U.S. Treasury yields slipped on Thursday after sizable gains in recent sessions, as investors took a breather from selling bonds and readjusted positions to prepare for more inflation-related volatility, a scenario that could take yields even higher. • Oil prices edged higher as the dollar stood near a three-year low in subdued Asian trade, with many markets closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. • Gold prices held firm to remain on track for their biggest weekly percentage gain in nearly two years, buoyed by a weaker U.S. dollar and as investors looked to hedge against inflation.
