    "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE: PBF) today reported fourth quarter 2017 income from operations of $253.5 million as compared to income from operations of $139.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The company reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $260.4 million, and net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $241.9 million or $2.14 per share. This compares to net income of $71.8 million, and net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $54.6 million or $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter 2016. Net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. for the year-ended December 31, 2017 was $415.5 million, or $3.73 per share as compared to net income of $170.8 million, or $1.74 per share, for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $730.2 million and $498.9 million, respectively.\nOur results for the fourth quarter 2017 were impacted by special items. These special items include a net, non-cash, after-tax gain of $119.3 million, or $1.04 per share, lower-of-cost-or-market (\"LCM\") inventory adjustment, and an after-tax net expense of $42.3 million, or $0.37 per share, related to a change in the tax receivable agreement (\"TRA\") liability and remeasurement of TRA associated deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") provided a net tax benefit of $173.3 million, or $1.51 per share, primarily related to the reduction in net deferred tax liabilities. In addition to these special items, our results included net after-tax charges totaling approximately $3.0 million, or $0.03 per share, related to an inventory layer decrement and approximately $42.2 million, or $0.37 per share, related to non-cash, unrealized derivative expense related to basis exposure for heavy Canadian feedstocks that will be processed in 2018.\nExcluding special items, fourth quarter 2017 income from operations was $55.9 million as compared to a loss from operations of $60.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted fully-converted net loss for the fourth quarter 2017, excluding special items, was $4.4 million, or $0.04 per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as described below, compared to adjusted fully-converted net loss of $74.9 million, or $0.71 per share, for the fourth quarter 2016.\nExcluding special items, income from operations was $434.7 million for the year-ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss from operations of $22.5 million for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted fully-converted net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding special items, was $130.1 million, or $1.14 per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as compared to adjusted fully-converted net loss of $145.7 million, or $1.41 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. PBF Energy's financial results reflect the consolidation of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX), a master limited partnership of which PBF indirectly owns the general partner and approximately 44.1% of the limited partner interests as of December 31, 2017.\n\"2017 was a year of two halves for PBF Energy. During the first two quarters of the year, we invested heavily in our assets and completed the largest turnaround in our company's history at our Torrance refinery. The improvements and strategic capital investments we completed were critical to our operational success in the third and fourth quarters and helped demonstrate the strength of our fully-operational refining system,\" said Tom Nimbley, PBF Energy's Chairman and CEO, \"Looking ahead, we continue to focus on the safe and reliable operations of our assets. We are beginning 2018 with a strong and flexible balance sheet and are positioned to benefit from opportunities in the market.\"\nPBF Energy Inc. Declares Dividend\nThe company announced today that it will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share of Class A common stock on March 14, 2018, to holders of record as of February 28, 2018.\nOutlook\nFor the first quarter 2018, we expect East Coast total throughput to average 330,000 to 350,000 barrels per day; Mid-Continent total throughput is expected to average 125,000 to 135,000 barrels per day; Gulf Coast total throughput is expected to average 180,000 to 190,000 barrels per day and West Coast total throughput is expected to average 160,000 to 170,000 barrels per day. These figures include the impact of the previously announced planned turnarounds at the Toledo, Delaware City and Chalmette refineries.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis earnings release, and the discussion during the management conference call, may include references to non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures including Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income, Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income excluding special items, Adjusted Fully-Converted Net Income per fully-exchanged, fully-diluted share, gross refining margin, gross refining margin excluding special items, gross refining margin per barrel of throughput, EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), EBITDA excluding special items, Adjusted EBITDA and projected EBITDA related to the refinery acquisitions. PBF believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about its operating performance and financial results. However, these measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed in isolation or considered as alternatives for, or superior to, comparable GAAP financial measures. PBF's non-GAAP financial measures may also differ from similarly named measures used by other companies. See the accompanying tables and footnotes in this release for additional information on the non-GAAP measures used in this release and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nAdjusted Fully-Converted Results\nAdjusted fully-converted results assume the exchange of all PBF Energy Company LLC Series A Units and dilutive securities into shares of PBF Energy Inc. Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, resulting in the elimination of the noncontrolling interest and a corresponding adjustment to the company's tax provision.\nConference Call Information\nPBF Energy's senior management will host a conference call and webcast regarding quarterly results and other business matters on Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The call is being webcast and can be accessed at PBF Energy's website, http://www.pbfenergy.com . The call can also be heard by dialing (866) 518-6930 or (203) 518-9797, conference ID: PBFQ417.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\nFOOTNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES\n(1) During the third quarter of 2017, we determined that we would revise the presentation of certain line items on our consolidated statements of operations to enhance our disclosure under the requirements of Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X. The revised presentation is comprised of the inclusion of a subtotal within costs and expenses referred to as \"Cost of sales\" and the reclassification of total depreciation and amortization expense between such amounts attributable to cost of sales and other operating costs and expenses. The amount of depreciation and amortization expense that is presented separately within the \"Cost of sales\" subtotal represents depreciation and amortization of refining and logistics assets that are integral to the refinery production process. The historical comparative information has been revised to conform to the current presentation. This revised presentation does not have an effect on our historical consolidated income from operations or net income, nor does it have any impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income or statements of cash flows.\n(2) Adjusted fully-converted information is presented in this table as management believes that these Non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare our results across the periods presented and facilitates an understanding of our operating results. We also use these measures to evaluate our operating performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The differences between adjusted fully-converted and GAAP results are explained in footnotes 3 through 9.\n(3) Represents the elimination of the noncontrolling interest associated with the ownership by the members of PBF Energy Company LLC other than PBF Energy Inc., as if such members had fully exchanged their Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock.\n(4) Represents an adjustment to reflect our statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 39.6% and 39.1% for the 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively, applied to the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest for all periods presented. The adjustment assumes the full exchange of existing PBF Energy Company LLC Series A Units as described in footnote 3. Our statutory tax rates will be reduced in future periods as a result of the TCJA enactment (as defined below).\n(5) The Non-GAAP measures presented include adjusted fully-converted net income excluding special items, income from continuing operations excluding special items, EBITDA excluding special items, and gross refining margin excluding special items. The special items for the periods presented relate to a lower of cost or market (\"LCM\") adjustment, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability (\"TRA\"), debt extinguishment costs, a net tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") and a net tax expense associated with the remeasurement of TRA associated deferred tax assets as further described below:\n(a) LCM is a GAAP guideline related to inventory valuation that requires inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market is determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and an LCM adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the current period.\n(b) Changes in the TRA reflect charges or benefits attributable to changes in our obligation under the TRA due to factors out of our control such as changes in tax rates.\n(c) Debt extinguishment costs reflect the difference between the carrying value of our 2020 Senior Secured Notes on the date that they were reacquired and the amount for which they were reacquired.\n(d) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the TCJA. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Under GAAP, we are required to recognize the effect of the TCJA in the period of enactment. These effects resulted in a net tax expense associated with the remeasurement of TRA associated deferred tax assets and a net tax benefit for the reduction of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the TCJA.\nAlthough we believe that Non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of special items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and performance of our business and allow for useful period-over-period comparisons, such Non-GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(6) The following table includes the lower of cost or market inventory reserve as of each date presented (in thousands):\n2017\n2016\nJanuary 1,\n$\n595,988\n$\n1,117,336\nSeptember 30,\n498,045\n796,503\nDecember 31,\n300,456\n595,988\nThe following table includes the corresponding impact of changes in the lower of cost or market inventory reserve on operating income and net income for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet LCM inventory adjustment\nbenefit in operating income\n$\n197,589\n$\n200,515\n$\n295,532\n$\n521,348\nNet LCM inventory adjustment benefit in net income\n119,326\n122,192\n178,475\n317,704\nAdditionally, during both the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded a change in TRA that increased operating income by $250.4 million and 250.9 million ($151.2 million and 151.5 million, net of tax), respectively.\nDuring the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a change in TRA that increased operating income by $16.1 million and $12.9 million ($9.8 million and $7.8 million, net of tax), respectively.\nFurthermore, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded pre-tax debt extinguishment costs of $25.5 million related to the redemption of the 2020 Senior Secured Notes. These nonrecurring charges decreased net income by $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There were no such costs in the year ended December 31, 2016 nor in the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe income tax impact of the special items, other than TCJA related items discussed in footnote 7 below, were calculated using the tax rates shown in footnote 4 above.\n(7) The Company made a one-time adjustment to deferred tax in relation to the TCJA. The net income tax expense impact of $20.2 million consists of a net tax expense of $193.5 million associated with the remeasurement of TRA associated deferred tax assets and a net tax benefit of $173.3 million for the reduction of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the TCJA.\n(8) Represents an adjustment to weighted-average diluted shares outstanding to assume the full exchange of existing PBF LLC Series A Units as described in footnote 3 above.\n(9) Represents weighted-average diluted shares outstanding assuming the conversion of all common stock equivalents, including options and warrants for PBF LLC Series A Units and options for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock as calculated under the treasury stock method (to the extent the impact of such exchange would not be anti-dilutive) for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of options and warrants to purchase 3,537,500 and 6,820,275 shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock and PBF LLC Series A Units because they are anti-dilutive for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of options and warrants to purchase 5,923,625 and 5,701,750 shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock and PBF LLC Series A Units because they are anti-dilutive for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(10) EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We use these Non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to our GAAP results in order to provide additional metrics on factors and trends affecting our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures of operating performance that are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n(11) We operate in two reportable segments: Refining and Logistics. Our operations that are not included in the Refining and Logistics segments are included in Corporate. As of December 31, 2017, the Refining segment includes the operations of our oil refineries and related facilities in Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, Toledo, Ohio, New Orleans, Louisiana and Torrance, California. The Logistics segment includes the operations of PBF Logistics LP (\"PBFX\"), a growth-oriented master limited partnership which owns or leases, operates, develops and acquires crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX's assets consist of rail and truck terminals and unloading racks, tank farms and pipelines, a substantial portion of which were acquired from or contributed by PBF LLC and are located at, or nearby, the company's refineries. PBFX provides various rail, truck and marine terminaling services, pipeline transportation services and storage services to PBF Holding and/or its subsidiaries and third party customers through fee-based commercial agreements. In connection with the contribution by PBF LLC of the limited liability interests in Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC (\"PNGPC\") to PBFX, the accompanying segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of PNGPC in the Logistics segment for all periods presented prior to such contribution.\nPBFX currently does not generate significant third party revenue and intersegment related-party revenues are eliminated in consolidation. Prior to the PBFX initial public offering, PBFX was not considered to be a separate reportable segment. From a PBF Energy perspective, the company's chief operating decision maker evaluates the Logistics segment as a whole without regard to any of PBFX's individual segments.\n(12) As reported by Platts.\n(13) Gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel of throughput are Non-GAAP measures because they exclude refinery operating expenses, refinery depreciation and amortization and gross margin of PBFX. Gross refining margin per barrel is gross refining margin, divided by total crude and feedstocks throughput. We believe they are important measures of operating performance and they provide useful information to investors because gross refining margin per barrel is a helpful metric comparison to the industry refining margin benchmarks shown in the Market Indicators Tables, as the industry benchmarks do not include a charge for refinery operating expenses and depreciation. Other companies in our industry may not calculate gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel in the same manner. Gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel of throughput have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n(14) Represents refinery operating expenses, including corporate-owned logistics assets, excluding depreciation and amortization, divided by total crude oil and feedstocks throughput.\n(15) We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity less than 24 degrees. We define medium crude oil as crude oil with API gravity between 24 and 35 degrees. We define light crude oil as crude oil with API gravity higher than 35 degrees.\n(16) The Refining segment includes capital expenditures of $971.9 million related to the acquisition of the Torrance refinery and related logistic assets that was completed in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Refining segment includes capital expenditures of $2.7 million for the working capital settlement related to the acquisition of the Chalmette refinery that was finalized in the first quarter of 2016.The Logistics segment includes capital expenditures of $98.4 million for the PBFX Plains Asset Purchase in the second quarter of 2016.\n(17) The Logistics segment includes capital expenditures of $10.1 million for the acquisition of the Toledo Terminal by PBFX on April 17, 2017.\n(18) The total debt to capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total equity. This ratio is a measurement that management believes is useful to investors in analyzing our leverage. Net debt and the net debt to capitalization ratio are Non-GAAP measures. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities from total debt. We believe these measurements are also useful to investors since we have the ability to and may decide to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to retire or pay down our debt. Marketable securities included in net debt fully collateralized PBFX's Term Loan prior to its repayment. Additionally, as described in footnote 5 above, we have also presented the total debt to capitalization and net debt to capitalization ratios excluding the cumulative effects of special items on equity.\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\nTotal debt\n$\n2,191,650\n$\n2,148,234\nTotal equity\n2,902,949\n2,570,684\nTotal capitalization\n$\n5,094,599\n$\n4,718,918\nTotal debt\n$\n2,191,650\n$\n2,148,234\nTotal equity, excluding special items\n2,950,154\n2,912,375\nTotal capitalization, excluding special items\n$\n5,141,804\n$\n5,060,609\nTotal equity\n$\n2,902,949\n$\n2,570,684\nSpecial items (Note 5):\nAdd: Non-cash LCM inventory adjustment (Note 6)\n300,456\n595,988\nAdd: Change in tax receivable agreement liability (Note 6)\n(276,430)\n(25,508)\nAdd: Debt extinguishment costs (Note 6)\n25,451\n—\nAdd: Recomputed income taxes on special items (Note 6)\n(22,425)\n(228,789)\nAdd: Net tax expense on TCJA related special items (Note 7)\n20,153\n—\nNet impact of special items to equity\n$\n47,205\n$\n341,691\nTotal equity, excluding special items (Note 5)\n$\n2,950,154\n$\n2,912,375\nTotal debt\n$\n2,191,650\n$\n2,148,234\nLess: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n573,021\n786,298\nNet debt\n$\n1,618,629\n$\n1,361,936\nTotal debt to capitalization ratio\n43\n%\n46\n%\nTotal debt to capitalization ratio, excluding special items\n43\n%\n42\n%\nNet debt to capitalization ratio\n36\n%\n35\n%\nNet debt to capitalization ratio, excluding special items\n35\n%\n32\n%\n(19) The Logistics segment includes 100% of the income from operations of the Torrance Valley Pipeline Company LLC (\"TVPC\"), as TVPC is consolidated by PBFX. PBFX records net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the 50% equity interest in TVPC held by PBF Holding. PBF Holding (included in the Refining segment) records equity income in investee related to its 50% noncontrolling ownership interest in TVPC. For the purposes of the consolidated PBF Energy financial statements, PBF Holding's equity income in investee and PBFX's net income attributable to noncontrolling interest eliminate in consolidation.\n(20) The Logistics segment includes 100% of the assets of TVPC as TVPC is consolidated by PBFX. PBFX records a noncontrolling interest for the 50% equity interest in TVPC held by PBF Holding. PBF Holding (included in the Refining segment) records an equity investment in TVPC reflecting its noncontrolling ownership interest. For the purposes of the consolidated PBF Energy financial statements, PBFX's noncontrolling interest in TVPC and PBF Holding's equity investment in TVPC eliminate in consolidation.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pbf-energy-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-results-declares-dividend-of-030-per-share-300599280.html\nSOURCE PBF Energy Inc.",
