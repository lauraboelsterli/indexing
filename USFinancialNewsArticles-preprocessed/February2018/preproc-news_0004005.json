    "text": "ST. LOUIS, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jackson Tree Service, a company long relied upon by St. Louis area homeowners for top quality tree removal and trimming, has announced it has moved into new headquarters at 11388 Dorsett Road, Maryland Heights, MO 63043.\n\"As our family has expanded, so has our business so we are moving to gain more space. This larger space allows us to invest in the community we've served for almost sixty years and will make us more efficient allowing for savings that can be passed on to our customers,\" said co-owner Mike Ballard.\nThe Jackson Tree Service shop size is expanding from 1,200 square feet to 2,700 square feet with the yard went from 8/10 of an acre to 1.5 acres at the new location.\nWith over 50 years of tree care experience, Jackson Tree Service serves clients in most St. Louis suburbs including Florissant, Webster Groves, Creve Coeur, Maryland Heights, and Overland.\n\"We have done work for the City of Maryland Heights over the years and appreciate the relationship we have with the Community Development, Street Maintenance, and Parks Departments. Working through the move with the City of Maryland Heights has strengthened our resolve to stay in this area as the City has worked hard to accommodate our needs and help us through the process,\" said co-owner Rachel Ballard.\nThe new space reflects Jackson Tree Service's company goal of focusing on providing each client with top quality service from the time of the initial contract to final cleanup.\nAbout Jackson Tree Service\nJackson Tree Service was opened in 1960 by Lawrence Ballard, who is said to have begun each day armed with just a truck and a chainsaw. Now in its 3rd generation, Mike Ballard, who grew up in the family business, with his wife Rachel, are committed to continuing the tradition of the family business. The business has established strong relationships with the community and its clients, providing quality work with a dedication to quick, safe, and friendly service at affordable prices.\nContact:\nRachel Ballard\n314-626-8587\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jackson-tree-service-announces-headquarters-relocation-to-maryland-heights-to-accommodate-expansion-300591308.html\nSOURCE Jackson Tree Service",
