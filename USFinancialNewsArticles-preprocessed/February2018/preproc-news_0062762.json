    "text": "CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS\nFourth Quarter 2017\nTotal revenue increased 10.7% to $1,705 million Property revenue increased 10.3% to $1,678 million Net income decreased 16.3% to $195 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.2% to $1,031 million Consolidated AFFO increased 8.0% to $707 million\nFull Year 2017\nTotal revenue increased 15.2% to $6,664 million Property revenue increased 14.9% to $6,566 million Net income increased 26.3% to $1,225 million Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.1% to $4,090 million Consolidated AFFO increased 16.5% to $2,902 million\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) today reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “In 2007, American Tower initiated a long-term aspirational strategy which included a target of quadrupling both the size of our communications site portfolio and our financial performance over a ten-year time horizon. Based on our 2017 results, we have far exceeded both objectives, with over 150,000 sites versus a goal of 100,000 sites, and $6.72 per share of Consolidated AFFO versus a goal of $6.00 per share. Moreover, in 2017, we delivered growth of nearly 16% in Consolidated AFFO per Share, expanded our return on invested capital, increased our common stock dividend by more than 20%, and repurchased approximately $770 million in stock.\nAs we look forward to 2018, we expect strong organic tenant billings growth of over 6% in the U.S., driven by unlimited data plans, increasing mobile video consumption, announced spectrum build-outs in the 2.5 GHz and 600 MHz bands and the planned FirstNet deployment. We also expect consistent demand for tower space in Latin America, notably in Mexico and Brazil, as well as robust activity in our key markets in the EMEA region. Finally, we have incorporated into our 2018 outlook the expected impacts of the ongoing carrier consolidation process in India. We continue to have a high level of confidence that once the consolidation activity concludes, the Indian mobile industry will be positioned for major network investments to bring 4G service to the country’s 1.3 billion people, providing strong growth opportunities for our extensive portfolio in India.”\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW\nAmerican Tower generated the following operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 (all comparative information is presented against the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The Company has converted its disclosure from thousands to millions and, as a result, certain necessary rounding adjustments have been made to prior year disclosed amounts in its financial statements.\n($ in millions, except per share amounts.)

As anticipated, the Company’s operational and financial results during the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by churn driven by this carrier consolidation process. We are disclosing the additional financial metrics below to quantify the impacts of this churn, which we expect to occur at varying rates over the next several years, and to provide additional insight into the underlying long-term trends across the Company’s business excluding these impacts.

For purposes of our full year 2018 outlook, we have assumed that both transactions will close on May 1, 2018.\nLEVERAGE AND FINANCING OVERVIEW\nLeverage – For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio was 4.7x net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to fourth quarter 2017 annualized Adjusted EBITDA.\nCalculation of Net Leverage Ratio ($ in millions, totals may not add due to rounding) As of December 31, 2017 Total debt $ 20,205 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 802 Net Debt 19,403 Divided By: Fourth quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA (1) 4,125 Net Leverage Ratio 4.7x\n(1) Q4 2017 Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four.\nLiquidity – As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $3.0 billion of total liquidity, consisting of $0.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus the ability to borrow an aggregate of $2.2 billion under its revolving credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit.\nOn December 8, 2017, the Company issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.600% senior unsecured notes due 2028. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to repay existing indebtedness under the Company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facilities.\nFULL YEAR 2018 OUTLOOK\nThe following full year 2018 financial and operational estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of February 27, 2018. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information.\nThe Company’s outlook is based on the following average foreign currency exchange rates to 1.00 U.S. Dollar for February 27, 2018 through December 31, 2018: (a) 19.90 Argentinean Pesos; (b) 3.30 Brazilian Reais; (c) 615 Chilean Pesos; (d) 2,890 Colombian Pesos; (e) 0.81 Euros; (f) 4.55 Ghanaian Cedi; (g) 64.00 Indian Rupees; (h) 19.00 Mexican Pesos; (i) 385 Nigerian Naira; (j) 5,660 Paraguayan Guarani; (k) 3.25 Peruvian Soles; (l) 12.40 South African Rand; and (m) 3,670 Ugandan Shillings.\nThe Company’s outlook reflects estimated favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO, of approximately $4 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, relative to the Company’s 2017 operating results. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort.\nThe Company’s outlook includes the impact of its pending Vodafone and Idea transactions in India, with an assumed closing date of May 1, 2018 for both transactions.\nAdditionally, the Company’s full year 2018 outlook reflects estimated unfavorable impacts from Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO of approximately $145 million, $85 million and $65 million, respectively, inclusive of an expected reduction in pass-through revenue of approximately $55 million. At this time, the Company expects the impacts of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn to last for several years and anticipates that churn rates in India will return to lower levels once the consolidation process is complete. The Company is providing key outlook measures adjusted to quantify the impacts of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on such measures as it believes that these adjusted measures better reflect the long-term trajectory of its recurring business and provide investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the Company’s business. The impact of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort.\nAdditional information pertaining to the impact of foreign currency, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) fluctuations and Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on the Company’s outlook has been provided in the supplemental disclosure package available on the Company’s website.\n2018 Outlook ($ in millions) Full Year 2018 Midpoint Growth\nTotal property revenue (1) $ 6,930 to $ 7,120 7.0% Net income 1,390 to 1,470 16.7% Adjusted EBITDA 4,300 to 4,400 6.4% Consolidated AFFO 3,160 to 3,260 10.6%\n(1) Includes U.S. property revenue of $3,700 million to $3,780 million and international property revenue of $3,230 million to $3,340 million reflecting midpoint growth rates of 3.7% and 11.0%, respectively.

For more information about American Tower, please visit the “Earnings Materials” and “Company & Industry Resources” sections of our investor relations website at www.americantower.com .\nNon-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures: Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO), AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated AFFO per Share, AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn. In addition, the Company presents: Tenant Billings, Tenant Billings Growth, Organic Tenant Billings Growth and New Site Tenant Billings Growth.\nThese measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group. As outlined in detail below, the Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure, while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business.\nDepreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost basis, are involved. The Company's Non-GAAP and Defined Financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nRevenue Components\nIn addition to reporting total revenue, the Company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for, and operating performance of, its real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components: (i) Tenant Billings, (ii) New Site Tenant Billings; (iii) Organic Tenant Billings; (iv) International pass-through revenue; (v) Straight-line revenue; (vi) Pre-paid amortization revenue; (vii) Foreign currency exchange impact; and (viii) Other revenue.\nTenant Billings: The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases. Revenue from Tenant Billings reflects several key aspects of the Company’s real estate business: (i) “colocations/amendments” reflects new tenant leases for space on existing towers and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment; (ii) “escalations” reflects contractual increases in billing rates, which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index; (iii) “cancellations” reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non-renewals or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced; and (iv) “new sites” reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions.\nNew Site Tenant Billings: Day-one Tenant Billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior-year period. Incremental colocations/amendments, escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes providing New Site Tenant Billings enhances an investor’s ability to analyze our existing real estate portfolio growth as well as our development program growth, as the Company’s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period.\nOrganic Tenant Billings: Tenant Billings on sites that the Company has owned since the beginning of the prior-year period, as well as Tenant Billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the Company’s portfolio.\nInternational pass-through revenue: A portion of the Company’s pass-through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices. As a result, revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period, which is not representative of the Company’s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs. Furthermore, this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses, such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the Company’s markets. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass-through revenue on certain revenue growth rates.\nStraight-line revenue: Under GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases. Due to the Company’s significant base of non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases, this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals (typically increases), when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred. These signings and renewals are only a portion of the Company’s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our Tenant Billings Growth. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight-line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures.\nPre-paid amortization revenue: The Company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants. These upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease. Given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on our real estate portfolio, (i.e.: does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do) the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre-paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business.\nForeign currency exchange impact: The majority of the Company’s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country’s local currency. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from period to period, depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business.\nOther revenue: Other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue.\nNon-GAAP and Defined Financial Measure Definitions\nTenant Billings Growth: The increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of Tenant Billings for a current period with Tenant Billings for the corresponding prior-year period, in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring Tenant Billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio.\nOrganic Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to Organic Tenant Billings. The Company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period, which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness, and therefore the value, of the Company’s property assets.\nIndian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn: Tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short-term carrier consolidation in India. Includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation but excludes normal course churn. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event.\nNew Site Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to Tenant Billings from recently acquired or constructed properties.\nGross Margin: Revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets.\nOperating Profit: Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments.\nFor segment reporting purposes, the Latin America property segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income, TV Azteca, net. Operating Profit and Gross Margin are before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and income tax benefit (provision).\nOperating Profit Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across our telecommunications real estate sector.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.\nNareit Funds From Operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit), attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above, particularly depreciation expenses, given the high initial, up-front capital intensity of the Company’s operating model. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across our telecommunications real estate sector.\nConsolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO): Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the deferred portion of income tax, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above, which if unadjusted, may cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of our property assets in those periods. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across our telecommunications real estate sector.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency, given a significantly larger minority interest component of its business as a result of the Company’s Viom transaction and European joint venture with PGGM, which both closed in 2016.\nConsolidated AFFO per Share: Consolidated AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nAFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share: AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nFree Cash Flow: Cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures, including payments on capital leases of property and equipment. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in its industry, although this measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nNet Debt: Total long-term debt, including current portion, less cash and cash equivalents.\nNet Leverage Ratio: Net Debt divided by the quarter’s annualized Adjusted EBITDA (the quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four). The Company believes that including this calculation is important for investors and analysts given it is a critical component underlying its credit agency ratings.\nCautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our full year 2018 outlook and other targets, our expectations regarding Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn and factors that could affect our expectations, foreign currency exchange rates, our expectations for the closing of signed acquisitions and our expectations regarding the leasing demand for communications real estate. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand; (2) increasing competition within our industry for tenants may materially and adversely affect our revenue; (3) if our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected; (4) our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do; (5) our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (6) a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants; (7) our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk; (8) competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria; (9) new technologies or changes in a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results; (10) our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements; (11) if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow; (12) complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities; (13) restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT; (14) our towers, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; (15) our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated; (16) we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws; (17) if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results; and (18) if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated. For additional information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, under the caption “Risk Factors”. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.\nUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents $ 802.1 $ 787.2 Restricted cash 152.8 149.3 Short-term investments 1.0 4.0 Accounts receivable, net 513.6 308.4 Prepaid and other current assets 568.6 441.0 Total current assets 2,038.1 1,689.9 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net 11,101.0 10,517.3 GOODWILL 5,638.4 5,070.7 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, net 11,783.3 11,274.6 DEFERRED TAX ASSET 204.4 195.7 DEFERRED RENT ASSET 1,499.0 1,289.5 NOTES RECEIVABLE AND OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS 950.1 841.5 TOTAL $ 33,214.3 $ 30,879.2 LIABILITIES CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable $ 142.9 $ 118.7 Accrued expenses 854.3 620.5 Distributions payable 304.4 250.6 Accrued interest 166.9 157.3 Current portion of long-term obligations 774.8 238.8 Unearned revenue 268.8 245.4 Total current liabilities 2,512.1 1,631.3 LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 19,430.3 18,294.7 ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 1,175.3 965.5 DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY 898.1 777.6 OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 1,244.2 1,142.6 Total liabilities 25,260.0 22,811.7 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 1,126.2 1,091.3 EQUITY: Preferred stock, Series A — 0.1 Preferred stock, Series B 0.0 0.0 Common stock 4.4 4.3 Additional paid-in capital 10,247.5 10,043.5 Distributions in excess of earnings (1,058.1 ) (1,077.0 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (1,978.3 ) (1,999.3 ) Treasury stock (974.0 ) (207.7 ) Total American Tower Corporation equity 6,241.5 6,763.9 Noncontrolling interests 586.6 212.3 Total equity 6,828.1 6,976.2 TOTAL $ 33,214.3 $ 30,879.2 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 REVENUES: Property $ 1,678.3 $ 1,521.3 $ 6,565.9 $ 5,713.1 Services 26.2 18.3 98.0 72.6 Total operating revenues 1,704.5 1,539.6 6,663.9 5,785.7 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below): Property (including stock-based compensation expense of $0.3, $0.4, $2.1 and $1.7, respectively) 517.4 482.3 2,022.0 1,762.7 Services (including stock-based compensation expense of $0.2, $0.1, $0.8 and $0.7, respectively) 9.5 5.7 34.6 27.7 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 466.1 388.2 1,715.9 1,525.6 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including stock-based compensation expense of $21.6, $19.2, $105.6 and $87.5, respectively) (1) 171.1 138.3 637.0 543.4 Other operating expenses (2) 211.4 35.8 256.0 73.3 Total operating expenses 1,375.5 1,050.3 4,665.5 3,932.7 OPERATING INCOME 329.0 489.3 1,998.4 1,853.0 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense of $0.3, $0.3, $1.2, and $1.2, respectively 2.6 2.7 10.8 10.9 Interest income 8.8 9.2 35.4 25.6 Interest expense (190.1 ) (186.0 ) (749.6 ) (717.1 ) (Loss) gain on retirement of long-term obligations (0.3 ) 0.4 (70.2 ) 1.2 Other (expense) income (including unrealized foreign currency (losses) gains of ($3.9), ($19.9), $26.5 and ($23.4), respectively) (8.6 ) (21.9 ) 31.3 (47.7 ) Total other expense (187.6 ) (195.6 ) (742.3 ) (727.1 ) INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 141.4 293.7 1,256.1 1,125.9 Income tax provision (3) 53.4 (60.8 ) (30.7 ) (155.5 ) NET INCOME 194.8 232.9 1,225.4 970.4 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 43.7 (3.7 ) 13.5 (14.0 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION STOCKHOLDERS 238.5 229.2 1,238.9 956.4 Dividends on preferred stock (18.9 ) (26.8 ) (87.4 ) (107.1 ) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS $ 219.6 $ 202.4 $ 1,151.5 $ 849.3 NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE AMOUNTS: Basic net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 0.51 $ 0.48 $ 2.69 $ 2.00 Diluted net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders $ 0.51 $ 0.47 $ 2.67 $ 1.98 WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING (in thousands): BASIC 428,836 426,071 428,181 425,143 DILUTED 432,472 429,896 431,688 429,283\n(1) Includes $18.7 million in bad debt expense in Asia recognized in Q4 2017, primarily associated with Reliance Communications and MTS.\n(2) Reflects impairment charge of approximately $209 million recorded in Q4 2017, primarily related to assets in India.
