    "text": "LILONGWE, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Malawi aims to cut government borrowing and stick to an International Monetary Fund programme in order to boost the economic growth rate to 7 percent in the medium term, the finance minister said on Friday.\nGoodall Gondwe made the comments in his budget speech to parliament.\nThe impoverished southern African nation is recovering from drought-induced economic stagnation and remains heavily reliant on borrowing, with about a third of its $3.5 billion total debt coming from external lenders.
