(NYSE: DHX) (\"DHI\" or the \"Company\"), a leading online career resource and talent acquisition platform for technology professionals and other select professional communities, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We accomplished a number of things in the fourth quarter, including having all the senior leaders of the functional areas in place, so the organization can execute on our strategy and our product roadmap. The early results are encouraging and the cadence that we established in the fourth quarter has set a strong foundation for 2018,\" said Michael Durney, President and Chief Executive Officer of DHI Group, Inc. \"We initiated a number of product features and enhancements in the quarter and in the new year that we feel really good about. Given the favorable fundamentals of tech career services and the strong competitive environment, it's critical we move to capture market opportunity and ultimately work to return our business to growth.\"\nQ4 2017 Tech-Focused Product and Business Highlights\nNotable achievements as part of the tech-focused strategy:\nLaunched several product features and improvements, including a new homepage and search functionality for eFinancialCareers, our new Dice homepage in beta that has reduced bounce rates and increased application rates, and a new salary tool which has improved user engagement Completed a Company-wide migration to a cloud-based platform, which will drive cost savings, improve SEO, result in faster response time, and accelerate product development and experimentation \"Open Web First\" go-to-market strategy drove 51% year-over-year growth in Dice customers with Open Web, increasing penetration of Dice recruitment package customers to 39% as of December 31, 2017, up from 24% a year ago On-boarded 80 additional search API clients and now have more than 950 customers with API integrations as of December 31, 2017, a 50% increase year-over-year Dice Careers app cumulative downloads were 58% higher than December 31, 2016\nQ4 and Fiscal Year 2017 Segment Financial Highlights\n\"Fourth quarter results met our expectation of continuing modest top line trend improvement, and our continued focus on efficiency allowed us to maintain our levels of investment in product and marketing, without unduly impacting profitability,\" said Luc Grégoire, Chief Financial Officer. \"We begin 2018 well positioned to execute our tech-focused strategy and realize the significant opportunity in the growing online tech recruitment market. While it may take a bit more time for our product roadmap to gain momentum and improve financial performance, initial feedback on product initiatives gives us confidence we are on the right path.\"\nThe Company's two reportable segments are Tech-focused and Healthcare. The Tech-focused segment includes Dice, Dice Europe, ClearanceJobs, eFinancialCareers, and Brightmatter (absorbed into Tech-focused in the third quarter of 2017). The Healthcare segment includes Health eCareers, which was sold on December 4, 2017. Corporate and other includes Hcareers, Rigzone, BioSpace (transferred to BioSpace management effective January 31, 2018), as well as Slashdot Media (sold in January 2016) and getTalent, which has been discontinued.\nThe following tables summarize Revenues, Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin results for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 ($ in millions). A reconciliation of Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is included toward the end of this press release.\nQ4\n2017\nQ4\n2016\nChange\nFx\nImpact\nFY\n2017\nFY\n2016\nChange\nFx Impact\nRevenues\nTech-focused\n$\n39.8\n$\n41.7\n(5)%\n$\n0.5\n$\n158.4\n$\n170.6\n(7)%\n$\n(1.2)\nHealthcare (1)\n4.6\n6.4\n(28)%\n—\n24.4\n27.1\n(10)%\n—\nCorporate & Other\n6.5\n6.8\n(4)%\n—\n25.2\n29.3\n(14)%\n(0.1)\nTotal Revenues\n$\n50.9\n$\n54.9\n(7)%\n$\n0.5\n$\n208.0\n$\n227.0\n(8)%\n$\n(1.3)\nNet Income (loss) (2)\n$\n11.8\n$\n5.5\n115%\n$\n16.0\n$\n(5.4)\nn.m.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share (2)\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.11\n118%\n$\n0.33\n$\n(0.11)\nn.m.\n(1) Sold on December 4, 2017.\n(2) Unusual items impacting comparability to previous periods increased net income by $8.8 million, including a tax benefit of $4.7 million\nrelated to certain discrete tax items, or $0.18 per share in Q4 2017, and increased net income $0.7 million, related to a tax benefit of $0.8\nmillion from certain discrete tax items in Q4 2016.

Q4 2016 included certain legal costs.\n(3) Reconciliations of Net Income and Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA and of Operating Cash Flows to Adjusted EBITDA are included toward the end of this press release.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company expects current top line trends to continue initially, with improvement later in the year as new products gain adoption with tech professionals and recruiters. Investments in marketing will continue at fourth quarter run rates and product development will increase, funded with efficiency gains in other functional areas. This outlook results in an Adjusted EBITDA margin that is in line with our 2017 Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding items that impact comparability to prior periods, and excluding the impact of the upcoming new revenue recognition accounting changes. On today's conference call, management will discuss additional details of its tech-focused strategy, including context around the financial impact of the Company's 2018 strategic objectives and operational plans.\nUpdate on Divestiture of Non-Core Assets\nAs previously announced, on December 4, 2017 the Company completed the sale of Health eCareers for $15.0 million, resulting in a $6.7 million pre-tax gain.\nThe Company has progressed on its strategy for the remainder of its non-tech portfolio. The Company expects to finalize a deal to sell the data services division of the Rigzone business in the first quarter. The career services division of Rigzone will remain a part of DHI. The Company continues to respond to interest in the Hcareers business and is exploring a possible deal for the brand. Ownership of the BioSpace business has recently been transferred to BioSpace management, with DHI retaining a minority stake.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company accompanied by a presentation of supporting materials to discuss fourth quarter and full year results today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation expense, other non-recurring income or expense (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company's management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes. The non-GAAP measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measures as shown within this document. The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures elsewhere in the document.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics used by management to measure operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors. The Company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business, certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement up to $250,000, deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, writeoff of non-cash stock compensation expense, and business interruption insurance proceeds, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, interest income, and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors, management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value.\nWe also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our Credit Agreement contain ratios based on this measure. Our Credit Agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity. If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our Credit Agreement that are based on Adjusted EBITDA may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our Credit Agreement.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives contain forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations. These statements often include words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate\" or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, our review of strategic alternatives from time to time, our ability to execute our tech-focused strategy, the review of potential dispositions of certain of our businesses and the terms and timing of any such transactions, the results and timing of our search for a new Chief Executive Officer, competition from existing and future competitors in the highly competitive market in which we operate, failure to adapt our business model to keep pace with rapid changes in the recruiting and career services business, failure to maintain and develop our reputation and brand recognition, failure to increase or maintain the number of customers who purchase recruitment packages, cyclicality or downturns in the economy or industries we serve, the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future departure from the European Union, including uncertainty in respect of the regulation of data protection and data privacy, failure to attract qualified professionals to our websites or grow the number of qualified professionals who use our websites, failure to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions, U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility or refinance our indebtedness and restrictions on our current and future operations under such indebtedness. These factors and others are discussed in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), all of which are available on the Investors page of our website at www.dhigroupinc.com , including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 to be filed with the SEC, under the headings \"Risk Factors,\" \"Forward- Looking Statements\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nYou should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by the Company or its representatives herein, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by applicable law.\nDHI GROUP, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF
