    "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s customs-cleared annual exports in January likely grew at a faster pace than in the previous month, a Reuters poll showed, as global demand remains strong.\nThe poll’s median forecast was for exports, a key driver of Thai growth, to increase 11.05 percent in January from a year earlier.\nIn December, exports rose 8.6 percent from a year earlier.\nThe commerce ministry targets export growth of 8 percent this year after a 9.9 percent rise in 2017, despite a strong baht THB=TH , which is hovering near four-year highs.\nJanuary imports may have risen 15 percent from a year earlier after jumping 16.6 percent in December, the poll showed.\nThailand is expected to have recorded a trade surplus of $330 million in January, according to the poll, following a deficit of $278 million in December.\nReporting by Orathai Sriring and Chinthathip Nanthavong; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
