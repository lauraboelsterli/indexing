    "text": "(All financial information is in U.S. dollars, and all earnings per share results are diluted, unless otherwise noted).\nFourth quarter 2017 net loss of $5.42 per share; earnings before items 1 of $0.64 per share Price increases announced for pulp and several uncoated freesheet grades Announced a 4.8% dividend increase\nFORT MILL, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Domtar Corporation (NYSE: UFS) (TSX: UFS) today reported a net loss of $340 million ($5.42 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net earnings of $70 million ($1.11 per share) for the third quarter of 2017 and net earnings of $47 million ($0.75 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.3 billion.\nExcluding items listed below, the Company had earnings before items 1 of $40 million ($0.64 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to earnings before items 1 of $65 million ($1.03 per share) for the third quarter of 2017 and earnings before items 1 of $47 million ($0.75 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 items :\nNon-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with Personal Care of $578 million ($573 million after tax); Closure and restructuring costs of $2 million ($1 million after tax); Deferred tax benefit of $186 million related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. Tax Reform); and Net gain on disposal of property, plant & equipment of $9 million ($8 million after tax).\nThird quarter 2017 items :\nGain on disposal of property, plant & equipment of $4 million ($3 million after tax); and Partial reversal of contingent consideration related to an acquisition of $2 million ($2 million after tax).\nFourth quarter 2016 items :\nClosure and restructuring impact of $(1) million ($(1) million after tax); and Negative impact of purchase accounting of $1 million ($1 million after tax).\nFISCAL YEAR 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nAs a result of its annual goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment tests, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $578 million associated with Personal Care. Growing competitive market pressures in the healthcare and retail markets over the last year, including the entry of new competitors in the private label category, excess industry capacity and the decline of healthcare spending by governmental agencies, are expected to result in lower than previously anticipated sales and operating margins. In light of this weakened market outlook, our current business forecast was not sufficient to support the carrying value of the goodwill associated with Personal Care, leading to the impairment.\nCommenting on the full-year results, John D. Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “We generated nearly $450 million of operating cash flow and continued our solid track record of rewarding shareholders with a high payout ratio while maintaining financial flexibility. Our performance, combined with our confidence in our cash flow generating capabilities, enable us to announce a 4.8% dividend increase. Looking ahead, we remain focused on maximizing long-term profitability and value creation.”\nQUARTERLY REVIEW\n“As expected, higher maintenance and seasonally higher operating costs impacted our fourth quarter Pulp and Paper results,” said John D. Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Nevertheless, pulp price realizations were higher and we shipped record volumes of tissue grade and fluff pulp. Recently announced price increases across a number of pulp and paper grades are expected to drive continued momentum into 2018.”\nCommenting on Personal Care, Mr. Williams added, “While we had good results in 2017, we have concluded that the performance of our Personal Care business will continue to be impacted by an increasingly competitive market. We remain optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of the absorbent hygiene market; however, this increasingly competitive market will negatively impact our sales, and we expect the environment to remain challenging for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the goodwill impairment charge is non-cash. It does not alter our current financial flexibility, and our overall cash generating capabilities remains strong.”\nOperating loss was $512 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to operating income of $89 million in the third quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization totaled $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating income before items 1 was $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an operating income before items 1 of $83 million in the third quarter of 2017.\n(In millions of dollars) 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 Sales $ 1,337 $ 1,292 Operating income (loss) Pulp and Paper segment 58 93 Personal Care segment (564 ) 8 Corporate (6 ) (12 ) Total operating (loss) income (512 ) 89 Operating income before items 1 59 83 Depreciation and amortization 82 80 The operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was a result of the goodwill impairment charge, higher maintenance and raw material costs, lower productivity and higher costs, when compared to the operating income in the third quarter of 2017. These factors were partially offset by higher selling prices and volume and favorable exchange rates.\nWhen compared to the third quarter of 2017, manufactured paper shipments were up 1% and pulp shipments increased 9%. The shipments-to-production ratio for paper was 100% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 97% in the third quarter of 2017. Paper inventories increased by 1,000 tons and pulp inventories decreased by 50,000 metric tons when compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to $125 million and capital expenditures were $71 million, resulting in free cash flow 1 of $54 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Domtar’s net debt-to-total capitalization ratio 1 stood at 28% at December 31, 2017 compared to 26% at September 30, 2017.\nIn 2017, cash flow from operating activities amounted to $449 million and capital expenditures were $182 million, resulting in free cash flow 1 of $267 million.\nDECLARATION OF DIVIDEND\nThe Board of Directors approved a 4.8% increase to its quarterly dividend (from $0.415 per share to $0.435 per share) on its common stock. The Board of Directors declared a dividend payable on April 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 2, 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nIn 2018, costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, are expected to marginally increase. Our paper shipments should benefit from expected industry capacity closures, while paper prices should improve following the recently-announced price increases and pulp will benefit from volume growth in fluff. Personal Care is expected to be negatively impacted by an unfavorable tender balance, resulting in lower volume and operating margins.\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results.

Management believes that the financial metrics are useful to understand our operating performance and benchmark with peers within the industry.

These metrics are presented as a complement to enhance the understanding of operating results but not in substitution for GAAP results.\nPulp and Paper Personal Care (1) Corporate Total Q1'16 Q2'16 Q3'16 Q4'16 Year Q1'16 Q2'16 Q3'16 Q4'16 Year Q1'16 Q2'16 Q3'16 Q4'16 Year Q1'16 Q2'16 Q3'16 Q4'16 Year Reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to \"Operating income (loss) before items\"\nOperating income (loss) ($) 19 35 89 74 217 14 15 15 13 57 (15) (11) (12) (13) (51) 18 39 92 74 223 (+) Impairment of property, plant and equipment ($) 21 3 5 — 29 — — — — — — — — — — 21 3 5 — 29 (+) Impact of purchase accounting ($) — — — — — — — — 1 1 — — — — — — — — 1 1 (+) Closure and restructuring costs ($) 2 21 10 (2) 31 — — — 1 1 — — — — — 2 21 10 (1) 32 (+) Litigation settlement ($) — — — — — — — — — — — 2 — — 2 — 2 — — 2 (=) Operating income (loss) before items ($) 42 59 104 72 277 14 15 15 15 59 (15) (9) (12) (13) (49) 41 65 107 74 287 Reconciliation of \"Operating income (loss) before items\" to \"EBITDA before items\"\nOperating income (loss) before items ($) 42 59 104 72 277 14 15 15 15 59 (15) (9) (12) (13) (49) 41 65 107 74 287 (+) Depreciation and amortization ($) 73 72 71 68 284 16 15 16 17 64 — — — — — 89 87 87 85 348 (=) EBITDA before items ($) 115 131 175 140 561 30 30 31 32 123 (15) (9) (12) (13) (49) 130 152 194 159 635 (/) Sales ($) 1,085 1,054 1,054 1,046 4,239 216 228 231 242 917 — — — — — 1,301 1,282 1,285 1,288 5,156 (=) EBITDA margin before items (%) 11% 12% 17% 13% 13% 14% 13% 13% 13% 13% — — — — — 10% 12% 15% 12% 12% “Operating income (loss) before items”, “EBITDA before items” and “EBITDA margin before items” have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Operating income (loss) or any other earnings statement, cash flow statement or balance sheet financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is important for readers to understand that certain items may be presented in different lines by different companies on their financial statements, thereby leading to different measures for different companies.\n(1) On October 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Home Delivery Incontinent Supplies Co. in the United States.\nDomtar Corporation\nSupplemental Segmented Information\n(In millions of dollars, unless otherwise noted)\n2017 2016 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Year Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Year Pulp and Paper Segment Sales ($) 1,073 999 1,054 1,090 4,216 1,085 1,054 1,054 1,046 4,239 Operating income ($) 34 65 93 58 250 19 35 89 74 217 Depreciation and amortization\n($) 64 63 63 64 254 73 72 71 68 284 Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n($) — — — — — 21 3 5 — 29 Paper Paper Production ('000 ST) 709 715 745 724 2,893 785 715 726 714 2,940 Paper Shipments - Manufactured\n('000 ST) 745 698 722 726 2,891 786 752 744 739 3,021 Communication Papers ('000 ST) 622 582 597 600 2,401 657 627 620 618 2,522 Specialty and Packaging Papers\n('000 ST) 123 116 125 126 490 129 125 124 121 499 Paper Shipments - Sourced from 3rd parties\n('000 ST) 29 26 29 25 109 32 29 35 27 123 Paper Shipments - Total ('000 ST) 774 724 751 751 3,000 818 781 779 766 3,144 Pulp Pulp Shipments (a) ('000 ADMT) 453 383 424 462 1,722 369 360 369 415 1,513 Pulp Shipments mix (b) : Hardwood Kraft Pulp (%) 4 % 3 % 7 % 5 % 5 % 5 % 4 % 4 % 8 % 5 % Softwood Kraft Pulp (%) 67 % 62 % 61 % 54 % 61 % 66 % 61 % 63 % 63 % 63 % Fluff Pulp (%) 29 % 35 % 32 % 41 % 34 % 29 % 35 % 33 % 29 % 32 % Personal Care Segment Sales ($) 249 241 253 262 1,005 216 228 231 242 917 Operating income (loss) ($) 16 13 8 (564 ) (527 ) 14 15 15 13 57 Depreciation and amortization\n($) 16 16 17 18 67 16 15 16 17 64 Impairment of goodwill ($) — — — 578 578 — — — — — Average Exchange Rates $US / $CAN 1.323 1.344 1.253 1.272 1.297 1.375 1.289 1.305 1.333 1.325 $CAN / $US 0.756 0.744 0.798 0.786 0.771 0.727 0.776 0.766 0.750 0.755 € / $US 1.066 1.100 1.175 1.178 1.130 1.103 1.130 1.116 1.078 1.107 (a) Figures represent Pulp Shipments to third parties.\n(b) Percentages include Pulp Shipments to our Personal Care segment.\nNote: the term “ST” refers to a short ton and the term “ADMT” refers to an air dry metric ton.\n1 Non-GAAP financial measure.
