(“CME” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ/Prague Stock Exchange - CETV) today announced financial results for the full year and three months ended December 31, 2017.\nFollowing the previously announced agreement to sell our Croatia and Slovenia operations, these businesses are classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations for all periods. The discussion in this release relates to our continuing operations in the four remaining operating segments.\nOperational and financial highlights:\nTV advertising revenues increased 8% at actual rates and 5% at constant rates in 2017. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased 17% at actual rates and 15% at constant rates. OIBDA increased 21% at actual rates and 17% at constant rates, resulting in OIBDA margin expansion of nearly 300 basis points to 29%. Operating income increased 23% at actual rates and 19% at constant rates. Unlevered free cash flow in 2017 increased 19% at actual rates, while lower debt service obligations contributed to a 61% increase in net cash generated from continuing operations. In 2018, we anticipate using increased cash generated by the business, proceeds from the sale of our operations in Croatia and Slovenia, expected proceeds from warrant exercises, and savings from lower debt service obligations to repay a significant balance of principal on our outstanding long-term debt. Taken together, these actions would result in a net leverage ratio around 3x by the end of the year. Upon closing of the sale transaction and repayment of debt, we expect our average borrowing cost to be 4.5%.\nMichael Del Nin, co-Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Our 2017 results represent our fourth straight year of both uninterrupted margin expansion and actual OIBDA growth above 20%. We anticipate that revenue growth, combined with our ongoing focus on cost containment, will drive another year of robust growth in profitability and continued margin expansion in 2018. Together with lower debt and reduced borrowing costs, this sets us up for a process of accelerated deleveraging that we think will characterize the year ahead.\"\nChristoph Mainusch, co-Chief Executive Officer, added: \"2017 was another outstanding year for CME and the positioning of our operations sets us up for additional success in 2018. We increased our audience share in three out of four countries, driving the gap between us and our closest commercial competition wider, both in prime time and all day. We also made important progress in diversifying our revenues. We expect to continue building on these successes, as we invest and innovate to remain the best partner for advertisers in our countries.\"\nIn this release we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow, unlevered free cash flow and constant currency percentage movements. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information, including definitions and reconciliations to US GAAP financial measures.\nConsolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were:\nRESULTS (US$ 000's, except per share data) For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Actual % Lfl (1) Net revenues $ 574,212 $ 526,174 9.1% 5.5% Operating income 129,949 105,532 23.1% 18.8% Operating margin 22.6% 20.1% 2.5 p.p. 2.5 p.p.

These segments reflect how CME Ltd.’s operating performance is evaluated by our chief operating decision makers, who we have identified as our co-Chief Executive Officers, how operations are managed by segment managers, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nWe evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. Stock-based compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective OIBDA. Intersegment revenues and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBelow are tables showing our net revenues and OIBDA by segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, (US $000's) 2017 2016 %Act %Lfl ( 1) Net revenues Bulgaria $ 77,341 $ 72,651 6.5% 3.7% Czech Republic 209,041 190,372 9.8% 3.5% Romania 191,244 172,951 10.6% 9.5% Slovak Republic 97,721 90,549 7.9% 4.7% Intersegment revenues (1,135) (349) NM (2) NM (2) Total net revenues $ 574,212 $ 526,174 9.1% 5.5% For the Three Months Ended December 31, (US $000's) 2017 2016 %Act %Lfl (1) Net revenues Bulgaria $ 25,223 $ 22,548 11.9% 2.5% Czech Republic 73,515 61,814 18.9% 3.4% Romania 63,261 54,682 15.7% 9.0% Slovak Republic 34,373 31,083 10.6% 1.3% Intersegment revenues (218) (100) NM (2) NM (2) Total net revenues $ 196,154 $ 170,027 15.4% 4.6% (1) % Lfl (like-for-like) variance reflects the impact of applying the current period average exchange rates to the prior period revenues and costs.

(2) Number is not meaningful. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this release we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow. We believe that each of these metrics is useful to investors for the reasons outlined below. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, US GAAP financial measures.\nWe evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. We believe OIBDA is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of our performance, as it excludes certain items that do not impact either our cash flows or the operating results of our operations. OIBDA and unlevered free cash flow are also used as components in determining management bonuses.\nOIBDA includes amortization and impairment of program rights and is calculated as operating income / loss before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and impairments of assets and certain unusual or infrequent items that are not considered by our co-Chief Executive Officers when evaluating our performance. Stock-based compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective OIBDA. Our key performance measure of the efficiency of our consolidated operations and our segments is OIBDA margin. We define OIBDA margin as the ratio of OIBDA to net revenues.\nFollowing a repricing of our Guarantee Fees in March 2017, the proportion of interest and related Guarantee Fees on our outstanding indebtedness that must be paid in cash has increased. In addition to this obligation to pay more Guarantee Fees in cash, we expect to use cash generated by the business to pay certain Guarantee Fees that are payable in kind. These cash payments are all reflected in free cash flow; accordingly we believe unlevered free cash flow, defined as free cash flow before cash payments for interest and Guarantee Fees, best illustrates the cash generated by our operations when comparing periods. We define free cash flow as net cash generated from continuing operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of disposals of property, plant and equipment and excluding the cash impact of certain unusual or infrequent items that are not included in costs charged in arriving at OIBDA because they are not considered by our co-Chief Executive Officers when evaluating performance.\nFor additional information regarding our business segments, see Part II, Item 8, Note 20, \"Segment Data\" in our Form 10-K.\nWhile our reporting currency is the dollar, our consolidated revenues and costs are divided across a range of European currencies and CME Ltd.’s functional currency is the Euro. Given the significant movement of the currencies in the markets in which we operate against the dollar, we believe that it is useful to provide percentage movements based on actual (“% Act”) percentage movements, which includes the effect of foreign exchange, as well as like-for-like percentage movements (“% Lfl”). The like-for-like percentage movement references reflect the impact of applying the current period average exchange rates to the prior period revenues and costs. Since the difference between like-for-like and actual percentage movements is solely the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, our discussion in this release includes constant currency percentage movements in order to highlight those factors influencing operational performance. The incremental impact of foreign exchange rates is presented in the tables accompanying such analysis.\nFor the Year For the Three Months (US $000's) Ended December 31, Ended December 31, (unaudited) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating income $ 129,949 $ 105,532 $ 57,750 $ 45,461 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 26,991 23,106 7,646 5,972 Amortization of intangible assets 8,592 8,270 2,243 2,023 Total OIBDA $ 165,532 $ 136,908 $ 67,639 $ 53,456 For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net cash generated from continuing operating activities $ 95,321 $ 59,387 Capital expenditure, net of proceeds from disposals (24,742 ) (22,201 ) Free cash flow 70,579 37,186 Cash paid for interest (includes mandatory cash-pay guarantee fees) 40,619 50,611 Cash paid for guarantee fees that may be paid in kind 1,735 7,464 Unlevered free cash flow from continuing operations $ 112,933 $ 95,261\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006432/en/\nCentral European Media Enterprises\nMark Kobal, +420 242 465 576\nHead of Investor Relations\nmark.kobal@cme.net\nSource: Central European Media Enterprises Ltd.",
