    "text": "Ford's North America president Raj Nair is leaving the company, effective immediately. \nThe announcement follows an internal investigation into reports of inappropriate behavior, Ford said Wednesday. The inquiry determined \"certain behavior by Nair was inconsistent with the company's code of conduct.\"\n\"We made this decision after a thorough review and careful consideration,\" said Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett. \"Ford is deeply committed to providing and nurturing a safe and respectful culture and we expect our leaders to fully uphold these values.\"\nShares of the second largest US automaker were flat in after hours trading. Ford said it would announce a replacement in the near future. \nNair had been President of Ford North America since Jul. 1. He had previously been head of global product development and chief technical officer. \n\"I sincerely regret that there have been instances where I have not exhibited leadership behaviors consistent with the principles that the Company and I have always espoused,\" Nair said. \"I continue to have the utmost faith in the people of Ford Motor Company and wish them continued success in the future.\"\nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",
