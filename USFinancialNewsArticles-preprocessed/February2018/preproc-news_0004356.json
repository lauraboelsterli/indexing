    "text": " 17 p.m. ET Share \nNone of today’s smartphones would work on technology, but it has implications for other machines and devices, such as self-driving cars Bloomberg \nBy Ryan Knutson \nSprint Corp. S, +4.31% said it planned to launch a commercial fifth-generation, or 5G, network in early 2019, putting it roughly in line with its rivals’ rollout plans as it charts a new course following the collapse of merger talks late last year with T-Mobile US Inc. \nIt isn’t entirely clear how necessary 5G will be for smartphone users: most 4G connections are already fast enough to stream HD video and play online games. None of today’s smartphones would work on the technology. \nBut 5G networks have implications for other machines and devices, such as self-driving cars. Sprint said the 5G network will benefit its parent company SoftBank Group Corp. 9984, -1.40% which—in addition to owning Sprint—also has a major investment in Uber Technologies Inc. \nAfter talks with T-Mobile TMUS, +0.50% unraveled, Sprint said in November that it would spend $5 billion to $6 billion annually on its network this year, up from the $3.5 billion to $4 billion it projected for last year.",
