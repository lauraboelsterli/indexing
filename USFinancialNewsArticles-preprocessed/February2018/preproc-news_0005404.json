    "text": "Feb 2 (Reuters) - Troubled doorstep lender Provident Financial has appointed acting chairman Malcolm Le ‎May as its CEO with immediate effect, the company said on Friday.\nLe ‎May, who was appointed to Provident’s board in 2014, fills a position that has been open since August, when a second profit warning in quick succession prompted the departure of CEO Peter Crook and suspension of its dividend.\nThe British sub-prime lender has been hit by unresolved problems at its door-to-door lending business, with the group’s woes compounded by investigations by Britain’s financial watchdog into two of its units.
