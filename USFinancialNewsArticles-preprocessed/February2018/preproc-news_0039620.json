    "text": "MADRID, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Failed Spanish lender Banco Popular had losses of 13.6 billion euros ($16.9 billion) last year when it was rescued by European authorities and taken over by bigger rival Banco Santander, it said in a regulatory notice late on Friday.\nThe news will likely add to a controversy between investors who lost money in the rescue and authorities and Santander who say the sale of Popular, saddled with bad debt and facing a run on its deposits, for one nominal euro in June, was the best possible solution for depositors.\nInvestors whose shares and bonds in the bank were wiped out and are now seeking redress say the sale was based on a “flawed” negative valuation. An independent report from Deloitte showed the bank could have been worth up to 1.3 billion euros when it was sold.\nSantander carried out a 7-billion-euro capital raise to cover for property writedowns at Popular and said restructuring costs, including the lay-off of around 2,000 staff, could total 1.3 billion euros.
