This focus was evident once again in the strong operational results demonstrated across all segments in the fourth quarter. Total Company adjusted EBITDA grew sequentially, driven by strong project execution and key milestone achievements on several projects in both Subsea and Onshore/Offshore. Surface Technologies results were broadly in-line with the solid third quarter performance. We are extremely pleased with these results along with the many operational, commercial, and strategic accomplishments of our first year as TechnipFMC.”\n“Full year Subsea orders of $5.1 billion increased 27 percent from the prior year, reflecting a book-to-bill approaching one. In Subsea, we recorded $1.7 billion in orders for the quarter; this included our 6 th , and first major, iEPCI™ award for the VNG Norge Fenja project in Norway. Total Company orders were $3 billion in the quarter, and year-end backlog stands at $13 billion.”\nPferdehirt continued, “In 2018, we expect to see another increase in subsea market activity, driven by major projects as well as a blend of small-to-mid size projects and service opportunities. We remain confident that our inbound orders will grow year-over-year and that as much as 25 percent of these orders will come from iEPCI™ in 2018.”\n“In Onshore/Offshore, we were awarded Bapco’s Sitra refinery expansion in Bahrain, which follows our successful completion of the FEED study. We remain confident in further downstream awards in the near-term. Our front-end engineering activity is also signaling a resurgence in the natural gas market, with notable prospects in North America, the Arctic region and the Middle East. We are further encouraged by growth in our medium-to-long term prospects, which could provide considerable inbound opportunity in the coming years.”\n“In the North American surface market, we see increased activity in unconventional resources, driven by further improvement in rig count and increased frac intensity. In 2018, we believe that revenues for our North American business will begin to approach the levels we achieved at the cycle peak in 2014. We also expect international markets will return to growth in 2018, although at a more moderate pace than North America. The Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Europe are positioned for the strongest growth.”\nPferdehirt concluded, “We will balance investment for growth against returning capital to our investors and will continue the dividend and share repurchase activity we initiated last year. Our strong execution performance and market acceptance of our integrated business model and new technologies, combined with our continued focus on cost and efficiency, positions us well to deliver strong performance in 2018.”\nOperational and Financial Highlights – Fourth Quarter 2017\nSubsea\nFinancial Highlights 2\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are detailed below and in the financial schedules.\n(In millions) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(Pro Forma)\nChange Revenue $1,292.2 $2,024.1 (36.2%) Operating profit $67.4 $146.3 (53.9%) Adjusted EBITDA $244.1 $395.9 (38.3%) Adjusted EBITDA margin 18.9% 19.6% (70 bps) Inbound orders $1,724.8 Backlog $6,203.9 Subsea reported fourth quarter revenue of $1,292.2 million. Revenue was down 36.2 percent from the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in project activity within the Europe and Africa as well as Asia Pacific regions. Revenue continues to be negatively impacted by prior period declines in inbound orders related to the market downturn.\nSubsea reported operating profit of $67.4 million; adjusted EBITDA was $244.1 million with a margin of 18.9 percent. Operating profit margin decreased from the prior year as a result of the revenue decline, although strong project execution and cost reduction initiatives mitigated the negative impact of reduced project activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased only 70 basis points from the prior-year results despite a 36.2 percent decline in revenue, and benefitted from the same factors that impacted operating profit margin.\nVessel utilization rate for the fourth quarter was 65 percent, down from 70 percent in the third quarter and from 78 percent in the prior year.\nFourth Quarter Subsea Highlights\nTotal Kaombo\nThe installation campaign for umbilicals, spools, and other subsea components continues, followed by hook-up of the FPSO.\nShell Appomattox\nSubsea tree assembly and testing of industry’s first extreme high pressure / high temperature (15,000psi / 400°F) subsea production system is progressing well.\nStatoil Trestakk iEPCI™\nWork on the subsea infrastructure is ongoing and preparations well underway for offshore installation campaign.\nSubsea inbound orders for the quarter were $1,724.8 million. The following awards were announced in the period:\nVNG Norge Fenja iEPCI™ Project in Norwegian Sea\nAward for integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (iEPCI™) which covers the provision of subsea equipment including umbilicals, risers, flowlines and the subsea production system.\nStatoil Snorre Expansion Project in North Sea\nAward for the engineering, procurement, and construction of the Snorre Expansion which covers the delivery of subsea production systems and includes six subsea templates and subsea production equipment.\nMurphy Sabah Oil Block H Gas Development Project in Malaysia\nAward for the engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and commissioning (EPCIC) of the umbilicals, risers, and flowlines as well as installation.\nEstimated Backlog Scheduling as of December 31, 2017 (In millions)\nSubsea 2018 $3,358.7 2019 $1,566.2 2020 and beyond $1,279.0 Total $6,203.9 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential for subsea services.\nOnshore/Offshore\nFinancial Highlights 2\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are detailed below and in the financial schedules.\n(In millions) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(Pro Forma)\nChange Revenue $2,019.5 $2,060.9 (2.0%) Operating profit (loss) $257.2 $(55.0) n/m Adjusted EBITDA $294.5 $134.6 118.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin 14.6% 6.5% 810 bps Inbound orders $874.2 Backlog $6,369.1 Onshore/Offshore reported fourth quarter revenue of $2,019.5 million. Revenue declined 2 percent from the prior-year quarter. Revenue was modestly lower as we neared completion of the first phase of Yamal LNG, largely offset by increased project activity in the Europe, Middle East, and Asia Pacific regions.\nOnshore/Offshore reported operating profit of $257.2 million; adjusted EBITDA was $294.5 million with a margin of 14.6 percent. Operating profit and margin improved year-over-year due to solid execution and the achievement of key milestones on several major projects, including Yamal LNG. These same factors drove the significant year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin; adjusted EBITDA margin increased 810 basis points from the prior-year results.\nFourth Quarter Onshore/Offshore Highlights\nYamal LNG\nTrain 1 start-up successful with first cargo loaded in December 2017, with additional cargos achieved to date. Construction and commissioning of Trains 2 and 3 progressing with Train 2 start-up planned for the second half of 2018.\nSIBUR Zapsib 2\nEngineering completed at the end of December, with most equipment already on site and construction activities ongoing.\nENOC Jebel Ali Refinery Upgrade\nMechanical as well as electrical and instrumentation subcontracts awarded.

Project award follows our successful completion of the FEED study and will be executed on an engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) lump sum turnkey basis. Slated for completion in 2022.\nNote: This award will be reflected in financial results in the first quarter of 2018. Additionally, the Company is not the majority owner of the joint venture and therefore will not fully consolidate the financial results. Inbound orders and backlog for the project will only reflect work awarded directly to affiliates of TechnipFMC by the joint venture.\nEstimated Backlog Scheduling as of December 31, 2017 (In millions)\nOnshore/Offshore 2018 $4,236.3 2019 $1,494.3 2020 and beyond $638.5 Total $6,369.1 Backlog does not capture all revenue potential in future periods given reimbursable scope portions of existing contracts.\nSurface Technologies\nFinancial Highlights 2\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are detailed below and in the financial schedules.\n(In millions) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(Pro Forma)\nChange Revenue $372.3 $303.6 22.6% Operating profit (loss) $53.3 $(5.3) n/m Adjusted EBITDA $75.8 $17.5 333.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin 20.4% 5.8% 1,460bps Inbound orders $392.9 Backlog $409.8 Surface Technologies reported fourth quarter revenue of $372.3 million. Revenue increased 22.6 percent from the prior-year quarter as a result of the increase in North American well completion activity, while international markets remained stable across our products and services portfolio.\nSurface Technologies reported operating profit of $53.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $75.8 million with a margin of 20.4 percent.\nOperating profit and margin improved significantly year-over-year due to robust North America surface activity favorably impacting product mix as well as cost savings benefits. These same factors drove the year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin.\nInbound orders for the quarter improved sequentially to $392.9 million. Backlog was $409.8 million. Given the short-cycle nature of the business, most orders are quickly converted into sales revenue; longer contracts are typically converted within twelve months.\nCorporate Items\nCorporate expense in the fourth quarter was $86.8 million. Excluding charges and credits of $44.8 million associated with the merger, corporate expense was $42 million.\nNet interest expense was $122.8 million in the quarter, which included an increase in the liability payable to joint venture partners of $90.8 million.\nThe Company recorded a tax provision during the fourth quarter of $295.8 million, which included charges of $138.2 million related to tax reform 3 , mostly in the United States. The quarterly rate also reflects an increase in valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions for which no future profitability is expected, as well as certain project costs realized in the quarter for which no tax benefit is allowed. Excluding the impact of these discrete items and tax law changes, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 33 percent.\nTotal depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $153 million, including depreciation and amortization related to purchase price accounting for the merger of $35.1 million.\nCapital expenditures were $85.3 million during the fourth quarter.\nThe Company repurchased two million shares during the quarter for total consideration of $54.9 million. The Company remains committed to repurchasing the full authorization of up to $500 million in ordinary shares no later than the end of 2018.\n2 All prior year period comparisons are to pro forma results for 2016 as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016 and fully consolidated the Yamal LNG joint venture for the full period.\n3 Included in the charges related to tax reform is the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. tax reform), effective January 1, 2018, which creates a territorial tax system and reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent. Also included in the charges related to tax reform are French corporate tax surcharges resulting from the 2017 Finance Act introduced in late 2017.\nTechnipFMC recorded $134.9 million of discrete charges as a result of the new U.S. law. These one-time, non-cash charges are comprised of a transition tax (a mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries) and a charge related to revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. These charges are subject to revision as the Company concludes its analysis of the impact of the new law. The Company anticipates that no cash taxes will be due as a result of the transition tax.\nGuidance\nThe Company’s full-year guidance 3 for 2018 is provided below. The following update is reflected in the outlook:\nOnshore/Offshore revenue in a range of $5.3 – 5.7 billion; EBITDA margin 4 of at least 10.5% (excluding charges and credits); margin guidance has been increased from the previous guidance of at least 9.5%.\nThe following items are unchanged from the previous outlook:\nSubsea revenue in a range of $5.0 – 5.3 billion; EBITDA margin 4 of at least 14% (excluding charges and credits). Surface Technologies revenue in a range of $1.5 – 1.6 billion; EBITDA margin 4 of at least 17.5% (excluding charges and credits).\n2018 Guidance * Items updated February 21, 2018 Subsea Onshore/Offshore Surface Technologies Revenue in a range of $5.0 – 5.3 billion Revenue in a range of $5.3 – 5.7 billion Revenue in a range of $1.5 – 1.6 billion EBITDA margin 4 at least 14% (excluding amortization related impact of purchase price accounting, and other charges and credits) EBITDA margin 4 at least 10.5%* (excluding amortization related impact of purchase price accounting, and other charges and credits) EBITDA margin 4 at least 17.5% (excluding amortization related impact of purchase price accounting, and other charges and credits) TechnipFMC Corporate expense $40 – 45 million per quarter (excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations) Net interest expense approximately $20 – 22 million per quarter (excluding the impact of revaluation of partners’ redeemable financial liability) Tax rate 28 – 32% for the full year (excluding the impact of discrete items) Capital expenditures approximately $300 million for the full year Merger integration and restructuring costs approximately $100 million for the full year Cost synergies $450 million annual savings ($200 million exit run-rate 12/31/17, $400 million exit run-rate 12/31/18, $450 million exit run-rate 12/31/19)\n4 Our guidance measure, adjusted EBITDA margin, is a non-GAAP measure. We are unable to provide a reconciliation to a comparable GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because of the unpredictability of the individual components of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the variability of items excluded from such measure. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future financial results.\nTeleconference\nThe Company will host a teleconference on Thursday, February 22, 2018 to discuss the fourth quarter 2017 financial results. The call will begin at 1 p.m. London time (8 a.m. New York time). Dial-in information and an accompanying presentation can be found at www.technipfmc.com .\nWebcast access will also be available on our website prior to the start of the call.

The financial results reflect the following information:\nOn January 16, 2017, TechnipFMC was created by the business combination of Technip S.A. (Technip) and FMC Technologies, Inc. (FMC Technologies). In December of 2016, Technip increased its ownership in the Yamal LNG joint venture and became the controlling shareholder. Under U.S. GAAP, this would have resulted in full consolidation of the joint venture on the date of the transaction.\nThe Non-GAAP results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017:\nInclude the results of Technip for the full period; Include the results of FMC Technologies for the period January 17 to December 31, 2017; revenue of $112.9 million during the period from January 1 to January 16, 2017 were excluded, of which approximately 70 percent from Subsea and the remainder from Surface Technologies; and Fully consolidate the Yamal LNG joint venture for the full period, within the Onshore/Offshore segment.\nThe Non-GAAP pro forma results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016:\nInclude the results of both Technip and FMC Technologies for the full period; Combine FMC Technologies’ former Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructure segments to form the pro forma Surface Technologies segment; Purchase price accounting adjustments applied on an equal basis to results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 to provide comparability; and Fully consolidate the Yamal LNG joint venture for the full period, within the Onshore/Offshore segment.\nWhen referencing these financial statements, adjusted EBITDA is also used to describe EBITDA excluding amortization related to the impact of purchase price accounting and other charges and credits.\nTECHNIPFMC PLC AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (In millions, unaudited)\nCharges and Credits\nIn addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and describes performance on a year-over-year basis against 2016 pro forma results and measures. Net income, excluding charges and credits, as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS, excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes, excluding charges and credits (\"Adjusted Operating profit\"); Depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period, and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income (loss) attributable to TechnipFMC plc Net (income) loss\nattributable to noncontrolling interests\nProvision for income taxes Net interest expense Income before net interest expense and income taxes (Operating profit) Depreciation and amortization Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) TechnipFMC plc, as reported $ (153.9) $ (26.4) $ 295.8 $ (122.8) $ 291.1 $ 153.0 $ 444.1 Charges and (credits): Impairment and other charges 11.7 - 6.8 - 18.5 - 18.5 Restructuring and other severance charges 73.5 - 42.7 - 116.2 - 116.2 Business combination transaction and integration costs 10.6 - 4.0 - 14.6 - 14.6 Change in accounting estimate - - - - - - - Purchase price accounting adjustments 10.8 - 4.0 - 14.8 (35.1) (20.3) Tax reform 138.2 (138.2) - - - Adjusted financial measures $ 90.9 $ (26.4) $ 215.1 $ (122.8) $ 455.2 $ 117.9 $ 573.1 Pro Forma Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\n(including legacy FMC Technologies and PPA adjustments) Net income (loss) attributable to TechnipFMC plc Net (income) loss\nattributable to noncontrolling interests and net income (loss) from discontinued operations\nProvision for income taxes Net interest expense Income before net interest expense and income taxes (Operating profit (loss)) Depreciation and amortization Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) TechnipFMC plc, as pro forma $ (100.6) $ 26.1 $ 88.4 $ (14.6) $ (23.7) $ 234.8 $ 211.1 Charges and (credits): Impairment and other charges (4.2) - (2.4) - (6.6) - (6.6) Restructuring and other severance charges 175.3 - 89.9 - 265.2 - 265.2 Business combination transaction and integration costs 51.4 - 25.1 - 76.5 - 76.5 Purchase price accounting adjustments 10.8 - 4.0 - 14.8 (35.1) (20.3) Adjusted financial measures $ 132.7 $ 26.1 $ 205.0 $ (14.6) $ 326.2 $ 199.7 $ 525.9 TECHNIPFMC PLC AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (In millions, unaudited) Charges and Credits\nIn addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and describes performance on a year-over-year basis against 2016 pro forma results and measures.
