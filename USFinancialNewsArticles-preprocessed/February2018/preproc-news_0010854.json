    "text": "NEW YORK, NY, Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Boustead Securities, LLC (“Boustead Securities”) and its affiliate, FinTech Clearing, LLC, are pleased to announce the hiring of Robert Maley as Senior Managing Director – Investment Banking, as well as the planned opening of the firm’s New York Office.

Mr. Maley also brings senior level experience in financial services and risk management, including as a Director Investment Banking Advisory for Compliance-Risk Concepts, and previously as the President and CEO of Gilford Securities, as well as the President and CFO of Gilford Financial Corporation.\n“We are looking forward to working with Robert to build the New York and East Coast presence of Boustead Securities,” said Boustead Securities CEO Keith Moore. “Robert’s experience covers a broad spectrum of investment banking services, from developing clients, conducting offerings, to compliance, and leadership.
