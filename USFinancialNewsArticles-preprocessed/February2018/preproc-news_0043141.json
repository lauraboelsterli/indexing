    "text": "SOMERSET, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Catalent, Inc. (NYSE: CTLT), the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics and consumer health products, today announced the addition of three new members to its Board of Directors and the retirement of Board member James Quella after nine years of valued service.\nJoining the Board are Rosemary A. Crane, John J. Greisch, and Dr. Christa Kreuzburg. Commenting on the new directors, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer John Chiminski stated, “We are very excited to add three accomplished individuals to our Board. Their enormous collective experience in healthcare and pharmaceutical operations, finance, and product development will be of substantial benefit to the entire Board and to Catalent as we continue to mature as a fully independent public company.”\nCommenting on the retirement of Mr. Quella, Mr. Chiminski said, “James has been an important part of Catalent’s transformation from a private equity portfolio company to a vibrant and growing leader in pharmaceutical services. I want to note especially the Board’s appreciation for his long service on important Board committees, critically important work that too often goes unsung. We thank James for all he has given Catalent during his distinguished tenure.”\nMs. Crane, 58, is currently a member of the board of directors of each of Edge Therapeutics, Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited, and Zealand Pharma A/S, and has previously served as a director of Unilife Corporation, Cipher Pharmaceuticals, MELA Sciences, Inc., Epocrates Inc., and Targanta Therapeutics.
