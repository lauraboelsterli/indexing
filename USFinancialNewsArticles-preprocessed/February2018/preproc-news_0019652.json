Eliot will continue to work with Andrew and the Immunocore leadership team to assist the transition and a search for his successor is underway.\nJonathan Knowles, Chairman of the Immunocore Board of Directors, said : \"I would like to express my sincere appreciation for Eliot's achievements as CEO. He spearheaded Immunocore's transformation into a world leading T cell receptor company and one of the UK's biotechnology flag-carriers.\n\"With its lead candidate, IMCgp100, a first-in-class therapeutic for patients with metastatic uveal and cutaneous melanoma, now in a confirmatory phase of development, with a pivotal uveal melanoma study recruiting, Immunocore is advancing the preparation of its commercial strategy and developing its infrastructure more broadly.\n\"Andrew is an outstanding leader with years of valuable pharmaceutical industry experience. We anticipate a smooth transition during this next phase in the Company's development.\"\nDr Forster said: \"After three transformational years, and in alignment with the future strategic needs of the business, I've decided this is the right moment for me to hand over the leadership reins.\n\"The business is now heading into the next promising phase of its evolution and in guiding Immunocore into this position, I feel I've completed the job I set out to do.\n\"Immunocore is now a world-class company, with an outstanding and talented team, and I'm proud to have played my part in its transformation.\"\nAndrew Hotchkiss, Chief Executive Officer of Immunocore, said: \"Immunocore is a fantastic company built on a strong scientific foundation, which has the potential to transform patient care. I would personally like to thank Eliot for his tremendous leadership in advancing our promising pipeline of assets closer to patients. I'm looking forward to working with Immunocore's leadership team and Board as we drive our exciting technology towards the market.\"\nAndrew joined Immunocore as Chief Commercial Officer in 2017. In his new role as CEO, he will also sit on the Immunocore Board.\n- Ends -\nFor more information, please contact:\nImmunocore\nAndrew Hotchkiss, Chief Executive Officer\nE: info@immunocore.com\nFollow on Twitter: @Immunocore\nConsilium Strategic Communications\nMary-Jane Elliott/Jessica Hodgson/Chris Welsh/Laura Thornton\nT: +44 (0)203 709 5700\nE: Immunocore@consilium-comms.com\nFollow on Twitter: @ConsiliumHC\nNotes for editors\nAbout Immunocore\nImmunocore, a leading TCR (T Cell Receptor) company, is developing first-in-class therapeutics that have the potential to transform the lives of people with serious diseases.
