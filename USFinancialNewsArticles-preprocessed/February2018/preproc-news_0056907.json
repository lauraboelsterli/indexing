    "text": "Feb 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Microchip Technology is in talks to buy Microsemi Corp, the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\nThe potential deal will value Microsemi at mid-$60s per share and a deal could be struck as early as this week, the source told Reuters.\nMicrosemi has a market capitalization of $7.55 billion, based on the stock's Monday close.\nThe company was exploring its options, including a possible sale, after it received a takeover approach, Reuters reported last month.\nThe deal, if finalized, comes amid a new wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry.\nBroadcom Ltd on Monday had called a proposal by U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc for a new meeting to negotiate an increase to Broadcom's $117 billion acquisition offer \"engagement theater\" aimed at dodging a takeover battle.\nArizona-based Microchip purchased fellow chipmaker Atmel in January 2016 for $3.42 billion in cash and stock.\nMicrochip and Microsemi did not respond to request for comments outside regular business hours.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier Microchip is nearing a deal to buy Microsemi.
