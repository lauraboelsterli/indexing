    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Lucas Pouille won his fifth ATP title by beating Richard Gasquet 7-6(2) 6-4 in an all French final at the Open Sud de France in Montpellier on Sunday.\nThe second seed was solid on serve throughout, not facing a single break point as he prevailed on his fourth match point for his first title of the year.\nIt was Gasquet’s sixth consecutive final in Montpellier, but his second defeat in a row after he was beaten by Germany’s Alexander Zverev last year.\nGasquet won the title here in 2013, 2015 and 2016.\nGasquet saved three break points and forced a tiebreak in the first set. Pouille won two points on his opponent’s first serve to win it 7-2 and take the lead.\nPouille broke decisively in the seventh game of the second set and did not look back.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Clare Lovell\n ",
