    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. You know something I admire about Cristiano Ronaldo? It’s not just his flair with a football or his trademark wink—it’s the fact he’s willing to spokesmodel for seemingly any brand that asks. It’s hardly surprising he said yes when Nike came-a-knockin’—but then there was the “ safety-oriented steel brand ” Egyptian Steel, Castrol Oil , an antidandruff shampoo …and this ad for a Japanese “facial fitness” gizmo that has to be seen to be believed . His latest? A commercial for luggage brand American Tourister , which shows the Real Madrid forward causing a kerfuffle at an airport.\nThink Different As we’ve been documenting in this newsletter, there are a heck of a lot of media agency reviews going on at the moment. So much so that Publicis Groupe has predicted a “Mediapalooza 2”—a repeat of 2015, when an unusually high number of brands put their accounts up for review. (Hat-tip to @joecacola for some great suggestions for the Mediapalooza rebrand . Big fan of “2 Media 2Furious.”) This time around, things are a little different, Adweek reports. Media reviews of the past were often driven by driving down costs, but there’s now more of a focus on data and tech . Also, many marketers have been bringing a lot of their media operations in-house. Tom Denford, chief strategy officer of ID Comms, an advertising consultancy leading many of the reviews, tells me, “Media agencies will need to reposition themselves more as value-adding strategic thought leaders—consultancy—and the large media-buying operations—such as GroupM, etc.—will exist separately and probably evolve into data, audience and inventory providers to brands, under separate contracts from the agencies.”\nHeavy Load We’ve heard a lot recently about TV giants experimenting with cutting down the number of commercials they air during their shows to reduce clutter and turn that ad scarcity into higher ad prices. But those experiments don’t appear to be a widespread trend. Things are actually going the other way, according to an analysis of U.S. TV trends in January by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. As ratings continued to decline, networks increased their commercial loads to make up for the shortfall in impressions. Mr. Wieser said national commercial loads across the industry were up 3.9% on average to 11 minutes an hour across all Nielsen-tracked programming in January. “This represented the most significant year-over-year increase in average commercial loads since July 2015,” Mr. Wieser wrote in a research note. He added that if ad loads had stayed at a constant level year over year, the national commercial impressions delivered would have dropped by double digits in January, rather than the 7.3% decline reported.\nChannel Surfing U.S. TV networks hunting for good news may find some cheer in this report from Digiday. Amazon will start offering ad-supported streaming channels to its Amazon Channels service in the U.S. later this year. (The company has been allowing access to ad-supported channels such as Discovery in European markets for a while.) This will differ from the current Amazon Channels program, which focuses on subscriptions and offers Prime members access to networks such as HBO and CBS without the need for a cable subscription. It isn’t exactly clear how financially additive those ad-funded channels are to networks in Europe, but it certainly opens up another revenue stream and chance to place network brands in front of cord-cutters. While we’re on an Amazon tear, Digiday separately reports the company is testing letting publishers run commerce-focused articles on Amazon.com and collect an affiliate fee if someone makes a purchase from them.\nFinesse The music marketing playbook typically dictates new artists establish themselves with a debut album, but the streaming age is turning that conventional wisdom on its head. Take “Bodak Yellow” rapper Cardi B. As The Wall Street Journal reports, she had an incredible 2017: a No.1 hit, collaboration after collaboration, two Grammy nominations. All without releasing an album . As the piece notes, the singles-led trend of music’s newest breakout musicians recalls early girl groups such as the Ronettes. Of course, Cardi B was an internet celebrity and reality TV star before she embarked on her music career, which will have given the marketing team at Atlantic Records a head start. But other burgeoning artists, with the help of streaming platforms and social media, are doing away with the typical release cycle, which requires more of an always-on marketing approach than the big bang of TV, outdoor, radio and press interviews staged around an album launch.\nBest of the rest A federal judge Tuesday denied AT&T’s bid for information on internal government discussions about its proposed Time Warner deal. AT&T has argued the government’s case was influenced by President Donald Trump’s opposition to the deal and his disdain for Time Warner’s CNN. [ WSJ ]\nAdam&Eve/DDB Chief Creative Officer Ben Priest is leaving the agency in June. Mr. Priest, who is one of the company’s co-founders, says he doesn’t plan to work for another agency. [ Campaign ]\nSlow payments are putting a strain on ad tech vendors, and the problem is getting worse as more dollars shift to programmatic advertising. [ AdExchanger ]\nWalmart bought Jet less than 18 months ago, and it’s already cutting its marketing spend for the online store. The company said it’s going to put more focus on acquiring customers for its main Walmart website, which has national brand recognition, compared with Jet, which caters more to higher-income, urban shoppers. [ WSJ ]\nDish disclosed subscriber numbers for its online-only pay-TV package Sling has for the first time. Sling TV has 2.2 million subscribers, but those customers weren’t enough to offset an overall decline in pay-TV subscribers, which fell to 13.2 million in Dish’s fourth quarter from 13.7 million the year before. [ WSJ ]\nAirbnb’s shift to offer “experiences” has been a slog.
