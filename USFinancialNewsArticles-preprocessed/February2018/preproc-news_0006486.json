    "text": "DALLAS, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Southwest Corporation (“Capital Southwest” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:CSWC), an internally managed Business Development Company focused on providing flexible financing solutions to support the acquisition and growth of middle market businesses, announced today the tax treatments of its 2017 dividends.\nCapital Southwest paid dividends totaling $1.16 per share that are attributable to the tax year ended December 31, 2017, with approximately 27.9% of those dividends taxed as long-term capital gains, approximately 16.7% taxed as qualified dividends and approximately 55.4% taxed as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends paid to non-corporate taxpayers (including individuals) qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") and, for 2017, will generally be subject to a maximum 20% U.S. federal income tax rate (plus a 3.8% Medicare surtax, if applicable). The Company has posted information regarding the U.S. federal income tax characteristics of its dividends that are attributable to 2017 (the \"2017 Form 1099 Information\") on its website ( http://www.capitalsouthwest.com/tax-information ).\nNon-U.S. resident and foreign corporation shareholders (\"Non-U.S. Shareholders\") in a Regulated Investment Company (\"RIC\") such as Capital Southwest are exempt from U.S. withholding tax on both \"interest-related\" dividends and short-term capital gains in accordance with the IRC sections 871(k) and 881(e). In addition, Non-U.S. Shareholders in a RIC are also exempt from U.S. withholding tax on long-term capital gains. Approximately 94.5% of Capital Southwest’s 2017 dividends relate to \"interest-related\" dividends, short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. See the \"Tax Treatment of 2017 Dividends for Non-U.S. Shareholders\" posted on the Company's website for more details ( http://www.capitalsouthwest.com/tax-information ).\nDividends distributed to Non-U.S. Shareholders may have been withheld to pay U.S. federal income tax. Non-U.S. Shareholders should contact their tax advisor with any questions regarding this information, and its application to any claim for refund of taxes paid to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nAbout Capital Southwest\nCapital Southwest Corporation (Nasdaq:CSWC) is a Dallas, Texas-based, internally managed Business Development Company, with approximately $293 million in net assets as of September 30, 2017.
