Photo: Becky Luigart-Stayner Mahita Gajanan \nFor some, Feb. 22 is just another Thursday in the middle of winter. \nBut unofficially, there is one big reason to celebrate: it’s National Margarita Day . Maybe you prefer the tequila drink frozen into an adult slushy or served over ice with a chili-lime-salt rim. Perhaps your preferred margarita is blended up with strawberries or another fruit, or maybe you love the original lime tang of the drink. No matter what, margaritas scream fun — and somehow taste better when they aren’t full price. \nSeveral restaurants throughout the country will have deals on Thursday, Feb. 22 in honor of National Margarita Day 2018. Check out the best margarita deals below. And if you don’t your favorite restaurant in the list, stop by your local Mexican restaurant or bar to see if they’re offering any margarita day deals. \nChili’s is celebrating margaritas all month long. The national chain is offering $5 margaritas for the month of February. \nWe’re crushing hard this month. All day, every day $5. Chambord",
