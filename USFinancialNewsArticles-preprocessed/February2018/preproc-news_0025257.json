(\"Elite\" or the “Company\") (OTCBB:ELTP), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing abuse-deterrent opioids and niche generic products, announced results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended December 31, 2017 (“Third Quarter”).\nConsolidated revenues for the third quarter were $2.5 million, an increase of $0.2 million or approximately 9% from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to growth across Elite’s generic product lines. Elite continued to invest heavily in product developmentwhich resulted in the positive outcome in a pilot study conducted on SequestOX™ and, in February, the filing of an ANDA for the first product being co-developed with SunGen Pharma.\nConference Call Information\nElite's management will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter financial results for fiscal year 2018 ended December 31st and provide an update on recent business developments. Stockholder questions should be submitted to the company in advance of the call.\nDate: Monday, February 12, 2018 Time: 11:30 AM EST Dial-in numbers: 1-800-346-7359 (domestic) 1-973-528-0008 (international) Conference number: 98840 Questions: dianne@elitepharma.com by 8:00 PM EST on Friday, February 9, 2018 Audio Replay: http://ir.elitepharma.com/events_presentations The financial statements can be viewed for Elite’s Third Quarter 2018 on Form 10-Q at http://ir.elitepharma.com/sec_filings .\nAbout Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nElite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company which is developing a pipeline of proprietary pharmacological abuse deterrent opioid products as well as niche generic products. Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products which have high barriers to entry. Elite owns generic and OTC products which have been licensed to TAGI Pharma, Epic Pharma, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Elite currently has nine commercial products being sold, five products filed with the FDA, additional approved products pending manufacturing site transfer and the NDA filing for SequestOx™. Elite’s lead pipeline products include abuse-deterrent opioids which utilize the Company’s patented proprietary technology and a once-daily opioid. These products include sustained release oral formulations of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. These formulations are intended to address two major limitations of existing oral opioids: the provision of consistent relief of baseline pain levels and deterrence of potential opioid abuse. Elite also provides contract manufacturing for Ascend Laboratories (a subsidiary of Alkem Laboratories Ltd.). Elite operates a GMP and DEA registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing located in Northvale, NJ.
