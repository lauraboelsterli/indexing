    "text": "We asked Marie-Claire Sabogal, head concierge at the Merrion Hotel, to plan us a special, singular day in Dublin: \nAfter a leisurely breakfast in our Garden Room, you would take a gentle stroll through Georgian Dublin with a private guide.\nFrom there you'd be whisked to the historic Croke Park stadium , home to Ireland's national games of hurling and Gaelic football. A private tour of the stadium would include a breathtaking sky walk across its roof, which offers unparalleled views of the city.\nLunch would follow at the Michelin-starred Chapter One , where chef-patron Ross Lewis and his team serve dishes from a bespoke tasting menu.\nRelated: 5 Great Things to Do in Dublin \nBack to the Merrion for afternoon tea, where the pastries are inspired by the hotel's art collection.\nDinner is the eight-course tasting menu at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud , Ireland's only two-star Michelin dining. Finish the day with a glass of rare Irish whiskey in front of an open fire in the drawing rooms.\nA version of this article appears in the March 2018 issue of Fortune as a sidebar in the article, \"See Dublin Like a Local.\" ",
