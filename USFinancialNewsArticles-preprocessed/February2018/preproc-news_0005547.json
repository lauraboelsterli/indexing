Jack Harris was introduced as the incoming Chairman of IMS at the November 2017 World Manufacturing Forum (WMF).\nHis focus during the U.S. Chairmanship will be small and medium enterprise (SME) manufacturing growth and sustainability through Industry 4.0 technologies, enabled by the launch of a new manufacturing innovation program entitled ManuVation 4.0. Mr. Harris will also focus on a new IMS model based on working with local and regional economic development groups in addition to federal governments. Supplementary to his role at IMS, he will become part of the steering body for the new Italian-based World Manufacturing Forum Foundation. As IMS contributes its WMF intellectual property to the foundation with partners from Confindustria and Politecnico di Milano, Mr. Harris will help guide development of the foundation.\nAbout IMS:\nIMS is an industry-led, international business innovation and research and development (R&D) program established to develop the next generation of manufacturing and processing technologies through multi-lateral collaboration.
