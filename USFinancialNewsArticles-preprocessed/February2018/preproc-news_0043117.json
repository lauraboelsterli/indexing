    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE-- Hispanica International Delights of America, Inc. (OTCQB:HISP) today announced that it has received approval from FINRA to formally change its name to “Life On Earth, Inc.” (OTCQB:LFER) effective immediately. The Company will begin trading under the new ticker symbol LFER starting February 20, 2018.\nThe new name better represents the Company’s strategic focus and long term forward vision, to accelerate the expansion of its own branded beverage and snack products with an added emphasis on the rapidly growing Functional, “Better for You”, Healthier, Cannabis and Hemp-based billion-dollar consumables market. Life On Earth’s new products will be marketed under its own brands through development, acquisition or distribution of existing and proven products that have achieved scalability.\n“We believe the growing mainstream acceptance of Cannabis and Hemp based products within the beverage, snack and medicinal markets offers significant revenue opportunities for the company. Leveraging our existing California coverage as a ‘launching pad’ for the upcoming products, we also plan to expand into our New York home market and beyond. In addition, we are negotiating to engage strategic partners to develop, market, and distribute our products as well as entry into potential joint venture agreements,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fernando Oswaldo Leonzo commented.\nIn conjunction with the name change, the Company has brought in new management and board advisors with expertise in development, distribution, marketing as well as other cannabis sector specific skills to help the existing management team navigate strategic implementation of these new initiatives.\n“We continue to demonstrate our ability to execute acquisitions, integrate operations, accounting systems and logistics to successfully lay the foundation for this launch. We aim to continue with our unique consumer brands to drive revenue growth and achieve an EBIDTA positive threshold,” concluded Mr. John Romagosa, the Company’s President.\nIn addition to the new corporate name, the Company has changed its ticker symbol on the OTCQB to ‘LFER’.\nwww.lifeonearthinc.com\nAbout Life On Earth, Inc.\nLife on Earth, Inc.
