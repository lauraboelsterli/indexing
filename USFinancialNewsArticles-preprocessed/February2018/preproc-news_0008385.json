    "text": "57 Mins Ago | 02:17 \nShares of Apple closed in correction territory on Friday, down slightly more than 10 percent from its all-time high of 180, which it hit on January 18. \nThe drop came on a day when the Dow dropped 665 points -- its worst week in two years -- and after a week in which the company reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations, but revealed weaker-than-expected December-quarter iPhone unit sales . \nThe report also revealed weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, leading many analysts to somewhat gloomier forecasts for the company. \n\"The verdict is in â€“ the iPhone X/8 cycle is disappointing,\" said an analyst at Bernstein. \"While Apple may launch a huge buyback, bolstering earnings for the next several years, we wonder if that is already priced into the stock, and note that Apple's longer term tax rate is likely to increase from FY 18 levels.\" Chloe Aiello News Associate for CNBC.com Related Securities",
