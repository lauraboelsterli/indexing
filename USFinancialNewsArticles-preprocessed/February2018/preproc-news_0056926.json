    "text": "Klay Thompson had 26 points, Kevin Durant had 22 and Stephen Curry added 21 to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 125-111 win over the New York Knicks on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.\nEmmanuel Mudiay had the best game of his short Knicks career with 20 points, including 18 in the first half, and seven assists, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 14 points for New York, which lost its second straight game and for the 10th time in its last 11.\nGolden State used an 11-0 run on 3-pointers by Draymond Green, Curry and Thompson and an alley-oop from Curry to JaVale McGee to take a 10-point advantage to start the third quarter after New York eked out a one-point halftime lead. The Warriors outscored the Knicks 39-18 in the third quarter, leading by as much as 23 in the process.\nMcGee added 10 points and Green finished with 10 points, six assists and two blocks to help the Warriors, who shot 52 percent from the field, 48 percent from three-point range, and 85 percent from the free-throw line.\nAll five Golden State starters picked up at least three assists as the Warriors finished with 31 assists on 44 field goals.\nNew York’s bench delivered in a big way as Trey Burke (18 points), Kyle O‘Quinn (14 points), Frank Ntilikina (13 points) shot a combined 21-for-37 from the field.\nNew York claimed a surprising first-quarter advantage as Mudiay went off early, scoring 14 points on 3-for-4 shooting from beyond the 3-point line. The Knicks survived Golden State’s hot first-quarter shooting (63 percent) by shooting 68 percent from the field themselves.\nThe Warriors stay on the road on Wednesday with a matchup at Washington before closing their trip with a Friday showdown at Atlanta. New York heads out on a four-game road trip, starting with a visit to Staples Center for a matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
