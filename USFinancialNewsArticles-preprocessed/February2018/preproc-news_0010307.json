    "text": "February 3, 2018 / 10:12 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Rugby-Uruguay qualify for 2019 World Cup with win over Canada Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMONTEVIDEO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Uruguay qualified for the Rugby World Cup for the first time on Saturday with a 32-31 win over Canada. \nThe result gave the South Americans a 70-60 aggregate win and means they will take their place in Japan next year in Pool D, alongside Australia, Wales, Georgia and Fiji. \nCanada, who have been to every World Cup since the tournament began in 1987, will now go into Novemberâ€™s four-team play-off for the 20th and final World Cup berth. \nUruguay won the first leg 38-29 in Vancouver last week but Canada looked like they might overcome that deficit and secure an aggregate win. \nThe visitors raced into a 15-0 lead with two early tries but Uruguay got a try of their own before the break to go in 18-10 behind. \nUruguay, however, took control early in the second period, scoring tries in the 41st and 64th minutes to take the lead. \nBoth sides continued to add points as the game swung back and forth but Uruguay held on, with flyhalf Berchesi Pisano kicking 17 points and centre Vilaseca Hontou getting two tries for the winners.
