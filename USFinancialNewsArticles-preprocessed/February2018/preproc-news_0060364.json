    "text": "Feb 27 (Reuters) - Canadian stock futures edged lower on Tuesday ahead of the government unveiling its federal budget and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first congressional testimony.\nCanadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to unveil a restrained budget, with just enough spending to assuage middle class voters under pressure from rising rates - while keeping his powder dry amid uncertainty over NAFTA.\nInvestor’s focus will also be on Powell when he faces questions from both houses of the U.S. Congress in a semi-annual testimony starting Tuesday, his first major set piece since he took over from Janet Yellen earlier this month.\nMost analysts expect no surprises from Powell regarding his view of U.S. economic growth and rates. However, his appearance comes at a sensitive period for the markets and Powell’s language will be scrutinized for any hints on the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes.\nMarch futures on the S&P TSX index were down 0.14 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. U.S. stock futures also dipped.\nDow e-minis were down 0.17 percent, while S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.19 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 0.16 percent.\nCanada's main stock index rose to a three-week high on Monday as gains in the prices of commodities such as gold and silver helped drive up shares of mining companies.
