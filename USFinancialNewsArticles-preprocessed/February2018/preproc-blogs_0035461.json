Tell the interviewer that you had a great career while working there and that you learned a lot, he suggests.\nshow chapters The 3 unusual questions a Google exec likes to ask employees      1:42 PM ET Wed, 29 March 2017 | 00:49 Another common error is blaming others for your mistakes. Again, this often occurs when asked why you're leaving a previous job or when you're asked what you didn't like about a previous employer, says Drexler.\nRemarks like \"I was let go because my boss had it out for me\" or \"I was removed from this project because my teammates were lazy\" have no place in an interview, says the interview expert.\n\"Don't ever make it personal with people that you used to work with,\" he says. \"Never say it wasn't my fault, blame people or make excuses.\"\nFinally, and most obvious of all, never curse in an interview. Drexler notes that some people are so used to dropping profanity in their everyday speech that they don't even notice themselves doing it in an interview. Curse words have simply become a part of their vocabulary, he says.\nOther times, people drop in \"four-letter words\" because they are so passionate about what they're saying. For example, \"I once had to take over a project that was a total s***show, but I managed to completely turn it around and deliver successful results.\"\n\"People know not to [curse],\" says Drexler, \"but sometimes people care so much they don't realize it.\"\nHowever, when you do these things, he says, \"you lose your integrity.\"\nLike this story?
