    "text": "By Don Reisinger 10:18 AM EST \nJeopardy! host Alex Trebek was at a loss for words after contestants on the wildly popular game show had more than a little trouble with football trivia. \nOn Thursday’s Jeopardy! show, contestants were faced with football clues, including what a “fair catch” means and what an “offsetting” penalty is. As each clue came and went, it was clear that the contestants weren’t exactly football fans. And with each clue, Trebek, who has hosted Jeopardy! for decades, became more exasperated. \n“Do you think we should go to commercial?” Trebek asked at one point. Before the final football clue, he said the contestants should look at the “final $1,000 clue, just for the fun of it!” \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nEach year, Jeopardy! has football-themed clues ahead of the Super Bowl. This Sunday on NBC , the New England Patriots will face off with the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. The game will be held at US Bank Stadium , home to the Minnesota Vikings. \nIn a nod to the Super Bowl, the last, $1,000 clue on Jeopardy! Thursday night asked contestants what the name was of the Minnesota Vikings’ famed defensive line that led the team to four Super Bowl victories. As you might expect, the contestants had no clue—and Trebek knew it. Fun fact: Our contestants answered as many clues in this category as the @Browns had wins this season. pic.twitter.com/KMaR8otIHe \n“If you guys ring in and get this one, I will die,” he said. He then told them the correct answer: Purple People Eaters. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
