    "text": "Diluted EPS for the year was $1.20, while adjusted diluted EPS was $1.61 Pre-closing activities for the Halyard Health S&IP acquisition continue according to plan\nRICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Owens & Minor, Inc. (NYSE: OMI) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, including consolidated revenues of $9.32 billion compared to the prior year’s revenues of $9.72 billion. Consolidated operating earnings for 2017 were $89.3 million versus $200 million last year. Adjusted consolidated operating earnings (non-GAAP) for 2017 were $180 million compared to adjusted operating earnings of $234 million for the same period last year. Net income for the year was $72.8 million, or $1.20 per share, versus $109 million, or $1.76 per share, for the same period last year. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $97.5 million, or $1.61 per share, compared to $134 million, or $2.17 per share, in 2016. Excluded from adjusted net income, was a benefit of $0.58 per share associated with recently enacted tax reform legislation. Reconciliations of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables below.\nWhile the company focused on executing the transformation strategy it launched in 2017, a number of external factors and market forces continued to affect overall performance throughout the year. Revenue shortfalls, ongoing margin pressure in the domestic distribution business, and increased costs to support new business in Europe negatively affected operating earnings. Partially offsetting these factors were benefits derived from expense control and productivity initiatives, as well as positive contributions from Byram Healthcare, which the company acquired on August 1, 2017.\n“2017 was a very challenging year for Owens & Minor,” said Phipps. “In order to deal with these challenges in 2018, we are taking aggressive steps to accelerate the transformation of our business toward a new future. We are reducing certain expenses while improving operational efficiency. At the same time, our teams are focused on serving our customers across our expanding geographic network. We are pleased with the contributions from our Byram Healthcare team, and we are all working intently to close the Halyard Health S&IP transaction. We believe that both of these transactions will strengthen and diversify our business model and will improve profitability.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, consolidated revenues were $2.39 billion, compared to revenues of $2.37 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Quarterly net income was $23.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the quarter was $21.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Adjusted net income excludes the benefit of the recently enacted tax reform act of $0.58 per share.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Owens & Minor reported a consolidated operating loss of $8.8 million compared to operating earnings of $49.0 million in the same period last year. Adjusted consolidated operating earnings (non-GAAP) for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $42.2 million, compared to $56.2 million in the prior year. Performance during the fourth quarter of 2017 was affected by increased price and margin compression, longer than expected sales cycles for the company’s fee-for-service businesses, and, more recently, product supply issues with certain larger manufacturers.\nAsset Management\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents was $105 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $185 million at December 31, 2016. For the year, the company reported operating cash flow of $56.8 million, compared to $188 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by changes in working capital. As of year-end, asset management metrics included consolidated days sales outstanding (DSO) of 28.7 compared to 23.1 days for 2016; consolidated inventory turns were 8.5 for 2017, compared to 9.2 for 2016. These metrics in 2017 were affected by changes in business mix along with changes in contractual terms with certain customers and suppliers.\nSegment Results\nSegment financial results for the year and the quarter are shown in the financial tables included with this release. Segment results include:\nDomestic Segment annual revenues were $8.79 billion compared to revenues of $9.19 billion a year ago. Fourth quarter 2017 revenues for the Domestic Segment were $2.28 billion, compared to $2.24 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year, segment operating earnings were $134 million compared to $165 million the year before, while quarterly operating earnings were $31.2 million compared to $39.3 million in the prior year. In the Domestic Segment, price and margin compression in the market negatively affected revenue and gross margin results. In addition, during the fourth quarter, the Domestic Segment incurred higher than expected healthcare costs and LIFO expense. Partially offsetting these results, were benefits derived from the company’s transformation and expense reduction initiatives. Byram Healthcare, which was acquired in August of 2017, positively affected annual results with a contribution of $209 million to net revenues. International Segment annual revenues were $392 million compared to prior year revenues of $344 million last year. Fourth quarter revenues were $104 million compared to 2016 fourth quarter revenues of $87.8 million. For the year, the segment operating loss was $3.9 million, compared to $5.6 million of operating earnings last year. For the fourth quarter, the International Segment had an operating loss of $3.1 million compared to operating earnings of $2.2 million in the prior year. The International Segment experienced a less favorable revenue mix, increased costs to onboard new customers, and a lag in implementing cost reduction activities. Proprietary Products Segment annual revenues were $504 million compared to $540 million last year. For the quarter, the segment provided revenues of $111 million, compared to $131 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year, segment operating earnings were $33.0 million compared to $53.8 million the year before, while quarterly operating earnings were $6.9 million compared to $11.9 million in the prior year. The operating earnings decline in the Proprietary Products Segment resulted from lower revenues from sourced products, as well as inventory write-offs. After stabilizing the production environment in 2017, the company has renewed its focus on growing the business.\nFinancial Guidance and Outlook\nOwens & Minor expects to provide its financial outlook for 2018 following the closing of the Halyard Health S&IP transaction, once final transaction details are known.

Net income per share, adjusted (Non-GAAP) $ 0.35 $ 0.55 $ 1.61 $ 2.17 The following items in the current quarter have been excluded in our non-GAAP financial measures:\n(1) Acquisition-related intangible amortization includes amortization of certain intangible assets established during purchase accounting for business combinations. These amounts are highly dependent on the size and frequency of acquisitions and are being excluded to allow for a more consistent comparison with forecasted, current and historical results and the results of our peers. We began to exclude these charges from our non-GAAP results in the second quarter of 2017 and thus prior year amounts have been recast on the same basis.\n(2) Acquisition-related charges in 2017 were primarily transaction and transition costs associated with the acquisition of Byram and the upcoming Halyard S&IP transaction. The prior year amounts related primarily to costs incurred to settle certain obligations and address other on-going matters associated with the acquisitions of ArcRoyal and Medical Action.\n(3) Exit and realignment charges in 2017 were associated with severance from reduction in force and other employee costs associated with the establishment of our new client engagement centers, the write-down of information system assets which are no longer used and other IT restructuring charges. Charges in 2016 included severance activities and other costs associated with our strategic organizational realignment which included certain professional fees and costs to streamline administrative functions and processes in the United States and Europe.\n(4) Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation costs associated with the upgrading of global IT platforms in connection with the redesign of our global information system strategy. SaaS implementation costs are recorded in other operating (income) expense, net.\n(5) These charges have been tax effected in the preceding table by determining the income tax rate depending on the amount of charges incurred in different tax jurisdictions and the deductibility of those charges for income tax purposes.\n(6) Includes a recognized income tax benefit of $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 associated with the estimated benefits under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In general, the measures exclude items and charges that (i) management does not believe reflect Owens & Minor, Inc.'s (the \"Company\") core business and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company's performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation.\nManagement provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on its financial and operating results and in comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214005495/en/\nOwens & Minor, Inc.\nTruitt Allcott, 804-723-7555\nDirector, Investor & Media Relations\ntruitt.allcott@owens-minor.com\nor\nChuck Graves, 804-723-7556\nDirector, Finance & Investor Relations\nchuck.graves@owens-minor.com\nSource: Owens & Minor, Inc.",
