    "text": " 30 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Gosling stuns Newcastle to snatch draw for Bournemouth Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - - Former Newcastle United midfielder Dan Gosling delivered a last-gasp equaliser against his former side to complete an astonishing Bournemouth comeback in a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. Slideshow (4 Images) Gosling popped up in the box to divert Nathan Akeâ€™s pass into the net in the 89th minute after Adam Smith had given the home side hope with a rocket of a shot to wrong foot the Newcastle goalkeeper on 80 minutes. The visitors had been cruising towards successive league wins for the first time since September after Dwight Gayle ended his 14-game goal drought by scoring twice before the interval. His first was a cheeky back-heel to convert a cross by former Newcastle striker Matt Ritchie and his second a simple tap-in. Newcastle supporters gave former Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe a predictably hostile reception when he came off the bench after two months out with an ankle injury.
