    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 8:34 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Roof to close on opening Six Nations tussle Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCARDIFF (Reuters) - The roof at the Principality Stadium will be closed for Saturday’s Six Nations clash between Wales and Scotland on what is expected to be a wet afternoon in Cardiff. \nScotland had initially requested that the roof remain open for the duration of the game and the rules dictate that both teams must request if the roof is to be closed, as the 74,500-seater venue braces for a rainy day. \nScotland told their counterparts on Tuesday they provisionally wanted the roof to stay open but also sought an option to reconsider later in the week. They have now agreed to its closure, officials said. \n”We would like dry conditions, so if it’s dry conditions outside there’s no need to close the roof, if it’s not, then let’s close the roof and have a really good game,” Scotland coach Gregor Townsend has said. \nWales coach Warren Gatland has said: “My opinion of the roof is it’s our stadium and we should decide whether it’s open or closed.” \nSaturday’s match marks the start of this year’s championship and sees Scotland, on the back of strong form in their November internationals, travel in hope of a first win since 2002 in Cardiff. \nThey are up against a Wales team who have an extensive list of players unavailable because of injury.
