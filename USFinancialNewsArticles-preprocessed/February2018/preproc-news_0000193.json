    "text": "Fiscal 2018 second quarter revenue of $536.3 million, up 20% versus prior year period\nFiscal 2018 second quarter operating income of $72.4 million, up 24% versus prior year period\nFiscal 2018 second quarter adjusted operating income of $118.0 million, up 23% versus prior year period\nNEW YORK, Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Madison Square Garden Company (NYSE:MSG) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter, the Company generated revenues of $536.3 million, an increase of 20% as compared with the prior year period. In addition, the Company generated fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income of $72.4 million and adjusted operating income of $118.0 million, which represent increases of 24% and 23%, respectively, both as compared to the prior year second quarter. (1) (2)\nExecutive Chairman and CEO Jim Dolan said, “For the fiscal 2018 second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenues and adjusted operating income, fueled by our continued focus on providing the very best in live experiences. Our performance this quarter was highlighted by strong bookings results, record revenue for the Christmas Spectacular and broad-based growth across our Sports segment. With regard to our venue expansion strategy, we continue to make important progress on the design of our Las Vegas venue. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ongoing ability to deliver attractive long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.”\nResults from Operations\nSegment results for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:\nRevenues Operating\nIncome (Loss) Adjusted Operating\nIncome (Loss) $ millions F’Q2\n2018\nF’Q2\n2017\n%\nChange F’Q2\n2018\nF’Q2\n2017\n%\nChange F’Q2\n2018\nF’Q2\n2017\n%\nChange MSG Entertainment $ 271.2 $ 192.5 41% $ 74.5 $ 57.0 31% $ 81.9 $ 63.7 29% MSG Sports 265.1 252.7 5% 49.3 40.2 23% 55.1 47.2 17% Corporate and Other — — NM (45.5 ) (38.7) (18)% (19.0 ) (14.9) (27)% Purchase accounting adjustments — — NM (5.9 ) (0.2) NM — — NM Total Company $ 536.3 $ 445.2 20% $ 72.4 $ 58.3 24% $ 118.0 $ 96.0 23% Note: Does not foot due to rounding\nSee page 3 of this earnings release for the definition of adjusted operating income (loss) included in the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Fiscal 2017 second quarter operating results did not include TAO Group, Counter Logic Gaming and Obscura Digital, which the Company acquired on January 31, 2017, July 28, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively. Accordingly, the Company's results for fiscal 2018 are not directly comparable to fiscal 2017 results. In addition, the Company records TAO Group's operating results in its consolidated statements of operations on a three-month lag basis.\nMSG Entertainment\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to the prior year period, MSG Entertainment revenues of $271.2 million increased 41%. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of operating results for TAO Group and higher overall event-related revenues at the Company's venues, as well as an increase in revenues for the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes production. The increase in event-related revenues was primarily due to higher revenues at The Theater at Madison Square Garden, the Forum, The Garden and The Chicago Theatre. The increase in revenues for the Christmas Spectacular production was primarily due to higher ticket-related revenue, mainly as a result of higher average ticket prices and the impact of additional scheduled performances, partially offset by a decrease in average per-show paid attendance.\nFiscal 2018 second quarter operating income of $74.5 million increased 31% and adjusted operating income of $81.9 million increased 29%, both as compared to the prior year period. The increases primarily reflect higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in direct operating expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in direct operating expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of TAO Group's operating results and higher overall event-related expenses at the Company's venues. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of TAO Group’s operating results (including a management fee incurred by TAO Group payable to the Company) and higher corporate general and administrative costs and professional fees.\nMSG Sports\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to the prior year period, MSG Sports revenues of $265.1 million increased 5%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher sponsorship and signage revenues, professional sports teams' pre/regular season ticket-related revenue and food, beverage and merchandise sales, as well as higher local media rights fees from MSG Networks Inc., suite rental fees and league distributions. This was partially offset by lower event-related revenues from other live sporting events.\nSecond quarter operating income of $49.3 million increased 23% and adjusted operating income of $55.1 million increased 17%, both as compared to the prior year period. The increases primarily reflect higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in direct operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in direct operating expenses was primarily due to higher other team operating expenses, net provisions for NBA and NHL revenue sharing expense, net provisions for certain team personnel transactions, and expenses associated with food, beverage and merchandise sales, partially offset by lower event-related expenses for other live sporting events and venue operating costs.\nCorporate and Other\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to the prior year period, Corporate and Other’s operating loss of $45.5 million and adjusted operating loss of $19.0 million increased 18% and 27%, respectively, primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits and the inclusion of certain selling, general and administrative expenses for Obscura Digital, partially offset by a management fee earned for providing management and strategic services to TAO Group.\nPurchase Accounting Adjustments\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter as compared to the prior year period, operating expenses related to purchase accounting adjustments of $5.9 million increased $5.6 million, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets and expense related to the step-up in value of leases for TAO Group.\nOther Items\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, the Company purchased a nearly 5-acre site in London, zoned for commercial and leisure use and adjacent to the Westfield Stratford City shopping center, for $79.5 million (£60.0 million). This amount excludes transactional taxes, a significant majority of which is recoverable value-added tax.\nAs a result of the recently enacted Federal tax reform legislation effective January 1, 2018, which reduces the Company's federal tax rate to 21% from 35% and provides that future net operating losses have an indefinite carry-forward period, fiscal 2018 second quarter net income includes a non-cash income tax benefit of $113.5 million to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities.\nAbout The Madison Square Garden Company\nThe Madison Square Garden Company (MSG) is a world leader in live sports and entertainment experiences. The company presents or hosts a broad array of premier events in its diverse collection of iconic venues: New York’s Madison Square Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and Beacon Theatre; the Forum in Inglewood, CA; The Chicago Theatre; and the Wang Theatre in Boston. Other MSG properties include legendary sports franchises: the New York Knicks (NBA), the New York Rangers (NHL) and the New York Liberty (WNBA); two development league teams -- the Westchester Knicks (NBAGL) and the Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL); and one of the leading North American esports organizations, Counter Logic Gaming.

More information is available at www.themadisonsquaregardencompany.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define adjusted operating income (loss), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before 1) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, 2) share-based compensation expense or benefit, 3) restructuring charges or credits, 4) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses and 5) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions. Because it is based upon operating income (loss), adjusted operating income (loss) also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.\nWe believe adjusted operating income (loss) is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. Adjusted operating income (loss) and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze our performance. Internally, we use revenues and adjusted operating income (loss) measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. Adjusted operating income (loss) should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Since adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. For a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to adjusted operating income (loss), please see page 5 of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results, developments and events may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including financial community and rating agency perceptions of the Company and its business, operations, financial condition and the industry in which it operates and the factors described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained therein.
