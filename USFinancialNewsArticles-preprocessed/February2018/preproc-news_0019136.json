    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 9 (Reuters) - China’s consumer inflation cooled to 1.5 percent in January, in line with economists’ forecasts, official data showed on Friday.\nThe consumer price index (CPI) had been expected to moderate from a 1.8 percent gain in December.\nThe producer price index (PPI) rose 4.3 percent from a year earlier, also cooling from the previous month’s rise of 4.9 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted producer inflation would ease to 4.4 percent in January.\nSources have told Reuters that China’s government will maintain a 3 percent consumer inflation target for 2018, suggesting policymakers are not foreseeing any sharp price rises.
