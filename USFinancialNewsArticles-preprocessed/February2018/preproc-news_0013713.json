(NASDAQ:NTGR), a global networking company that delivers innovative networking and Internet connected products to consumers and growing businesses, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $397.1 million, as compared to $367.9 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, and $355.5 million in the third quarter ended October 1, 2017. Net loss, computed in accordance with GAAP, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.9 million, or $1.02 net loss per diluted share. This compared to GAAP net income of $22.1 million, or $0.65 net income per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, and GAAP net income of $20.8 million, or $0.64 net income per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $0.71 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.88 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.81 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017.\nOperating margin, computed in accordance with GAAP, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.9%, as compared to 9.0% in the year ago comparable quarter, and 7.1% in the third quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 9.5% in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet revenue for the full year of 2017 was $1.41 billion, a 5.9% increase as compared to $1.33 billion for 2016. Net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, for the full year 2017 was $19.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share. This compared to GAAP net income of $75.9 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, for 2016. Non-GAAP net income was $2.74 per diluted share for the full year of 2017, as compared to non-GAAP net income of $3.10 per diluted share for 2016.\nOperating margin, computed in accordance with GAAP, for the full year of 2017 was 6.2%, as compared to 8.6% for 2016. Non-GAAP operating margin was 8.7% in the full year of 2017, as compared to 11.6% for 2016.\nThe accompanying schedules provide a reconciliation of financial measures computed on a GAAP basis to financial measures computed on a non-GAAP basis.\nPatrick Lo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NETGEAR, commented, \"We had a very successful fourth quarter, as demand during the holiday season was stronger than we had originally expected. I'm pleased to report that we set an all-time record in quarterly net revenue. Our Arlo and Orbi product lines were both massive hits with consumers. We could not have asked for a better finish to 2017. Meanwhile, we recently expanded our Nighthawk line into the gaming category, and released several new and exciting products and services for the SMB segment. \"\nMr. Lo continued, “Today we are announcing that we have decided to separate the Arlo business from the rest of NETGEAR. Both Arlo and NETGEAR are market-leading businesses that have benefited from the resources that come with being part of a single company. That being said, we believe that now is an opportune time for them to part ways and pursue different growth trajectories. Arlo will aggressively acquire new users, while NETGEAR will continue to deepen engagement with its vast installed base. Both businesses are strong enough to operate independently, and will benefit from the focus, flexibility and financial resources that come with separation.\"\nChristine Gorjanc, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, \"We are fortunate to have two successful businesses that are at very different stages of maturity. They have distinctly different investment profiles and capital structure requirements. Separating the two will provide each company with its own equity currency, as well as provide investors with the opportunity to invest in two great companies with unique financial profiles. Ultimately, we believe this is the best path forward to make both businesses more competitive in the market and to maximize value for our shareholders.”\nBusiness Outlook\nChristine Gorjanc, Chief Financial Officer of NETGEAR, added, \"Looking forward to the first quarter of 2018, we expect net revenue to be in the range of $330 million to $345 million. GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 0.8% to 1.8% and non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 28.0% and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 25.0% for the first quarter of 2018.”\nA reconciliation between the Business Outlook on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the following table:\nThree months ended April 1, 2018 Operating Margin\nRate Tax Rate GAAP 0.8% - 1.8% 28.0% Estimated adjustments for 1 : Amortization of intangibles 0.7% __ Stock-based compensation expense 2.4% __ Separation expense 2.6% __ Tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments __ (3.0)% Non-GAAP 6.5% - 7.5% 25.0% 1 Business outlook does not include estimates for any currently unknown income and expense items which, by their nature, could arise late in a quarter, including: restructuring and other charges; litigation reserves, net; acquisition-related charges; impairment charges; discrete tax benefits or detriments relating to tax windfalls or shortfalls from equity awards; and any additional impacts relating to the implementation of U.S. tax reform. New material income and expense items such as these could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.\nInvestor Conference Call / Webcast Details\nNETGEAR will review the year results and discuss management's expectations for the first quarter of 2018 today, Tuesday, February 6, 2018 at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. PT).

NETGEAR undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information:\nTo supplement our unaudited selected financial data presented on a basis consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain charges, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP total operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. These supplemental measures exclude adjustments for amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, separation expense, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, gain on litigation settlements, loss pertaining to cost method investment, and the related tax effects, and the tax effects of the implementation of U.S. tax reform. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance.\nIn calculating non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude certain items to facilitate a review of the comparability of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such items are not, in our view, related to our ongoing operational performance. We use non-GAAP measures to evaluate the operating performance of our business, for comparison with forecasts and strategic plans, and for benchmarking performance externally against competitors. In addition, management’s incentive compensation is determined using certain non-GAAP measures. Since we find these measures to be useful, we believe that investors benefit from seeing results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing GAAP results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by offering:\nthe ability to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our on-going operating results; the ability to better identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses; a better understanding of how management plans and measures our underlying business; and an easier way to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of competitors that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following are explanations of the adjustments that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures, as well as the reasons for excluding them in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures:\nAmortization of intangibles consists primarily of non-cash charges that can be impacted by, among other things, the timing and magnitude of acquisitions. We consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and forecasting our earnings trends, and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of our competitors.\nStock-based compensation expense consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock units and shares under the employee stock purchase plan granted to employees. We believe that the exclusion of these charges provides for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to peer companies due to the varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. In addition, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact stock-based compensation expense has on our operating results.\nOther items consist of certain items that are the result of either unique or unplanned events, including, when applicable: separation expense, restructuring and other charges, litigation reserves, net, gain on litigation settlements, and loss pertaining to cost method investment. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or estimate the amount or timing of these items in advance. Although these events are reflected in our GAAP financial statements, these unique transactions may limit the comparability of our on-going operations with prior and future periods. The amounts result from events that often arise from unforeseen circumstances, which often occur outside of the ordinary course of continuing operations. Therefore, the amounts do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our continuing business operations for the period in which they are incurred.\nTax effects consist of the various above adjustments and the charge relating to the implementation of U.S. tax reform that we incorporate into non-GAAP measures in order to provide a more meaningful measure on non-GAAP net income. We also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effects relating to our non-GAAP financial measures provides our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on-going performance of our business.\nSource: NETGEAR-F\n-Financial Tables Attached-\nNETGEAR, INC.
