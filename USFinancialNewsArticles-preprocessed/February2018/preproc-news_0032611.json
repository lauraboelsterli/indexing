    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. agricultural merchants are scrambling to register themselves as cooperatives after a blunder in the country’s new tax law gave farmers a tax break for selling grains to co-ops rather than private firms.\nThe following are details of cooperatives in the U.S.:\n- Agricultural cooperatives provide grain handling, seed purchasing and other farm services to its members, who are also the owners of the business.\n- Cooperatives handle farm products ranging from corn to dairy to nuts and fruit.\n- As owners, a cooperative’s members control its activities through a board of directors and through voting at annual and other membership meetings.\n- Cooperatives return profits to their owners through periodic payments known as patronage.\n- There are more than 2,500 farmer cooperatives in the United States, according to the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n- Publicly traded CHS Inc is the largest U.S. cooperative, with revenues of $31.9 billion in 2017.\nSources: National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, CHS, University of California Cooperative Extension.\nReporting by Mark Weinraub and Tom Polansek; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
