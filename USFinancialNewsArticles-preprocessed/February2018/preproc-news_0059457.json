    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Diageo ( DGE.L ), the world’s largest spirits company, is launching a U.S. limited edition of its Johnnie Walker Black Label Scotch featuring a woman on the label, called Jane Walker, it said on Monday.\nThe launch in March marks the first major change to the brand’s “striding man” logo in over a century and comes as Diageo and peers try to attract more women drinkers.\nFor every bottle of Jane Walker made, Diageo will donate $1 to organizations supporting women’s causes.\n(This story was corrected to show donation for bottles made, not sold.)\nReporting by Martinne Geller, editing by David Evans\n ",
