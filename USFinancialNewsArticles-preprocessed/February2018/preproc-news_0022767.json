    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - AirAsia is expected to reconfirm an order for Airbus A330neo passenger jets, a person familiar with the discussions said on Thursday.\nAirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes announced last week he was looking at buying Boeing 787s to expand the fleet of its long-haul arm AirAsiaX, as well as Airbus wide-body models.\nThe decision of Asiaâ€™s largest budget carrier - currently exclusively an Airbus customer - is seen as crucial as Airbus tries to shore up its slow-selling A330neo and Boeing looks to cement an advantage in wide-body sales, industry sources say.\nAirbus and AirAsia declined comment.
