In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 36 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track, including Pioneer Natural Resources Corp , have already provided capital expenditure guidance indicating an 8 percent increase in planned spending over 2017. Pioneer said it expects to spend about $2.65 billion in drilling and completions in 2018. Cowen said that was up 1 percent from 2017. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks planned to spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016.
