    "text": "EditorsNote: minor edits throughout\nJake Guentzel scored twice, Zach Aston-Reese added his first two career goals, and the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Ottawa Senators 6-3 Tuesday night in Pittsburgh.\nThe Penguins scored three times in the second period and held a 4-2 lead after two despite being outshot 25-11 to that point.\nOverall, Ottawa held an 33-28 lead in shots, but goalie Matt Murray helped the Penguins with his 30 saves.\nPittsburgh’s Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang each added one goal and one assist. Sidney Crosby scored his 400th goal in Sunday’s game and had three assists, including one on each of the Aston-Reese goals.\nPittsburgh now has won a season-best nine straight games at home.\nThis was the first time Ottawa returned to Pittsburgh since the Penguins scored a double-overtime victory in Game 7 of last year’s Eastern Conference finals.\nPittsburgh took a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal 4:07 into the game when Guentzel redirected a Justin Schultz shot into the net.\nThe Senators tied it on Derick Brassard’s goal 4:18 into the second period. However, the Penguins then scored three in a row over a stretch of 6:12 for a 4-1 lead.\nGuentzel started everything 52 seconds after the Ottawa goal when he put away the rebound of a Phil Kessel shot.\nMalkin made it 3-1 at 10:01 with an assist from Carl Hagelin. Malkin took a behind-the-back pass from Hagelin to the right of goalie Mike Condon and then wheeled around and put a backhander in on the short side.\nAston-Reese, playing in his fifth NHL game, scored his first goal to stretch the lead to 4-1 just 1:21 later.\nCraig Anderson then replaced Condon, who allowed the four goals on only nine shots. Colin White scored for Ottawa later in the period before Letang scored his goal midway through the third period.\nMatt Duchene scored for the Senators with 5:39 to go in the third. Aston-Reese finished the scoring with an empty-net goal.\nAnderson stopped 17 of the 18 shots he faced.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
