    "text": "SILVER SPRING, Md. and RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ: UTHR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"Our fourth quarter net revenues reached $465 million and our annual net revenues reached $1.7 billion, our highest quarterly and annual net revenues ever,\" said Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D., United Therapeutics Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Orenitram's fourth quarter net revenues grew by 25%, as compared to the same period in the prior year, representing our third consecutive quarter of greater than 20% net revenue growth for this therapy and confirming our belief in the organic growth opportunity for Orenitram, which is the only true oral prostacyclin analogue therapy for the large and increasing number of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients. These financial results strengthen our ability to develop and advance our growing product pipeline, which currently includes seven phase III programs and multiple next-generation treprostinil drug delivery systems as well as investigative regenerative medicine and organ manufacturing programs, which we hope will ultimately provide a cure for PAH and other end-stage organ diseases.\"\nKey financial highlights include (in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\n$\n464.7\n$\n409.0\n$\n1,725.3\n$\n1,598.8\nNet income\n$\n19.0\n$\n110.3\n$\n417.9\n$\n713.7\nNon-GAAP earnings (1)\n$\n170.2\n$\n184.3\n$\n741.3\n$\n726.0\nNet income, per diluted share\n$\n0.43\n$\n2.43\n$\n9.31\n$\n15.25\nNon-GAAP earnings, per diluted share (1)\n$\n3.89\n$\n4.06\n$\n16.51\n$\n15.51\n(1)\nSee definition of non-GAAP earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP earnings below.\nRevenues\nThe table below summarizes the components of total revenues (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet product sales:\nRemodulin®\n$\n180.1\n$\n151.2\n19.1\n%\n$\n670.9\n$\n602.3\n11.4\n%\nTyvaso®\n92.4\n93.6\n(1.3)\n%\n372.9\n404.6\n(7.8)\n%\nAdcirca®\n119.3\n112.7\n5.9\n%\n419.7\n372.2\n12.8\n%\nOrenitram®\n48.0\n38.3\n25.3\n%\n185.8\n157.2\n18.2\n%\nUnituxin®\n24.9\n13.2\n88.6\n%\n76.0\n62.5\n21.6\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n464.7\n$\n409.0\n13.6\n%\n$\n1,725.3\n$\n1,598.8\n7.9\n%\nRevenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased by $55.7 million as compared to the same period in 2016. The growth in revenues primarily resulted from: (1) a $28.9 million increase in Remodulin net product sales; (2) an $11.7 million increase in Unituxin net product sales; (3) a $9.7 million increase in Orenitram net product sales; and (4) a $6.6 million increase in Adcirca net product sales, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in Tyvaso net product sales.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $126.5 million as compared to the same period in 2016. The growth in revenues primarily resulted from the following: (1) a $68.6 million increase in Remodulin net product sales; (2) a $47.5 million increase in Adcirca net product sales; (3) a $28.6 million increase in Orenitram net product sales; and (4) a $13.5 million increase in Unituxin net product sales, partially offset by a $31.7 million decrease in Tyvaso net product sales.\nExpenses\nCost of product sales.

The increases in cost of product sales of $27.2 million and $31.0 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016, were primarily attributable to a $21.9 million increase in royalty expense for Adcirca. Our amended license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company resulted in our royalty rate on net product sales of Adcirca increasing from five percent to an effective rate of approximately 42.5 percent beginning December 1, 2017. The remaining increase in cost of product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in sales.\nResearch and development expense.

The increases in research and development expense of $44.9 million and $98.8 million, respectively, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same periods in 2016, were driven by the expansion of our pipeline programs to treat cardiopulmonary disease and cancer and to develop organ manufacturing technologies.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. The table below summarizes selling, general and administrative expense by major category (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nCategory:\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n51.4\n$\n45.9\n12.0\n%\n$\n203.1\n$\n210.7\n(3.6)\n%\nSales and marketing\n17.6\n17.5\n0.6\n%\n64.3\n84.6\n(24.0)\n%\nShare-based compensation\nexpense (1)\n90.1\n76.1\n18.4\n%\n62.7\n21.5\n191.6\n%\nTotal selling, general and\nadministrative expense\n$\n159.1\n$\n139.5\n14.1\n%\n$\n330.1\n$\n316.8\n4.2\n%\n(1)\nRefer to Share-based compensation expense below for discussion.\nGeneral and administrative, excluding share-based compensation. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily resulted from: (1) a $32.0 million decrease in grants to non-affiliated, non-profit organizations that provide financial assistance to patients with PAH; and (2) a $9.3 million decrease of expenses in connection with the disposition and write down of various properties in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by: (1) a $9.4 million increase in legal fees incurred in connection with intellectual property litigation and the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation of our support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to patients; (2) a $9.2 million increase in compensation due to an increase in staffing; and (3) a $6.5 million increase in consulting expenses.\nSales and marketing, excluding share-based compensation. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily resulted from a $11.3 million decrease in compensation and related costs associated with the 2016 consolidation of our sales and marketing staff.\nShare-based compensation expense . The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense (benefit) by major category (dollars in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nCategory:\nStock options\n$\n13.1\n$\n3.1\n322.6\n%\n$\n43.0\n$\n24.8\n73.4\n%\nShare tracking awards plan\n104.6\n101.3\n3.3\n%\n27.1\n(15.2)\n278.3\n%\nOther (1)\n0.8\n0.9\n(11.1)\n%\n3.4\n2.5\n36.0\n%\nTotal share-based\ncompensation expense\n$\n118.5\n$\n105.3\n12.5\n%\n$\n73.5\n$\n12.1\n507.4\n%\n(1)\nIncludes expense related to restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nShare-based compensation. The increase in share-based compensation expense of $13.2 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to a $10.0 million increase in stock option expense due to additional awards outstanding in 2017.\nThe increase in share-based compensation expense of $61.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, was primarily due to: (1) a $42.3 million increase in share tracking awards expense related to an increase in our stock price during 2017 and the continued vesting of outstanding awards; and (2) an $18.2 million increase in stock option expense due to additional awards granted and outstanding in 2017.\nSettlement of Loss Contingency\nIn December 2017, we entered into a civil Settlement Agreement with the U.S. Government to resolve a DOJ investigation related to our support of 501(c)(3) organizations that provide financial assistance to patients. During the second quarter of 2017, we recorded a $210.0 million accrual relating to this matter, and ultimately paid this amount, plus interest, to the U.S. Government upon settlement. This matter is described in more detail in Note 16—Litigation—Department of Justice Subpoena, to our consolidated financial statements included within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nImpairment of Cost Method Investment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $49.6 million of impairment charges related to our cost method investments in privately-held companies. There were no such impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $351.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $346.5 million for the same period in 2016. The change in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to a charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes due to the lower corporate tax rate enacted by The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform\"), which is effective as of January 1, 2018, and increases in nondeductible items, partially offset by a decrease in income before income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the effective tax rates were approximately 46 percent and 33 percent, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Earnings\nNon-GAAP earnings is defined as net income, adjusted for: (1) share-based compensation expense (including expenses relating to stock options, restricted stock units, share tracking awards, and our employee stock purchase plan); (2) settlement of loss contingency; (3) impairment charges; (4) impact of Tax Reform; and (5) tax impact on non-GAAP earnings adjustments.\nA reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP earnings is presented below (in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016 (1)\n2017\n2016 (1)\nNet income, as reported\n$\n19.0\n$\n110.3\n$\n417.9\n$\n713.7\nAdjust for the following charges:\nShare-based compensation expense (2)\n118.5\n105.3\n73.5\n12.1\nSettlement of loss contingency (3)\n—\n—\n210.0\n—\nImpairment of cost method investments (4)\n—\n—\n49.6\n—\nOther impairment charges (4)\n—\n4.3\n—\n4.3\nImpact of Tax Reform (5)\n71.0\n—\n71.0\n—\nTax benefit (2)(3)\n(38.3)\n(35.6)\n(80.7)\n(4.1)\nNon-GAAP earnings\n$\n170.2\n$\n184.3\n$\n741.3\n$\n726.0\nNon-GAAP earnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n3.94\n$\n4.37\n$\n16.85\n$\n16.58\nDiluted\n$\n3.89\n$\n4.06\n$\n16.51\n$\n15.51\nWeighted average number of common shares\noutstanding:\nBasic\n43.2\n42.2\n44.0\n43.8\nDiluted\n43.8\n45.4\n44.9\n46.8",
