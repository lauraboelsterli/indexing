    "text": "CAESAREA, Israel, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mazor Robotics Ltd. (TASE: MZOR; NASDAQGM: MZOR), a pioneer and a leader in the field of robotic guidance systems, reported record fourth quarter and full year revenues of $19.1 million and $64.9 million, respectively. As previously announced, the Company received purchase orders for 27 systems in the 2017 fourth quarter, including 24 Mazor X systems. For the 2017 full year, the Company received 73 system orders, of which 64 were for the Mazor X system and nine were for the Renaissance system.\n\"Our effective execution during 2017 continued to strengthen our global leadership position in spine robotics and led to record systems sales and recurring revenue,\" commented Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer. \"2018 will be a year of transition during which we will emphasize synergy with Medtronic as well as procedure growth. Mazor is well positioned to benefit from the accelerating adoption of robotics for spine surgeries.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS ON IFRS BASIS (\"GAAP\")\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 36% to $19.1 million compared to $14.0 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. U.S. revenue increased 38% to $17.4 million compared to $12.6 million in the year-ago fourth quarter, as the Company recognized revenue from 21 Mazor X systems, compared to 13 Mazor X and two Renaissance systems in the fourth quarter of 2016. International revenue was $1.7 million compared to $1.4 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. Recurring revenue from kit sales, services and other increased 107% to $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.5 million in the year-ago fourth quarter, which is primarily attributed to the higher system installed base. The Company ended the quarter with a backlog of 16 systems (14 Mazor X and two Renaissance systems).\nThe Company's gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 59.3% compared to 70.5% in the year-ago fourth quarter. This expected decrease is attributed mainly to the higher manufacturing costs of the Mazor X system compared to the Renaissance system and the pricing terms with Medtronic. Total operating expenses were $11.4 million compared to $14.2 million in the year-ago fourth quarter, mainly due to lower operating expenses, following the transition to the global distribution phase of the Medtronic partnership. Operating loss was $0.1 million compared to an operating loss of $4.3 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.3 million, or $0.09 per share, for the year-ago fourth quarter.\nCash generated by operating activities was $3.8 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.9 million in last year's fourth quarter. The change is primarily a result of strong collections in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $108.3 million.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS ON NON-GAAP BASIS\nThe tables below include reconciliations of the Company's GAAP results to non-GAAP results. The reconciliations relate to non-cash expenses in the amount of $1.5 million with respect to share-based payments and amortization of intangible assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, the net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.9 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to net loss of $3.1 million, or $0.07 per share, for the year-ago fourth quarter.\nFULL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS ON IFRS BASIS (\"GAAP\")\nFor the full 2017, revenue increased 78% and totaled $64.9 million compared to $36.4 million for the full 2016, due to higher system sales and an increase in recurring revenue. Recurring revenue totaled $27.8 million, an increase of 65% compared to $16.8 million in the full 2016. The growth in recurring revenue is attributed to the increase in the installed base and high utilization of the Company's robotic guidance systems. Gross margin for the full 2017 was 63.5% compared with 71.6% for the full 2016. This expected decrease is attributed mainly to the higher manufacturing costs of the Mazor X system compared to the Renaissance system and to the pricing terms with Medtronic. Operating expenses for the full 2017 were $55.1 million, compared to $45.1 million for the full 2016. The Company's sales and marketing expenses are now expected to decrease, as Medtronic assumed commercial responsibility for the Mazor X, effective September 18, 2017. Net loss for the full 2017 was $12.4 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.7 million, or $0.42 per share for the full 2016.\nFULL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS ON NON-GAAP BASIS\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the full 2017 was $5.7 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to a net loss of $16.1 million, or $0.36 per share for the full 2016.\nADJUSTMENTS TO REPORTED THIRD QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nAs previously disclosed on January 8, 2018, the Company's revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017 was adjusted from $17.2 million to $18.6 million. The corresponding cost of goods sold was also adjusted from $5.3 million to $5.9 million. The increase is due to system deliveries to Medtronic which were incorrectly recorded as delivered after the third quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nFollowing an additional analysis of the 2017 third quarter results, the Company is further adjusting its cost of goods sold by $1.1 million to $7.0 million due to the inaccurate recording of purchase of goods.\nAs a result of these adjustments, the gross margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were adjusted from 69.2% and 68.0% to 62.3% and 65.3%, respectively. The net loss for the same periods was increased by $0.3 million to $3.9 million and $12.9 million, respectively.\nThe amended financial results for three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 are available through the Company's website at\nhttps://www.mazorrobotics.com/index.php/investors-relations/financial-reports .\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Wednesday, February 14, 2018, at 8:30 AM EST (3:30 PM IST).

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance that enhances management's and investors' ability to evaluate the Company's net income and earnings per share and to compare them to historical net income and earnings per share.\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when operating and evaluating the Company's business internally and therefore decided to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors.\nAbout Mazor\nMazor Robotics (TASE: MZOR; NASDAQGM: MZOR) believes in healing through innovation by developing and introducing revolutionary technologies and products aimed at redefining the gold standard of quality care.
