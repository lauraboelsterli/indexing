    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 8:40 AM / in an hour UPDATE 1-Calamos sues Exin citing loan default, casting doubt on Greek insurance deal Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds detail) \nATHENS, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. investor Calamos Family Partners said on Wednesday it is sued Dutch EXIN Financial Services Holdings for defaulting on loans, casting doubts on whether a deal between the two companies to buy Greek National Bankâ€™s insurance unit can go ahead. \nU.S.-based Calamos Investments and EXIN Partners, a Netherlands-based investor focused on insurance, reinsurance and asset management, had agreed to acquire 75 percent of the unit - National Insurance - for 718 million euros ($889.53 million) last year. \nIt is unclear what impact the legal wrangle will have on the Greek investment, which is supposed to be concluded by the end of March. National Bank of Greece was not immediately available for comment. \nEXIN was not immediately available for comment. \nIn an emailed statement, Calamos Family Partners (CFP) said it was seeking immediate repayment of more than $41 million in principal, plus interest, owed to them by EXIN under a series of loan agreements. The full amount was payable on Dec. 31 2017, and was now in default. \nIt said EXIN has repeatedly failed to provide requested financial statements and other financial, accounting and regulatory information and records as required by the applicable loan agreements. In addition, the lawsuit seeks a full accounting of when and how EXIN used the borrowed funds. \nNational Bank (NBG) had put its insurance subsidiary up for sale as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations and focus on core banking.
