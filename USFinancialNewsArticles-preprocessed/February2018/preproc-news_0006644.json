    "text": "Reiterates Transaction Represents Best Path Forward for Aviragen and ALL Stockholders\nCAS Group Has Not Articulated a Clear Plan and Has Now Changed its Stance to Emphasize Teslexivir (BTA074)\nATLANTA, Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVIR) today issued the following statement urging stockholders to vote FOR the Company’s proposed merger with Vaxart, Inc. on the WHITE proxy card. The voting period will close at the upcoming Special Meeting of Stockholders on February 6, 2018.\nAviragen’s Board of Directors and management team conducted a strictly impartial review process that ensured that no director or executive had any prior affiliation with Vaxart, and unanimously concluded that the proposed merger with Vaxart is in the best interests of the Company and all Aviragen stockholders.\nThe Aviragen Board of Directors and executive management team collectively have over 200 years of experience as either operating biotechnology executives or biotechnology company Directors. As such, the Board and management have the requisite experience to analyze strategic alternatives and recommend the best path forward for the Company and its stockholders.\nThe merger with Vaxart has the potential for significant upside for Aviragen. The transaction will result in a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing Vaxart’s oral recombinant vaccines and our direct-acting antivirals, specifically teslexivir, to treat infections that have limited therapeutic options. We believe Vaxart’s oral tablet vaccines have the potential to be major products in the worldwide vaccine market. The company recently completed a successful Phase 2 clinical trial in which its influenza tablet vaccine performed favorably against the market-leading injectable flu vaccine, proving that its oral tablet vaccine delivery technology works in humans. Vaxart’s second program, a novel oral vaccine for norovirus, has already demonstrated robust immune responses in human clinical trials.\nAs we reported in November 2017, we completed the enrollment in a Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of teslexivir 5 percent gel in patients with condyloma, or anogenital warts. The Company expects to report top-line data from this trial next quarter. We are very confident that Vaxart is fully committed to continuing the future development of teslexivir. As evidence of their commitment they plan on retaining Aviragen’s entire clinical team that has been intimately involved with the design and execution of the Phase 2 trial. Importantly, the combined company will be led by an experienced biotechnology drug development management and directorial team.\nThe Aviragen strategic review process was extensive and well conducted. The proposed merger with Vaxart is the result of an exhaustive seven-month public review of strategic alternatives conducted by Aviragen’s Board. This included the consideration of 167 biotech companies, including numerous unsolicited inbound inquiries. Since the merger was announced three months ago, no other parties have expressed interest in a transaction with Aviragen. We believe the process objectively considered all possible rational strategic alternatives available during that period.\nIn making its unanimous determination in favor of the Vaxart transaction, the Board took into account Aviragen’s liquidation value, which was $22.4 million – or $0.58 per share – as of October 31, 2017. Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”), which overstated the current liquidation value in their initial report, continues to substantially overestimate Aviragen’s current liquidation value in a revised report . ISS’s calculation does not account for Aviragen’s significant cash burn of approximately $8 million between October 31 and June 30, 2018 – the earliest date at which it could consider liquidating the Company – that is the result of the costs of the Company’s ongoing clinical trial and the pending proxy contest with the CAS Group, which is led by Digirad. This is before taking into account the costs associated with conducting yet another strategic alternatives process, which has been an option proposed by the dissident CAS Group.\nAviragen encourages its stockholders to support the merger and not risk putting their investment in the hands of the CAS Group. Together, the members comprising the CAS Group have a history of underperformance, with essentially no stock price growth at Digirad in the six years since they took over the company, no alternative plans for growing Aviragen other than to conduct another vaguely-described alternatives process, a proposed Board slate made up of Wall Street financial people, with no experience in the biotechnology industry to evaluate the Company’s assets, and a leader – Digirad’s chairman – found to have violated securities law.\nBy approving the Vaxart transaction, Aviragen stockholders would place their investment in the hands of Vaxart’s veteran management team and proven Board of Directors. Each member of the combined company’s Board and management team has a proven track record in all key aspects of the biopharmaceuticals industry.\nAccordingly, Aviragen’s Board and management unanimously recommend that Aviragen stockholders vote FOR on the WHITE PROXY CARD at the upcoming Special Meeting of Stockholders on February 6, 2018.\nEACH VOTE IS IMPORTANT – PLEASE VOTE FOR THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH VAXART TODAY\nEACH VOTE IS IMPORTANT\nThe Aviragen Board of Directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote FOR the proposed merger. Each vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares are owned. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Aviragen common stock properly cast at the Aviragen Special Meeting, presuming a quorum is present, is required to approve the proposed merger. Aviragen shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2018 are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Please take a moment to vote FOR the proposals necessary to approve the proposed merger today – by telephone, by Internet or by signing, dating and returning the proxy card received with the proxy statement.\nIf you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact the Company’s proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., toll-free at (800) 967-5074.\nAbout Aviragen Therapeutics\nAviragen Therapeutics is focused on the discovery and development of the next generation of direct-acting antivirals to treat infections that have limited therapeutic options and affect a significant number of patients globally.
