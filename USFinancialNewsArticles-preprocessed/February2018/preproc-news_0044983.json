    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The president of a Swiss foundation that conducted a $232 million online fundraiser for the embattled Tezos cryptocurrency project has stepped down, the foundation said in a statement on Thursday.\nJohann Gevers, who helped set up the foundation in July, has been replaced by Ryan Jesperson, one of the projectâ€™s contributors, the foundation said. Another board member Diego Olivier Fernandez Pons has also stepped down, while Michel Mauny, a computer programming academic has joined the board, the foundation said.\nThe project had been embroiled in a battle over control between its founders, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman and Gevers (Reporting by Anna Irrera Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ",
