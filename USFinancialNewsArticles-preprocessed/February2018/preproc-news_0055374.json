    "text": "Syrian capital and its suburbs are calm after the UN cease-fire vote The U.N. Security Council approved late Saturday a resolution demanding a 30-day cease-fire across Syria. Published 8 Hours Ago The Associated Press Mohammed Elshamy | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images US Ambassador to the United Nations speaks to Ambassador MA Zhaoxu (R) of China before voting on Sweden's Syria ceasefire resolution during a Security Council meeting at the UN HQ in New York, United States on February 24, 2018. \nThe Syrian capital and its embattled eastern suburbs were relatively calm on Sunday, following the U.N. Security Council's unanimous approval of a resolution demanding a 30-day cease-fire across Syria, opposition activists and residents of Damascus said. \nThe activists reported few violations, including some clashes, on the southern edge of the rebel-held suburbs, known as eastern Ghouta, and two airstrikes late on Saturday night, shortly after the resolution was adopted. \nThe calm came after a week of intense airstrikes and shelling that killed more than 500 people in eastern Ghouta and left dozens dead or wounded in the government-held Damascus, which rebels pelted with mortar shells. \n\"This has been the calmest night since last Sunday,\" said Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, referring to the start of the bombing campaign on Feb. 19. He said there have been no deaths reported since the resolution passed. \nGhouta-based opposition activist Anas al-Dimashqi said the night was calm but warplanes and drones were flying over rebel-held areas. He said several explosions were heard Sunday in Ghouta. \nDr. Sakhr al-Dimashqi, a surgeon at a clinic in Ghouta, told The Associated Press that several shells hit some towns in the suburbs, adding that they received six wounded people at the clinic where he works. \n\"The shelling today is not as intense as over the past week,\" he said. \nThe two largest and most powerful rebel factions in Ghouta, Failaq al-Rahman and Army of Islam issued statements saying they will abide by the cease-fire unless they are forced to fire in self-defense. Both called for the \"immediate delivery\" of emergency aid. \nThe resolution excludes members of the Islamic State group and al-Qaida-linked fighters. Ghouta is also home to a few hundred members of the al-Qaida-linked Levant Liberation Committee. \nDamascus residents said there's more traffic in the streets, compared to previous days and most schools and universities were open on Sunday. They said some private schools were still closed, especially those close to the front lines with Ghouta. \nSaturday's vote at the United Nations came after the vote was delayed from Friday. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia had repeatedly called an immediate cease-fire unrealistic. \nIn a bid to get Russian support, sponsors Kuwait and Sweden amended the draft resolution late Friday to drop a demand that the cease-fire take effect 72 hours after the resolution's adoption. \nAfter two hours of additional negotiations on Saturday, the Security Council unanimously approved the resolution demanding a 30-day cease-fire across Syria \"without delay\" to deliver humanitarian aid to millions and evacuate the critically ill and wounded. \nAfter the vote, many council members urged stepped-up efforts to ensure a cease-fire and get assistance to millions in need. \nRussia has been a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad since the country's conflict began seven years ago. In 2015, Moscow joined the war on Assad's side tipping the balance of power in his favor.",
