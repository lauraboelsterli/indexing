    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said warplanes struck eastern Ghouta on Saturday evening, minutes after the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire in Syria.\nThe jets hit the town of Shifouniyeh in the rebel enclave, said the Britain-based monitoring group and two residents of the besieged suburbs near Damascus.\nA surge of air strikes and shelling by the Syrian government and its allies has pounded eastern Ghouta since Sunday night, in one of the fiercest air-assaults of the seven-year war, residents, rescuers and the monitor say.\nReporting by Ellen Francis and Dahlia Nehme, Editing by William Maclean\n ",
