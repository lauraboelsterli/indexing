    "text": "REDMOND, Wash., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HyTech Power , a hydrogen energy solutions company, today announced the appointment of Susan Ireland as its head of program management, and Brien Akers as head of operations. Ireland will focus on leading planning and control processes to ensure the company’s commitments to performance exceed stakeholders’ expectations and will also oversee the company’s marketing efforts. Akers will be responsible for operations as well as the integration and commercialization of HyTech Power’s supply chain.\nThe addition of Ireland and Akers is part of the company’s long-term growth strategy as it prepares for market adoption of its internal combustion assistance (ICA) technology , promising breakthrough diesel emission reductions while significantly increasing fuel efficiency and engine performance. ICA is currently undergoing California Air Resources Board (CARB) verification and is slated for commercial availability late this quarter.\nIreland joins HyTech Power after over 30 years with Boeing Commercial Airplanes, where she most recently held the position of business operations director for the company’s 787 development program. Prior to that, she held various program management and business operations leadership positions in commercial airplane services and airplane programs.\nBefore joining HyTech Power, Akers served as director of operations for Orion Industries’ Mukilteo facility. Prior to that, he was with Boeing Commercial Airplanes for over 32 years, where he held a number of senior management and executive positions including operations, program management, product development and supplier management.\nThe company’s third former Boeing executive, HyTech Power’s President Jerry Allyne, stated, “We are honored to welcome Susan and Brien to HyTech. Their expertise and backgrounds position us for continued fast-paced growth and commercialization of our technology, and further refine our business strategies for long-term success.”\nThis announcement follows the recent appointment of Jerry Allyne as its president and John Dunlap to its board of directors last year.\nAbout HyTech Power\nHyTech Power is a hydrogen energy solutions company located in Redmond, Washington, dedicated to creating clean, efficient and renewable energy solutions for multiple applications including automotive and scalable energy storage.
