    "text": "FRANKFURT, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Moody’s on Tuesday said a German ruling to allow bans of diesel cars in German cities is credit negative for European securitised car loans, although the impact will be limited.\n“The share of potentially affected diesel-vehicles in the securitised portfolios is typically in the low-single-digit percentages and only about 30 percent of the obligors reside in low emission zones,” Moody’s said in a note.\nGerman auto ABS performance is so far very strong and certain stress scenarios are covered by the current credit ratings of German auto ABS, Moody’s said.
