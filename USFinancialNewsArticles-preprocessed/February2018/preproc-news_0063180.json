    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NYSE: OAS) (\"Oasis\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operational results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided its 2018 outlook.\nHighlights\nExceeded average daily production exit target for 2017 with 73,207 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"Boepd\") in the fourth quarter of 2017 and produced 66,144 Boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. Decreased lease operating expenses per Boe to $6.42 per Boe for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Completed and placed on production 88 gross (58.3 net) operated wells while investing $517.3 million of E&P capital expenditures (\"E&P CapEx\"), which excludes acquisitions, other capital and midstream capital, during 2017. Acquired approximately 22,000 net acres in the over-pressured oil window of the Delaware Basin. The acquisition was announced in late 2017 and subsequently closed on February 14, 2018. More than doubled core net inventory from 483 net undeveloped locations at December 31, 2016 to 1,092 net undeveloped locations at December 31, 2017, due to the expansion of the Company's core footprint in the Williston Basin into much of Painted Woods and its entry in the Delaware Basin. Oasis Midstream Partners LP (\"OMP\") completed its initial public offering resulting in net proceeds distributed to Oasis of $132.1 million. Commenced investment in second Wild Basin gas plant with a total capacity of 200 million standard cubic feet per day to service gas production from its highly economic inventory. OMP invested $94.7 million of capital in the second gas plant and $105.6 million of total capital expenditures in 2017. The Company invested $235.1 million in capital expenditures in midstream assets (\"Midstream CapEx\") in 2017, including the $105.6 million attributable to OMP. Successfully launched operations with second Oasis Well Services fracturing crew. Net cash provided by operating activities was $507.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $209.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $707.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $236.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) including non-controlling interests and net cash provided by operating activities, see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\"2017 was a tremendous year for Oasis. We successfully grew production 31% while spending within cash flow on the E&P side of the business,\" said Thomas B. Nusz, Oasis' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our Williston Basin position continues to generate top-in-class cash margins, which drives strong corporate level returns. We have supplemented our highly economic Williston Basin asset with the Forge acquisition located in the best part of the Delaware Basin. The depth of our core inventory increased organically in the Bakken and through our accretive Permian acquisition. We now have approximately 18 years of core and extended core inventory at our 2018 completion pace, which is economic at or below a $45 WTI oil price. In 2018 and 2019, we expect this capital efficient inventory to drive 15-20% production growth within cash flow on the E&P business.\"\n\"Our well services and midstream businesses continue to be critical complements of our E&P operations. We introduced a second fracturing crew midyear 2017 and successfully completed the IPO of OMP in September,\" added Nusz. \"Oasis funded its Midstream CapEx in 2017 through OMP IPO proceeds of $132.1 million distributed to Oasis and capital spent at OMP of $105.6 million. Our midstream business has numerous highly attractive midstream investment opportunities in 2018, both in the Williston and potentially in the Delaware, all of which we expect will generate strong returns and will be built within 4-5x EBITDA multiples. Oasis plans to invest $235 million to $275 million in Midstream CapEx in 2018, of which $72 million to $90 million will be funded by OMP in 2018, and the balance is expected to be funded over time through OMP via drops.\"\nInventory and Leasehold Update\nOasis' total inventory increased to 2,578 net locations, of which 1,092 net locations are considered core. Core net undeveloped locations increased by 126%, from 483 net undeveloped locations at December 31, 2016 to 1,092 net undeveloped locations currently. Of the Company's 1,092 core net locations, 585 are in the Williston Basin and 507 are in the Delaware Basin.\nOasis ended the year with a leasehold position of approximately 503,000 net acres in the Williston Basin, and, as of February 14, 2018, with a leasehold position in the Delaware Basin of approximately 22,000 net acres.\n2018 Plan\nHighlights for 2018 include:\nTotal E&P CapEx plan of approximately $815 million to $855 million, excluding acquisitions. Williston Basin - $700 million to $730 million Delaware Basin - $115 million to $125 million Completing approximately 100 to 110 gross operated wells with a working interest of approximately 73% in the Williston Basin and approximately six to eight gross operated wells with high working interest in the Delaware Basin in 2018.\nMetric\nRange\nProduction (Boepd)\nFull Year 2018\n80,000 to 83,000\n1st Quarter 2018\n75,000 to 77,000\nFull Year Financial Metrics\nLOE ($ per Boe)\n$7.00 to $7.50\nMarketing, transportation and gathering (\"MT&G\") ($ per Boe) (1)\n$2.75 to $3.00\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") ($ in millions) (2)\n$105 to $115\nProduction taxes (% of oil and gas revenue)\n8.1% to 8.4%\n2018 CapEx Plan ($ in millions)\nE&P CapEx\n$815 - $855\nMidstream CapEx\n235 - 275\nOther (3)\n40\n(1)\nExcludes the effect of non-cash valuation charges.\n(2)\nIncludes non-cash amortization of restricted stock of approximately $30 to $32 million.\n(3)\nIncludes capitalized interest, OWS and administrative capital.\nOperational and Financial Update\nSelect operational and financial statistics are included in the following table for the periods presented:\nQuarter Ended:\nYear Ended:\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n12/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nProduction data:\nOil (Bopd)\n57,238\n51,825\n51,557\n41,459\nNatural gas (MMcfpd)\n95,812\n85,800\n87,522\n53,478\nTotal production (Boepd)\n73,207\n66,125\n66,144\n50,372\nPercent Oil\n78.2\n%\n78.4\n%\n77.9\n%\n82.3\n%\nAverage sales prices:\nOil, without derivative settlements ($ per Bbl)\n$\n54.97\n$\n46.35\n$\n48.52\n$\n38.64\nDifferential to NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil index prices (\"WTI\") ($ per Bbl)\n0.50\n1.82\n2.60\n4.76\nOil, with derivative settlements ($ per Bbl) (1)(2)\n53.41\n47.93\n48.00\n46.68\nOil derivative settlements - net cash receipts (payments) ($ in millions) (2)\n(8.2)\n7.5\n(9.8)\n122.0\nNatural gas, without derivative settlements ($ per Mcf) (3)\n4.64\n3.50\n3.81\n1.99\nNatural gas, with derivative settlements ($ per Mcf) (1)(2)(3)\n4.72\n3.58\n3.86\n1.99\nNatural gas derivative settlements - net cash receipts ($ in millions) (2)\n0.7\n0.6\n1.5\n—\nSelected financial data ($ in millions):\nRevenues:\nOil\n$\n289.5\n$\n221.0\n$\n913.1\n$\n586.3\nNatural gas\n40.9\n27.6\n121.8\n38.9\nPurchased oil and gas sales\n31.1\n21.2\n88.0\n10.3\nMidstream revenues\n23.8\n18.8\n72.8\n35.4\nWell services revenues\n19.2\n16.1\n52.8\n33.8\nTotal revenues\n$\n404.5\n$\n304.7\n$\n1,248.5\n$\n704.7\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n209.1\n$\n88.9\n$\n507.9\n$\n228.0\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n236.2\n$\n179.6\n$\n707.7\n$\n500.3\nSelect operating expenses:\nLOE\n$\n43.3\n$\n45.3\n$\n177.1\n$\n135.4\nMidstream operating expenses\n6.7\n4.3\n17.6\n9.0\nWell services operating expenses (5)\n13.4\n10.3\n37.2\n20.7\nMT&G (4)\n19.0\n15.2\n56.6\n29.5\nNon-cash valuation charges\n(1.3)\n(0.2)\n(0.8)\n0.6\nPurchased oil and gas expenses\n31.6\n21.7\n89.3\n10.3\nProduction taxes\n27.8\n21.1\n88.1\n56.6\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\")\n146.6\n132.3\n530.8\n476.3\nTotal select operating expenses\n$\n287.1\n$\n250.0\n$\n995.9\n$\n738.4\nSelect operating expenses data:\nLOE ($ per Boe)\n$\n6.42\n$\n7.45\n$\n7.34\n$\n7.35\nMT&G ($ per Boe) (4)\n2.83\n2.50\n2.34\n1.60\nDD&A ($ per Boe)\n21.76\n21.75\n21.99\n25.84\nE&P G&A ($ per Boe)\n2.93\n2.93\n3.21\n4.28\nProduction taxes (% of oil and gas revenue)\n8.4\n%\n8.5\n%\n8.5\n%\n9.1\n%\n(1)\nRealized prices include gains or losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives, which do not qualify for or were not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.\n(2)\nCash settlements represent the cumulative gains and losses on the Company's derivative instruments for the periods presented and do not include a recovery of costs that were paid to acquire or modify the derivative instruments that were settled.\n(3)\nNatural gas prices include the value for natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n(4)\nExcludes non-cash valuation charges on pipeline imbalances and purchased oil and gas expenses.\n(5)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, certain well services direct field labor compensation expenses are included in well services operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, which were previously recognized in general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company defines Cash Interest as interest expense plus capitalized interest less amortization and write-offs of deferred financing costs and debt discounts included in interest expense. Cash Interest is not a measure of interest expense as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of interest expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash Interest for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands)\nInterest expense\n$\n36,289\n$\n34,861\n$\n146,837\n$\n140,305\nCapitalized interest\n4,024\n3,165\n12,797\n16,848\nAmortization of deferred financing costs\n(1,779)\n(1,715)\n(6,907)\n(9,757)\nAmortization of debt discount\n(2,654)\n(2,409)\n(10,080)\n(2,709)\nCash Interest\n$\n35,880\n$\n33,902\n$\n142,647\n$\n144,687\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow Reconciliations\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, exploration expenses and other similar non-cash or non-recurring charges. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Cash Interest and CapEx, excluding capitalized interest.

The Company defines Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Oasis as net income (loss) after adjusting for (1) the impact of certain non-cash and non-recurring items, including non-cash changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, impairment, and other similar non-cash and non-recurring charges, (2) the impact of net income attributable to non-controlling interests and (3) the non-cash and non-recurring items' impact on taxes based on the Company's effective tax rate applicable to those adjusting items, excluding net income attributable to non-controlling interests, in the same period. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Oasis is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Oasis Per Share as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Oasis divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss) attributable to Oasis to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Oasis and the GAAP financial measure of diluted earnings (loss) attributable to Oasis per share to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Oasis Per Share for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Oasis\n$\n124,617\n$\n(54,688)\n$\n123,796\n$\n(243,016)\nTax reform rate change adjustments\n(171,900)\n—\n(171,900)\n—\n(Gain) loss on sale of properties\n(1,774)\n(2)\n(1,774)\n1,303\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n124\n—\n(4,741)\nNet loss on derivative instruments\n123,954\n49,693\n71,657\n105,317\nDerivative settlements (1)\n(7,460)\n6,401\n(8,264)\n121,977\nImpairment\n866\n717\n6,887\n4,684\nAmortization of deferred financing costs (2)\n1,779\n1,715\n6,907\n9,757\nAmortization of debt discount\n2,654\n2,409\n10,080\n2,709\nOther non-cash adjustments\n(1,236)\n93\n(745)\n790\nTax impact (3)\n(44,425)\n(22,882)\n(31,696)\n(90,480)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Oasis\n$\n27,075\n$\n(16,420)\n$\n4,948\n$\n(91,700)\nDiluted earnings (loss) attributable to Oasis per share\n$\n0.52\n$\n(0.25)\n$\n0.52\n$\n(1.32)\nTax reform rate change adjustments\n(0.71)\n—\n(0.72)\n—\n(Gain) loss on sale of properties\n(0.01)\n—\n(0.01)\n0.01\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n—\n—\n(0.03)\nNet loss on derivative instruments\n0.51\n0.23\n0.30\n0.57\nDerivative settlements (1)\n(0.03)\n0.03\n(0.03)\n0.66\nImpairment\n—\n—\n0.03\n0.03\nAmortization of deferred financing costs (2)\n0.01\n0.01\n0.03\n0.05\nAmortization of debt discount\n0.01\n0.01\n0.04\n0.01\nOther non-cash adjustments\n(0.01)\n—\n—\n—\nTax impact (3)\n(0.17)\n(0.11)\n(0.14)\n(0.48)\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Oasis Per Share\n$\n0.12\n$\n(0.08)\n$\n0.02\n$\n(0.50)\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n241,960\n217,332\n237,875\n183,615\nEffective tax rate applicable to adjustment items\n37.4\n%\n37.4\n%\n37.4\n%\n37.4\n%\n(1)\nCash settlements represent the cumulative gains and losses on the Company's derivative instruments for the periods presented and do not include a recovery of costs that were paid to acquire or modify the derivative instruments that were settled.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2016, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Oasis includes the non-cash adjustment for amortization of deferred financing costs.
