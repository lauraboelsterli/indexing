(Veru) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on urology and oncology. Veru utilizes FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway to develop and commercialize drug candidates. FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway is designed to allow for potentially expedited, lower cost and lower risk regulatory approval based on a previously established safety and efficacy profile of the product. Veru is developing products under the 505(b)(1) pathway as well, which is the traditional new drug application (NDA) pathway. The company is currently developing drug product candidates: Tamsulosin DRS, slow release granules, and Tamsulosin XR capsules for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (NDA planned 2018), Solifenacin DRG, slow release granules, for overactive bladder (urge incontinence, urgency and frequency of urination) (NDA planned 2019), Tadalafil/finasteride combination capsule for restricted urination because of an enlarged prostate (NDA planned 2019), VERU-944 (cis-clomiphene citrate) for hot flashes in men associated with prostate cancer hormone treatment (planned Phase 2 in 2018), VERU-722 (fixed ratio clomiphene citrate) for male infertility, and VERU-111 a novel oral anti-tubulin cancer therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin for a variety of malignancies, including metastatic prostate, breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers (planned Phase1/2 in 2018).\nTo help support these clinical development programs, the company markets and sells the PREBOOST ® medicated individual wipe, which is a male genital desensitizing drug product for the prevention of premature ejaculation which is being co-promoted with Timm Medical Technologies, Inc. and the FC2 Female Condom ® (now available by prescription in the US including through the virtual doctor smartphone app “HeyDoctor” at www.fc2.us.com ) in the United States and through The Female Health Company Division in the Global Public Health Sector.
