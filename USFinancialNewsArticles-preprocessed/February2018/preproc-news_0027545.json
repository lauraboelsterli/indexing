    "text": "KUWAIT (Reuters) - Restoring the unity of Gulf nations remains in the interest of all parties in the region, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday, urging them to resolve a diplomatic dispute over Qatar.\nLast June, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and opening up the worst rift in years among the U.S. allies. Qatar denies the accusation.\nTillerson was speaking at a meeting in Kuwait of the global coalition against Islamic State.\nReporting by Yara Bayoumy; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Andrew Torchia\n ",
