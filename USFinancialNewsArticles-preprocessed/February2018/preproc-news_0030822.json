Nassetta, President & Chief Executive Officer of Hilton, said, \"Our performance for the fourth quarter and full year exceeded the high end of our guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items. Given the strength of our brand portfolio, we continue to build momentum in both unit and pipeline growth and now have the largest number of rooms under construction in the industry. We feel great about our set up for 2018 and our ability to continue delivering record-setting results.\"\nFor the three months and 2017, system-wide comparable RevPAR grew 3.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, driven by increases in both ADR and occupancy. In particular, strength at Hilton's international hotels benefited results.

The legislation had no effect on cash taxes for the quarter.

The adoption will initially be reflected in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and earnings press release as of and for the three months ending March 31, 2018, with adjustments to prior comparable periods. The provisions of this ASU will not affect the Company's cash flow or cash available for capital return. The significant changes to the Company's revenue recognition as a result of the provisions of ASU 2014-09 include the following:\napplication, initiation and other fees, charged when: (i) new hotels enter Hilton's system, (ii) there is a change of ownership or (iii) contracts are extended, will be recognized over the term of the franchise contract, rather than upon execution of the contract; certain contract acquisition costs related to management and franchise contracts are recognized over the term of the contracts as a reduction to revenue, instead of as amortization expense; incentive management fees are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur as a result of future hotel profits or cash flows, as opposed to recognizing amounts that would be due if the management contract was terminated at the end of the reporting period; revenue related to the Hilton Honors guest loyalty program will be recognized upon point redemption, net of any reward reimbursement paid to a third party, as opposed to recognized on a gross basis at the time points are issued in conjunction with the accrual of the expected future cost of the reward reimbursement; and indirect reimbursable fees related to management and franchise contracts will be recognized as they are billed, as opposed to when Hilton incurs the related expenses.\nThe changes in revenue recognition for contract acquisition costs will not affect the Company's net income and the changes for incentive management fees will not affect the Company’s net income for any full year period. Upon adoption, the provisions of this ASU will affect certain key metrics reported in the Company's earnings release as follows, applying a statutory tax rate on the adjustments, which does not reflect the provisional effect of tax reform:\nFull year and first quarter 2017 net income is expected to be reduced by $105 million and $27 million, respectively. Full year and first quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be reduced by $56 million and $14 million, respectively. Full year and first quarter 2017 diluted EPS, before special items, is expected to be reduced by $0.32 and $0.08, respectively. Full year and first quarter 2017 diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, is expected to increase by $0.06 and $0.02, respectively.\nRefer to \"Management and Franchise Fees, Reflecting Application of ASU 2014-09\" and \"Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA\" in the schedules to this earnings release for additional details of the effect of this ASU on the Company's results.\nHilton's outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018 includes the effect of ASU 2014-09 discussed above. Share-based metrics in Hilton's outlook do not include the effect of potential share repurchases.\nFull Year 2018\nSystem-wide RevPAR is expected to increase between 1.0 percent and 3.0 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis compared to 2017.
