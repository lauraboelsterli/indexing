    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- EchoStar Corporation (NASDAQ: SATS) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights:\nConsolidated revenues of $506 million. Consolidated net income from continuing operations of $311.8 million, consolidated net income attributable to EchoStar common stock of $313.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.23. Consolidated EBITDA of $207 million (see reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure below).\nFull Year Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Highlights:\nConsolidated revenue of $1.89 billion. Consolidated net income from continuing operations of $385.0 million, consolidated net income attributable to EchoStar common stock of $393.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.07. Consolidated EBITDA of $795 million (see reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure below).\nAdditional Highlights:\nApproximately 1,208,000 Hughes broadband subscribers as of December 31, 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities of $3.25 billion as of December 31, 2017\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 includes a reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 21%. As a result, we provisionally recorded a one-time tax benefit of $303.5 million from the re- measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The net income and earnings per share noted above include the impact of this benefit.\nStarting with the quarter that ended March 31, 2017, we changed the way we present our segments. Previously, our business segments reflected an allocation of the costs of our corporate functions. Under our new presentation, these costs are no longer allocated to the operating segments and are now reported as part of the Corporate and Other segment (previously \"All Other and Eliminations\").\nIn addition, results of our EchoStar Technology segment, which was transferred to DISH Network Corporation in the Share Exchange transaction, are included in Discontinued Operations.\nSet forth below is a table highlighting certain of EchoStar's segment results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Years\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenue\nHughes\n$\n405,775\n$\n370,910\n$\n1,477,918\n$\n1,392,361\nEchoStar Satellite Services\n96,459\n101,741\n392,244\n407,660\nCorporate & Other\n3,814\n3,137\n15,346\n10,445\nTotal\n$\n506,048\n$\n475,788\n$\n1,885,508\n$\n1,810,466\nEBITDA\nHughes\n$\n132,529\n$\n123,660\n$\n475,222\n$\n477,165\nEchoStar Satellite Services\n73,412\n84,335\n315,285\n341,516\nCorporate & Other\n598\n(22,170)\n4,070\n(67,676)\nTotal\n$\n206,539\n$\n185,825\n$\n794,577\n$\n751,005\nNet income (loss) attributable to EchoStar common stock\n$\n313,237\n$\n38,222\n$\n393,770\n$\n181,673\nDiluted earnings per share (in dollars)\n$\n3.23\n$\n0.40\n$\n4.07\n$\n1.92\nNet income from continuing operations\n$\n311,759\n$\n23,823\n$\n384,980\n$\n136,372\nCapital expenditures from continuing operations\n$\n156,239\n$\n150,692\n$\n566,384\n$\n628,510\nThe following table reconciles total consolidated Net income to EBITDA.\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Years\nEnded December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In thousands)\nNet income\n$\n313,814\n$\n38,930\n$\n393,489\n$\n180,692\nInterest income and expense, net\n46,465\n35,587\n172,621\n102,237\nIncome tax (benefit) provision, net\n(293,359)\n18,996\n(284,286)\n80,254\nDepreciation and amortization\n142,251\n108,161\n522,190\n432,904\nNet income from discontinued operations\n(2,055)\n(15,107)\n(8,509)\n(44,320)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(577)\n(742)\n(928)\n(762)\nEBITDA\n$\n206,539\n$\n185,825\n$\n794,577\n$\n751,005\nNote on Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA is defined as \"Net income\" excluding \"Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized,\" \"Interest income,\" \"Income tax benefit (provision), net\" and \"Depreciation and amortization.\" EBITDA is not a measure determined in accordance with US GAAP. This non-GAAP measure is reconciled to \"Net income\" in the table above. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is used by our management as a measure of operating efficiency and overall financial performance for benchmarking against our peers and competitors. Management believes EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business. Management also believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of companies in our industry.\nThe consolidated financial statements of EchoStar for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are attached to this press release. Detailed financial data and other information are available in EchoStar's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017 filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nEchoStar will host its earnings conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
