    "text": "Michael Stone scored the go-ahead goal with 3:30 remaining in the third period, and the visiting Calgary Flames held on for a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday night at the United Center.\nDougie Hamilton and Sean Monahan also scored for Calgary, which completed a three-game sweep against Chicago during the regular season. The Flames improved to 14-5-5 on the road.\nAlex DeBrincat and Patrick Kane scored for Chicago. The Blackhawks dropped to 2-5-2 in their past nine contests and fell to 12-11-3 on home ice.\nStone flicked a wrist shot from the top of the right circle to notch the decisive goal. Johnny Gaudreau helped to set a screen in front of the crease, and the puck sailed into the top left corner of the net for Stoneâ€™s third goal of the season.\nMonahan gave Calgary a two-goal lead when he scored an empty-net goal with 1:51 to go.\nKane punched in his team-leading 21st goal with seven seconds remaining to close the gap to 3-2.\nFlames goalie Mike Smith stopped 34 shots to improve to 22-15-6. On the opposite end of the rink, Blackhawks goaltender Jeff Glass turned aside 20 shots.\nChicago opened the scoring on a power play 3:35 into the first period. DeBrincat fired a wrist shot through traffic from the top of the right circle for his 19th goal of the season and his fifth in the past five games.\nCalgary evened the score at 1 at the 1:10 mark of the second period. Hamilton scored his ninth goal during a two-on-one break. Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith tried to block the pass across the crease but could not react in time.\nThe Blackhawks believed that they had gained a 2-1 lead less than three minutes later, but after a lengthy video review, officials waved off a goal by Ryan Hartman because of goaltender interference.\nBoth teams traded quality scoring opportunities during a back-and-forth start to the third period. Flames center Mikael Backlund missed a golden opportunity when Glass slid across the crease for a kick save. Minutes later, Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews hit the crossbar during an odd-man rush.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
