    "text": "MIAMI, Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Starwood Capital Group, a leading global private investment firm, announced today that a controlled affiliate of Starwood Global Opportunity Fund XI has acquired a portfolio of seven Hilton hotels throughout the United Kingdom, totalling over 1,300 rooms from Park Hotels & Resorts for Â£135 million.\nThe portfolio is located in several of the UK's top hotel markets, including London, Edinburgh, Bath and Belfast, which benefit from high occupancies, high barriers to entry and solid investment fundamentals.\nStarwood Capital Group plan to refurbish a number of the assets in order to transform operating performance and enhance asset values, with the portfolio being managed by Kew Green under franchise agreements with Hilton Worldwide. This marks the second acquisition in 12 months where Starwood and Kew Green have partnered, following the successful acquisition of the 298-key Holiday Inn Manchester in April 2017.\n\"We are delighted to be partnering with Kew Green on yet another exciting transaction involving prime UK city centre assets,\" said Jon Asumendi, Vice President at Starwood Capital Group. \"We are acquiring this well-located portfolio at a substantial discount to replacement cost and with significant upside potential still to be realized. We look forward to investing in these properties alongside Kew Green and leveraging Starwood Capital Group's hospitality expertise to maximize portfolio performance and investment returns.\"\n\"Adding seven high quality Hilton branded assets to our Management Platform is an exciting step forwards for the Kew Green Group.
