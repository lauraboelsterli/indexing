    "text": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Wednesday convicted 31 people over the campus lynching of a university student who was falsely accused of blasphemy, and sentenced one of them to death, a defence lawyer said.\nThe killing of student Mashal Khan, 23, last year sparked an outcry and raised fresh questions about the misuse of a harsh blasphemy law, which stipulates the death sentence for insulting Islam or the Prophet Muhammad.\nBarrister Ameerullah Chamkani told Reuters one of the 31 accused had been sentenced to death, five were jailed for life and the other 25 were jailed for four years.\nThe court acquitted 26 others out of a total of 57 people indicted by a court late last year.\nChamkani said one of the convicts, Imran Ali, had been sentenced to death because he had shot Mashal three times.\nThe accused were students, teachers and some officials of Abdul Wali Khan University named after a secular political leader in northwest Pakistan.\nThey all pleaded not guilty in the trial conducted at a high-security prison due to threats to defence lawyers and government prosecutors, Chamkani said.\nLawyers for those convicted were not available for comment.\nKhan, a Muslim, was known as an intellectually curious student who liked to debate controversial social, political and religious issues.\nHe was attacked and killed by a mob on the campus on April 13 after a dormitory debate about religion.\nBlasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in Pakistan, where insulting Islam’s prophet is punishable by death, though no executions have been carried out for blasphemy.\nEven a rumour of blasphemy can spark mob violence and there have been cases of people misusing the law to settle scores.\nAt least 67 people have been killed over unproven blasphemy allegations since 1990, according to human rights groups.\n‘CONTINUE MY STRUGGLE’\nIn 2011, a bodyguard assassinated the liberal governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, after he called for the blasphemy laws to be reformed.\nHis killer, Mumtaz Qadri, who was executed last year, has been hailed as a martyr by religious hardliners.\nA political party founded in Qadri’s honour has made blasphemy its central issue in the run-up to a general election later this year.\nThe party last year forced the government to retract within a day a change in electoral laws that it deemed blasphemous.\nParty supporters also blocked the main road into Islamabad for nearly three weeks last year in a protest against a law minister they accused of blasphemy.\nThe government eventually gave in, agreeing to an army-brokered deal that included the resignation of the minister.\nKhan’s father, Iqbal Khan, expressed satisfaction about the verdicts.\n“I appreciate the court decision,” he told reporters in London in remarks broadcast live by Pakistan’s Geo TV.\nAsked about the acquittals, the father said: “I will continue my struggle.”\nKhan is visiting London to talk at various forums about his son’s case and the blasphemy law.\nKhan’s family say they have been threatened since his death and his two sisters have had to drop out of school. Police guard his grave.\nWriting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
