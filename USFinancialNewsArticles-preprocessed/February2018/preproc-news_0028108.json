    "text": "February 11, 2018 / 8:47 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Rugby-No discipline, no victory, says France captain Guirado Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Adds Brunel quotes) \nEDINBURGH, Feb 11 (Reuters) - France captain Guilhem Guirado said that Les Bleus will not win a game in the Six Nations if they don’t show more discipline after a 32-26 defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday. \nFrance made a good start with wing Teddy Thomas scoring two splendid tries and led by six points at halftime, but were sanctioned numerous times after the break, Greig Laidlaw slotting home the six penalties he attempted for Scotland. \nLes Bleus lost 15-13 to Ireland in last weekend’s opener where they also paid dearly for their lack of discipline. \n“It was worse this time,” said Guirado. \n“As long as we don’t show more discipline, we won’t win a match. But to be disciplined you have to be confident.” \nFrance have not won in their last eight outings. \n“We must respect the rules otherwise we won’t make it,” added Guirado. \n“We’re always under tremendous pressure and after two defeats in a row the game against Italy will be more than welcome to bounce back.” \nFrance are fifth in the standings with two points with their next opponents Italy on zero after they also lost their first two games. \n“The championship is not over yet but we must stop losing games like this,” said Guirado. \n“We gave away too many points,” added flyhalf Lionel Beauxis. \nCoach Jacques Brunel said: ”Our lack of discipline cost us a lot. We conceded seven penalties in the second half, five of them in the last 20 minutes. \n“We lost control of the ball and allowed our opponents to level and go ahead on the scoreboard.” \nBrunel, who was in charge of his second France game since being appointed in December, remained optimistic, however. \n“What I want to remember is that we were able to compete with Scotland, who have been in great form in the past three years. We just lack a little something but I think we’re close,” he said. (Writing by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",
