Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. \nHeadlines \nTDC rejects joint bid from Danish pension funds and Macquarie Group on.ft.com/2siqyUC \nRio Tinto rewards investors with record dividend on.ft.com/2sixvVC \nSoftBank in talks to take Swiss Re stake worth up to $11 bln on.ft.com/2siqIeG \nOverview \nTDC A/S has rejected a bid from three Danish pension funds and Macquarie Group only days after the telecoms operator made a poorly received bid to take over a media company. \nRio Tinto Plc has rewarded shareholders with the biggest dividend in its 145-year history and added a further $1 billion to a share buyback programme as annual profits surged on the back of higher commodity prices. \nSoftBank Group Corp, the acquisitive Japanese conglomerate, is in talks to take a minority stake in reinsurer Swiss Re AG in what would mark a significant expansion into financial services.
