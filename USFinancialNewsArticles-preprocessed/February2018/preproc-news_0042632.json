    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Finland beat South Korea 5-2 on Tuesday to reach the men’s Olympic ice hockey quarter-finals as the hosts bowed out of the tournament after a spirited performance in their final game.\nFinland opened a commanding lead near the game’s halfway point but the South Koreans battled back, closing to within a goal to give the Finns, ranked fourth in the world versus the hosts’ 21st, a genuine scare.\nFinland went ahead on the powerplay five minutes into the first period, Petri Kontiola rifling the puck into the upper corner of the net.\nThey increased the lead to three on a second goal from Kontiola and another from Miro Heiskanen in the second period before the Koreans got into gear.\nBrock Radunske, a Canadian who came to South Korea a decade ago, got his first Olympic goal when Mikko Koskinen coughed up a big rebound and he snuck it between the goaltender’s legs before Ahn Jin-Hui fired a hard wrist shot into the net.\nThe Finns regrouped midway through the third period when Juuso Hietanen forced the puck past a sprawling Matt Dalton less than 20 seconds into a man advantage.\nThe Koreans pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker with time expiring and Finland’s Sakari Manninen dribbled in an empty-net goal.\nFinland next face Canada on in the quarter-finals on Wednesday while South Korea exited the tournament having lost four straight games.\nAt the end of the game, the Korean team skated around the ice carrying South Korean flags to rousing applause from the home crowd. They formed a line in front of their bench and bowed to a visibly emotional head coach Jim Paek.\nTuesday also marked the end of the Olympic road for the Korean unified women’s hockey team who lost 6-1 to Sweden.
