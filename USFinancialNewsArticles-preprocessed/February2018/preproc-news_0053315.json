The year-over-year decline in NOI was primarily due to a year-over-year appreciation in the Peso relative to the US Dollar. For the full year, NOI was Ps 2,670.6 million, a 4.1% increase from 2016.\nThe industrial portfolio occupancy rate as of December 31, 2017 was 92.6%. The ten basis points change in closing occupancy compared to the prior year was partly attributable to the opportunistic sale of two fully leased properties. Rental rates improved in the fourth quarter of 2017, with a closing weighted average of US$4.61 per leased square meter per month, a 2.8% increase from the end of 2016. This rate increase was driven primarily by contractual increases, along with positive renewal spreads.\nFIBRAMQ signed 29 new and renewal leases in the fourth quarter of 2017, comprising 2.9 million square feet, which represents a record level of quarterly leasing activity since FIBRAMQ’s inception. Signed leases included six new leases totaling 337 thousand square feet and 23 renewal leases totaling 2.5 million square feet. New leases included the commencement of two completed expansions.\nNotable new leases in the quarter include a logistics company in Monterrey, a manufacturer of refrigeration equipment in Reynosa, and a call center operator in Ciudad Juárez. Renewal activity was particularly strong in the quarter, with the signing of seven renewal leases which were all greater than 100 thousand square feet, across various geographies and customer types, including manufacturers of automotive and diesel train components and medical supplies.\nFor the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2017, FIBRAMQ achieved a retention rate of 86%, a meaningful improvement from 2016.\nRetail Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes the proportionally combined results of operations for FIBRAMQ’s retail portfolio:\nRETAIL PORTFOLIO 4Q17 4Q16 Variance FY17 FY16 Variance NOI Ps 139.9m Ps 130.9m 6.9% Ps 551.2m Ps 522.6m 5.5% NOI Margin 73.1% 74.5% -140 bps 74.2% 74.5% -30 bps GLA (’000s sqm) EOP 456 455 0.0% 456 455 0.0% Occupancy EOP 95.1% 95.2% -10 bps 95.1% 95.2% -10 bps Average monthly rent per leased (Ps/sqm) EOP Ps 151.00 Ps 143.54 5.2% Ps 151.00 Ps 143.54 5.2% Customer retention LTM 76% 59% 1,750 bps 76% 59% 1,750 bps Weighted Avg. Lease Term Remaining (years) EOP 4.8 5.3 -10.3% 4.8 5.3 -10.3% FIBRAMQ’s retail portfolio delivered NOI of Ps 139.9 million, an increase of 6.9% from the prior year period. The year over year growth was driven by a 5.2% increase in average monthly rents. During the fourth quarter, FIBRAMQ signed 51 leases, representing 6.8 thousand square meters. This activity included 17 new leases and 34 renewals.\nFor the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2017, FIBRAMQ achieved a retention rate of 76%, a meaningful improvement from 2016.\nPORTFOLIO AND EXPANSION ACTIVITY\nFIBRAMQ continues to effectively execute on its strategy to deploy retained AFFO into accretive investments. A key element of this strategy is the targeted expansion of existing properties on a pre-leased basis along with selective development in core markets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, FIBRAMQ deployed or committed to deploy US$5.3 million and has deployed or committed to deploy US$25.4 million for the full year 2017 on these types of projects. The projected weighted average NOI yield on the capital deployed in 2017 was 12% p.a.\nDuring the fourth quarter, FIBRAMQ completed the following expansion projects:\nA 14 thousand square foot expansion for a manufacturer of fasteners, plastic components, automation systems and automatic doors in Querétaro A 65 thousand square foot expansion for an automotive parts manufacturer in Hermosillo A 3 thousand square foot expansion in connection to a new lease of 14 thousand square feet for a major retailer in the Magnocentro shopping center\nFIBRAMQ continued the following expansion projects:\nA 37 thousand square foot expansion for a food and beverage producer in Guadalajara A 14 thousand square foot expansion for a manufacturer of irrigation systems in Querétaro\nASSET RECYCLING\nFIBRAMQ remains committed to owning a best-in-class real estate portfolio by continuing to enhance its composition through asset recycling opportunities, pursuing both single asset and portfolio sales.\nDuring the fourth quarter, FIBRAMQ sold two properties in Villahermosa and Durango, completely exiting these non-core, single-asset markets. The sale proceeds of US$22.3 million exceeded the book value of the assets. FIBRAMQ has now successfully exited four of the five non-core markets in which it was present at the start of 2017.\nFIBRAMQ anticipates recycling approximately 10% of its existing total GLA over the medium term.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, FIBRAMQ had approximately Ps 17.3 billion of debt outstanding, Ps 4.3 billion available on its undrawn revolving credit facility and Ps 442.3 million of unrestricted cash on hand. FIBRAMQ’s CNBV regulatory debt to total asset ratio was 36.5%, a reduction of 60 basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter and 270 basis points compared to the end of 2016.\nDuring the quarter, a debt repayment of US$25.0 million was made in respect of the revolving credit facility, mainly sourced from asset sale proceeds. As a result, FIBRAMQ’s undrawn credit line available for general purposes has increased to US$217.8 million, providing ample liquidity and flexibility.\nIn addition, FIBRAMQ’s percentage of fixed-rate debt also increased to 95% across a weighted-average debt tenor remaining of 6.0 years, providing significant visibility on long-term funding costs amidst a rising interest rate environment.\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION\nFIBRA Macquarie is committed to providing clear and transparent reporting of its capital allocation track record. The following table provides an overview of how FIBRA Macquarie has funded and deployed its cash to execute on its previously stated initiatives to maximize value to its certificate holders. In 2017, FIBRA Macquarie effectively utilized retained AFFO and proceeds from non-core assets sales to deploy or commit to deploy capital across property expansions and developments, certificates re-purchased for cancellation and repayment of revolving debt.\nSOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL Ps Equivalent US$ equivalent Sources Retained AFFO – 2017 620.7m 32.8m Retained AFFO – from periods other than 2017 475.4m 25.1m Asset Sales – 2017 535.8m 28.3m Total Sources 1,631.9m 86.2m Uses Debt repayment – 2017 832.9m 44.0m Expansions & developments – completed in 2017 371.3m 19.6m Expansions & developments – committed in 2017, for completion in 2018 108.7m 5.7m Certificate re-purchased for cancellation – 2017 250.8m 13.3m Other – 2017 68.1m 3.6m Total Uses 1,631.9m 86.2m Note: Other - 2017 includes US$1.5m of income-generating Above-Standard Tenant Improvements. Uses average FX of Ps 18.93.\nCERTIFICATE BUY-BACK AND CANCELLATION PROGRAM\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, FIBRAMQ repurchased 8.1 million certificates, representing highly accretive returns based upon an end of period discount to NAV of 36.4% and an AFFO yield of 11.2% based upon the mid-point of 2018 AFFO guidance (Ps 2.275 per certificate) and the February 22, 2018 closing certificate price of Ps 20.39.\nSince commencing the certificate buy-back program on June 26, 2017 through to the current date, FIBRAMQ has repurchased 19.1 million certificates for a total of Ps 412.2 million, at an average certificate price of Ps 21.5438. All repurchased certificates have been cancelled or will be cancelled in due course.\nFIBRAMQ is authorized to repurchase up to 21.4 million additional certificates to complete the total authorization of up to 5.0% of outstanding certificates. The timing, price per certificate and amount of future repurchases will depend upon prevailing market prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations, including investment alternatives.\nDaily updates of FIBRAMQ’s buyback activity can be found at http://www.bmv.com.mx/en/issuers/corporativeinformation/FIBRAMQ-30024-CGEN_CAPIT .\nDISTRIBUTION\nOn February 22, 2018, FIBRAMQ declared a cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 of Ps 0.375 per certificate. The distribution is expected to be paid on March 9, 2018 to holders of record on March 8, 2018. FIBRAMQ’s certificates will commence trading ex-distribution on March 7, 2018. The full year 2017 distribution represents a full year 2017 AFFO payout ratio of 66.0%.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nFIBRA Macquarie is introducing its guidance for 2018. FIBRAMQ estimates total AFFO of between Ps. 2.25 and Ps. 2.30 per certificate in 2018. In respect of the full year 2018, FIBRAMQ expects to make cash distributions of approximately Ps 1.56 per certificate, payable in quarterly instalments of Ps 0.39 per certificate.\nThis guidance is based on the following assumptions:\nBased on the cash-generating capacity of its existing portfolio and an average exchange rate of Ps 18.5 per US dollar Assumes no new acquisitions or divestments, but noting that successful execution of opportunistic asset sales may result in a temporary decrease in AFFO until proceeds are re-deployed in other accretive opportunities Re-purchase for cancellation in 2018 of the remaining 21.4 million certificates available for buyback (as of February 22 nd 2018), resulting in an aggregate 5.0% of issued certificates being re-purchased and cancelled, to close 2018 with 770.8 million certificates outstanding The payment of cash distributions is subject to the approval of the board of directors of the Manager for cash distributions The continued stable performance of the properties in the portfolio, and market conditions.\nWEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL\nFIBRAMQ will host an earnings conference call and webcast presentation on Friday, February 23, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. CT / 8:30 a.m. ET.
