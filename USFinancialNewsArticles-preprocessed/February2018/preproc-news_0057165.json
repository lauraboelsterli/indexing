    "text": "Godfather of BitShares to provide strategic counsel for TopiaCoin’s entrance into blockchain community\nTACOMA, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Topia Technology announced today that digital currency guru and parallel entrepreneur Stan Larimer has joined its board of advisors, established to provide strategic counsel for TopiaCoin, the first secure network to be introduced into the blockchain community in 2019. Larimer is co-founder of BitShares, a platform blockchain technology, as well as president and co-founder of Cryptonomex, a software development services company providing blockchains and related technology.\n“Today, there is no real data security for blockchain-based applications and there is a huge need in the marketplace for a security layer,” said Larimer. “TopiaCoin will be the first to market with military-grade security and this will bring great value to the blockchain and BitShares community. I am excited to be involved with Topia Technology, a well-established company that is really going to make a world of difference in the future of blockchain through the introduction of TopiaCoin.”\nLarimer is a global leader in developing innovative blockchain technologies. He brings decades of executive leadership experience in software, hardware, and systems engineering in the American aerospace industry. He is now focused on leveraging that expertise to build a new industry developing unmanned companies that produce smart currencies and other decentralized financial services.\n“Stan will be a tremendous ally and we are thrilled to have him join our team,” said Janine Terrano, CEO, Topia Technology. “Not only is he the Godfather of BitShares, a community that is very important to us, he also understands the security gap that we are filling for blockchain-based applications. BitShares is expanding rapidly and we want to contribute to that growth through TopiaCoin.”\nThrough the introduction of TopiaCoin in 2019, Topia Technology will combine its patented security for shredding and encrypting data with the power and transparency of blockchain. Individuals and businesses will be able to easily and securely share any digital asset without a central server and with the confidence that each transaction is not only performed in a manner agreed upon by the blockchain, it will have the ability to guard against multiple threats.\nTopia’s Initial Coin Offering, for accredited investors only, is scheduled for April 2, 2018. Topia is currently in a private pre-sale and accepting pre-registration for accredited investors at TopiaCoin.io .\nAbout Topia Technology\nTopia Technology is a global leader in securely moving and managing data in complex distributed environments. Topia’s military-grade security platform, Secrata, is the only triple-layer enterprise security platform providing encryption and separation end-to-end, protecting against brute force attacks and more innovative security threats. It offers unparalleled security, flexibility and performance for US government agencies such as the Air Force, Army, FAA and TSA and other enterprises that require security coupled with strict performance metrics. In 2019, Topia will launch TopiaCoin, combining blockchain with the proven security of Secrata to enable unmatched protection of any digital asset in a decentralized architecture.
