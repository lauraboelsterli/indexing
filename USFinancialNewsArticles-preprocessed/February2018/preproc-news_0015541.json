    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nuveen, a leading global investment manager, appointed several key executives to positions supporting its expanding Defined Contribution Investment Only (DCIO) enterprise. The move builds on the firm’s second consecutive year of growth since re-positioning its DCIO business in 2015.\n“Demand for our retirement plan investment solutions has been robust with our active and index target date strategies seeing particularly high levels of inflows as a result of their competitive performance, strong showing in industry rankings and relatively low costs. Our DCIO business grew nearly 40% in 2017 which is a testament to the competitive offering we have for plan sponsors, consultants and advisors,” said Erin Donnelly, executive vice president and head of Nuveen’s DCIO business. “Our success in this business segment has certainly been an advantage in attracting top talent to support our plans to continue growing in this business in the year ahead.”\nAdditions to Nuveen’s DCIO team include:\nPeter Whitman joined the firm as managing director responsible for DCIO Strategic Accounts reporting directly to Ms. Donnelly. He will oversee the firm’s retirement presence across recordkeeping, retirement intermediary and other third-party retirement platforms and relationships. Mr. Whitman will also focus on building Nuveen’s retirement sub-advisory business. Greg Koleno joined the DCIO sales team reporting to Brendan McCarthy, DCIO National Sales Director, and is based in Portland, Oregon. Mr. Koleno is responsible for DCIO sales in the Northwest. Previously, Mr. Koleno was vice president for DCIO sales covering the Pacific Northwest for American Century Investments. James Polito joined the DCIO sales team, also reporting to Mr. McCarthy, and is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mr. Polito is responsible for DCIO sales in the Southeast. Most recently, Mr. Polito was vice president and retirement consultant for DCIO sales with BNY Mellon covering the southeastern United States.\nComplementing the new DCIO team hires, Nuveen hired Jeff Eng as managing director responsible for retirement solutions reporting to Martin Kremenstein, senior managing director and head of Nuveen’s retirement and ETF solutions business. In this role, Mr. Eng supports the firm’s retirement businesses by leading new product initiatives. Mr. Eng joins the firm from AB, where he was head of their custom defined contribution solutions business.\nNuveen is the fourth largest investment manager of defined contribution assets in the United States 1 and the sixth largest manager of target date fund assets 2 . Its DCIO team works in consultation with plan sponsors, consultants and retirement plan advisors to evaluate the investment menus of retirement plans and identify ways to improve outcomes for plan participants.\nThrough Nuveen’s investment affiliates, the DCIO team delivers a wide range of competitive fixed income and equity mutual funds and a diversified suite of environmental, social and governance (ESG) equity and fixed income funds, including the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund (TSBIX). The team also offers the firm’s industry-leading 3 active and passive target date funds such as TIAA-CREF Lifecycle 2040 (TCIOX) and TIAA-CREF Lifecycle Index 2040 (TIZLX), asset allocation strategies that can act as the qualified default investment alternative (QDIA) of defined contribution plans.\nAbout Nuveen\nNuveen, the investment manager of TIAA, offers a comprehensive range of outcome-focused investment solutions designed to secure the long-term financial goals of institutional and individual investors.
