McFall, who has served as the company’s president since 2016, brings a proven success record in the software and mobility space to his new position of President and CEO.\nMcFall has held numerous strategy and implementation, solution design, customer acquisition and support and industry growth roles throughout his 19-year career. He will call on that experience, especially his time as Mobile Labs president, to help drive the company to new levels of revenue growth and success in 2018 and beyond.\n“Dan’s drive, leadership skills and industry knowledge have made a strong and enduring impact on Mobile Labs,” said Sanjeev Tirath, Mobile Labs board member. “These qualities, along with his passion for innovation, make him the logical choice for the expanded role of President and CEO.”\n“We closed out 2017 on a very high note,” McFall said recently. “Our graduation from Atlanta Tech Village, achieving a customer base growth of more than 20%, the launch of new products and the expansion of key staff all represent the formidable growth potential Mobile Labs has in the mobile application marketplace. I look forward to the challenge of leading this innovative team as we continue our track record of success.”\nAbout Mobile Labs\nMobile Labs provides enterprise-grade mobile device clouds that improve efficiency and raise quality for agile–based, cross-platform mobile app and mobile web deployments.
