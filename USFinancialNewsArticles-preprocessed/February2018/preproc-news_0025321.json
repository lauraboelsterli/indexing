    "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Apollo that is seeking to buy the chemicals division of Dulux paintmaker Akzo Nobel ( AKZO.AS ) has added a Dutch pension firm to its team, the Financial Times reported on Monday.\nAccording to the FT report, PGGM, which oversees 200 billion euros ($245 billion) on behalf of workers in the Dutch healthcare sector, has joined with Apollo and chemicals company Lanxess ( LXSG.DE ).\nAkzo has set an April deadline to sell or spin off the chemicals operations, which account for a third of company sales and earnings and is valued at roughly 9 billion euros.\nPGGM could not immediately be reached to comment on the FT report.\nAdding a Dutch player to the Apollo bidding team could be a smart strategic move. Akzo’s decision to sell the unit was made as part of its strategy to reject a 26 billion euro takeover bid from U.S. rival PPG Industries.\nAkzo rejected the idea of an American owner, saying PPG would be a poor cultural fit and the takeover would lead to job losses.\nCandidates to buy the chemicals division include the Apollo group, private equity firm Carlyle, a teamup between private equity firms Bain Capital and Advent, and Luxembourg-based Hal Investments.\nThe firms have all either declined comment or have not responded to requests for comment on their possible interest in Akzo’s chemicals business..
