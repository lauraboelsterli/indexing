Topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard (\"Topic 605\"). The financial information under the heading “Financial Outlook” above is prepared in accordance with Topic 606, and the comparison period amounts used to calculate related growth rates are based on amounts that have been restated from previously reported amounts to conform to the requirements of Topic 606. Unless otherwise indicated, all other financial information in this release is prepared in accordance with Topic 605.\nUnder Topic 606, for our on-premises offerings, we will recognize a portion of the subscription revenue when the on-premises offering is made available, resulting in a larger amount of upfront subscription revenue, and a smaller amount of deferred revenue compared with Topic 605, which required ratable revenue recognition over the contract period. Due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 will depend on contract-specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period. Proceeds for attendance and sponsorship related to Knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expenses instead of professional services and other revenues.\nUnder Topic 606, we will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain customer contracts, including indirect costs that are not tied to a specific contract. On initial contracts, only the portion equivalent to a renewal commission will be amortized over the contract term, while the portion incremental to a renewal commission will be amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. On renewal contracts, these costs will be amortized over the renewal term. Additionally, for our on-premises offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenue for on-premises offerings as described above, a portion of the commission costs will be expensed upfront when the on-premises offering is made available. Under Topic 605, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortized those costs over the contract term, which is generally 12 to 36 months.\nStatement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report the following non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nRevenue Adjusted for Constant Currency. We present revenues adjusted for constant currency to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. We believe the presentation of revenues adjusted for constant currency facilitates the comparison of revenues year-over-year. Billings. We believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business. Because billings is derived from our GAAP revenues, the definition of billings varies depending on whether our revenues have been calculated under Topic 605 or Topic 606. Under Topic 605, we define subscription billings, professional services and other billings, and total billings as the applicable revenue plus the applicable change in deferred revenue as presented or derived from the statement of cash flows. Under Topic 606, due to the change in timing of revenue recognition under certain of our contracts, we define subscription billings, professional services and other billings, and total billings as the applicable revenue plus the applicable change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits as presented or derived from the statement of cash flows. Under Topic 606, unbilled receivables are amounts recognized as revenue that have not yet been billed, and customer deposits are refundable amounts associated with customer contracts. In presenting billings under either definition, we adjust for constant currency, as described above, and adjust for constant duration by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of twelve months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of twelve months during the prior period presented. We believe these adjustments facilitate greater comparability in our billings information year-over-year. Gross Profit, Income from Operations and Net Income. Our non-GAAP presentation of gross profit, income from operations, and net income measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes, loss on early note conversions, amortization of purchased intangibles, legal settlements, business combination and other related costs, and the related income tax effect of these adjustments. We believe the presentation of operating results that exclude these non-cash or non-recurring items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of our operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash paid for legal settlements and repayment of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of total revenues. We believe information regarding free cash flow and free cash flow margin provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations.\nOur presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business. Please see the tables included at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nUse of Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains “forward-looking statements” regarding our performance, including but not limited to statements in the section entitled “Financial Outlook.” are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results expected or implied by the forward-looking statements.

The impact of the adoption for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 is not material.\nServiceNow, Inc.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Twelve 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (3) Growth Rates December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (3) Growth Rates Subscription revenues: GAAP subscription revenues $ 497,232 $ 344,604 44 % $ 1,739,795 $ 1,221,639 42 % Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations (12,941 ) (6,303 ) Non-GAAP adjusted subscription revenues (1) $ 484,291 41 % $ 1,733,492 42 % Subscription billings: GAAP subscription revenues $ 497,232 $ 344,604 44 % $ 1,739,795 $ 1,221,639 42 % Increase in subscription deferred revenue 186,801 139,303 379,188 289,053 Non-GAAP subscription billings 684,033 $ 483,907 41 % 2,118,983 $ 1,510,692 40 % Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations (18,085 ) (7,384 ) Effects of fluctuations in billings duration 12,444 (1,562 ) Non-GAAP adjusted subscription billings (2) $ 678,392 40 % $ 2,110,037 40 % Professional services and other revenues: GAAP professional services and other revenues $ 49,138 $ 41,062 20 % $ 193,231 $ 168,874 14 % Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations (1,565 ) (899 ) Non-GAAP adjusted professional services and other revenues (1) $ 47,573 16 % $ 192,332 14 % Professional services and other billings: GAAP professional services and other revenues $ 49,138 $ 41,062 20 % $ 193,231 $ 168,874 14 % Increase in professional services and other deferred revenue 1,167 9,845 2,374 11,114 Non-GAAP professional services and other billings 50,305 50,907 (1 %) 195,605 179,988 9 % Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations (1,565 ) (899 ) Non-GAAP adjusted professional services and other billings (2) $ 48,740 (4 %) $ 194,706 8 % Total revenues: GAAP total revenues $ 546,370 $ 385,666 42 % $ 1,933,026 $ 1,390,513 39 % Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations (14,506 ) (7,202 ) Non-GAAP adjusted total revenues (1) $ 531,864 38 % $ 1,925,824 38 % Total billings: GAAP total revenues $ 546,370 $ 385,666 42 % $ 1,933,026 $ 1,390,513 39 % Increase in total deferred revenue from condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 187,968 149,148 381,562 300,167 Non-GAAP total billings 734,338 534,814 37 % 2,314,588 1,690,680 37 % Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations (19,650 ) (8,283 ) Effects of fluctuations in billings duration 12,444 (1,562 ) Non-GAAP adjusted total billings (2) $ 727,132 36 % $ 2,304,743 36 % Gross profit: GAAP subscription gross profit $ 409,708 $ 279,897 $ 1,424,225 $ 986,225 Stock-based compensation 9,474 7,722 35,334 28,420 Amortization of purchased intangibles 4,118 3,334 14,967 12,633 Non-GAAP subscription gross profit $ 423,300 $ 290,953 $ 1,474,526 $ 1,027,278 GAAP professional services and other gross profit $ 2,302 $ 833 $ 9,029 $ 5,606 Stock-based compensation 5,853 6,397 27,475 26,442 Non-GAAP professional services and other gross profit $ 8,155 $ 7,230 $ 36,504 $ 32,048 GAAP gross profit $ 412,010 $ 280,730 $ 1,433,254 $ 991,831 Stock-based compensation 15,327 14,119 62,809 54,862 Amortization of purchased intangibles 4,118 3,334 14,967 12,633 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 431,455 $ 298,183 $ 1,511,030 $ 1,059,326 Gross margin: GAAP subscription gross margin 82 % 81 % 82 % 81 % Stock-based compensation as % of subscription revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 % Amortization of purchased intangibles as % of subscription revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Non-GAAP subscription gross margin 85 % 84 % 85 % 84 % GAAP professional services and other gross margin 5 % 2 % 5 % 3 % Stock-based compensation as % of professional services and other revenues 12 % 16 % 14 % 16 % Non-GAAP professional services and other gross margin 17 % 18 % 19 % 19 % GAAP gross margin 75 % 73 % 74 % 71 % Stock-based compensation as % of total revenues 3 % 3 % 3 % 4 % Amortization of purchased intangibles as % of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Non-GAAP gross margin 79 % 77 % 78 % 76 % Income (loss) from operations: GAAP loss from operations $ (13,132 ) $ (23,603 ) $ (101,414 ) $ (422,808 ) Stock-based compensation 105,627 83,120 394,078 317,580 Amortization of purchased intangibles 5,359 4,220 19,658 15,118 Business combination and other related costs 917 27 2,421 989 Legal settlements -

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Guidance The financial guidance provided below is an estimate based on information available as of December 31, 2017. As described in the “New Revenue Recognition Standard Under Topic 606” section above, our guidance is based on the new Topic 606 revenue recognition standard that is effective beginning January 1, 2018. The comparison period amounts and the related growth rates have been restated from previously reported amounts to conform with the Topic 606 presentation. The company’s future performance and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from the guidance set forth below. Some of the factors that could affect the company’s financial results are stated above in this press release. Further information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Form 10-K that will be filed for the year ended December 31, 2017.
