    "text": "By Lucinda Shen 1:45 PM EST \nThe majority of Americans polled following a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla . on Feb. 14 say the tragedy could have been prevented, and agree on at least on one thing: neither Congress nor President Donald Trump are doing enough to curtail such violence. \nThatâ€™s according to a Washington Post -ABC News Poll of some 808 adults conducted between Feb. 15 to Feb. 18, the days following an attack by former student Nikolas Cruz at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead and 14 injured . \nAbout 77% of those polled said Congress is not doing enough to prevent such mass shootings, while 62% said Trump has not been doing enough. \nWhen quizzed as to whether the school shooting in Parkland could have been prevented, 58% opined that yes, it could have been stopped, with 37% disagreeing. \nThe poll comes at a time when the number of deadly school shootings has reached 18 thus far into 2018, reawakening debate over gun control laws and school safety initiatives. \nAnd while those polled sought more action from the White House and Congress, most thought the number of mass shootings in the country centers around an issue about identifying and treating people with mental health issues. About 57% said as much, versus 28% who thought it to be a reflection of inadequate gun control laws. \nMeanwhile, some 51% said armed teachers could have helped prevent the Parkland shooting, against 42% that leaned the other way. Schools across the country have been considering whether or not to arm some educators as a way to protect against mass shootings. An Eastern Ohio school board agreed to arm some members of staff in the hopes of boosting security, the Ohio Dispatch reported . \nAt the same time that Florida students are pleading Congressional leaders to implement more gun control , a seventh grader in Jackson Township, Ohio was found injured by a self-inflicted gunshot wound early Tuesday . Authorities are still unclear as to whether the incident was an accident, and no others have been reported injured. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
