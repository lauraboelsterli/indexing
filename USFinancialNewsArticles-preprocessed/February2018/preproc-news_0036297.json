    "text": "February 15, 2018 / 12:55 PM / a few seconds ago Ice Hockey: South Korean men score first goal of Games Dan Burns 1 Min Read GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - It took the unified Korean women’s ice hockey team 149 minutes and 31 seconds of playing time to get their first Olympic goal. South Korea’s men’s hockey team needed only 7 minutes and 34 seconds to do it. Slideshow (5 Images) The Koreans jumped out to a surprise 1-0 lead over a much higher-ranked Czech Republic team with a goal by Cho Minho, assisted by Brock Radunske and Michael Swift, sending the near-capacity crowed at the Gangneung Hockey Centre into delirium. The Czechs leveled the scores about four minutes later. Reporting by Dan Burns, editing by Ed Osmond",
