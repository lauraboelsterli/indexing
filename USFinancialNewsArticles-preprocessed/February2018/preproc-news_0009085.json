    "text": "Zelalem — February 6, 2018 0 comment \nADDIS ABABA (Reuters) – An Ethiopian court sentenced a senior opposition leader to six months in jail for contempt of court on Monday because he raised his hand when addressed by the judge rather than standing, his lawyer said. \nThe court ruling came despite a government push to release politicians jailed after mass protests broke out three years ago in the Oromiya region over accusations of land grabbing. \nMore than 2,000 political prisoners have been released since January as part of a package of reforms announced to try to calm lingering tensions.

The charge was later reduced to inciting violence. \n“He had raised his hand when called upon by the judge. The judged deemed that as contempt of court as he did not rise and delivered a six-month sentence,” his lawyer Ameha Mekonnen told Reuters. \nLast month, the court had also sentenced him for a similar period after Bekele and other opposition party members sang a protest song during the trial. A separate verdict on his incitement charge is expected on March 7.

It denies the charges. \nLast month the United Nations human rights body called on Ethiopia to review the status of a “large number of people” still behind bars. The total number of people that remain imprisoned for taking part in the demonstrations is unknown. \nThe body said the government should review anti-terror legislation and laws “to ensure that they are neither interpreted nor implemented too broadly, thereby resulting in people being arbitrarily or wrongfully detained”. \nLaws placing “undue restrictions” on non-governmental organizations and restricting the media should also be revised, the U.N. said. \nMerera Gudina, the leader of Bekele’s Oromo Federalist Congress, is among those recently released. The group is a member of Ethiopia’s largest opposition coalition. Reporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Katharine Houreld and Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
