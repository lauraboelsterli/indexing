(NYSE:TREX), the world’s number-one brand of decking and railing and leader in high-performance, low-maintenance outdoor living products, and a leading national provider of custom-engineered railing systems, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nConsolidated sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $122 million, a 28% year-over-year increase. Trex Residential Products’ sales were up 15% to $109.6 million, with Trex Commercial Products sales contributing an additional $12.7 million. Consolidated gross margin for the quarter expanded 170 basis points to 41.7% driven by a 590 basis point increase in Trex Residential Products’ gross margin to 45.9%, as a result of continued raw material benefits, ongoing cost saving initiatives and increased capacity utilization. EBITDA amounted to $30 million, a 29% year-over-year increase. SG&A was $25.6 million, or 20.9% of sales. Exclusive of $1.2 million in amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of SC Company, SG&A was 20% of sales.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $18 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, up 45% and 44% respectively, from the net income of $13 million, or $0.43 per diluted share reported for the last year’s fourth quarter. A one-time tax benefit of $1.9 million added $0.06 to earnings per diluted share, as a result of the company's revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the recently enacted U.S. Federal \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\"\n“Our fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to another record year for Trex. Positive consumer confidence trends, strong demand for Trex Residential Products, and continued support from our channel partners, drove organic revenue growth of 15%. Consistent with prior quarters, consolidated and Trex Residential Products’ gross margins expanded from year-ago levels, increasing by 170 basis points and 590 basis points, respectively, benefitting from lower input costs, ongoing manufacturing cost savings, and higher capacity utilization. Consolidated margin performance includes the impact of below normal margins on certain legacy commercial contracts,” said James E. Cline, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFor full year 2017, consolidated sales were $565 million, 18% above the $480 million reported for full year 2016, with Trex Residential Products sales growing 13% to $543 million, and Trex Commercial Products adding $22 million. Gross margin was 43.1%, a 410 basis point year-over-year increase compared to full year 2016 gross margin of 39%. After adjusting for a $9.8 million warranty charge taken in 2016, gross margin expanded by 200 basis points. Net income amounted to $95 million, or $3.22 per diluted share, up 40% and 41% respectively, from 2016 levels. Adjusted for the 2016 warranty reserve charge, diluted earnings per share increased 28% from $2.51 in 2016. Incremental margin for Trex Residential Products for the year was 69%, while consolidated incremental margin totaled 54%, both adjusted for the 2016 warranty reserve charge.\n“We achieved positive momentum across all key metrics in each quarter of 2017, reflecting our brand and market share leadership in residential products, supported by an operational infrastructure that is dedicated to continuous improvement. As a result, we have been able to achieve substantial operating leverage and post a significant increase in operating cash flow.\n“The acquisition of SC Company in July 2017 was funded entirely through internally-generated cash and has established our wholly-owned subsidiary, Trex Commercial Products, which diversifies our revenue sources and expands our growth opportunities . Sales related to Trex Commercial Products have been and will continue to be somewhat uneven quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to address certain execution issues from the fourth quarter that were related primarily to pre-acquisition projects. These executional issues, along with stronger operational and financial controls will continue to be our focus as we work towards driving improved profitability. This acquisition has significantly enhanced our engineering capabilities enabling us to accelerate the development and introduction of new railing products into the residential marketplace and, as previously noted, increasing margins in this segment by the second half of this year is a priority,” Mr. Cline added.\nSummary and Outlook\n“Looking ahead, indications point to continued positive trends for the repair and remodeling markets, which together with favorable consumer confidence data, have been closely correlated with demand for Trex decking products. At the same time, we continue to invest in targeted marketing and advertising programs to further strengthen Trex brand recognition amongst consumers and enable us to continue to gain share from the dominant wood market. Research and development spending has ensured that Trex remains at the forefront of product innovation and process improvement, and we continue to capture the structural benefits of our recycled-content business model, and its increasing appeal to consumers.\n“For the first quarter of 2018, we expect consolidated sales of $172 million, comprised of approximately $157 million from Trex Residential Products and $15 million from Trex Commercial Products. We expect our effective tax rate to be 25%, down from our 2017 rate of 33%, and incremental margin to be approximately 45% as we will continue to benefit from lower input costs, ongoing process improvement initiatives, and increased capacity utilization,” Mr. Cline concluded.\nThe Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 2.9 million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call and Webcast Information\nTrex will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and other corporate matters on Wednesday, February 21, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual operating results to differ materially. Such risks and uncertainties include the extent of market acceptance of the Company's products; the costs associated with the development and launch of new products and the market acceptance of such new products; the sensitivity of the Company's business to general economic conditions; the impact of weather-related demand fluctuations on inventory levels in the distribution channel and sales of the Company’s products; the Company's ability to obtain raw materials at acceptable prices; the Company's ability to maintain product quality and product performance at an acceptable cost; the level of expenses associated with product replacement and consumer relations expenses related to product quality; and the highly competitive markets in which the Company operates. Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company, including in particular its latest annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, discuss some of the important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The Company has included data with respect to EBITDA because management evaluates and projects the performance of the Company’s business using several measures, including EBITDA. Management considers EBITDA to be an important supplemental indicator of the Company’s operating performance, particularly as compared to the operating performance of the Company’s competitors, because this measure eliminates many differences among companies in capitalization and tax structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets, as well as some recurring non-cash and non-operating charges to net income or loss. For these reasons, management believes that EBITDA provides important supplemental information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company and facilitates comparisons by investors between the operating performance of the Company and the operating performance of its competitors. Management believes that consideration of EBITDA should be supplemental, because EBITDA has limitations as an analytical financial measure. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of operating performance, nor should it be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income:\nReconciliation of net income to EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended December 31\n(in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nNet income $ 18,299 $ 12,629 Interest $ (53 ) $ 17 Taxes $ 7,076 $ 7,112 Depreciation and Amortization $ 4,762 $ 3,573 EBITDA $ 30,084 $ 23,331 About Trex Company\nTrex Company is the world’s largest manufacturer of high performance wood-alternative decking and railing, with more than 25 years of product experience.
