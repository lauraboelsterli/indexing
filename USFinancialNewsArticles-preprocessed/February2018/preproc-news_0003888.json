    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:ESIO), an innovator of laser-based manufacturing solutions for the microtechnology industry, today announced results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended December 30, 2017. Financial measures are provided on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of purchase accounting, equity compensation, restructuring, and other items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below.\nThird quarter revenue was $110.8 million, compared to $33.8 million in the third quarter of last fiscal year. GAAP net income was $34.0 million or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $9.7 million or $0.29 per share one year ago. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $35.6 million or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $7.6 million or $0.23 per share in the prior year's third quarter.\nMichael Burger, ESI's president and CEO, stated, “We delivered another quarter of excellent financial results. I’m particularly proud of the entire ESI team as they demonstrated the power of our highly scalable cost model by shipping a record amount of product, resulting in dramatic increases in revenue and profitability. Our non-GAAP gross margin rate of nearly 49% enabled adjusted operating margin of over 32% and adjusted quarterly earnings of nearly $1.00 per share.\"\nTotal orders for the quarter were $134.0 million, compared to $44.1 million one year ago and $128.9 million in the prior quarter. Burger continued, \"Bookings more than tripled year over year as increasingly complex consumer electronics have driven an expansion of the flexible circuit content per device, requiring flexible circuit manufacturers to add capacity of our industry-leading laser drilling products.\"\nGAAP gross margin was 48.0%, compared to 33.9% in the third quarter of last year, on significantly higher revenues. Operating expense was $19.9 million, down from $21.5 million last year, as a result of our now-completed cost reduction activities that were partially offset in the quarter by higher volume-related variable expenses. Operating income was $33.2 million, or 30% of revenue, compared to a loss of $10.1 million in last year's third quarter.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAt quarter end, total cash, restricted cash and current investments increased to $100.2 million. The company generated $15.1 million of cash from operations during the quarter. Sequentially, and as a result of our increased production and shipment levels, inventories increased by $13.1 million to $74.5 million, and accounts receivable increased by $28.0 million to $75.7 million. Inventory turnover improved to 3.4 times and days sales outstanding remained relatively steady at 62 days.\nFourth Quarter 2018 Outlook\nBased on current market and backlog conditions, revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 are expected to be between $95 and $110 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $0.75 to $0.95.\nBurger concluded, \"Similar to other capital equipment providers, our visibility of specific demand levels beyond the first quarter of fiscal 2019 remains limited. That said, we believe the underlying technology trends for our products will drive long-term growth in our targeted markets, and our business model should translate the incremental revenue into leveraged earnings growth.\"\nThe company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET. The session will include a review of the financial results, operational performance and business outlook, and also a question and answer period. The conference call can be accessed by calling 888-339-2688 (domestic participants) or 617-847-3007 (international participants). The conference ID number is 24885109. A live audio webcast can be accessed at www.esi.com .\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, we have presented financial measures which have not been determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are therefore non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP, or adjusted, financial measures exclude the impact of purchase accounting, equity compensation, restructuring, and other items. We believe that this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to assess the company’s operating performance by comparing it to prior periods on a more consistent basis. We have included a reconciliation of various non-GAAP financial measures to those measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Because our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing our non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.\nAbout ESI\nESI enables our customers to commercialize technology using precision laser processes.
