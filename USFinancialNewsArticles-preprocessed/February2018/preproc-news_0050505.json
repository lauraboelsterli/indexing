    "text": "4 COMMENTS Joel McHale’s new talk show isn’t so different in format from the old one he hosted on basic cable.\nOn “The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale,” which premiered over the weekend, he played clips from reality shows, cracked jokes about them in front of an audience, and goofed off with celebrity guests—much like he did as host of “The Soup” on the E! Network. Now that he is on Netflix , however, each weekly taping is quickly translated into more than 20 languages, then released through the streaming service to 190 countries.\nThe talk-show universe is expanding. One of the most antiquated television formulas—host, monologue, famous interviewees—is becoming crowded with chatty competitors eager to process the drama of American politics and culture. Meanwhile, the influence of other mediums, including podcasting, is seeping into TV.\nBroadcast TV’s big three, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon, battle nightly for ratings and relevance, alongside Seth Meyers, James Corden and cable rivals like Trevor Noah and Conan O’Brien. The conversation has spilled into streaming services, including Hulu, which in October aired “I Love You, America,” a political talk series from comedian Sarah Silverman. President Donald Trump is a reliable source of fuel for other young shows such as “The Opposition With Jordan Klepper ” on Comedy Central and “The Rundown With Robin Thede” on BET.\nSarah Silverman in her Hulu series ‘I Love You, America.’ Photo: Hulu With built-in audiences and road-tested hosts, some podcasts are jumping to the screen, too. HBO this month began airing the comedy podcast “2 Dope Queens” and picked up the political round table “Pod Save America” for later this year. Weeknights on Vice Media’s freewheeling cable channel Viceland are anchored by the late-night show “Desus & Mero,” named for the hosts who honed their tag-team comedy riffs in podcasting.\nDesus Nice and the Kid Mero on the set of their Viceland show ‘Desus & Mero.’ Photo: VICELAND As usual, the TV industry is watching to see what happens as Netflix muscles into the space . After training viewers to binge on full seasons of shows, the streaming giant is diversifying into episodic television via the talk format. \n“They want to expand into everything,” Mr. McHale joked in an interview, “including farming, rocketry and nation-building.”\nSimilar to how Netflix wooed big names to its stable of stand-up comedy specials , the company is now inviting comedians and TV stars to build their own talk shows. It brought David Letterman out of retirement, beard intact, for a monthly interview series that so far has featured Barack Obama and George Clooney. Like all streaming series, new installments of Netflix talk shows can be viewed on-demand at any time.\nLast week, the streamer announced a deal with Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comedian and former writer for “The Daily Show” and “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” to host a weekly half-hour series. “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Norm Macdonald has been doing his own talk show on YouTube and is expected to create an expanded version for Netflix, according to people familiar with the matter. Netflix declined to comment.\nThe company has experimented with the talk-show format before. Chelsea Handler , a seasoned late-night host on cable TV, began hosting a weekly Netflix show in 2016. Amid the din of the presidential election, her eclectic approach didn’t draw the attention that rivals more focused on politics and satire did, including Samantha Bee on TBS and John Oliver on HBO. After two seasons, “Chelsea” ended last year.\nChelsea Handler hosted a weekly Netflix show in 2016 and 2017. Photo: Netflix The blueprint for “The Joel McHale Show” predates Netflix. It was introduced by E! in 1991 with “Talk Soup,” whose hosts riffed on the antics seen on “The Jerry Springer Show” and other daytime TV. The series relaunched as “The Soup” in 2004 with Mr. McHale. \nDelivering deadpan snark as absurd clips played, the comedian provided a sort of color commentary for the reality TV era and launched his own Hollywood career in the process. He later starred in the NBC comedy “Community” and has popped up everywhere from the reboot of “The X-Files” to the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, which he hosted in 2014.\nMr. McHale in a clip from his new show. Photo: Netflix The Netflix platform allows Mr. McHale a wider array of targets. The producers now unearth clips from South Korean soap operas, Japanese game shows and other international content that Netflix hosts. \nIt remains to be seen if talk shows can retrain Netflix users to use the service for appointment television. To boost the visibility of “The Joel McHale Show” across the internet—where all talk shows compete for buzz—Netflix is releasing segments on YouTube, Twitter and other sites, a first for the company.\nPaul Feig , who directed “Bridesmaids” and 2016’s “Ghostbusters,” was a repeat guest on “The Soup” and “a crazed fan,” he says. After E! canceled it in 2015, Mr. Feig set out to bring the concept back. \nHe is the executive producer and director of the new show, which he says Netflix won amid competition from several studios, TV networks and streaming companies. \nDespite Netflix’s deep pockets, “The Joel McHale Show” maintains the scrappy “garage band” aesthetic of its predecessor, Mr. Feig says. Adds Mr. McHale, “If we’re not the cheapest show on their air, I’ll be surprised.” \nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com",
