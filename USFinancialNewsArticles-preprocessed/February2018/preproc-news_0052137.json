    "text": "23 COMMENTS In her Feb. 16 op-ed Angela Rocco DeCarlo asks the question: “ Did My Mother Have ‘White Privilege’? ” In short, Ms. DeCarlo, the answer is yes. How so? Very simply, between 1911 when your mother arrived and 1920, 80 black Americans were lynched in the city of Chicago. And while your ancestors worked hard and faced levels of discrimination as you mention, at least they were alive to share their lives with you. The scores of black Americans who were lynched weren’t so fortunate.\nTim Smith\nCincinnati\nMy mother’s family came from Southern Italy about a decade before Ms. DeCarlo’s. There were 14 of them, and they were uneducated. Neither of my parents got beyond the second grade, but of the males, including those who married my mother’s sisters, seven of 10 successfully started or bought businesses with their savings. Discrimination? My father extended his successful business to Blackwell, Okla., where a Ku Klux Klan cross was burned in front of our house.\nHarry R. Clements\nWichita, Kan.\nMs. DeCarlo’s Italian mother, like my Eastern European great-grandparents, fought hard against many obstacles to gain a toehold in American society. Why can’t we honor their struggles, without diminishing the reality that American blacks—even those who, like my own black daughter, enjoy substantial social and economic advantages—face racial discrimination on every street they walk down, every institution they enter and every screen they peer at? Why can’t we abhor this discrimination and yet still love our country?\nPeter Mostow\nMercer Island, Wash.\nMs. DeCarlo questions whether her mother benefited from “white privilege” when in 1918 at age 14 she dropped out of school and went to work in a Chicago coat factory because her family needed the income.\nWould a poor, black 14-year-old girl in the same situation have been able to get a similar job in that factory? I don’t know the answer, but if not, why wouldn’t Ms. DeCarlo think that her mother benefitted from “white privilege”?\nJeffrey I. Zuckerman\nSilver Spring, Md.",
