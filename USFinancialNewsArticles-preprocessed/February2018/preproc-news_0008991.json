    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A supersonic aerobatic jet of South Korea’s Air Force skidded off one of the two runways at Singapore’s Changi Airport during the Singapore Airshow, closing one runway and causing flight delays, authorities said.\n“At around 1324 Singapore local time, one aircraft of the Black Eagles aerobatic team from the Republic of Korea Air Force skidded and crashed into the grass verge at the side of Changi Airport’s Runway 1 and caught fire,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore said in a news release on Tuesday.\nIt said the pilot suffered light injuries.\nThe Black Eagles demonstration team flies T-50B jets manufactured by Korea Aerospace Industries. The accident happened as the jet was taking off for a flight display at the airshow.\nChangi Airport said in a tweet that departing and arriving flights would be delayed during the next few hours.\nChangi, the world’s sixth-busiest airport for international traffic, has more than 100 airlines operating from it and handled a record 62.2 million passenger movements in 2017.\nThe T-50 was developed jointly with Lockheed Martin. The T-50A variant is participating in the U.S. Air Force’s multibillion-dollar T-X competition for the service’s next-generation training aircraft.\nReporting by Anshuman DagaEditnig by Gerry Doyle\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
