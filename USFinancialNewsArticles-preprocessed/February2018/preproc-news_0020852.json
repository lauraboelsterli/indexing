(NASDAQ:TTWO) today reported results for its fiscal third quarter 2018, ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company provided its initial financial outlook for its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2018, and updated its financial outlook for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.\nFiscal Third Quarter 2018 GAAP Financial Highlights\nNet revenue grew to $480.8 million, as compared to $476.5 million in last year’s fiscal third quarter. Recurrent consumer spending (virtual currency, add-on content and microtransactions) grew 64% year-over-year and accounted for 32% of total net revenue. The largest contributors to net revenue in fiscal third quarter 2018 were Grand Theft Auto® V and Grand Theft Auto Online, NBA® 2K18, WWE® 2K18 and WWE SuperCard, and L.A. Noire.\nDigitally-delivered net revenue grew 8% to $258.4 million, as compared to $240.2 million in last year’s fiscal third quarter, and accounted for 54% of total net revenue. The largest contributors to digitally-delivered net revenue in fiscal third quarter 2018 were Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K18, WWE 2K18 and WWE SuperCard, and Sid Meier’s Civilization VI.\nNet income increased to $25.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to net loss of $29.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the comparable period last year. Net income reflects $11.9 million of incremental income tax expense, or approximately $0.10 per diluted share, due to the application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017. This amount is a reasonable estimate provided in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidance. We will provide additional information about such estimate in our forthcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $203.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and short-term investments of $1.322 billion.\nThe following data, together with a management reporting tax rate of 22%, are used internally by the Company’s management and Board of Directors to adjust the Company’s GAAP financial results in order to facilitate comparison of its operating performance between periods and to better understand its core business and future outlook:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nFinancial Data\n$ in thousands Statement\nof\noperations\nChange in\ndeferred\nnet\nrevenue\nand related\ncost of\ngoods sold\nStock-based\ncompensation\nNon-cash\namounts\nrelated to\nconvertible\nnotes\nAmortization\n& impairment\nof acquired\nintangible\nassets\nBusiness\nreorganization\nNet revenue $ 480,840 173,099 Cost of goods sold 267,983 37,647 8,262 (4,912 ) Gross profit 212,857 135,452 (8,262 ) 4,912 Operating expenses 204,005 (21,288 ) (4,258 ) (700 ) Income from operations 8,852 135,452 13,026 9,170 700 Interest and other, net 3,374 795 Income before income taxes 12,226 135,452 13,026 795 9,170 700 In order to calculate net income per diluted share for management reporting purposes, the Company uses its fully diluted share count of 119.5 million and adds back to net income the interest expense, net of tax, on its convertible notes of $0.01 million.\nOperational Metric – Net Bookings\nDuring fiscal third quarter 2018, total Net Bookings were $653.9 million, as compared to $744.8 million during last year’s fiscal third quarter, which had benefitted from the launches of Mafia III and Sid Meier’s Civilization VI.

We took advantage of favorable market conditions to deploy $110 million of cash to repurchase more than 1 million shares of our stock. As a result of our outstanding third quarter performance and increased fourth quarter forecast, we are raising our fiscal 2018 outlook for Net Bookings.\n“In addition to achieving superb results, we announced the formation of Private Division, our new label that is dedicated to bringing titles from top independent developers to market. Private Division already has deals to publish several upcoming titles based on new IP from renowned talent, and represents an exciting new growth opportunity that complements Take-Two’s core business.\n“Rockstar Games has announced that Red Dead Redemption 2 will launch on October 26, 2018.

We have a robust development pipeline and are better positioned than ever for long-term growth and margin expansion.”\nBusiness and Product Highlights\nSince October 1, 2017:\nTake-Two announced the formation of Private Division, a new publishing label that focuses on bringing titles from top independent developers to market.

In addition, the Company is increasing its outlook for GAAP net revenue and GAAP net income.\nGAAP net revenue is expected to range from $1.80 to $1.85 billion GAAP net income is expected to range from $170 to $181 million GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to range from $1.50 to $1.60 Share count used to calculate GAAP diluted net income per share is expected to be 113.2 million (4) Net cash provided by operating activities is expected to be approximately $300 million Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million Net Bookings (operational metric) are expected to range from $1.99 to $2.04 billion\nThe Company is also providing selected data and its management reporting tax rate of 22% that are used internally by its management and Board of Directors to adjust the Company’s GAAP financial outlook in order to facilitate comparison of its operating performance between periods and to better understand its core business and future outlook:\nTwelve Months Ending March 31, 2018 Financial Data $ in millions GAAP outlook (2)\nChange in\ndeferred\nnet\nrevenue\nand related\ncost of\ngoods sold\nStock-based\ncompensation (3)\nNon-cash\namounts\nrelated to\nconvertible\nnotes\nAcquisition\nrelated\nexpenses\nAmortization &\nimpairment of\nacquired\nintangible\nassets\nBusiness\nreorganization\nexcluding\nstock-based\ncompensation\nNet revenue $1,803 to $1,853 $187 Cost of goods sold $905 to $934 $11 ($30) ($17) Operating Expenses $776 to $786 ($93) (5) $7 ($27) ($13) Interest and other, net $0 ($10) Income before income taxes $123 to $133 $176 $123 $10 ($7) $44 $13 1) For the fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company’s fully diluted share count used for both GAAP and management reporting purposes is expected to be 118.8 million, which includes 114.0 million basic shares, 4.1 million shares representing the potential dilution from unvested employee stock grants, and 0.7 million shares representing the potential dilution from convertible notes. For management reporting purposes, the interest expense, net of tax, on the convertible notes, which is added back to net income to calculate diluted net income per share is $0.03 million. 2) The individual components of the financial outlook may not foot to the totals as the Company does not expect actual results for every component to be at the low end or high end of the outlook range simultaneously. 3) The Company's stock-based compensation expense for the periods above includes the cost of approximately 0.6 million restricted stock units previously granted to ZelnickMedia that are subject to variable accounting. Actual expense to be recorded in connection with these shares is dependent upon several factors, including future changes in Take-Two's stock price. 4) For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, the Company’s fully diluted share count used for management reporting purposes is expected to be 118.0 million, which includes 110.1 million basic shares, 3.1 million shares representing the potential dilution from unvested employee stock grants, and 4.8 million shares representing the potential dilution from convertible notes. The interest expense, net of tax, on the convertible notes, which is added back to net income to calculate diluted net income per share for management reporting purposes is $0.83 million. Take-Two’s GAAP net income per diluted share outlook is calculated using a diluted share count of 113.2 million (basic shares plus unvested employee stock grants ), because using the “if-converted” method and the Company’s fully diluted share count of 118.0 million would have been anti-dilutive.\n5)\nIncludes $2.4 million of stock-based compensation related to business reorganization.\nKey assumptions and dependencies underlying the Company’s financial outlook include: the timely delivery of the titles included in this financial outlook; continued consumer acceptance of Xbox One and PlayStation 4; the ability to develop and publish products that capture market share for these new-generation systems while also leveraging opportunities on Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and mobile platforms; and stable foreign exchange rates.
