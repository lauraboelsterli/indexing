    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 3:36 PM / in 7 minutes Aecon's takeover by Chinese firm delayed as Canada extends review Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 12 (Reuters) - Construction company Aecon Group Inc said on Monday the completion date for its $1.5 billion sale to China’s CCCC International Holding Ltd (CCCI) has been pushed back, as Canada extended a national security review of the deal. \nThe proposed takeover, originally scheduled to close on Feb. 23, will now close on March 30, Aecon said. \nCCCI, the overseas investment and financing arm of engineering and construction company China Communications Construction Co Ltd , said in October it would buy Aecon for $1.5 billion. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau had said his government will closely monitor security issues when it decides whether to allow the deal, examining the implications for intellectual property protections. \nHowever, the Aecon-CCCI deal has passed most other hurdles, including a clearance from Canada’s competition regulator.
