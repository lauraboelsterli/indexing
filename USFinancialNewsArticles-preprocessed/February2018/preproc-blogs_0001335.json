Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday is expected to speak at a retreat for GOP lawmakers in West Virginia.\nHere are excerpts from the address, as prepared for delivery, which the White House released earlier Thursday:\nEvery day, we are removing government burdens, and empowering our citizens to follow their hearts and live out their dreams.\nThe priorities of Republicans in Congress are the priorities of the American People. We believe in strong families and strong borders. We believe in the rule of law, and we support the men and women of law enforcement. We believe every American has the right to grow up in a safe home, to attend a good school, and to have access to a great job. …\nHere in West Virginia, as a result of our tax cuts, the typical family of four will save roughly $2,000 dollars a year. …\nAnd we are reaching our hand across the aisle in pursuit of common ground and commonsense reforms for the good of ALL AMERICANS. …\nNearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on DACA, secures the border, ends chain migration, and cancels the visa lottery. These are the Four Pillars of the White House Framework – a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. …\nI know that the Senate is planning to bring an immigration bill to the floor in the coming weeks, and I am asking today that the framework we submitted be the bill that the Senate votes on. …\nBecause when Americans are united, nothing can stop us.",
