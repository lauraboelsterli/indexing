    "text": "BURLINGTON, MA, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Attunity Ltd. (NasdaqCM: ATTU), a leading provider of data integration and Big Data management software solutions, today reported its unaudited financial results for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We had a strong close to the year. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record total revenue, record license revenue, positive cash flow from operations and significantly enhanced our balance sheet through a successful public offering. We reported total quarterly revenue of $18.3 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and $62.1 million for the full year 2017, in line with our annual guidance. Revenue in the quarter was driven by a combination of an increase in new customer engagements as well as existing customers' expansion,\" stated Shimon Alon, Chairman and CEO of Attunity. \"Customers successfully using the Attunity platform are now looking to expand their current environments to accommodate additional data sources, driving return business. For example, during the fourth quarter, we closed two large expansion deals with existing customers, each for approximately $1.0 million.\"\n\"The strong momentum we experienced in the second half of 2017 is carrying into 2018. In 2017, we continued to close large customer engagements, partnered with key players in the IT industry, enhanced our technology platform, increased term-license bookings (which is growing in demand among customers) and expanded our senior management team with the new hire of a COO. With these achievements, we believe we are well positioned to accelerate our revenue growth, penetrate additional Fortune 1000 companies, and continue to replace traditional vendors. We plan to further expand and ramp up our sales and marketing investments and anticipate our pipeline will further grow in 2018 and for years to come,\" concluded Mr. Alon.\nRecent Operational Highlights\nRaised approximately $21.0 million in total net proceeds from public offering in December 2017.

Attunity's management believes the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release is useful to investors' understanding and assessment of Attunity's on-going core operations and prospects for the future. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP information in evaluating and operating its business internally and as such has determined that it is important to provide this information to investors. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. For further details, see the Reconciliation of Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information table later in this press release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other applicable securities laws. Statements preceded by, followed by, or that otherwise include the words \"believes\", \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as \"will\", \"should\", \"would\", \"may\" and \"could\" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts. For example, when we discuss the demand for our products, expectations regarding our pipeline and our outlook for 2018, we are using forward-looking statements. In addition, announced results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 are preliminary, unaudited and subject to year-end audit adjustment. Because such statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, could differ materially from Attunity's current expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to: our history of operating losses and ability to achieve or sustain profitability; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our business and operating results dependency on the successful and timely implementation of our third party partner solutions; the lengthy sales cycle of our products; competition; acquisitions, including costs and difficulties related to integration of acquired businesses and impairment charges; global economic conditions; the potential loss of one or more of our significant customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers; timely availability and customer acceptance of Attunity's new and existing products; international operations; our need and ability to raise capital; and other factors and risks on which Attunity may have little or no control. This list is intended to identify only certain of the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ. For a more detailed description of the risks and uncertainties affecting Attunity, reference is made to Attunity's latest Annual Report on Form 20-F (as amended) which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the other risk factors discussed from time to time by Attunity in reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
