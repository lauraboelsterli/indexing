Baird in Milwaukee.\nMSCI’s all-country world index of equity performance in 47 countries fell 1.07 percent while its gauge of emerging market stocks lost 1.54 percent.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 0.98 percent and the STOXX 600 index tumbled 1.07 percent.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 291.39 points, or 1.11 percent, to 25,895.32. The S&P 500 lost 27.83 points, or 0.99 percent, to 2,794.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 81.01 points, or 1.1 percent, to 7,304.85.\nThe dollar index, tracking the unit against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.72 percent, with the euro down 0.64 percent to $1.2428. The Japanese yen weakened 0.87 percent versus the greenback at 110.37 per dollar.\nThe U.S. bond market’s gauges of inflation expectations added to their earlier rise on Friday as domestic wages recorded their strongest annual increase in more than 8-1/2 years, suggesting inflation may be accelerating.\nThe gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and the 10-year Treasury notes reached its highest level since September 2014.\nU.S. crude fell $1.02 to $64.78 per barrel and Brent fell $1.34 to $68.31.\nSpot gold dropped 1.4 percent to $1,329.62 an ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Sinead Carew; Editing by Bernadette Baum\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
