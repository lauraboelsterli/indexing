    "text": "(Reuters) - Alphabet Incâ€™s Google is developing a subscription-based game streaming service that could work either on its Chromecast or a Google-made console, which is still being developed, the Information website reported on Wednesday.\nThe service, codenamed Yeti, would put Google at the forefront of a new part of the videogame business that lets people play games as they're being streamed, rather than using downloads or disks, the report said. ( bit.ly/2FUNLOu )\nThe plan that Google has been working on involves use of its cloud servers to broadcast the games to users over the internet, the Information report said, citing people with knowledge of the project.\nGoogle has discussed Yeti with game developers, but it is unclear whether any of them will develop a game specifically for Yeti or only make existing streamed games available, the Information reported.\nGoogle declined to comment.\nReporting by Muvija M in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
