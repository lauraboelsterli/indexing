PNB, India’s second-largest state-run lender with assets of $120 billion, said in a filing on Wednesday that it had detected fraudulent transactions worth $1.77 billion at a single Mumbai branch. Shares in PNB, which fell 10 percent on Wednesday, were down more than 5 percent in early trading on Thursday. Reporting by Swati Bhat Editing by Edwina Gibbs",
