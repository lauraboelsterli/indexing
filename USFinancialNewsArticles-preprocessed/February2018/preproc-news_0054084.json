    "text": "Appointment of Independent Director Advances Company Toward NASDAQ Uplisting Qualification\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FISION Corporation ( OTCQB: FSSN ), a leading provider of cloud-based digital asset management, sales enablement, and agile marketing technologies, has appointed John Bode, 43, as company director and chairman of its audit committee, effective March 1, 2018.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222005503/en/\nFISION Appoints Global CFO, John Bode, to Board of Directors (Photo: Business Wire)\nBode formerly served as chief financial officer of the Tribune Publishing Company (now tronc, Inc., NASDAQ: TRNC). He is currently the managing director of Aerie Investments, working on strategic initiatives with companies ranging from legacy media enterprises to digital start-ups. Recent engagements include serving on the board of directors and audit committee of a leading payments firm as it successfully completed a significant recapitalization.\nPrior to leading Tribune Publishing’s successful listing on the NYSE following its separation from Tribune Media, Bode served as the CFO of Source Interlink Companies, one of the largest enthusiast media companies in the U.S. and a leading distributor of periodicals. After graduating from the accounting program at Notre Dame, Bode began his auditing career as a CPA at BDO Seidman.\n“John brings to our board extensive entrepreneurial and senior management experience, particularly as a CFO of several global enterprises,” said FISION CEO, Mike Brown. “Given his success in guiding several large enterprise organizations, we expect John’s insights and guidance to play an important role as we continue to pursue large enterprise customers with our agile marketing solutions.”\n“John’s appointment as our first independent director also enhances our corporate governance as a public company and advances us toward meeting the qualification for listing on a major exchange, like the Nasdaq Stock Market,” added Brown.\nBode commented: “I’m excited to join the board and work alongside Mike and his talented team as they enable enterprises with a patented technology that solves major pain points in the creation and management of digital content.”\n“FISION has developed an extremely valuable suite of tools that are just now starting to be recognized in the market,” continued Bode. “However, their progress and success over the past year has been phenomenal, from winning major enterprise customers and rolling out global deployments, to completing a strategic acquisition, receiving its first U.S. patent, and becoming a public company. I feel fortunate to join the company at such a pivot time in its growth and development.”\nSeveral large enterprises across a range of industries have deployed FISION’s sales enablement solutions, including a national financial services company, a global provider of aerospace and building systems, a top provider of online higher education, an operator of the world’s largest business network, and a Super Bowl-winning National Football League team.\nAbout FISION Corporation\nFounded in 2011, Minneapolis-based FISION is the nation’s leading provider of agile marketing software that simplifies collaboration across global organizations, and more effectively manages brand and marketing content.
