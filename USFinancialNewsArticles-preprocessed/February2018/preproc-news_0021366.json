    "text": "Alphabet rolls its Nest smart-home unit back into Google Alphabet is rolling smart-home company Nest back into Google. Nest was regarded as one of Alphabet's model bets when the company blew up its corporate structure back in 2015 The company says that rolling Nest back into Google will help it \"supercharge\" its mission CNBC.com Pradeep Gaur | Mint | Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during Digital Unlocked Google event at Taj palace on January 4, 2017 in New Delhi, India. \nAlphabet is rolling its smart-home company, Nest, back into Google proper, the company announced in a pair of blog posts on Wednesday . \nWhen Alphabet blew up its corporate structure back 2015, Nest was regarded as one of the model \"Other Bets,\" but the unit subsequently experienced product struggles and the departure of its CEO. Meanwhile, Google increased its own focus on the home with its line of smart-speakers, which compete with Amazon's Echo products. \nThe company writes that by bringing Nest back into Google, it can \"supercharge Nest's mission.\" Nest's current CEO, Marwaz Fawan, will now report to Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh, and the merger will mean that Google's artificial intelligence, like its smart assistant, will be better baked into Nest products, CNET reports .",
