    "text": "OTTAWA, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avivagen Inc. (TSXV:VIV) (OTC Pink:CHEXF) (“ Avivagen ” or the “ Company ”), a life sciences innovation company with a series of patent protected products that support and optimize human and animal health, announces an update by the Chairman & Interim CEO and its financial results for the first quarter ending January 31, 2018.\nOver the past year, Avivagen has achieved a number of milestones which have both strengthened our company and enhanced our future prospects. These milestones include:\nUNAHCO Inc. more than doubling its OxC-beta commercial usage to 400kg/month, a rate which we believe should increase in coming months.\nLeveraging our experience with UNAHCO Inc. in other regions to establish new market approvals and distribution deals, significantly expanding our market potential. Discussions are underway with multiple parties in numerous new territories for Avivagen.\nSignificant positive results from swine and dairy cattle trials, demonstrating both the efficacy of our OxC-beta technology and its continued expansion into new and exciting markets.\nThe relaunch of our Vivamune Health Chews supplement, spearheaded by a marketing agreement with Cesar Millan, known worldwide as the “Dog Whisperer” and through his television series “Cesar Millan’s Dog Nation”.\nNew distribution deal in the US for our Vivamune Health Chews supplement, with additional deals expected internationally.\nThe addition of Mr. Aubrey Dan to the Board of Directors. Mr. Dan brings a wealth of experience within the healthcare sector, as well as a tremendous business acumen for marketing and strategy.\nThe completion of a CDN $4.1 million private placement, against the backdrop of an extremely volatile and challenging capital market.\nWhile I am pleased with what our company has achieved over the past several months, I also wish to let shareholders know that I have strongly conveyed to all Avivagen employees and the board that 2018 must be a year of execution and growth. Given all that has transpired this past year, combined with our prospects for the future, I am confident that we will achieve these objectives.\nSincerely,\nKym Anthony\nChairman & interim CEO\n2018 Q1 Results\nThe Company’s January 31, 2018 first quarter end financial statements and its management discussion and analysis have been filed on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval and are available via its website ( www.sedar.com ).\nThe Company reported (all in Canadian dollars) revenues of $143,201 and a comprehensive loss from continuing operations of $1,241,588 for the three-month period ended January 31, 2018.\nAs at January 31, 2018, the Company reported total current assets of $4,541,173, total liabilities of $1,871,229 and shareholders’ equity of $2,669,944.\nSignificant cash inflows in the three-month period ended January 31, 2018 consisted of a private placement for gross proceeds of $4,058,500, which was completed on November 30, 2017. Each of the 4,058,500 units issued consisted of one common share and one half common share purchase warrant for a unit price of $1.00 each. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire one common share of the Company at a purchase price of $1.20 for a period of three years commencing from November 30, 2017.\nAbout Avivagen\nAvivagen Inc. is a public company traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol VIV and is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, based in partnership facilities of the National Research Council of Canada and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.
