    "text": "RENO, Nev., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AMERCO (Nasdaq: UHAL), parent of U-Haul International, Inc., Oxford Life Insurance Company, Repwest Insurance Company and Amerco Real Estate Company, today reported net earnings available to shareholders for its third quarter ended December 31, 2017, of $528.9 million, or $27.00 per share, compared with net earnings of $65.2 million, or $3.33 per share, for the same period last year. Included in the results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was a $17.32 per share, or $339.2 million benefit resulting from the Tax Reform Act and an additional after-tax benefit of $7.34 per share or $143.8 million resulting from the sale of a portion of our Chelsea, NY property. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $2.34 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, net earnings available to shareholders were $779.7 million, or $39.81 per share, compared with net earnings of $388.9 million, or $19.85 per share, for the same period last year. Included in the results for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, was a $17.32 per share, or $339.2 million benefit resulting from the Tax Reform Act and an additional after-tax benefit of $7.34 per share or $143.8 million resulting from the sale of a portion of our Chelsea, NY property. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $15.15 per share for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017. Included in the results for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016, was an after tax benefit of $0.79 per share associated with our settlement of the PEI litigation that resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of $24.6 million. Excluding this after tax benefit, adjusted earnings were $19.06 per share for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2016.\n\"Tax reform is a real benefit. While accounting rules required us to recognize a large book gain in the quarter, significant cash flow benefits will accrue to us over time,\" stated Joe Shoen, chairman of AMERCO. \"We have already been investing savings from bonus tax depreciation back into increased rental equipment. The new depreciation rules will allow us to accelerate investments in the future. The tax rate changes allow U-Haul to invest still more in our people and in facility and equipment upgrades. I was pleased with the growth in both equipment and self-storage revenues. We are still challenged to better manage the sales of our pickups and cargo vans.\"\nHighlights of Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nThe recently enacted Tax Reform Act resulted in a net benefit to the Company of $339.2 million. This is a combination of a $349.2 million benefit resulting from the application of the new 21% federal income tax rate in our deferred tax liability calculation, partially off-set by a $10.0 million charge from the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings from our Canadian subsidiaries. Excluding the net benefits resulting from the initial application of the new laws we expect our blended GAAP effective tax rate for the twelve months of fiscal 2018 will be approximately 34.3% and 24.3% for fiscal 2019. Self-moving equipment rental revenues increased $33.3 million or 6.2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The revenue improvement was primarily transaction driven and came from our truck and trailer rental fleets. Transaction and revenue increases were recognized in both the one-way and in-town markets. We increased the number of trucks, trailers, towing devices, independent dealers and Company-owned locations compared with the same period last year. Self-storage revenues increased $9.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The average monthly amount of occupied square feet increased by 9.2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period last year. The growth in revenues and square feet rented comes from a combination of improved occupancy at existing locations as well as the addition of new facilities to the portfolio. Over the last twelve months, we have added approximately 3.5 million net rentable square feet or a 13.2% increase to our owned self-storage portfolio with approximately 0.7 million of that coming on during the third quarter. Depreciation, net of gains and losses on sales increased $18.5 million. Depreciation on the rental equipment fleet increased $17.9 million primarily due to a larger fleet. Gains on the sales of rental trucks increased $2.1 million due to higher unit sales partially offset by lower gains per unit. All other depreciation increased $2.7 million from the increase in new moving and storage locations. Net gains on the sale of real estate increased $190.0 million. The increase was caused by the sale of a portion of our Chelsea, NY property which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $190.7 million. Fleet maintenance and repair costs increased $32.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period last year. Higher repair and maintenance spending was primarily associated with the portion of the fleet nearing resale. Operating earnings at our Moving and Storage operating segment, excluding the gain on the Chelsea property, decreased $23.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the same period last year. Total revenues climbed $48.5 million and total costs and expenses excluding the gain on the Chelsea property increased $72.0 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017 gross truck and trailer capital expenditures were $788 million and $870 million, for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2017 proceeds from sales of rental equipment were $389 million compared with $403 million and spending on real estate related acquisitions and projects were $400 million compared with $378 million. Cash and credit availability at the Moving and Storage operating segment was $1,141.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared with $804.7 million at March 31, 2017. On December 6, 2017, the Board declared a cash dividend on our Common Stock of $0.50 per share to holders of record on December 21, 2017. The dividend was paid on January 5, 2018.\nAMERCO will hold its investor call for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on Thursday, February 8, 2018, at 8 a.m. Arizona Time (10 a.m. Eastern).
