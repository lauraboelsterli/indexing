    "text": "0 COMMENTS Japan’s Nikkei gains 2% European steelmakers climb Markets closed in U.S., China, Canada European stocks stalled in quiet trading Monday while Asian bourses continued to rebound after many indexes notched their best week in years.\nWorld stocks staged a broad-based rally last week as markets recovered from an early February rout, with the Stoxx Europe 600 posting its biggest weekly gain since December 2016, the S&P 500 its biggest since 2013 and the Nasdaq its biggest since 2011.\nTrading volumes were expected to be muted on Monday with U.S. equity markets closed for Presidents Day, Canadian markets shut for Family Day and China shut for the Lunar New Year holiday. \nThe Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.1% midday after initially opening higher, brushing off an upbeat lead from Japan.\nAmong decliners, shares of Reckitt Benckiser RBGLY -4.01% fell 5.5% after the consumer goods company announced fourth-quarter results, while Daimler shares fell 1.9% on reports that software in some vehicles may have helped it to pass U.S. emissions testing.\nShares of steel pipe manufacturer and supplier Tenaris TS 3.96% led gains, meanwhile, rising 3.7% after the Trump administration said it is considering sweeping new limits on imports of steel and aluminum . The company has a U.S. subsidiary and generates roughly 25% of its revenues in the U.S., according to FactSet.\nStainless steel producer Outokumpu rose 2.5% while ArcelorMittal rose 0.9%.\nShares of European financials were also boosted by a climb in government bond yields which tends to lift banks’ lending income. Yields on 10-year German government bonds rose to 0.730% Monday from 0.707% on Friday, signaling a decline in prices.\nRising bond yields, concerns about inflation and crowded bets against market volatility triggered a correction in many equity markets at the start of the month, but investors said they believed the economic and earnings backdrop justified a recovery.\n“I think this was a healthy correction that wiped out some very aggressive momentum trades that were in place,” said Paul Eitelman, multiasset investment strategist for North America at Russell Investments. “Investor sentiment has taken a step back from euphoria to something more sensible.”\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange in Mumbai, India. Many investors say they believed the economic and earnings backdrop justified a recovery. Photo: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg News Related \nWhat Wall Street Worries? Stocks Make a Comeback Analysis: Does Private Equity Really Beat the Stock Market? Reaction and Response From Dec. 31-Feb. 15, 127 S&P 500 companies issued positive earnings guidance for 2018, more than double the 10-year average of 49 for this same period, according to FactSet.\nEarlier, stocks mostly rose in Asia-Pacific trading, continuing to recover following a correction earlier this month. Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average closed up 2%.\n“It’s a kind of a relief rally,” said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities in Tokyo. Both retail and institutional investors in Japan were using the recent dip as a buying opportunity, Mr. Hiroki added, against a background of healthy economic growth. \nJapanese exports rose for a 14th straight month in January, led by continued demand from Asia for semiconductor equipment, Japan’s finance ministry said Monday.\nThe Nikkei got an extra lift as the yen shed some of its gains from last week. The dollar was last up 0.3% against the yen but still down 1.9% against the Japanese currency from a week ago. Last week was the dollar’s biggest fall against the yen since July 2016.\nSouth Korea’s Kospi was up 0.9% while Australia‘s S&P ASX 200 rose 0.6% following a recovery by most of the major banks and a strong corporate earnings season. Beach Energy , Brambles , NIB Holdings and Seek each gained at least 1% after releasing earnings results. \n“The underlying investment climate I don’t think has changed,” said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management. “The global economy is growing reasonably solidly and that growth is translating into corporate profits,” he said.\nIn commodities, Brent crude oil rose 0.6% to $65.23 a barrel, while gold edged down 0.4% to $1,350 a troy ounce after its biggest weekly gain since April 2016.\n—Robb M.
