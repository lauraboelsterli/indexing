A buyback would chime in with the expectations of investors, who are also anticipating news from the British bank of a three-year plan centred on digital investment and growing its insurance and wealth businesses. Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, reported its highest full-year profit since 2006 last year. Bailed out nine years ago in a 20 billion pound rescue during the financial crisis, it returned to full private ownership in May with the sale of the last of the government’s stake.
