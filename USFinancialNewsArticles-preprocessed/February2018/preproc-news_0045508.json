    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwest Biotherapeutics (OTCQB: NWBO) -- (\"NW Bio\"), a biotechnology company developing DCVax® personalized immune therapies for solid tumor cancers, congratulated Cognate BioServices, the contract manufacturer of NWBio's DCVax® products, on the Management Buyout of Cognate supported by global institutional investors, which Cognate announced today.\nFollowing this transaction, neither Linda Powers nor any Toucan Capital related entities have any ownership interest in Cognate or any role on Cognate's Board.\nMore information can be found in a Cognate press release at https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220006077/en .\nAbout Northwest Biotherapeutics\nNorthwest Biotherapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing personalized immunotherapy products designed to treat cancers more effectively than current treatments, without toxicities of the kind associated with chemotherapies, and on a cost-effective basis, in both the North America and Europe. The Company has a broad platform technology for DCVax® dendritic cell-based vaccines. The Company's lead program is a 331-patient Phase III trial in newly diagnosed Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer, and is an \"orphan disease.\" The Company is also pursuing a Phase I/II trial with DCVax-Direct for all types of inoperable solid tumor cancers. It has completed the 40-patient Phase I portion of the trial, and is preparing for the Phase II portion. The Company previously conducted a Phase I/II trial with DCVax-L for metastatic ovarian cancer together with the University of Pennsylvania.\nDisclaimer\nStatements made in this news release that are not historical facts, including statements concerning future treatment of patients using DCVax and future clinical trials, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"design,\" \"plan,\" \"continue,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"anticipate,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. We cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Specifically, there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, such as risks related to the Company's ability to enroll patients in its clinical trials and complete the trials on a timely basis, uncertainties about the clinical trials process, uncertainties about the timely performance of third parties, risks related to whether the Company's products will demonstrate safety and efficacy, risks related to the Company's ongoing ability to raise additional capital, and other risks included in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings. Additional information on the foregoing risk factors and other factors, including Risk Factors, which could affect the Company's results, is included in its SEC filings. Finally, there may be other factors not mentioned above or included in the Company's SEC filings that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.
