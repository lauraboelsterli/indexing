Boralex would like to point out that, by their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties such that its results or the measures it adopts could differ materially from those indicated by or underlying these statements, or could have an impact on the degree of realization of a particular projection. Boralex considers the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based to be reasonable at the time they were prepared, but cautions that these assumptions regarding future events, many of which are beyond the control of the Corporation, may ultimately prove to be incorrect.\nCertain forward-looking information such as expected EBITDA(A) and accretion to discretionary cash flows per share and forward-looking statements are subject to important assumptions, including: (i) assumptions as to the performance of the Corporation's projects based on management estimates and expectations with respect to wind and other factors, (ii) assumptions as to general industry and economic conditions and (iii) assumptions as to EBITDA(A) margins. While the Corporation considers these factors and assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available, they may prove to be incorrect.\nThe reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Unless required to do so under applicable securities legislation, Boralex management does not assume any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect new information, future events or other changes.\nSOURCE Boralex Inc.",
