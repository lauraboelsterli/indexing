We continue to make good progress on completing the integration of the MAA and Post Properties operating platforms and we're excited about the enhanced strength and capabilities of the company. The long-term outlook for apartment real estate remains very strong and we look forward to steadily compounding value moving forward.\"\nHighlights\nThe Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio generated a 1.8% increase in revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 supported by strong Average Physical Occupancy of 96.2% and effective rent growth of 1.7%. Combined Adjusted Same Store property operating expenses grew by 1.3% and Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI increased 2.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Resident turnover for the Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio remained low for the fourth quarter of 2017 at 50.1% on a rolling twelve month basis. During the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA acquired a newly built 320-unit apartment community in initial lease-up located in the highly desirable Downtown/West End submarket of Nashville, Tennessee. During the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA sold two properties located in the Atlanta, Georgia market. The sale of these two apartment communities with an average age of 19 years achieved an economic cap rate after capex of 5.9%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA completed development of expansion projects on two apartment communities located in Kansas City, Missouri and Austin, Texas. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA had three multifamily projects under development, which include 937 units, with a total projected cost of $214.0 million, with an estimated $46.3 million remaining to be funded as of December 31, 2017. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, five properties remained in lease-up, including the new apartment community acquired during the quarter and two development projects completed during the quarter, with average quarter-end physical occupancy of 62.5% for the group. During the year ended December 31, 2017, MAA completed renovation of 8,375 units under its redevelopment program, achieving average rental rate increases of 8.8% above non-renovated units.\nFourth Quarter Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio Operating Results\nTo ensure comparable reporting with prior periods, the same store portfolio, or MAA Same Store Portfolio, includes properties which were stabilized and which were owned by us at the beginning of the previous year. To provide relevant operating metrics for the fourth quarter and full year periods, stabilized communities acquired in the Post Properties Merger that would otherwise have met our requirements to be included in the MAA Same Store Portfolio, are presented on a combined adjusted basis, as if owned by MAA during the prior period. The Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio presentation below represents the MAA Same Store Portfolio and the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio considered as a single portfolio. See the \"Other Key Definitions\" section of this release for more details. Post Properties communities became eligible to enter the MAA Same Store Portfolio on January 1, 2018. Operating results for the Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio of 91,700 units in MAA's Large Market and Secondary Market segments of the portfolio are presented below:\nPercent Change From\nThree months ended\nThree months ended December 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2017\nAverage\nAverage\nEffective\nPhysical\nRevenue\nExpense\nNOI\nRent per Unit\nOccupancy\nLarge Market\n1.6\n%\n1.3\n%\n1.7\n%\n1.5\n%\n96.2\n%\nSecondary Market\n2.6\n%\n1.1\n%\n3.6\n%\n2.4\n%\n96.1\n%\nCombined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio\n1.8\n%\n1.3\n%\n2.2\n%\n1.7\n%\n96.2\n%\nCombined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio revenue growth of 1.8% during the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily a result of a 1.7% increase in Average Effective Rent per Unit, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Average Physical Occupancy for the Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio was strong at 96.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase from 96.0% in the same period of the prior year. Property operating expenses increased 1.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017, with the largest portion of the growth related to property taxes and utilities, partially offset by lower building repair and maintenance, office operations and insurance costs.\nA reconciliation of NOI, including Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI, to net income available for MAA common shareholders, and an expanded discussion of the components of NOI, can be found later in this release.\nAcquisition and Disposition Activity\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA acquired a newly developed apartment community, Acklen West End, a 320-unit property located in the highly desirable Downtown/West End submarket of Nashville, Tennessee, for a purchase price of $71.8 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA closed on the disposition of two wholly-owned apartment communities located in the Atlanta, Georgia market, Terraces at Fieldstone, a 316-unit community, and Terraces at Towne Lake, a 502-unit community, for combined proceeds of $97.4 million, resulting in total net gains recognized on the sale of real estate assets of approximately $68.3 million.\nDevelopment and Lease-up Activity\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA had three development communities under construction consisting of two new development communities and one expansion project. Total development costs for the three communities are projected to be $214.0 million, of which an estimated $46.3 million remained to be funded as of the end of the fourth quarter. The expected average stabilized NOI yield on these communities is 6.3%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA funded $27.6 million of construction costs on both current and completed development projects.\nMAA had five apartment communities, containing a total of 1,538 units, remaining in initial lease-up as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2017: Post Afton Oaks, located in Houston, Texas; The Denton II, located in Kansas City, Missouri; Post South Lamar II, located in Austin, Texas; Post Midtown, located in Atlanta, Georgia; and Acklen West End, located in Nashville, Tennessee. Physical occupancy for the five lease-up projects averaged 62.5% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRedevelopment Activity\nMAA continues its interior redevelopment program at select apartment communities throughout the portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA redeveloped a total of 1,832 units at an average cost of $6,503 per unit, bringing the total units renovated during the year ended December 31, 2017 to 8,375, at an average cost of $5,463, achieving average rental rate increases of 8.8% above non-renovated units.\nCapital Expenditures\nRecurring capital expenditures totaled $18.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, or approximately $0.16 per Share, as compared to $9.1 million, or $0.10 per Share, for the same period in 2016. These expenditures led to Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, of $1.34 per Share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.03 per Share for the same period in 2016.\nRedevelopment, revenue enhancing and other capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $29.0 million, as compared to $15.5 million for the same period in 2016. These expenditures led to Funds Available for Distribution, or FAD, of $129.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $79.6 million for the same period in 2016. Dividends and distributions paid on common shares and noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $102.5 million, as compared to $65.6 million for the same period in 2016.\nRecurring capital expenditures totaled $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or approximately $0.64 per Share, as compared to $51.7 million, or $0.62 per Share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. These expenditures led to AFFO of $5.30 per Share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.96 per Share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRedevelopment, revenue enhancing and other capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $98.5 million, as compared to $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These expenditures led to FAD of $525.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $338.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Dividends and distributions paid on common shares and noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $409.9 million, as compared to $261.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nA reconciliation of FFO, AFFO and FAD to net income available for MAA common shareholders and an expanded discussion of the components of FFO, AFFO and FAD can be found later in this release.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA paid $47.5 million relating to the remaining balances on two secured property mortgages and $80.0 million relating to the partial paydown of its secured credit facility with the Federal National Mortgage Association.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017:\nTotal debt to total assets (as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by MAA's primary operating partnership, Mid-America Apartments, L.P., or MAALP) was 33.2%, compared to 33.9% as of December 31, 2016; Total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion at an average effective interest rate of 3.6%; 83.0% of total debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates for an average of 4.7 years; Approximately $598.3 million combined cash and capacity under MAA's unsecured revolving credit facility was available; and Unencumbered NOI was 84.8% of total NOI, as compared to 78.4% as of December 31, 2016.\nMerger Related Activities\nIntegration efforts associated with the merger of MAA and Post Properties continue to progress well and in line with the company's expectations. Activities surrounding the full integration of the operating, financial reporting and technology platforms of the two companies are well underway with full consolidation expected to be completed later this year. In connection with the Post Properties Merger, MAA incurred a total of $5.5 million, or $0.05 per Share, of merger and integration costs during the fourth quarter of 2017 and a total of $20.0 million, or $0.17 per Share, of merger and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. Merger costs consisted primarily of severance, legal, professional and advisory costs, while integration costs were primarily related to temporary systems, staffing, facilities and consulting costs necessary for the integration of the companies' business platforms. MAA expects to incur additional integration costs as integration efforts are completed during 2018 and such costs are considered in the 2018 guidance outlined below.\nMAA continues to forecast expected synergies of approximately $20.0 million in gross overhead costs (combined general and administrative costs and property management expense savings) to be realized from the Post Properties Merger. MAA also anticipates additional opportunities and savings to be gained from enhanced efficiencies due to increased portfolio scale, from reconciling various operating practices between the two companies, from significant redevelopment opportunities at a number of properties in the legacy Post Properties portfolio, and from an improved cost of capital due to increased strength and liquidity of the combined balance sheet.\nAs part of the Post Properties Merger, MAA issued 867,846 shares of publicly traded preferred stock in exchange for 867,846 shares of publicly traded preferred stock previously issued by Post Properties. The MAA preferred shares have the same rights preferences, privileges and voting powers as those of the Post Properties preferred shares. The preferred shares have a $50 per share redemption price with an 8.5% cumulative coupon and are redeemable beginning in October 2026. At the time of the Post Properties Merger, the preferred shares had a market value in excess of the $50 redemption price, which created an implied embedded derivative. GAAP requires that the derivative be bifurcated from the preferred shares and recorded at fair market value each period. Due to the low volume of trading for the preferred shares and changes in market interest rates, the valuation outcome can be volatile. During the fourth quarter of 2017, MAA recorded $3.0 million of non-cash income related to the change in value of the embedded derivative, bringing the total non-cash income recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $8.8 million, resulting in a recorded derivative value of $21.2 million at December 31, 2017. MAA believes the quarterly revaluation of the embedded derivative has no significant economic impact on the company, and expects the valuation to remain volatile.\n96th Consecutive Quarterly Common Dividend Declared\nMAA declared its 96th consecutive quarterly common dividend at an annual rate of $3.69 per common share, which was paid on January 31, 2018 to holders of record on January 12, 2018.\n2018 Net Income per Diluted Common Share and FFO and AFFO per Share Guidance\nMAA is providing initial 2018 guidance for Net income per diluted common share, as well as FFO per Share and AFFO per Share, which are non-GAAP measures. Acquisition and disposition activity materially affects depreciation and capital gains or losses, which, combined, generally represent the majority of the difference between Net income available for common shareholders and FFO. As outlined in the definitions of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release, MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts', or NAREIT, definition. MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that FFO excludes depreciation expense of real estate assets and certain other non-routine items. MAA intends to update Net income per diluted common share, FFO per Share, and AFFO per Share guidance on a quarterly basis.\nNet income per diluted common share is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $2.08 per diluted common share for the full year of 2018. FFO per Share for the year is expected to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.15 per Share, or $6.00 per Share at the midpoint. This initial guidance is based on projections of revenue growth for the MAA Same Store Portfolio to be in the range of 1.75% to 2.25% for the full year based on continued steady occupancy, current market conditions and normal seasonal pricing trends, while expense growth is expected to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year. As a result, MAA expects NOI growth for the MAA Same Store Portfolio for the full year to be in the range of 2.0% to 2.5%. FFO guidance for 2018 includes an expected effective interest rate range of 3.8% to 4.0%. At the midpoint, this is an increase of about 50bps from MAA's effective interest rate in 2017. The increase is driven by the expectation of increasing interest rates on variable rate debt and the refinancing of maturing fixed rate debt, declining capitalized interest related to development, and a declining mark to market adjustment related to the Post Properties and Colonial Properties Mergers. MAA expects FFO for the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48 per Share, or $1.43 per Share at the midpoint. MAA does not forecast Net income per diluted share on a quarterly basis as it is not reasonable to accurately predict the timing of forecasted acquisition and disposition activity within a particular quarter (rather than during the course of the full year).\nGuidance for 2018 includes expected dilution of approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per Share due to integration expenses, which is projected to be $8.0 million to $10.0 million in total for the year.\nMAA expects total recurring capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $72.0 million, which would produce expected AFFO of $5.30 to $5.54 per Share.\nSupplemental Material and Conference Call\nSupplemental data to this release can be found under the \"Financial Results\" navigation tab on the \"For Investors\" page of our website at www.maac.com .

As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDA does not include various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance. MAA's computation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)\nAFFO is composed of FFO less recurring capital expenditures. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers AFFO to be an important measure of performance from operations because AFFO measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and recurring capital expenditures.\nCombined Adjusted Same Store NOI\nCombined Adjusted Same Store NOI represents total operating revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for all properties classified within the Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio during the period. Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. MAA believes Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance within MAA's markets because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance.\nEBITDA\nFor purposes of calculations in this release, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA, is composed of net income plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income taxes. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance.\nFunds Available for Distribution (FAD)\nFAD is composed of FFO less total capital expenditures, excluding development spending and property acquisitions. FAD should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers FAD to be an important measure of performance from core operations because FAD measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and total capital expenditures.\nFunds From Operations (FFO)\nFFO represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Because noncontrolling interest is added back, FFO, when used in this document, represents FFO attributable to the Company. While MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies.\nGross Assets\nGross Assets represents Total assets plus Accumulated depreciation, the accumulated depreciation for corporate properties, which is included in Corporate property, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accumulated depreciation for Assets held for sale, which is included in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes that Gross Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance sheet positions. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies.\nGross Real Estate Assets\nGross Real Estate Assets represents Real estate assets, net plus Accumulated depreciation, the accumulated depreciation for corporate properties, which is included in Corporate property, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accumulated depreciation for Assets held for sale, which is included in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets plus Cash and cash equivalents plus 1031(b) exchange proceeds included in Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes that Gross Real Estate Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance sheet positions. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies.\nNet Debt\nNet Debt represents Unsecured notes payable and Secured notes payable less Cash and cash equivalents and 1031(b) proceeds included in Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes Net Debt is a helpful tool in evaluating its debt position.\nNet Operating Income (NOI)\nNet operating income represents total operating revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for all properties held during the period, regardless of their status as held for sale. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. MAA believes NOI by market is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance within MAA's markets because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance.\nRecurring Adjusted EBITDA\nRecurring Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations such as acquisition and merger and integration expenses. MAA believes Recurring Adjusted EBITDA is an important performance measure as it adjusts for certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. Recurring Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA's computation of Recurring Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Recurring Adjusted EBITDA.\nOTHER KEY DEFINITIONS\nAverage Effective Rent per Unit\nAverage effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. MAA believes average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.\nAverage Physical Occupancy\nAverage physical occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the quarter.\nCombined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio\nCombined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio represents the MAA Same Store Portfolio and the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio considered as a single portfolio, as if the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio was owned by MAA during all periods presented. For comparability purposes, certain adjustments have been made to the prior year Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio. See the definition of the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio for more details.\nDevelopment Portfolio\nCommunities remain identified as development until certificates of occupancy are obtained for all units under development. Once all units are delivered and available for occupancy, the community moves into the Lease-up Portfolio.\nLease-up Portfolio\nNew acquisitions acquired during lease-up and newly developed communities remain in the Lease-up Portfolio until stabilized.\nNon-Same Store Portfolio\nNon-Same Store Portfolio includes recent acquisitions, communities that have been identified for disposition, and communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss.\nMAA Same Store Portfolio\nMAA reviews its Same Store Portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year, or as significant transactions warrant. Communities are generally added into the MAA Same Store Portfolio if they were owned and stabilized at the beginning of the previous year. Communities that have been approved by MAA's Board of Directors for disposition are excluded from the MAA Same Store Portfolio. Communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss are also excluded from the MAA Same Store Portfolio. Within the MAA Same Store Portfolio communities are designated as operating in Large or Secondary Markets:\nLarge Market Same Store communities are generally those communities in markets with a population of at least one million and at least 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units.\nSecondary Market Same Store communities are generally those communities in markets with either a population less than one million or less than 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units, or both.\nPost Adjusted Same Store Portfolio\nPost Adjusted Same Store Portfolio represents the Post Properties same store portfolio that would have been in effect had the properties been owned by MAA since January 1, 2016. Prior year results have been adjusted for consistency with MAA accounting policies and year over year comparisons. The primary adjustments include moving corporate property management expenses, exterior paint costs and IT operating systems costs out of property expenses. Because these properties have only been owned by MAA since December 1, 2016, they were not included in the MAA Same Store Portfolio for periods prior to January 2018. See MAA Same Store Portfolio for more information regarding inclusion. These properties have been identified in certain tables to provide Combined Adjusted Same Store results as if the properties had been owned by MAA in prior periods. These properties became eligible to join the MAA Same Store portfolio in January 2018.\nStabilized Communities\nCommunities are considered stabilized after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.\nTotal Market Capitalization\nTotal Market Capitalization equals the number of shares of common stock plus units not held by MAA at period end multiplied by the closing stock price at period end, plus total debt outstanding.\nUnencumbered NOI\nUnencumbered NOI represents NOI generated by our unencumbered assets (as defined in MAALP's bond covenants).\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maa-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-results-300591501.html\nSOURCE MAA",
