The Company's preliminary estimates relating to this accounting change are as follows: an unfavorable impact of approximately $15.0 million on total revenue for 2018, with approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million of that within the first quarter, and an unfavorable impact of approximately 1 percent to 2 percent on non-GAAP operating margin for 2018. These impacts are addressed in the guidance below.\nAs of February 8, 2018, Hortonworks is providing the following financial outlook for its first quarter and full year 2018:\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we expect:\nTotal revenue of $75.0 million.\nGAAP operating margin between negative 63 percent and negative 58 percent, which includes stock-based compensation and related expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $26.0 million.\nNon-GAAP operating margin between negative 29 percent and negative 24 percent, which excludes stock-based compensation and related expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $26.0 million.\nFor the full year 2018, we expect:\nTotal revenue between $322.0 million and $327.0 million.\nGAAP operating margin between negative 53 percent and negative 48 percent, which includes stock-based compensation and related expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $101.0 million.\nNon-GAAP operating margin between negative 23 percent and negative 17 percent, which excludes stock-based compensation and related expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately $101.0 million.\nGAAP operating margin outlook includes estimates of stock-based compensation and related expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles in future periods and assumes, among other things, the occurrence of no additional acquisitions, investments or restructuring and no further revisions to stock-based compensation and related expenses.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Details\nHortonworks will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss the Q4 and FY 2017 results, Q1 and FY 2018 outlook and related matters at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time) on Thursday, February 8, 2018. Interested parties may access the call by dialing (877) 930-7786 in the U.S. or (253) 336-7423 from international locations. In addition, a live audio webcast of the conference call will be available on the Hortonworks Investor Relations website at http://investors.hortonworks.com .\nShortly after the conclusion of the conference call, a replay of the audio webcast will be available on the Hortonworks Investor Relations website for approximately seven days.\nStatement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nHortonworks reports non-GAAP results for gross profit and margins, operating loss and margins, net loss, basic and diluted net loss per share and expenses in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nHortonworks' financial measures under GAAP include stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, advisory fees and other expense items that are nonrecurring. Management believes the presentation of operating results that exclude these items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company's core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing the Company's past and future operating performance.\nNon-GAAP cost of revenue is calculated as GAAP cost of revenue less stock-based compensation expense. Management believes non-GAAP cost of revenue offers investors useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business, and will help investors better understand our business.\nNon-GAAP gross profit is calculated as GAAP revenue less our non-GAAP cost of revenue. Management believes non-GAAP gross profit offers investors useful supplemental information to help compare our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods.\nNon-GAAP gross margin is calculated as non-GAAP gross profit divided by GAAP revenue. Management believes that non-GAAP gross margin offers investors useful supplemental information in evaluating our ongoing operational performance, and will help investors better understand our underlying business.\nNon-GAAP operating loss is calculated as GAAP operating loss plus non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expense adjustments. The Company believes that non-GAAP operating loss is a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, advisory fees and other expense items that are nonrecurring so that our management and investors have a greater visibility to the underlying performance of the business operations.\nNon-GAAP operating margin is calculated as non-GAAP operating loss divided by GAAP revenue. Management believes that non-GAAP operating margin offers investors useful supplemental information in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods.\nNon-GAAP net loss is calculated as GAAP net loss plus non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expense adjustments. Management believes non-GAAP net loss offers investors useful supplemental information to help identify trends in our underlying business and perform related trend analyses.\nNon-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net loss divided by the weighted-average shares outstanding for the period. Management believes non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share offers investors useful supplemental information, and will help investors better understand our performance and return to shareholders.\nUse of Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" regarding our performance within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
