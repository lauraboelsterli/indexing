    "text": "February 16, 2018 / 2:31 AM / Updated 36 minutes ago Alpine skiing - Swede Hansdotter wins gold, no medal for Shiffrin Simon Evans 3 Min Read PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Sweden’s Frida Hansdotter won gold in the women’s slalom as defending champion and clear favourite Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States failed to even reach the podium. Shiffrin has utterly dominated women’s slalom, winning four of the last five World Cup season titles and the last three World Championships, as well as the gold in Sochi four years ago. But her performance was well below her usual standards and she said she had been unwell prior to her first run. Hansdotter’s combined time from the two legs was one minute 38.63 leaving her just 0.05 seconds ahead of Switzerland’s Wendy Holdener, who had led after a brilliant first leg run. “I knew it would be tough, Mikaela has been so strong this season. I was maybe a little bit surprised. It’s nice for me to beat her for once because she has been beating me so many times,” said Hansdotter. “It’s completely magic. I’ve battled so hard for this medal. Winning Olympic gold is a dream”. Austria’s Katharina Gallhuber, who has never reached the podium in a World Cup race and is ranked 10th in slalom in the World Cup, was in the bronze medal position with Shiffrin fourth, 0.40 behind Hansdotter. Alpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Women’s Slalom – Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 16, 2018 - Frida Hansdotter of Sweden reacts. REUTERS/Jorge Silva Shiffrin had been aiming to become the first skier to defend an Olympic slalom title but she looked flat in her first leg and needing to make up time in her second run, she was actually slower. Hansdotter, a 32-year-old veteran of the World Cup circuit, will become the second Swedish woman to win Olympic slalom following Anja Paerson in Turin in 2006. She was the season World Cup winner in slalom in 2006 and had won slalom silver in the 2015 World Championships in Beaver Creek. Slideshow (6 Images) The 22-year-old Shiffrin had won the giant slalom on Thursday but after her first run said she had been feeling unwell, even vomiting before her start. “It almost felt like a virus kind of puking, less about nerves,” she said. Holdener wasn’t able to capitalise fully on beautiful first run of 48.89 seconds, as the first skier of the day, but she was delighted to have a silver medal. “My legs weren’t that fast on the second run, I felt the pressure so I fought to the end and I’m really happy to get the second place,” she said. The biggest upset was 20-year-old outsider Gallhuber finishing ahead of Shiffrin into bronze after a near perfect second run of 48.83 -- the fastest leg of the day. “After the first run I was a bit behind so I knew I needed a really good second run and I had to all in. Yeah, unbelievable that it happened. I am speechless and I can’t believe it,” she said.
