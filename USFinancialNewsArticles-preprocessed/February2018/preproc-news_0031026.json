    "text": "Joakim Ryan scored his first NHL goal to open the scoring and then netted the winner with 2:27 remaining on the clock as the San Jose Sharks rebounded from blowing a 3-0 lead to beat the Edmonton Oilers 6-4 Saturday night at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif.\nRyan, San Jose’s seventh-round draft pick in 2012, broke the goose egg in grand style in his 46th career game to the delight of the home crowd.\nAfter Ryan tallied with the game’s first shot -- the 10th time this season Oilers goaltenders have allowed a goal on the first puck they’ve faced -- Joe Pavelski doubled the lead on a lucky bounce when a clearing attempt went off an official’s skate and to him at the side of the net.\nBarclay Goodrow made it 3-0 early in the second period, and it appeared the Sharks could coast to the finish. Taking their foot off the gas almost proved costly.\nZack Kassian twice beat Sharks goalie Aaron Dell on a pair of breakaways and Leon Draisaitl added a goal within a 10-minute span to make it 3-3 before the second period was finished.\nThe craziness wasn’t over, either. Brandon Davidson put the Oilers ahead early in the third period, but San Jose’s Tomas Hertl drew the hosts even a couple of minutes later.\nThe Oilers even wasted a couple of power-play opportunities late in the third period before Ryan’s winner. Pavelski added an empty-netter in a four-point game. He’s collected four goals and six points in two games.\nDell stopped 27 shots for the Sharks, who snapped a two-game losing skid but have a new injury to deal with as Joel Ward missed the game due to a shoulder problem. In his place was Jannik Hansen, who’s suited up in only four of the last 20 games, and he responded with an assist.\nOn a night captain Connor McDavid was held without a point, Al Montoya made 24 saves for the Oilers, who are riding a three-game losing skid.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
