    "text": "Quarterly loss of $0.14 per share Quarterly GAAP combined ratio of 100.9 Return on equity of (1.2)% Book value per share of $20.76\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- State Auto Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:STFC) today reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $5.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, versus net income of $32.5 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss from operations 1 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2017 was $0.46 versus net income from operations 1 per diluted share of $0.46 for the same 2016 period.\nFor the year ended 2017, STFC had a net loss of $10.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to net income of $21.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the same 2016 period. Net loss from operations 1 per diluted share for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017 was $1.26 versus net loss from operations 1 per diluted share of $0.07 for the same 2016 period.\nThe fourth quarter and year ended 2017 net loss and net loss from operations included a charge of $36.4 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).\nGAAP Operating Results\nSTFC’s GAAP combined ratio for the fourth quarter 2017 was 100.9 compared to 101.3 for the same 2016 period. Catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter 2017 accounted for 2.6 points of the 62.9 total loss ratio points, or $8.3 million, versus 5.0 points of the total 68.6 loss ratio points, or $16.2 million, for the same period in 2016. Non-catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter 2017 included 3.7 points of favorable development relating to prior years, or $11.8 million, versus 1.9 points, or $6.3 million, for the same period in 2016.\nNet written premium for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 2.1% compared to the same period in 2016. By segment, net written premium for personal increased 19.1% and commercial and specialty decreased 1.4% and 51.0%, respectively. The personal segment increase was primarily due to rate actions taken to improve the profitability in personal auto and a higher level of new business policies for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The decrease in the commercial segment was primarily driven by actions taken to improve commercial auto profitability and a reduction in workers’ compensation due to the softening market conditions during the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The decline in the specialty segment was primarily due to our decision to exit specialty business.\nSTFC’s GAAP combined ratio for the year ended 2017 was 107.7 compared to 106.2 for the same 2016 period. Catastrophe losses increased the loss ratio for the year ended 2017 by 9.7 points, or $124.0 million, compared to 6.3 points, or $81.6 million for the year ended 2016. Non-catastrophe losses for the year ended 2017 included 3.5 points of favorable development relating to prior years, or $44.6 million, versus 2.2 points of adverse development, or $28.4 million, for the same period in 2016.\nNet written premium for the year ended 2017 decreased 1.9% compared to the same 2016 period. By segment, net written premium for personal increased 5.7% and commercial and specialty decreased 1.3% and 19.7%, respectively. The segment trends were due to the same factors discussed above.\nPersonal and Commercial Statutory Operating Results\nSTFC previously announced its decision to exit the specialty insurance segment and identified its continuing operations as the personal and commercial insurance segments. The statutory personal and commercial combined ratio 2 for the fourth quarter 2017 was 97.1 compared to 96.7 for the same 2016 period. Catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter 2017 accounted for 0.4 points of the 59.2 total loss ratio points, or $1.1 million, versus 3.6 points of the total 63.9 points or $9.3 million for the same period in 2016. Non-catastrophe losses during the fourth quarter 2017 included 5.2 points of favorable development relating to prior years, or $13.7 million, versus 3.0 points or $7.8 million, for the same period in 2016.\nThe statutory personal and commercial combined ratio 2 for the year ended 2017 was 102.3 compared to 104.5 for the same 2016 period. Catastrophe losses increased the loss ratio for the year ended 2017 by 6.8 points, or $70.1 million, compared to 7.0 points, or $74.1 million for the year ended 2016. Non-catastrophe losses for the year ended 2017 included 4.7 points of favorable development relating to prior years, or $48.8 million, versus adverse development of 0.6 points or $6.8 million, for the same period in 2016.\nBook Value and Return on Equity\nSTFC’s book value was $20.76 per share as of Dec. 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.52 per share from STFC’s book value on Sept. 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset due to the enactment of the TCJA. Return on stockholders’ equity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was (1.2)% compared to 2.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nSTFC’s Chairman, President and CEO Mike LaRocco commented on the quarter and year as follows:\n“2017 was the year in which State Auto’s turnaround began to take hold. We delivered profitable fourth quarter results in our personal and commercial lines of business, with a statutory combined ratio of 97.1. Loss ratios in personal and commercial auto continued to improve as a result of actions we’ve taken around rates, underwriting and claims handling practices. These efforts take time to earn out in the numbers, but we have the processes and people in place to maintain our focus on improving profitability.\n“Retention in our personal auto and homeowners lines declined as a result of the rate actions, but we know we can’t afford to knowingly write risks at an unprofitable rate. And while our loss ratio improved in our largest line, personal auto, our expense ratio was elevated in the fourth quarter due to continued investment in our digital technology platform and foundation and timing and changes in our agent bonus compensation plan.\n“Our technology investment is critical if we’re to become more efficient as we grow profitably. In the fourth quarter, we continued the rollout of State Auto Connect for personal lines and successfully rolled out State Auto Connect for our business owners policy (BOP) and commercial auto in four states. Our decision to go completely digital is paying off, with approximately a 37% increase in new business and record Quote: volumes for the year in our personal lines. For the first time in eight years, we grew the number of homeowners policies written, and we ended 2017 with four straight months of auto policy count growth.\n“In our continuing businesses the full year statutory combined ratio was 102.3. In late 2017, we made the tough call to exit the specialty segment. I’m pleased to say we’ve made progress toward completing agreements to exit all our lines except E&S property, which we placed in run-off in November.\n“We accomplished a great deal in 2017, and I’m very proud of our team’s efforts that moved us even closer to delivering profitable growth for our policyholders and shareholders.”\nAbout State Auto Financial Corporation\nState Auto Financial Corporation, headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, is a super regional property and casualty insurance holding company and is proud to be a Trusted Choice® company partner.
