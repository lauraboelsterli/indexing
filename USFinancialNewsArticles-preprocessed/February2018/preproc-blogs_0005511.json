    "text": "For the average American, the nearly 8-year-old recovery in the job market continues to make it easier to find steady work with a solid paycheck.\nBut the averages mask big disparities in the way the benefits of that recovery are being felt across racial and ethnic lines.\nPresident Donald Trump during his State of the Union address Tuesday took credit for the ongoing strength in hiring, singling out the drop in unemployment among black workers.\n\"Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low,\" Trump told Congress. \"It's something I'm very proud of. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded.\"\nNot anymore. Last month, the jobless rate among blacks jumped nearly a full point to 7.7 percent , according to the latest monthly data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nEven at its low point, the jobless rate for black Americans has been roughly twice the rate for whites since the job market recovery began in March 2010.\nThose higher jobless rates for blacks may understate the overall level of unemployment for that group, which has a lower labor force participation rate than other groups tracked by the BLS. (The labor force participation rate measures the share of the overall population that is actively in the workforce and excludes, among others, those who have given up looking for a job.)",
