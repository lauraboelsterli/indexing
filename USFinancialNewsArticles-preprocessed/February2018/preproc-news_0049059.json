    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (\"FHLBank Indianapolis\" or \"Bank\") declared its fourth quarter 2017 dividends on Class B-1 and Class B-2 capital stock at annualized rates of 4.25% and 3.40%, respectively. In addition, the Board declared supplemental dividends for the year on Class B-1 and Class B-2 capital stock at annualized rates of 2.50% and 2.00%, respectively. The dividends will be paid in cash on February 21, 2018.\n\"FHLBank Indianapolis is pleased to provide this supplemental dividend to its members,\" President and CEO Cindy Konich said. \"It reflects particularly strong performance throughout 2017.\"\nEarnings Highlights 1\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $46 million, an increase of $6 million compared to the same quarter in the prior year, primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on derivatives and hedging activities. Net interest income after provision for credit losses was $70 million, an increase of $16 million compared to the same quarter in the prior year as a result of asset growth and higher spreads.\nNet income for the year 2017 was $156 million, an increase of $43 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by net losses on derivatives and hedging activities. Net interest income after provision for credit losses was $262 million, an increase of $64 million compared to the prior year as a result of asset growth and higher spreads.\nAffordable Housing Program Allocation 2\nAs a direct result of our earnings for the year, FHLBank Indianapolis allocated $18 million to its Affordable Housing Program (\"AHP\"), which provides grant funding to support housing for low- and moderate-income families in Michigan and Indiana. This AHP allocation will be available to the Bank's members in 2018 to help address their communities' affordable housing needs, including construction, rehabilitation, accessibility improvements and homebuyer down-payment assistance.\n1 FHLBank Indianapolis earns interest income on advances to and mortgage loans purchased from its Michigan and Indiana member financial institutions, as well as on long- and short-term investments. Net interest income is primarily determined by the spread between the interest earned on those assets and the interest cost of funding with consolidated obligations.\n2 Each year FHLBanks allocate to the AHP 10% of earnings, which is defined as income before assessments, plus interest expense on Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $62.3 billion, an increase of $8.4 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2016, primarily driven by an increase in advances outstanding.\nAdvances 3\nAdvances outstanding at December 31, 2017 totaled $34.1 billion, a net increase of $6.0 billion, or 21%, from December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in demand by our members for short-term advances; however, longer-term advances also grew during the year.\nAdvances to depository members - comprising commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions - increased by 42%. Advances to insurance company members (excluding captive insurance companies) increased by 8%. The significant increase in advances to depository members resulted in a change in the mix of advances during the year. Advances to depository institutions, as a percent of total advances outstanding, increased from 47% at December 31, 2016 to 55% at December 31, 2017, while advances to insurance companies decreased from 53% to 45% at those dates.\nMortgage Loans Held for Portfolio 4\nMortgage loan purchases from members for the year 2017 totaled $2.2 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio at December 31, 2017 totaled $10.4 billion, a net increase of $855 million, or 9%, from December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated Obligations 5\nFHLBank Indianapolis' consolidated obligations outstanding at December 31, 2017 totaled $58.3 billion, a net increase of $8.0 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2016. The increase in consolidated obligations supported the Bank's growth in assets.\nCapital\nTotal capital at December 31, 2017 was $2.9 billion, a net increase of $510 million, or 21%, from December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of additional capital stock issued to members in connection with the increase in advances. 6 The growth of retained earnings also contributed to the increase.\nThe Bank's regulatory capital 7 -to-assets ratio at December 31, 2017 was 4.8%, which exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements.\n3 Advances are secured loans that FHLBank Indianapolis provides to its member institutions.\n4 FHLBank Indianapolis purchases mortgage loans from its members to support its housing mission, provide an additional source of liquidity to its members, and diversify its investments.\n5 The primary source of funds for FHLBank Indianapolis, and for the other Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBanks\"), is the sale of FHLBanks' consolidated obligations in the capital markets. FHLBank Indianapolis is the primary obligor for the payment of the principal and interest on these consolidated obligations; additionally, it is jointly and severally liable with each of the other FHLBanks for all of the FHLBanks' consolidated obligations outstanding.\n6 FHLBank Indianapolis is a cooperative whose member financial institutions and former members own all of its capital stock as a condition of membership and to support outstanding advances.\n7 Total regulatory capital consists of capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock and retained earnings.\nAll amounts referenced above and in the following table are unaudited. More detailed information about FHLBank Indianapolis' financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 will be included in the Bank's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we intend to file by mid-March.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis Financial Highlights (unaudited) ($ amounts in millions, as rounded)\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Condensed Statements of Income 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net interest income after provision for credit losses $ 70 $ 54 $ 262 $ 198 Other income (loss) 4 13 (6 ) 6 Other expenses 23 22 82 78 Assessments 5 5 18 13 Net income $ 46 $ 40 $ 156 $ 113\nCondensed Statements of Condition December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Advances $ 34,055 $ 28,096 Mortgage loans held for portfolio, net 10,356 9,501 Cash and short-term investments 4,601 4,128 Other assets (1) 13,337 12,182 Total assets $ 62,349 $ 53,907 Consolidated obligations $ 58,254 $ 50,269 Mandatorily redeemable capital stock 164 170 Other liabilities 985 1,032 Total liabilities 59,403 51,471 Capital stock (2) 1,858 1,493 Retained earnings (3) 976 887 Accumulated other comprehensive income 112 56 Total capital 2,946 2,436 Total liabilities and capital $ 62,349 $ 53,907 Total regulatory capital (4) $ 2,998 $ 2,550 Regulatory capital-to-assets ratio 4.81 % 4.73 % (1) Includes held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities.\n(2) Putable by members at par value.\n(3) Includes restricted retained earnings at December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $183 million and $152 million, respectively.\n(4) Consists of total capital less accumulated other comprehensive income plus mandatorily redeemable capital stock.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis document may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance.
