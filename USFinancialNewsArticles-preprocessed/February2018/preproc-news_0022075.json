(\"IIJ\")(NASDAQ:IIJI) (TSE:3774) today announced its nine months consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 (“3Q17” from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017). 1\nHighlights of Financial Results for 3Q17 Revenues JPY127.6 billion (up 12.3% YoY) Operating Income JPY3.8 billion (up 19.7% YoY) Income before Income Tax Expense JPY4.3 billion (up 26.1% YoY) Net Income attributable to IIJ JPY2.7 billion (up 40.7% YoY) Financial Targets for FY2017 Revenues JPY176.0 billion (up 11.5% YoY) Operating Income JPY6.5 billion (up 26.6% YoY) Income before Income Tax Expense JPY6.5 billion (up 19.8% YoY) Net Income attributable to IIJ JPY4.0 billion (up 26.3% YoY) Overview of 3Q17 Financial Results and Business Outlook\n“To launch cryptocurrency exchange and settlement business, we established an equity method investee by partnering with prominent Japanese companies from various industries: Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Daiwa Securities Group, Nomura Holdings, Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Nippon Life Insurance Company, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company, Sompo Holdings, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Company, East Japan Railway Company, ITOCHU Corporation, ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation, K-Opticom Corporation, QTnet, Bic Camera, DENTSU, Mitsui Fudosan, and Yamato Holdings. DeCurret, IIJ’s 35% equity method investee with capital of JPY5.23 billion, 2 will offer BtoC cryptocurrency exchange services from the latter half of FY2018 and BtoBtoC and BtoC cryptocurrency settlement services from FY2019. Based on our existing ASP FX trading system, which has been used by thirteen major Japanese financial institutions, DeCurret should be able to develop highly reliable and scalable cryptocurrency exchange system and services, incorporating Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) and other necessary and critical security requirements. 3 We see a great growth opportunity in settlement business as conventional financial infrastructure needs to be changed dramatically, especially in Japan where cash is a predominantly major payment method. 4 We’re very excited about working together with so many outstanding Japanese companies to create a new standard for cryptocurrency settlements which is thought to be a new social infrastructure,” said Koichi Suzuki, Founder, CEO and Chairman of IIJ.\n“As for the three months financial results, revenue and operating income increased year over year by 13.0% and 20.9% respectively. Network services, especially security-related services, which was supported by the strong demands, and mobile services, led the revenue growth. Accordingly with our mobile business growth strategy, our enterprise mobile revenue strongly grew by 45.2% year over year as MVNE and IoT/M2M transactions continued to expand. SI revenue increased by 8.6% YoY as we continued to accumulate projects. Operating income grew as gross margin of both network services and SI expanded by 13.6% and 13.0% year over year,” said Eijiro Katsu, COO and President of IIJ.\n“We decided to build our own data center and we’ve acquired the land of approximately 40 thousand m 2 . 5 The main purpose is to integrate our racks that are currently spread out in the metropolitan area’s data centers for more effective operation. The new data center, which ultimately can accommodate up to 6,000 racks, allows gradual expansion of capacity as we’ll place system module-based data centers developed from our container-based data center technology accumulated from our Matsue Data Center Park since 2011. We estimate the future data center facility cost should be approximately 20% lower by having our own data center than continuously expanding leasing space. We’ll also ensure business expansion scalability for the future by having this new data center,” concluded Katsu.\n“We continuously enhance our existing business such as cloud, mobile, security and SI, and we’re also making further business developments like FinTech project this time. Our invisible yet very essential business assets such as Internet technology, network and system infrastructure, SI expertise, brand of reliability, and long-term relationship with prominent Japanese blue-chips let us develop and expand our business foundation. We shall continue to pursue these strategies going forward,” concluded Katsu.\n1 Unless otherwise stated, all financial figures discussed in this announcement are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, unaudited and consolidated.\n2 The capital is JPY5.23 billion as of the mid-February when all the capital partners make payments.\n3 The service, IIJ Raptor Service, was launched in 2010 and its customers include Nomura Scurities and Sony Bank.\n4 According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry who published a report in May 2017, as for 2015, 19% of settlement was through non-cash in Japan compared to 41% in the U.S.A. and 55% in China.\n5 The new data center will be located in Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo. As of December 2017, there are 21 data centers operated by IIJ in Japan. 20 of them are leased by data center owners and 1 data center owned by IIJ in Shimane prefecture.\n3Q17 Financial Results Summary\nOperating Results Summary\n3Q16 3Q17 YoY Change JPY millions JPY millions % Total revenues 113,602 127,612 12.3 Network services 68,481 80,000 16.8 Systems integration (SI) 39,858 42,301 6.1 Equipment sales 2,207 2,275 3.1 ATM operation business 3,056 3,036 (0.6 ) Total costs 95,772 107,856 12.6 Network services 56,274 66,109 17.5 Systems integration (SI) 35,644 37,898 6.3 Equipment sales 2,024 2,053 1.4 ATM operation business 1,830 1,796 (1.9 ) Total gross margin 17,830 19,756 10.8 Network services 12,207 13,891 13.8 Systems integration (SI) 4,214 4,403 4.5 Equipment sales 183 222 21.0 ATM operation business 1,226 1,240 1.2 SG&A expenses and R&D 14,675 15,980 8.9 Operating income 3,155 3,776 19.7 Income before income tax expense 3,433 4,329 26.1 Net income attributable to IIJ 1,910 2,688 40.7\nSegment Results Summary 3Q16 3Q17 JPY millions JPY millions Total revenues 113,602 127,612 Network services and SI business 110,831 124,835 ATM operation business 3,056 3,036 Elimination (285 ) (259 ) Operating income 3,155 3,776 Network service and SI business 2,178 2,782 ATM operation business 1,088 1,123 Elimination (111 ) (129 ) We have omitted segment analysis because most of our revenues are dominated by network services and systems integration (SI) business.\n3Q17 Revenues and Income\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were JPY127,612 million, up 12.3% YoY (JPY113,602 million for 3Q16).\nNetwork services revenue was JPY80,000 million, up 16.8% YoY (JPY68,481 million for 3Q16).\nRevenues for Internet connectivity services for enterprise were JPY20,418 million, up 24.0% YoY from JPY16,461 million for 3Q16, mainly due to an increase in mobile-related services revenues along with an expansion of MVNE business clients’ transactions.\nRevenues for Internet connectivity services for consumers were JPY18,707 million, up 17.6% YoY from JPY15,903 million for 3Q16, mainly due to the revenue growth of “IIJmio Mobile Service,” consumer mobile services which offer inexpensive data communication and voice services with SIM cards.\nRevenues for WAN services were JPY21,676 million, up 9.2% YoY compared to JPY19,848 million for 3Q16.\nRevenues for Outsourcing services were JPY19,199 million, up 18.0% YoY from JPY16,269 million for 3Q16, mainly due to an increase in security-related services revenues.\nNetwork Services Revenues Breakdown 3Q16 3Q17 YoY\nChange JPY millions JPY millions % Internet connectivity services (Enterprise) 16,461 20,418 24.0 IP service * 7,331 7,553 3.0 IIJ FiberAccess/F and IIJ DSL/F 2,279 2,262 (0.8 ) IIJ Mobile service (Enterprise) 6,680 10,436 56.2 IIJ Mobile MVNO Platform Service 4,358 7,742 77.7 Others 171 167 (2.7 ) Internet connectivity services (Consumer) 15,903 18,707 17.6 IIJ 14,290 17,394 21.7 IIJmio Mobile Service 12,437 15,342 23.4 hi-ho 1,613 1,313 (18.6 ) WAN services 19,848 21,676 9.2 Outsourcing services 16,269 19,199 18.0 Total network services 68,481 80,000 16.8 * IP service revenues include revenues from the data center connectivity service.\nNumber of Contracts and Subscription for Connectivity Services *1\nas of\nDecember 31, 2016 as of\nDecember 31, 2017 YoY\nChange Internet connectivity services (Enterprise) 824,546 1,246,898 422,352 IP service (1Gbps-) 413 461 48 IP service (100Mbps-999Mbps) 577 643 66 IP service (-99Mbps) 622 627 5 IIJ Data center connectivity service 258 243 (15 ) IIJ FiberAccess/F and IIJ DSL/F 72,132 70,778 (1,354 ) IIJ Mobile service (Enterprise) 749,484 1,173,563 424,079 IIJ Mobile MVNO Platform Service *2 501,374 744,332 242,958 Others 1,060 583 (477 ) Internet connectivity services (Consumer) 1,377,529 1,349,664 (27,865 ) IIJ *2 1,241,399 1,349,664 108,265 IIJmio Mobile Service 912,394 986,767 74,373 hi-ho *2 136,130 - (136,130 ) Total contracted bandwidth *3 2,636.7Gbps 3,085.3Gbps 448.6Gbps *1.
