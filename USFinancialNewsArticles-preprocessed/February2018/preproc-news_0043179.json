    "text": "ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diana Containerships Inc. (NASDAQ:DCIX), (the “Company”), a global shipping company specializing in the ownership of containerships, today reported a net loss of $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $8.5 million for the same period of 2016. The loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes impairment losses of $8.4 million for two vessels, without which the result for the quarter would have been a net loss of $8.2 million. The loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 includes a loss of $2.4 million on sale of one vessel, without which the result for the quarter would have been a net loss of $6.1 million.\nTime charter revenues, net of prepaid charter revenue amortization, were $7.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.4 million for the same period of 2016. This increase was mainly the result of increased revenues generated by the improvement of the Company’s fleet utilization and increased realized time charter rates.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total debt outstanding, including the entire discount premiums under the two existing loan agreements, amounted to $106.1 million, while as of December 31, 2016, the Company’s total debt outstanding amounted to $174.7 million.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $3.8 million, compared to a net loss of $149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net income for 2017 reflected a gain from a debt write-off, arising from the refinancing of the secured loan facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc (“RBS”), which was agreed to on June 30, 2017. The specific gain, net of related expenses, amounted to $42.2 million. The loss for 2016 includes $118.9 million of impairment charges for seven of the Company’s vessels and $2.9 million of loss on sale of two vessels. Time charter revenues, net of prepaid charter revenue amortization, for the year ended December 31, 2017, amounted to $23.8 million, compared to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFleet Employment Profile (As of February 16, 2018) Diana Containerships Inc.’s fleet is employed as follows: Vessel Sister\nShips* Gross Rate (USD\nPer Day) Com** Charterers Delivery Date\nto\nCharterers*** Redelivery Date to\nOwners**** Notes BUILT TEU 5 Panamax Container Vessels SAGITTA A $8,400 1.25% Hapag-Lloyd AG 15-Aug-17 15-Feb-18 $8,400 1.25% 15-Feb-18 15-May-18 - 15-Jul-18 2010 3,426 CENTAURUS A $7,950 3.50% CMA CGM 23-Aug-17 23-Apr-18 - 23-Aug-18 2010 3,426 NEW JERSEY - - - - - - - 1,2 (ex YM New Jersey) 2006 4,923 PAMINA $9,500 3.75% Orient Overseas\nContainer Line Ltd. 12-Sep-17 12-Apr-18 - 12-Sep-18 (ex Santa Pamina) 2005 5,042 DOMINGO $8,500 3.50% CMA CGM 14-Sep-17 14-May-18 - 14-Aug-18 (ex Cap Domingo) 2001 3,739 6 Post - Panamax Container Vessels PUELO B $10,600/$12,000 5.00% Maersk Lines A/S 1-Aug-17 1-Apr-18 - 1-Feb-19 3 2006 6,541 PUCON B $10,750 3.75% Orient Overseas\nContainer Line Ltd. 27-Apr-17 27-Apr-18 - 26-Jun-18 2006 6,541 MARCH C $6,850 1.25% Hapag-Lloyd AG 15-Feb-17 22-Feb-18 - 30-Mar-18 4,5,6 (ex YM March) 2004 5,576 GREAT C $7,300 3.75% Orient Overseas\nContainer Line Ltd. 8-Apr-17 23-Feb-18 - 30-Mar-18 4,6 (ex YM Great) 2004 5,576 HAMBURG D $6,700 3.50% CMA CGM 9-Jan-17 19-Nov-17 $11,000 3.75% Wan Hai Lines\n(Singapore) Pte\nLtd. 1-Dec-17 31-Mar-18 - 9-Jul-18 2009 6,494 ROTTERDAM D $6,890 3.50% CMA CGM 7-Mar-17 7-Jan-18 $13,150 3.75% Wan Hai Lines\n(Singapore) Pte\nLtd. 25-Jan-18 25-May-18 - 14-Jul-18 2008 6,494 * Each container vessel is a \"sister ship\", or closely similar, to other container vessels that have the same letter. ** Total commission paid to third parties. *** In case of newly acquired vessel with time charter attached, this date refers to the expected/actual date of delivery of the vessel to the Company. **** Range of redelivery dates, with the actual date of redelivery being at the Charterers’ option, but subject to the terms, conditions, and exceptions of the particular charterparty. 1 As of October 11, 2016, vessel has been placed into lay-up, in Malaysia. 2 Vessel sold and expected to be delivered to her new owners by mid-March 2018. 3 The gross charter rate is US$10,600 per day for the first eight (8) months of the charter period and US$12,000 per day for the balance period of the time charter.

Voyage expenses include port charges, bunker (fuel) expenses, canal charges and commissions. TCE is a non-GAAP measure. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters are generally expressed in such amounts.\n(2) Daily vessel operating expenses, which include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance and vessel registry, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the costs of spares and consumable stores, lubricant costs, tonnage taxes, regulatory fees, environmental costs, lay-up expenses and other miscellaneous expenses, are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period.\nAbout the Company\nDiana Containerships Inc. is a global provider of shipping transportation services through its ownership of containerships. The Company’s vessels are employed primarily on time charters with leading liner companies carrying containerized cargo along worldwide shipping routes.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nMatters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.\nThe Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intends,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"pending\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, our management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.\nIn addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values, changes in demand for containership capacity, changes in our operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for our vessels, availability of financing and refinancing, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, vessel breakdowns and instances of off-hires and other factors. Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties.\nDIANA CONTAINERSHIPS INC.
