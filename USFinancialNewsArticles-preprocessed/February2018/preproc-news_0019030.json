    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Embraer SA, Brazilian government authorities and Boeing Co. are still in talks for a potential combination of the Brazilian planemaker and Boeing, a senior official from Embraer said on Wednesday.\nSpeaking at the Singapore Airshow, John Slattery, the CEO of Embraer’s commercial aviation business, told a news conference that Embraer had not yet received a proposal from Boeing. “The only reason for that is the parties continue to work on identifying structures that might work,” he said.\nA Brazilian newspaper reported on Tuesday that Boeing had presented a plan to Brazil’s government that would give it a stake of up to 90 percent in a new venture encompassing Embraer’s commercial jet business.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga and Jamie FreedEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ",
