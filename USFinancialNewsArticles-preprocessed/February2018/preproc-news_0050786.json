    "text": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - South African clothes retailer Truworths on Thursday reported flat retail sales growth in the first-half, which it blamed on a challenging trading period marred by political uncertainty in its home market.\nThe company, which also runs the British footwear chain Office, said retail sales for the 26-week period ended Dec. 31 rose to 10.3 billion rand ($884.69 million), from 10.2 billion rand a year ago.\nRetailers in South Africa are facing tough trading conditions as consumer sentiment hits multi-year lows and high unemployment and inflation erode disposable incomes in the countryâ€™s first recession in eight years.\nDiluted headline earnings per share, a widely watched profit measure in South Africa, strips out certain one-off, non-trading items, fell 3 percent to 379.3 cents.
