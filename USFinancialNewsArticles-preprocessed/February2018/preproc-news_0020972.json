    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- 2017 saw a net revenue retention rate of 118 percent for Seismic , the leading global sales and marketing enablement solution, the company announced today. Strong customer retention helped facilitate 97 percent year over year revenue growth and landed them on the Deloitte Fast 500 for the second year in a row as the 132 nd Fastest Growing Technology Company in North America, ending the year as the largest company in the sales enablement space.\nTo keep pace with sustained rapid growth, the company has hired former Guidewire Software CEO and founder John Raguin as chief marketing officer. Raguin brings more than 20 years of technology executive experience to Seismic's leadership team. In addition to founding Guidewire Software, which he led from inception to $150 million in revenue and pre-IPO, Raguin held management roles at Ariba (acquired by SAP) and MRO Software (acquired by IBM) and was a partner at venture capital firm F-Prime Capital. He will lead global marketing strategy at Seismic.\nSeismic moved into larger offices in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and their San Diego headquarters in 2017, adding more than 100 total employees. In 2018, Seismic plans to hire approximately 190 additional employees. More than half of these new positions will be allocated to its product team, which currently makes up about one-third of Seismic's 350-person headcount. Seismic also plans on expanding its international efforts, including in the company's recently launched Sydney, Australia office.\n\"2017 was a banner year for Seismic as we grew into the largest sales and marketing enablement provider in the space,\" said Doug Winter, Seismic co-founder and CEO. \"As we look at 2018, we have an aggressive hiring plan that will help us fully capitalize on our market momentum. I am incredibly excited to have John on board as CMO as his success and experience leading similar rapid growth companies will well complement the experienced management team we have in place.\"\nCustomer success across industries\nSeismic onboarded a new enterprise customer every 2.5 days and impacted more than 2.5 million selling interactions in 2017, achieving customer expansion in multiple major industries.
