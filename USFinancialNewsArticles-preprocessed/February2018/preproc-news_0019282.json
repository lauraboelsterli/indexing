Arizona was third in Division I with a 51.4 percent field-goal rate entering the game.\nUCLA shot 51.6 percent and made 11 of 24 3-point attempts. Hands had three and Goloman had a career-high three. Goloman, a senior center, returned to the starting lineup after missing three games, and he helped combat Arizona’s inside presence.\nHands, a freshman, made his fourth consecutive start after coming off the bench for the first 20 games.\nThe Bruins rode a 14-3 run to a 44-34 halftime lead.\nWilkes and Goloman made 3-pointers in an 8-0 surge that extended the Bruins’ lead to 56-44 with less than 14 minutes remaining.\nWelsh’s slam gave UCLA a 66-51 lead with 9:09 remaining.\nDusan Ristic had 11 points and Parker Jackson-Cartwright finished with 10 for the Wildcats.\nArizona is 79-3 at McKale Center since the start of the 2012-13 season. Even with the loss, it boasts the best home record in the nation in that span.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
