    "text": "TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TerraCycle US Inc., a leader in the collection and repurposing of hard-to-recycle post-consumer waste, announced it has acquired Chicago-based Air Cycle Corporation, a leader in universal waste recycling that provides solutions for mercury-containing fluorescent bulbs, battery, ballast and electronic waste disposal.\n\"This acquisition marks an important step in our growth and diversification strategies,\" said TerraCycle CEO Tom Szaky. \"Adding Air Cycle to TerraCycle's core business means that we can now offer, for the first time, the collection and recycling of products mandated for disposal by federal regulations, in addition to the voluntary programs we've had for over ten years.\"\nAir Cycle and its two decades of experience in the industry, will join TerraCycle's Regulated Waste business unit and will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraCycle US, Inc. In its new capacity the company will continue to offer lamp recycling products and services worldwide based on three recycling programs:\nBulb Eater® - Designed and manufactured for facilities that dispose of large quantities of lamps, the Bulb Eater crushes spent fluorescent bulbs into small fragments and compresses the waste into 55-gallon drums. Each Bulb Eater unit is built around a filtration system that ensures both OSHA and EPA compliance, and greatly reduces costs associated with the storage, handling and recycling of the lamps. EasyPak™ Recycling Program – The EasyPak recycling program is an alternative for customers who generate smaller quantities of spent lamps, batteries, and/or ballasts. Available in a variety of sizes, the EasyPak boxes are shipped by customers, through pre-paid UPS Ground transportation services, to recycling centers for processing. National Bulk Recycling – Designed to offer nationwide bulk pick-up and recycling services for companies with large amounts of intact lamps, ballasts, batteries, electronic waste and the crushed lamps generated by the Bulb Eater. Once the waste has been recycled, a Certificate of Recycling confirming the proper handling of the waste will be provided.\n\"Federal EPA regulations on fluorescent and mercury vapor lamps require non-residential facilities to properly dispose of their lamps,\" said Bobby Farris, General Manager of TerraCycle Regulated Waste. \"This acquisition puts the company in a unique position to meet those regulated waste needs, as well as offer our clients a vast range of other voluntary and customized recycling services.\"\nThe timing of this announcement coincides with TerraCycle US Inc. being qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue shares in a Regulation A offering to raise up to $25 million. The company will use the proceeds to expand its existing programs and acquire additional companies it believes will thrive within its broad array of recycling and consumer engagement services. With the SEC qualification of the Regulation A offering, now any category of investor can invest in TerraCycle's U.S. operating company and participate in its future. Interested investors are invited to visit www.OwnTerraCycle.com to view detailed information about the offering and invest directly from that site.\nAn offering statement regarding this offering has been filed with the SEC. The SEC has qualified that offering statement, which only means that the company may make sales of the securities described by the offering statement. It does not mean that the SEC has approved, passed upon the merits or passed upon the accuracy or completeness of the information in the offering statement. You should read the offering circular before making any investment. The offering circular that is part of that offering statement can be found at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714781/000114420418002133/tv483295_253g2.htm\nContact: Lauren Taylor\nTerraCycle\nLauren.taylor@terracycle.com\n609-656-5100 ext. 3705\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/terracycle-acquires-air-cycle-corporation-a-leader-in-universal-waste-recycling-300591788.html\nSOURCE TerraCycle US Inc.",
