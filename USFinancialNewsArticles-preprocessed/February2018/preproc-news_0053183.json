    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Singapore’s increase in stamp duty on expensive home purchases was unlikely to derail a recovery in the city state’s housing market, the head of a property developer’s association said on Friday.\nThe government this week raised the stamp duty on the portion of a residential property’s value above S$1 million ($761,615) to 4 percent from 3 percent.\n“Although the new revised buyer’s stamp duty hike may add some friction to transaction volumes and buyers are still price-sensitive, it is unlikely to derail the recovery,” Augustine Tan, president of the Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore, said in a speech.\n“In the purchase of sites from the government land sales programme or private collective sites, the substantial premiums paid by developers for residential sites, together with the 1 percent hike in the buyer’s stamp duty may translate into higher prices for new projects in the future,” Tan added.\nHis comments come as Singapore’s housing market is showing signs of a recovery, with private homes recording their first annual price rise in four years in 2017, and as property firms paid record sums to buy sites to develop.
