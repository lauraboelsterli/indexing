    "text": "More than 130 political appointees working in the Executive Office of the President did not have permanent security clearances as of November 2017, NBC News reported Wednesday, citing information from internal White House documents the network obtained.\nThose without permanent security clearances included Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior advisor, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior advisor.\nAmong appointees working with interim clearances, 47 of them are in positions that report directly to President Donald Trump, NBC News added.\nThe White House declined to comment on the matter, according to NBC.\nJust because permanent security clearance has not been granted, that doesn't necessarily mean there are problems with an individual's background, legal experts said, according to the NBC report.\nNBC reported that it was unclear whether some employees have had their clearance status changed since the time of the documents.\nRead NBC's story about White House officials who lacked permanent security clearances.",
