    "text": "(Reuters) - New world number one Roger Federer delivered another polished performance to beat Andreas Seppi 6-3 7-6(3) in the semi-final of the ABN AMRO World Tournament in Rotterdam on Saturday.\nThe Swiss will play world number five Grigor Dimitrov in Sunday’s final.\nFederer, who has won the title twice before, was not at his fluent best but was seldom troubled after breaking the Italian early in the first set and proved too good on all the big points.\nThe 36-year-old guaranteed his return to the top of the world rankings on Friday after more than five years, becoming the oldest man ever to reach the summit.\nIn the other semi-final, Belgium’s David Goffin was forced to retire against Dimitrov after suffering a freak eye injury.\nThe 27-year-old was trailing 6-3 0-1 when he framed an attempted volley directly into his left eye and was unable to continue. It was not clear how serious the injury was.\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis\n ",
