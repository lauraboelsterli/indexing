Gerry received a B.S. in Business Administration from Villanova University and is a holder of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation.\n“I am delighted to have Gerry join me as portfolio manager on both of our strategies,” stated Walthausen & Co. Chief Investment Officer, John Walthausen. “Gerry is a tenured portfolio manager, with extensive experience in leading a team utilizing a research-driven, fundamental bottom-up stock selection process. Additionally, he shares the same values of commitment, respect and fairness that are central to how we operate. For these reasons, we selected Gerry over other well-qualified candidates, as we believe that the alignment of these factors will be a key component in the growth and success of our firm for years to come.”\nAbout Walthausen & Co., LLC\nWalthausen & Co. has grown from its inception in August 2007 to approximately $1.3 billion in assets under management as a result of its strong reputation as an investment advisory firm and the success of its two domestic equity strategies in small and small- to mid-capitalization companies.\nThe investment team endeavors to provide returns in excess of their stated benchmarks over a market cycle by discovering opportunity in companies that they believe are trading below their underlying intrinsic value and over time will appreciate to reflect their legitimate worth.\nFor more information, please visit www.walthausenco.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221005791/en/\nWalthausen & Co.\nErik Nero\nenero@walthausenco.com\nSource: Walthausen & Co., LLC",
