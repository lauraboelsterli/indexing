    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Source Capital, Inc. (NYSE:SOR), today declared a regular quarterly distribution of 25 cents a common share, payable March 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business March 2, 2018.\nSource Capital, Inc. is a closed-end investment company managed by First Pacific Advisors, LLC.\nAbout Source Capital, Inc.\nThe Fund ( www.sourcecapitalinc.com ) is a diversified, closed-end management investment company seeking maximum total return for shareholders from both capital appreciation and investment income to the extent consistent with protection of invested capital.

Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. It is important to remember that there are risks inherent in any investment and there is no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over time. Value style investing presents the risk that the holdings or securities may never reach our estimate of intrinsic value because the market fails to recognize what the portfolio management team considers the true business value or because the portfolio management team has misjudged those values. In addition, value style investing may fall out of favor and underperform growth or other style investing during given periods. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks, such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country, including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Non-U.S. securities, including American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and other depository receipts, are also subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate risks.\nFixed income securities are subject to interest rate, inflation and credit risks. Lower rated bonds, convertible securities, and other types of debt obligations involve greater risks than higher rated bonds. Mortgage securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are subject to prepayment risk and the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or other assets; such derivatives may increase volatility. Convertible securities are generally not investment grade and are subject to greater credit risk than higher-rated investments. High yield securities can be volatile and subject to much higher instances of default.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212006370/en/\nHewes Communications, Inc.\nTucker Hewes, 212-207-9451\nor\nFor investor questions:\n1-800-982-4372\nSource: Source Capital, Inc.",
