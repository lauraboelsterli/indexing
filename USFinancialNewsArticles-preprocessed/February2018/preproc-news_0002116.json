Forward-looking statements can be identified by the words \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"intends,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"will,\" \"outlook\" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current plans, estimates, assumptions and projections, and speak only as of the date they are made. Celgene and Juno undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in light of new information or future events, except as otherwise required by law. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of either company, including the following: (a) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (b) the inability to complete the transaction due to the failure to satisfy conditions to the transaction; (c) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations; (d) difficulties or unanticipated expenses in connection with integrating Juno into Celgene; (e) the risk that the acquisition does not perform as planned; and (f) potential difficulties in employee retention following the closing of the transaction. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of the impact of a number of factors, many of which are discussed in more detail in the public reports of each company filed with the SEC.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180202005228/en/\nCelgene:\nInvestors:\n908-673-9628\ninvestors@celgene.com\nor\nMedia:\n908-673-2275\nmedia@celgene.com\nSource: Celgene Corporation",
