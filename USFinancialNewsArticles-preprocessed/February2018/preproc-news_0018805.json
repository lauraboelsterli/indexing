But after ramping up to 300 people, the 18F initiative is now less than half that size. Daniel Castro is sounding the alarm, writing in Fed Scoop about the Trump administration’s apparent neglect: \nIt has been slow to bring on staff, such as taking almost a year to appoint a new federal CIO. This matters because if agencies like 18F cannot recruit new talent, they will fail. As Dan Tangherlini, the former administrator of GSA, put it “[18F’s long-term viability] really comes down to whether they’re able to continue to attract the absolutely world-class people that they’ve been able to bring in over the last several years of their existence.” \nIf the Trump administration hopes to avoid the problems faced by its predecessor, it should not neglect the importance of recruiting top technical talent. FOR YOUR WEEKEND READING PLEASURE \nA few interesting longer reads I came across that are suitable for your weekend reading pleasure. \nThe Astronaut Who Might Actually Get Us to Mars ( Texas Monthly ) \nIn a cavernous warehouse behind a strip mall about three miles from the Johnson Space Center, just south of Houston, a Costa Rica–born scientist and former NASA astronaut named Franklin Chang Díaz has been tinkering with an unorthodox idea for the past thirteen years. The lab for his eleven-person company, Ad Astra, is roughly the size of a Barnes & Noble. But in the center of the room, rather than rows of romance novels, there are three stacks of gadgets resembling hi-fi stereo components. A few long tables and office chairs are scattered about. Along the back wall is the main event: a forty-ton stainless-steel cylindrical chamber that sits like a thirteen-foot-tall beer keg tipped on its side. If Franklin is right, this is the engine that will take us to Mars. \nSilicon Valley’s Tax-Avoiding, Job-Killing, Soul-Sucking Machine ( Esquire ) \nFour companies dominate our daily lives unlike any other in human history: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. We love our nifty phones and just-a-click-away services, but these behemoths enjoy unfettered economic domination and hoard riches on a scale not seen since the monopolies of the gilded age. The only logical conclusion? We must bust up big tech. \nForensic Science Put Jimmy Genrich in Prison for 24 Years. What if It Wasn’t Science? ( The Nation ) \nDuring the trial, ErkenBrack and the trial judge, Nicholas Massaro, agreed that Genrich’s fate hung on the toolmarks, the only physical evidence that connected him to the bombs. In the early 1990s, few people challenged the foundations of forensic methods such as toolmark analysis. Since then, despite CSI-style portrayals of forensic analysts as crime-solving oracles, prominent scientists and criminal-justice experts have questioned many of the “pattern-matching” disciplines that rely on comparisons of bite marks, hairs, shoe prints, tire tracks, or fingerprints. These are different from, say, forensic DNA analysis, which relies on scientific principles like the known variations in the human genome. \nThe White Darkness: A Solitary Journey Across Antarctica ( The New Yorker ) \nThe man, whose name was Henry Worsley, consulted a G.P.S. device to determine precisely where he was. According to his coördinates, he was on the Titan Dome, an ice formation near the South Pole that rises more than ten thousand feet above sea level. Sixty-two days earlier, on November 13, 2015, he’d set out from the coast of Antarctica, hoping to achieve what his hero, Ernest Shackleton, had failed to do a century earlier: to trek on foot from one side of the continent to the other. BEFORE YOU GO \nEver been nearly unable to stop playing a video game ? The first few versions of Sid Meier’s Civilization had that effect on me. I lost interest years ago, but the newest incarnation, called Civilization VI: Rise and Fall , looks kind of crazy complicated in a good way. \nThis edition of Data Sheet was curated by Aaron Pressman .
