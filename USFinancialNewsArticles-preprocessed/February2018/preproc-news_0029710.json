    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Marathon Oil Corp said on Wednesday its quarterly loss narrowed sharply on rising oil prices and cost cuts.\nFor the fourth quarter, Marathon posted a net loss of $28 million, or 3 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $1.38 billion, or $1.62 per share, in the year-ago period.\nProduction in the quarter rose 12 percent to 383,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).\nFor the year, Marathon plans a capital budget of $2.3 billion. The company expects to pump 390,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year. (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by James Dalgleish)\n ",
