    "text": "BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ZAYO) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell Scott-Rice Telephone Co., a Minnesota ILEC (incumbent local exchange carrier), for $42 million to New Ulm Telecom, Inc.\nZayo acquired Scott-Rice Telephone as part of its March 2017 purchase of Electric Lightwave. Since the acquisition, it has been managed separately but within Zayo’s Allstream business segment. Scott-Rice Telephone serves residential and business customers in areas of Scott and Rice counties southwest of Minneapolis.\n“This transaction represents further progress toward the separation of our Allstream business,” said Matt Steinfort, Zayo’s CFO. “It is consistent with Zayo’s strategic focus on communications infrastructure, and our goal of maximizing the value of our non-core assets.”\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to occur in the June 2018 quarter.
