Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.87, up 5% compared to $0.83 last year Completed the acquisition of MAS Automotive Distribution Inc. (MAS) The company expects 2018 net sales growth between 6%-9% and expects diluted EPS of between $4.00 and $4.23 on a GAAP basis and Adjusted diluted EPS of between $4.10 and $4.32, or between a 22% and 28% growth rate.\nCOLMAR, Pa., Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorman Products, Inc. (NASDAQ:DORM), a leading supplier in the automotive aftermarket, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 30, 2017.\n4 th Quarter Financial Results\nThe Company reported fourth quarter 2017 net sales of $227.7 million, down slightly compared to net sales of $229.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The MAS acquisition increased 2017 net sales by 3% ($7.0 million), while 2016 fourth quarter results included an extra week and accounted for a 5% year over year decline in revenues.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.0 million, or $0.65 per diluted share compared to $28.7 million, or $0.83 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income in the current year fourth quarter was $29.1 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, up 5% compared to $28.7 million, or $0.83 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures reported in the supplemental schedules.\nFiscal 2017 Financial Results\nFiscal 2017 net sales were $903.2 million, up 5% compared to $859.6 million in 2016. Growth attributable to the MAS acquisition was 1% offset by a 1% decline attributable to one less week’s net sales in fiscal 2017.\nNet income for the current fiscal year was $106.6 million, or $3.13 per diluted share compared to $106.0 million, or $3.07 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income in the current fiscal year was $114.7 million, or $3.37 per diluted share, up 10% compared to $106.0 million, or $3.07 per diluted share in the prior year.\nMatt Barton, Dorman Products President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: “the fourth quarter caps off another successful year at Dorman, with record sales and earnings for the company. I would like to thank our 2,000+ world-wide contributors, whose dedication, passion and persistence made this possible. We executed well in 2017, delivering full year sales growth of 6% (adjusted for one less week in 2017) and Adjusted EPS growth of 10% despite tough end market conditions coupled with inventory reductions at several customers. We launched 4,079 new SKU’s in 2017 ensuring that our future growth prospects remain strong. Sales from new products launched in the last 24 months represented 18% of our total sales in 2017, which is up from 17% in 2016, showcasing our healthy new product pipeline. Our Heavy Duty business continues its strong growth trajectory, growing 31% this year, and is well positioned to continue to deliver strong growth over the next several years. Our Complex Electronics portfolio, which we believe is a key competitive differentiator for us, grew 16% in 2017. We also completed the acquisition of MAS in the fourth quarter, a premium chassis parts company. We believe this acquisition firmly positions us as a leader in the category and provides exciting opportunities for growth in the future.”\nBarton continued: “we remain bullish on the Automotive Aftermarket despite slower market growth in 2017. We believe the market fundamentals remain strong. Miles driven are up and are expected to increase, gasoline prices remain relatively low and the pool of cars aged 6+ years is expected to increase going forward. Our strategy of developing New to the Aftermarket parts will continue to enable our customers to achieve year over year sales growth while offering the end user a high quality alternative to the OE. We believe that this, combined with other growth initiatives, will enable us to grow at a faster rate than the overall market.”\nTCJA\nWe will have a lower corporate tax rate under the TCJA. We anticipate an effective tax rate in 2018 of approximately 24%. The savings from this lower rate will be reduced by a reinvestment of approximately 20% of the realized tax savings back into the business through investment in additional growth initiatives and an enhancement to our employee profit sharing plan.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company’s full year sales growth is estimated to be in the 6%-9% range for 2018, which includes the net sales contribution from MAS. Fiscal 2018 EPS on a GAAP basis is expected to be in the $4.00 to $4.23 range. Fiscal 2018 Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $4.10 to $4.32 range or a 22% to 28% growth rate. EPS benefit from the TCJA (lower effective tax rate) included in this guidance, net of reinvestment in the business, is expected to be in the $0.58 to $0.62 range. We have not assumed any share repurchases in this guidance. First quarter 2018 net sales growth is expected to be at the lower end of our full year guidance due to non-recurring program launches that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nShare Repurchases\nUnder its share repurchase program, Dorman repurchased 223.9 thousand shares of its common stock for $15.7 million at an average share price of $70.23 during the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017, bringing fiscal year 2017 purchases to 1.0 million shares for $74.7 million at an average price of $74.26.\nAbout Dorman Products\nDorman Products, Inc. is a leading supplier of Dealer “Exclusive” replacement parts to the Automotive, Medium and Heavy Duty Aftermarkets.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(in thousands, except per-share amounts)\nThe Company’s financial results include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. Additionally, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. However, the Company has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes this presentation, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provides useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing the Company’s results, profitability trends, and underlying growth relative to prior and future periods and to our peers. Non-GAAP financial measures may reflect adjustments for charges such as fair value adjustments, amortization, transaction costs, and other similar expenses related to acquisitions which the Company has determined are material as well as other items that are not related to the Company’s ongoing performance.\nAdjusted Net Income:\n13 Weeks 14 Weeks 52 Weeks 53 Weeks (unaudited) 12/30/17 12/31/16 12/30/17 12/31/16 Net income (GAAP) $ 21,968 $ 28,701 $ 106,599 $ 106,049 Pretax acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustment [1] 592 - 592 - Pretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [2] 349 - 349 - Pretax acquisition-related transaction costs [3] 769 - 1,079 - Tax adjustment (related to above items) [4] (599 ) - (707 ) - Deferred tax asset revaluation related to the TCJA [4] 4,361 - 4,361 - Tax charge related to pre 2016 state tax matters [4] 1,636 - 2,400 - Adjusted net income (Non-GAAP) $ 29,076 $ 28,701 $ 114,673 $ 106,049 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: 13 Weeks 14 Weeks 52 Weeks 53 Weeks (unaudited) 12/30/17 12/31/16 12/30/17 12/31/16 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.65 $ 0.83 $ 3.13 $ 3.07 Pretax acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustment [1] 0.02 - 0.02 - Pretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [2] 0.01 - 0.01 - Pretax acquisition-related transaction costs [3] 0.02 - 0.03 - Tax adjustment (related to above items) [4] (0.02 ) - (0.02 ) - Deferred tax asset revaluation related to the TCJA [4] 0.13 - 0.13 - Tax charge related to pre 2016 state tax matters [4] 0.05 - 0.07 - Adjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 0.87 * $ 0.83 $ 3.37 $ 3.07 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 33,605 34,517 34,052 34,598 * Adjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) does not add due to rounding.\n[1] – Pre-tax acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments result from adjusting the value of acquired inventory from historical cost to fair value. Such costs were $0.6 million pretax (or $0.4 million after tax) and were included in Costs of Good Sold.\n[2] – Pre-tax acquisition related intangible asset amortization results from allocating the purchase price of material acquisitions to the acquired tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business and recognizing the cost of the intangible asset over the period of benefit. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Such costs were $0.3 million pretax (or $0.2 million after tax) and were included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses.\n[3] – Pre-tax acquisition related transaction costs include external costs incurred to complete and integrate a material acquisition as well as accretion expenses related to contingent consideration obligations. Such costs were $0.8 million pretax (or $0.5 million after tax) and were included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses.\n[4] – These adjustments represent the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the table above of $0.6 million. Such items are estimated by applying the Company’s overall estimated tax rate to the pretax amount, or, by applying a specific tax rate if one is appropriate. Also included in Provision for Income Taxes is a revaluation of a net deferred tax asset related to the TCJA and a tax charge related to pre 2016 tax matters.\n2018 Guidance:\nThe Company provided the following guidance ranges related to their fiscal 2018 outlook:\nDecember 29, 2018 Fiscal Year Ended (unaudited) Low End High End Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 4.00 $ 4.23 Pretax acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustment [1] 0.05 0.05 Pretax acquisition-related intangible assets amortization [2] 0.06 0.06 Pretax acquisition-related transaction costs [1,2] 0.06 0.04 Tax adjustment (related to above items) [3] (0.07 ) (0.06 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $ 4.10 $ 4.32 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 33,572 33,572 [1] - Included in Cost of Goods Sold [2] - Included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses [3] - Included in Provision for Income Taxes\nSource:Dorman Products, Inc.",
