    "text": "TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average edged up on Friday morning, with most sectors advancing as sentiment improved after fears of more aggressive U.S. interest rate hikes receded, with defensive stocks such as construction and utilities outperforming.\nThe Nikkei rose 0.3 percent to 21,791.68 in midmorning trade. For the week, the benchmark index was up 0.4 percent.\nConstruction companies Kajima Corp and Taisei Corp climbed 2.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, and Tokyo Electric Power Co rose 1.8 percent.\nMining stocks also gained, with Inpex and Japan Petroleum Exploration both surging 2.0 percent after oil prices rose to two-week highs.\nExporters were mixed. Some investors hesitated to take positions, on caution the U.S. share market could see volatility again.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.4 percent to 1,753.98.
