    "text": "TULSA, Okla., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matrix Service Company (Nasdaq:MTRX), a leading contractor to the energy, power and industrial markets across North America, today reported financial results for its second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nKey highlights:\nCompany earned $0.17 per fully diluted share in the second quarter\nConsolidated gross margins increased year over year to 9.4%\nConsolidated book-to-bill was 1.0 on awards of $279.1 million, with the largest quarterly awards in Storage Solutions since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015\nIndustrial segment revenue increased 137% while Oil Gas & Chemical segment revenue increased 59% compared to the same period in the prior year\nNet income and tax expense benefited by $1.9 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n“Our diversified business model continues to serve us well, with strong second quarter results in our Industrial and Oil Gas & Chemical segments. These positive results were offset by an expected reduction in power generation revenue as well as less spending in the high voltage business,\" said Matrix Service Company President and CEO John R. Hewitt. \"Additionally, in our Storage Solutions segment, while revenues were lower as a result of delayed project awards, we achieved a book-to-bill of 1.8 in the quarter. Subsequent to the closing of the quarter, we received a number of additional significant and strategic project awards; announcements on which will be forthcoming.\"\nThe delay in the award of these anticipated projects has shifted revenue to later periods. Said Hewitt, \"These and other delayed awards, combined with lower than anticipated spending in our Northeastern based high voltage electrical business, will impact our full year revenue. Our EPS guidance remains unchanged, however we are modifying full year revenue guidance from between $1.225 billion and $1.325 billion to between $1.150 billion and $1.225 billion.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nConsolidated revenue was $282.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $312.7 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year. Storage Solutions revenue declined primarily as a result of delays in project awards which have not allowed the Company to replace higher revenue experienced in the prior year in connection with work on the construction of crude gathering terminals for the Dakota Access pipeline. Electrical Infrastructure segment revenue also declined due to a combination of a reduction in high voltage revenue and revenue associated with the construction of a large power generating facility in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by higher maintenance, turnaround and construction volumes in our Oil Gas & Chemical segment and higher volumes in our Industrial segment attributable to work in the iron and steel industry.\nConsolidated gross profit was $26.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $28.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The gross margin was 9.4% in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 9.0% in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to improved construction overhead cost recovery. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $21.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20.0 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to overhead and amortization on intangible assets associated with a December 2016 acquisition that expanded the Company's engineering business.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, the Company earned net income of $4.5 million, or $0.17 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $5.3 million, or $0.20 in the prior year.\nSix Month Fiscal 2018 Results\nConsolidated revenue was $552.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $654.4 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year. Storage Solutions revenue declined primarily as a result of delays in project awards which have not allowed the Company to replace higher revenue experienced in the prior year in connection with work on the construction of crude gathering terminals for the Dakota Access pipeline. Electrical Infrastructure segment revenue also declined due to a combination of a reduction in high voltage revenue and revenue associated with the construction of a large power generating facility in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by higher maintenance, turnaround and construction volumes in our Oil Gas & Chemical segment and higher volumes in our Industrial segment attributable to work in the iron and steel industry.\nConsolidated gross profit was $55.6 million in the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $60.5 million in the six months ended December 31, 2016. The gross margin was 10.1% in the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 9.2% in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to strong project execution as well as improved construction overhead cost recovery. Consolidated SG&A expenses were $43.1 million in the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $38.0 million in the same period a year earlier. The increase in fiscal 2018 is primarily attributable to overhead and amortization on intangible assets associated with a December 2016 acquisition that expanded the Company's engineering business.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, the Company earned net income of $8.4 million, or $0.31 per fully diluted share during the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $14.6 million, or $0.54 in the prior year.\nImpact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Company’s financial statements have been adjusted to account for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act affected the Company’s second quarter and full year results as follows:\nResulted in a reduced effective tax rate of 32% for fiscal 2018 based on a blended statutory tax rate of 28%.\nResulted in a $1.2 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of the Company’s domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nResulted in a $0.7 million tax benefit related to reducing the first half of the year income tax expense to the new reduced fiscal 2018 effective rate of 32%.\nThe Company does not expect to record a one-time transition tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign entities.\nBacklog\nBacklog at December 31, 2017 was $725.0 million compared to $728.8 million at September 30, 2017. Quarterly book-to-bill ratio was 1.0 on project awards of $279.1 million. The six month ended December 31, 2017 book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 on project awards of $595.6 million.\nFinancial Position\nThe Company's cash balance increased to $74.1 million in the quarter. The cash balance combined with availability under the credit facility provides the Company with liquidity of $99.7 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $32.1 million since September 30, 2017. This decrease in liquidity is primarily attributable to an increase in the capacity constraint of the credit facility along with an increase in project related letters of credit. The Company's liquidity continues to support its long-term strategic growth plans. The Company expects liquidity improvement as we work through the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Since December 31, 2017, the Company repaid $35.0 million of borrowings under the credit facility while maintaining a cash balance in excess of $60.0 million, further strengthening the Company's liquidity.\nEarnings Guidance\nThe Company is maintaining fiscal 2018 earnings guidance of between $0.55 and $0.75 per fully diluted share. Revenue guidance is being reduced from between $1.225 billion and $1.325 billion to between $1.150 billion and $1.225 billion.\nConference Call / Webcast Details\nIn conjunction with the earnings release, Matrix Service Company will host a conference call / webcast with John R.

The following arrangements are considered firm:\nfixed-price awards; minimum customer commitments on cost plus arrangements; and certain time and material arrangements in which the estimated value is firm or can be estimated with a reasonable amount of certainty in both timing and amounts.\nFor long-term maintenance contracts with no minimum commitments and other established customer arrangements, we include only the amounts that we expect to recognize into revenue over the next 12 months. For all other arrangements, we calculate backlog as the estimated contract amount less revenue recognized as of the reporting date.\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in our backlog for the three months ended December 31, 2017:\nElectrical\nInfrastructure Oil Gas &\nChemical Storage\nSolutions Industrial Total (In thousands) Backlog as of September 30, 2017 $ 119,642 $ 235,549 $ 133,138 $ 240,468 $ 728,797 Project awards 40,083 91,491 123,568 24,006 279,148 Revenue recognized (64,852 ) (88,359 ) (70,441 ) (59,259 ) (282,911 ) Backlog as of December 31, 2017 $ 94,873 $ 238,681 $ 186,265 $ 205,215 $ 725,034 Book-to-bill ratio (1) 0.6 1.0 1.8 0.4 1.0\n(1) Calculated by dividing project awards by revenue recognized during the period.
