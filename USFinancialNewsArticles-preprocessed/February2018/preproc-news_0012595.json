When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nAdjusted operating expenses, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for per share amounts):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nOperating Expenses 2,250 2,332 552 580 Less: Interactive Data and NYSE transaction and integration costs and acquisition related success fees 31 46 8 15 Less: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services 6 — — — Less: Accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries 14 — — — Less: Employee severance costs related to Creditex U.K. brokerage operations — 4 — — Less: Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment — 33 — — Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 261 302 65 72 Adjusted operating expenses $ 1,938 $ 1,947 $ 479 $ 493 Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet income attributable to ICE $ 2,514 $ 1,422 $ 1,225 $ 352 Add: Interactive Data and NYSE transaction and integration costs 31 46 8 15 Add: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services 6 — — — Add: Accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries 14 — — — Add: Employee severance costs related to Creditex U.K. brokerage operations — 4 — — Add: Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment — 33 — — Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 261 302 65 72 Less: Gain on divestiture of Trayport, net (110 ) — (110 ) — Less: Cetip investment gain, net (167 ) — — — Less: Income tax effect for the items above (43 ) (143 ) 11 (32 ) Less: Tax adjustments on U.S. tax reform (764 ) — (764 ) — Less: Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles 10 (22 ) (2 ) (2 ) Add: Other tax adjustments — 23 — 23 Adjusted net income attributable to ICE $ 1,752 $ 1,665 $ 433 $ 428 Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE $ 4.23 $ 2.37 $ 2.08 $ 0.59 Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE $ 2.95 $ 2.78 $ 0.73 $ 0.71 About Intercontinental Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) is a Fortune 500 and Fortune Future 50 company formed in the year 2000 to modernize markets.
