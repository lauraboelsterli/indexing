Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include the following: customer demand for Tableau's products and services and customer response to its subscription pricing offerings; risks associated with anticipated growth in Tableau's business and addressable market; competitive factors, including new market entrants and changes in the competitive environment, pricing changes, sales cycle time and increased competition; Tableau's enterprise sales execution and expansion and further transition to subscription and term licensing; Tableau's ability to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel; general economic and industry conditions, including expenditure trends for business analytics and productivity tools; new product introductions and Tableau's ability to develop and deliver innovative, secure and high-quality products; Tableau's ability to provide high-quality customer service and support offerings; risks associated with international expansion and operations; macroeconomic conditions; market conditions; and the possibility that the stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued. These and other important risk factors are described more fully in additional documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Tableau's most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and could cause actual results to vary from expectations. All information provided in this release and in the conference call is as of the date hereof and Tableau undertakes no duty to update this information except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTableau believes that the use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share and free cash flow is helpful to its investors. These measures, which are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense and expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, each to the extent attributable to the cost of revenues, from gross profit. Non-GAAP gross margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by total revenues. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense and expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets from operating income (loss). Non-GAAP operating margin is the ratio calculated by dividing non-GAAP operating income (loss) by total revenues. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated by excluding stock-based compensation expense, expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-GAAP income tax adjustments from net income (loss). Non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted common share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding includes the effect of dilutive shares in periods of non-GAAP net income.\nNon-GAAP financial information is adjusted for a tax rate equal to Tableau's estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income over a three-year financial projection. This long-term rate is based on Tableau's estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures. To determine this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, Tableau evaluates a three-year financial projection that excludes the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. The long-term non-GAAP tax rate takes into account other factors including Tableau's current operating structure, its existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where Tableau operates. The long-term non-GAAP tax rate applied to each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was 30%. The long-term non-GAAP tax rate assumes the Company's deferred income tax assets will be realized based upon projected future taxable income excluding stock-based compensation expense. As of January 1, 2018, Tableau anticipates the long-term non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% due to the recent U.S. corporate tax legislation. Tableau may provide updates to this rate on an annual basis, or more frequently if material changes occur.\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash expenses, Tableau believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between its operating results from period to period. The expense related to amortization of acquired intangible assets is dependent upon estimates and assumptions, which can vary significantly and are unique to each asset acquired; therefore, Tableau believes non-GAAP measures that adjust for the amortization of acquired intangible assets provides investors a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are important tools for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating Tableau's own operating results over different periods of time.\nTableau calculates free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities for purchases of property and equipment. Tableau considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by Tableau's business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in Tableau's business, making strategic acquisitions, repurchasing Tableau's common stock and strengthening Tableau's balance sheet. All of Tableau's non-GAAP financial measures are important tools for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating Tableau's operating results over different periods of time.\nNon-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in Tableau's industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on Tableau's reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Tableau's business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Tableau's business.\nTableau Software, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember

Tableau adopted the new requirement retrospectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, this resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.2 million and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by (used in) financing activities of $2.2 million.\nTableau Software, Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(In share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of gross profit to non-GAAP gross profit:\nGross profit\n$\n219,046\n$\n222,950\n$\n763,500\n$\n727,853\nExcluding: Stock-based compensation expense attributable to cost of revenues\n2,777\n2,535\n11,029\n10,595\nExcluding: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n346\n96\n800\n323\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n222,169\n$\n225,581\n$\n775,329\n$\n738,771\nReconciliation of gross margin to non-GAAP gross margin:\nGross margin\n87.8\n%\n88.9\n%\n87.1\n%\n88.0\n%\nExcluding: Stock-based compensation expense attributable to cost of revenues\n1.1\n%\n1.0\n%\n1.3\n%\n1.3\n%\nExcluding: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n0.1\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.1\n%\n0.0\n%\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n89.1\n%\n89.9\n%\n88.4\n%\n89.3\n%\nReconciliation of operating loss to non-GAAP operating income:\nOperating loss\n$\n(43,519)\n$\n(16,946)\n$\n(190,965)\n$\n(139,561)\nExcluding: Stock-based compensation expense\n54,660\n47,758\n210,283\n185,712\nExcluding: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n346\n96\n800\n323\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n11,487\n$\n30,908\n$\n20,118\n$\n46,474\nReconciliation of operating margin to non-GAAP operating margin:\nOperating margin\n(17.5)\n%\n(6.8)\n%\n(21.8)\n%\n(16.9)\n%\nExcluding: Stock-based compensation expense\n21.9\n%\n19.1\n%\n24.0\n%\n22.5\n%\nExcluding: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n0.1\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.1\n%\n0.0\n%\nNon-GAAP operating margin\n4.6\n%\n12.3\n%\n2.3\n%\n5.6\n%\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP net income:\nNet loss\n$\n(41,838)\n$\n(21,088)\n$\n(185,560)\n$\n(144,449)\nExcluding: Stock-based compensation expense\n54,660\n47,758\n210,283\n185,712\nExcluding: Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n346\n96\n800\n323\nIncome tax adjustments\n(2,792)\n(6,083)\n(2,854)\n(7,560)\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n10,376\n$\n20,683\n$\n22,669\n$\n34,026\nWeighted average shares used to compute non-GAAP basic net income per share:\n80,074\n76,411\n78,869\n75,162\nEffect of potentially dilutive shares: stock awards\n4,427\n4,331\n4,092\n4,783\nWeighted average shares used to compute non-GAAP diluted net income per share\n84,501\n80,742\n82,961\n79,945\nNon-GAAP net income per share:\nBasic\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.29\n$\n0.45\nDiluted\n$\n0.12\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.43\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nNet cash provided by operating activities (1)\n$\n226,867\n$\n177,262\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment\n61,823\n60,732\nFree cash flow (1)\n$\n165,044\n$\n116,530\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(461,962)\n$\n(77,131)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1)\n$\n(41,135)\n$\n14,347\n(1) Tableau adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017.

Customer accounts are typically organizations. In some cases, organizations will have multiple groups purchasing Tableau software, which count as discrete customer accounts.\n(2) These operating metrics are based on Tableau's definition of bookings, which is defined as the first year of contracted revenue only and does not include additional years beyond the first year unless a customer pays for those years up front. Bookings includes both new sales and renewals. Tableau's bookings may not be comparable to similarly named measures disclosed by other companies in the software industry. Bookings is not a measure of revenue or an indication of actual revenue results. Revenues ultimately recognized could be affected by a number of factors. License bookings include sales of software licenses and subscriptions to Tableau Online. Ratable bookings are sales transactions that result in revenues, which will be amortized over a period of time.\n(3) Tableau defines total annual recurring revenue (\"Total ARR\") as the annualized recurring value of all active contracts at the end of a reporting period. Total ARR includes subscription annual recurring revenue (\"Subscription ARR\") and the annualized value of all maintenance contracts related to perpetual licenses active at the end of a reporting period.\n(4) Tableau defines Subscription ARR as the annualized recurring value of all active subscription contracts at the end of a reporting period. Subscription ARR includes term licenses and renewals, subscription enterprise license agreements and Tableau Online subscriptions and renewals, and excludes distribution original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") license agreements and perpetual-style enterprise license agreements.\n(5) Ratable revenues were amortized during the respective periods. For example, sales of Tableau Online, enterprise license agreements, term licenses and OEM license arrangements, as well as maintenance and support, are recognized ratably.\n(6) Ratable license revenues were amortized during the respective periods. For example, sales of Tableau Online, enterprise license agreements, term licenses and OEM license arrangements are recognized ratably.\n(7) Services revenues were recognized upon delivery of professional services and training.\n(8) Tableau calculates normalized license bookings by applying the equivalent ratio of perpetual prices to subscription bookings, assuming demand and discount are held constant, to adjust term license and renewals, subscription enterprise license agreements and Tableau Online subscriptions and renewals.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tableau-reports-q4-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300592292.html\nSOURCE Tableau Software",
