    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 8:31 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago Bitcoin slides below $6,000; half its value lost in 2018 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slid another 13 percent to below $6,000 (£4,294) on Tuesday, bringing the world’s best-known cryptocurrency’s losses to more than half since the start of 2018. \nBitcoin has fallen heavily in recent sessions as worries about a regulatory clampdown on the nascent market and panicked investors push prices lower. The virtual currency hit a peak of almost $20,000 in December. \nOn the Luxembourg-based bitstamp exchange, bitcoin fell to as low as $5,920, its lowest level since mid-November, before recovering slightly. Other cryptocurrencies have also dropped sharply in value this week. Reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Alison Williams",
