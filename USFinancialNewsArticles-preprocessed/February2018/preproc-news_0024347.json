    "text": "Having grown up in successive but very different eras, millennials — people ages 17 to 37 — and Gen Xers, ages 38 to 52, can harbor different concerns and perspectives around investing.\nCristian Baitg Schreiweis/aluxum | Getty Images Millennials and Generation X have quite different approaches and attitudes to financial management. For example, a study from Global X found that for 87 percent of millennials, also known as Gen Y, their most important expectation of an advisor was protecting their investments during a market downturn. In contrast, 76 percent of Gen X wanted financial education.\nThis lines up with the observations of Rob O'Dell, certified financial planner with Coyle Financial Counsel. He also lectures on selling financial services across the generations for research firm Generational Insights.\nGen X tends to be very skeptical, he said. They know things don't go according to plan. They grew up witnessing the Watergate scandal of the 1970s and watched the space shuttle Challenger blow up in 1986. They were often latchkey kids, with more than 50 percent having divorced parents, which led them to become very self-reliant.\n\"As a result, they want total transparency,\" O'Dell said. \"With mutual funds, for example, they want to know exactly how much they're paying in fees at the fund level and advisor level.\n\"They want their advisors to help save them time and money, in that order.\"\nIn contrast, O'Dell said, millennials — because they grew up so close to their super-involved baby boomer parents — are interested in similar social causes as embraced by their parents in the 1960s and '70s. They want to make the world a better place, and they invest accordingly.\nInvesting with borrowed money can be a big win\nBeware of online financial quick-fix stories\nSo you're a 401(k) 'millionairess.' Now what?\n\"These idealistic hippie kids tend to have a more conservative mindset in terms of investing, because they saw the results of the tech bubble, September 11 and the [Great Recession of] 2008,\" he said.\nMillennials and Gen X have quite different approaches and attitudes, agreed Marcio Silveira, CFP and founder of Pavlov Financial Planning.\n\"Generation X remembers the '90s — the robust stock market and hedge funds,\" he said. \"So they're more willing to bet on the market and stocks and risky assets.\n\"They're less concerned with corporate social responsibility and accept that corporations are here to make money.\"\nIn terms of portfolio planning, it is important to address any overconfidence, Silveira said, especially with those who are now thinking about retirement.\nYour Wealth: Weekly advice on managing your money Sign up to get Your Wealth\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Submit Please enter a valid email address Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service. Privacy Policy . Millennials tend to be suspicious of institutions, the stock market, regulators and corporations, he said, adding, \"They think the system is rigged. They expect corporations to be good corporate citizens.\"\nMillennial clients often try to avoid certain sectors — such as defense, oil, tobacco and alcohol — in their portfolios, he said. In response, Silveira will supplement a core of index investments with funds that take a more actively managed socially responsible approach.\n\"They seem to be more conservative and less knowledgeable [about investing] than Generation X,\" he said. \"We need to educate them to be not too risk-averse.\"\nFor his part, Trent Porter, CFP and owner of Priority Financial Partners, finds that members of both generations have similarities: interest in socially responsible investing and membership in what he calls the research culture.\nOn the investment side, younger clients (age 45 and younger) are asking, overall, for socially responsible options, he said. In response, all of his model portfolios come in two versions: traditional passive funds and sustainably tilted passive funds.\n\"The internet opened the information flow up, and that's where the millennials grew up. They're not buying the old line of having to choose between financial returns and sustainable, responsible business practices.\" -Shane Yonston, principal advisor at Impact Investors \"They like knowing they're voting with their dollars and supporting a cause,\" Porter said. \"Once I mention the sustainable option to clients, they're thrilled.\"\nHe also sees a market opportunity in offering socially responsible investments because, he said, no major robo-advisors are offering them.\nPorter sees several effects from his clients' passion for research:\nFOMO (fear of missing out): This is a main concern, especially of the millennial clients, he said. \"As new investors, they know that the earlier you start, the better,\" Porter said. \"They're afraid of missing the boat.\" Robo-overload: \"They're now starting to get overwhelmed with the number of robo-advisors out there and realizing they're not getting the financial planning they need from them.\" It's true that both generations are interested in socially responsible investing, said Shane Yonston, principal advisor at Impact Investors, a company that considers financial returns along with positive, measurable social and environmental impact. His portfolios include socially focused mutual funds, community investment notes and private-equity impact investing.\nWhile both cohorts share this interest, he has observed that millennials and Gen X clients have come to it via different avenues.\n\"The internet opened the information flow up, and that's where the millennials grew up,\" Yonston said. \"They're not buying the old line of having to choose between financial returns and sustainable, responsible business practices.\n\"For Generation X and older clients, the lightbulb is going off in their heads due to greater publicity and awareness about climate change, fossil-fuel divestment and themes like environmental or women-focused investing,\" he added.\n— By Deborah Nason, special to CNBC.com",
