(Nasdaq: MEDP) (“Medpace”) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet service revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $99.4 million, an increase of 4.3%, compared to $95.4 million for the comparable prior-year period. Net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $386.5 million, an increase of 4.3%, compared to $370.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBacklog as of December 31, 2017 grew 8.4% to $524.4 million from $483.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Net new business awards were $114.7 million, representing a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.15x for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $99.7 million for the comparable prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net new business awards were $426.1 million, representing a net book-to-bill ratio of 1.10x, compared to $427.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company calculates net book-to-bill ratio by dividing net new business awards by net service revenue.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $55.6 million, compared to $51.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Direct costs were $56.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $51.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $211.8 million, compared to $198.5 million in the full year 2016. Adjusted Direct costs were $215.0 million for the full year 2017, compared to $198.1 million in the full year 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses were $16.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017 versus $16.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, Selling, general and administrative expenses were $63.4 million compared to $61.5 million in the full year 2016. Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses were $63.1 million for the full year 2017 versus $58.8 million for the full year 2016.\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.3 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, versus a GAAP net loss of $0.0 million, or ($0.00) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. This resulted in a net income (loss) margin of 11.4% and (0.0%) for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. GAAP net income for the full year 2017 was $39.1 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, versus GAAP net income of $13.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. This resulted in a net income margin of 10.1% and 3.6% for the full year 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $27.0 million, or 27.2% of net service revenue, compared to $27.5 million, or 28.8% of net service revenue, for the comparable prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 decreased 4.7% to $108.0 million, or 28.0% of net service revenue, compared to $113.4 million, or 30.6% of net service revenue, for the prior year.\nAdjusted Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 3.2% to $14.8 million, compared to $14.3 million for the comparable prior-year period. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.39 compared to Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $0.35 for the comparable prior-year period. Adjusted Net Income for the full year 2017 increased 8.5% to $60.5 million, compared to $55.7 million for the prior year. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for the full year 2017 was $1.52 compared to Adjusted Net Income per diluted share of $1.53 for the prior year.\nA reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Direct costs, Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share to the corresponding GAAP measures is provided below.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\nThe Company’s share repurchase program initiated in 2017 terminated in the fourth quarter and the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized new share repurchases of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions, at the discretion of our management. The extent and timing of repurchases depends on market conditions, applicable regulatory requirements, and other considerations. The share repurchase authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any minimum amount of common stock and any repurchase program may be modified, limited, extended, suspended or terminated at any time at the Company’s discretion. The Company currently expects that any repurchases under the program would be made in compliance with the SEC’s Rules 10b-5 and 10b-18.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nThe Company’s Cash and cash equivalents were $26.5 million at December 31, 2017, and the Company generated $28.7 million in cash flow from operating activities during the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 2.0 million shares from Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited for a total of $60.3 million.\nFinancial Guidance\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” For full-year 2018, the Company is providing guidance under ASC 605, excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, for comparability purposes. The Company forecasts 2018 net service revenue in the range of $412 million to $428 million, representing growth of 6.6% to 10.7% over 2017 net service revenue of $386.5 million. GAAP net income for full year 2018 is forecasted in the range of $43.9 million to $48.1 million. Additionally, full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $102 million to $108 million.\nBased on forecasted 2018 net service revenue of $412 million to $428 million and GAAP net income of $43.9 million to $48.1 million, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) is forecasted in the range of $1.21 to $1.33. Adjusted Net Income for 2018 is forecasted in the range of $66.0 million to $70.0 million, compared to Adjusted Net Income of $60.5 million for 2017. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for 2018 is expected in the range of $1.82 to $1.93 per share.\nConference Call Details\nMedpace will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET, Tuesday, February 27, 2018, to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nTo participate in the conference call, dial 800-219-7113 (domestic) or 574-990-1030 (international) using the passcode 5099654.\nTo access the conference call via webcast, visit the “Investors” section of Medpace’s website at medpace.com .

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this release and in our filings with the SEC. Any such represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release. While we may elect to update such at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change. These should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain financial measures presented in this press release, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Direct costs, Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share, are not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Direct costs, Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share or comparable metrics as a measurement used in evaluating our operating performance on a consistent basis, as a consideration to assess incentive compensation for our employees, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget, and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Direct costs, Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. See the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this release for our U.S. GAAP results. Additionally, for reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Direct costs, Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income per diluted share to our closest reported U.S. GAAP measures, refer to the appendix of this press release.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash and non-recurring items. While we believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors, because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Medpace Holdings, Inc. before income tax expense, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization with Adjusted EBITDA being further adjusted for unusual and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Service revenue, net for each period. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share\nAdjusted Net Income measures our operating performance by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Medpace Holdings, Inc. to include cash expenditures related to rental payments on leases classified for accounting purposes as deemed landlord liabilities, and exclude amortization expense, certain stock based compensation award non-cash expenses, certain litigation expenses, deferred financing fees and certain other non-recurring items. Adjusted Net Income per diluted share measures Adjusted Net Income on a per diluted share basis. Management uses these measures to evaluate our core operating results as it excludes certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the core operations of the business, but includes certain items such as depreciation, interest expense and tax expense, which are otherwise excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We believe the presentation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per diluted share enhances our investors’ overall understanding of the financial performance. You should not consider Adjusted Net Income or Adjusted Net Income per diluted share as an alternative to Net income (loss) or Net income per diluted share attributable to Medpace Holdings Inc., determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.\nAdjusted Direct costs and Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses\nAdjusted Direct costs and Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses are useful to provide information to investors to evaluate core operating expenses as they exclude certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the core operations of the business, but includes certain items such as certain lease payments which are otherwise excluded from core operating expenses. We believe that reporting these metrics enhance our investors’ overall understanding of our core recurring operating expenses. You should not consider Adjusted Direct costs and Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses as an alternative to Direct costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and Selling, general and administrative expenses, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.\nMEDPACE HOLDINGS, INC.

Future stock based awards activity is expected to be classified as equity for accounting purposes and will not be subject to period ending fair value adjustments. (b) Represents cash rental payments on two corporate headquarter buildings that are accounted for as deemed assets and subject to depreciation expense over the life of the lease. Payments made for these leases are accounted for with a principal portion and an interest portion, consistent with deemed landlord liability accounting. The interest portion of these payments is included in net cash provided by operating activities in our statement of cash flows. The principal portion is reflected as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows. These adjustments for purposes of arriving at Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Direct costs, Adjusted Selling, general and administrative expenses and Adjusted Net Income have the effect of presenting these leases consistently with all other office lease rentals that we have globally. (c) Represents amortization of the discount and issuance costs deferred on the consolidated balance sheet associated with the issuance of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. (d) Represents advisory costs and other fees incurred in connection with the August 2016 initial public offering and the 2017 S-3 registration statement and the Prospectus. (e) Represents the tax effect of the total adjustments at 39% for 2016. Fourth quarter of 2017 and year-to-date 2017 is reflective of an estimated effective tax rate of 36%. For full year 2018 guidance, a tax rate of 22.0% to 25.0% is assumed. (f) Represents a loss on extinguishment of long-term debt in connection with the repayment and extinguishment of our obligations under the previous Senior Secured Credit Facilities during the fourth quarter of 2016. (g) Consists of one time adjustments due to U.S. federal tax reform passed in December 2017, including revaluation of deferred credit, partially offset by revaluation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, transition tax, and other miscellaneous tax reform related items.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006476/en/\nMedpace Holdings, Inc.\nMedia Contact:\nJulie Hopkins, 513-579-9911 x12627\nj.hopkins@medpace.com\nor\nInvestor Contact:\ninvestor@medpace.com\nSource: Medpace Holdings, Inc.",
