    "text": "HONG KONG, Feb 2 (Reuters) - China is drafting a proposal to allow gambling on its southern resort island of Hainan, Bloomberg reported on Friday, a move that would allow betting on the mainland for the first time, sending shares of Hong Kong-listed casinos plunging.\nGovernment agencies are said to be considering online gaming, sports betting or a lottery on Hainan, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the talks.\nThe proposal, which is still at an early stage, could open the door to physical casinos over the long term, Bloomberg said.\nThe former Portuguese territory of Macau is currently the only place on Chinese soil where casino gambling is permitted.\nSome casino shares plunged as much as 8 percent following the report, but pared losses by the close of trade with Galaxy Entertainment down 2 percent, Sands China down 1.4 percent, MGM China falling 1.5 percent and SJM Holdings sliding 2.6 percent.\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities shut down a cashless casino bar in Hainan after a Reuters report drew attention to it.\nThe owner of the resort that housed the casino bar had told Reuters at the time that the government was monitoring the concept of cashless gambling.\nGambling revenue in Macau skyrocketed 36 percent year-on-year in January on strong demand from big whale gamblers, while mom-and-pop mass punters eager to play in the countryâ€™s only legal casino hub also drove up business.\nReporting by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ",
