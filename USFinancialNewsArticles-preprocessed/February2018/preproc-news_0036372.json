    "text": " 02 AM / Updated an hour ago Quotes from the Pyeongchang Winter Games on day 12 Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Following are some memorable quotes from the Pyeongchang Olympics on Wednesday: “For sure it is painful but we call it type-two fun, where it’s painful in the moment and then afterwards you look back and then go, ‘wow, I just pushed myself so hard. I can’t believe I was able to do that’.” - American cross country skier Jessica Diggins on the rush after crossing the finish line Canadian freestyle skier Cassie Sharpe on sleeping next to her halfpipe gold medal: “I put it on my pillow next to me last night, it was like a tooth fairy sitting next to me, it was nice. Just got to really soak it in and enjoy the moment.” “It’s like being the penalty-taker in a soccer team, you’ve got to like taking that penalty in extra time... I love that pressure, that tension, knowing that if you make the shot, you win the game, but if you miss it, you’re gonna lose. If you enjoy that feeling, then you’re a skip. If you’re peeing your pants and sneaking around, you’re not the skip.” - Norwegian curler Thomas Ulsrud on handling the pressure of leadership ”I have a degree in molecular biology but I fell in love with ski coaching. In one sense, you know, I wanted to be a doctor to help people, and so you could say that I‘m doing that, just in a different way. - Karin Hajro, the assistant coach of the U.S. women’s alpine skiing team, on following her passion “I still don’t realize I‘m first. I was really focused, I moved like a samurai. Usually, I‘m really chaotic but I wanted to take in every little detail, every particular in the morning. I believed in myself and then what counts, counts.” - Italian skier Sofia Goggia after her downhill gold New Zealand snowboarder Carlos Garcia Knight on what surprised him at the Olympics: ”I‘m surprised it’s not as intimidating as I expected. I thought I was going to be at the top losing it, but I‘m actually feeling really good, and I‘m also surprised that the level of riding has been so good and so consistent across the board.
