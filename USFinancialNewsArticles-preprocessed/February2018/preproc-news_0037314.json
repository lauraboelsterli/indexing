    "text": "LOS ANGELES and CHICAGO, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Surkus Inc, the Los Angeles-based industry leader in event technology, has acquired Chicago-based Craze Promotions LLC, a national leader in last-minute distribution of live event unclaimed ticket inventory.\nChris Bauman, Founder and CEO of Craze, will join Surkus as a result of the acquisition. Bauman, a live music industry veteran and serial entertainment entrepreneur, will directly oversee the strategy and expansion of merging Surkus' innovative technology with the Craze business model of filling client venues to full capacity each and every event.\n\"Tackling the problem of distressed or unsold ticket inventory at entertainment events is an age-old problem and has baffled event promoters since the dawn of entertainment,\" Bauman explains. \"Consumer-focused technologies have finally reached a pivotal moment in the evolution to both solve and revolutionize the live entertainment marketplace by pairing consumers with the entertainment they love or could fall in love with â€” all while maximizing profitability for venues hosting these once in a lifetime experiences. This merger of Craze with Surkus is going to change how people experience and discover live entertainment forever and ever.\"\nCraze, which was founded in 2014, has accumulated over 300,000 members since its inception and has distributed tens of thousands of free or corporate sponsored tickets to premium live music, comedy, and sporting events across the United States. These free tickets are many times distributed to members just hours before a particular event and are claimed on a first come, first serve basis.\n\"It's like Christmas morning in your inbox,\" Bauman states, referring to the Craze member experience of getting free tickets to attend concerts featuring the industry's top artists such as Eli Young Band, Snoop Dogg, 311, The Misfits, Jake Owen and Bone Thugs N' Harmony, among thousands of others.\nSurkus is no stranger to the excitement people feel when given access to popular events in their area, having matched hundreds of thousands of its members to exclusive and ticketed events for free. What makes the West Coast company so unique is its technology, which ensures its members are not only invited to the kind of events they are interested in, but that those events are both geographically desirable and accessible. Surkus' technology utilizes hundreds of data points and geo-targeting to perfectly match its members to the events on its platform.\nOf the highly-anticipated acquisition, Surkus CEO Stephen George states, \"This acquisition solidifies our commitment to the live events industry. As our members' interest in access to all types of experiences grow, we feel Craze has cracked the code on targeting and activating music fans to discover new shows around the US.\"\nIn addition to concerts, Surkus offers its members access to a host of other events, including VIP brand launches, classes, acting gigs, comedy shows, restaurant openings and more. As a brand partner, Surkus offers its clients access to a hyper-targeted community of engaged users.
