    "text": "GAHANNA, Ohio, Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heartland BancCorp (“the company,” and “the bank”) (OTCQB:HLAN), today reported that following a one-time write-down of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in an additional tax expense of $541,000, or $0.29 per diluted share, net income was $2.1 million, or $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares with net income of $2.8 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, in the preceding quarter and $2.2 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year 2017, Heartland’s net income increased 11.1% to $8.9 million, or $5.43 per diluted share, compared to $8.0 million, or $4.97 per diluted share, in 2016.\nThe company also announced its board of directors increased its regular quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.4731 per share. The dividend will be payable April 10, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 25, 2018, providing a 2.07% current yield at recent market prices.\n“Our 2017 operations remain solid, with strong net interest income and other revenues contributing to record pre-tax earnings for the year,” stated G. Scott McComb, Chairman, President and CEO. “While our fourth quarter earnings were impacted by the write-down of our net deferred tax assets following the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the tax legislation is expected to have a positive impact on our earnings in future years, lowering our effective tax rate from 28% to 18%. This tax savings will help offset our investments in technology, employee benefits, continued organic expansion and other corporate strategies which we have been successfully executing.”\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted December 22, 2017, the company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. Based on its preliminary analysis, Heartland recorded a one-time net tax charge of $541,000, or $0.29 per share. Of this total, $498,000 is related to the write-down of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the remaining $43,000 is related to the market value adjustment on bonds held as available-for-sale. This increase in income tax expense was reflected in Heartland’s operating results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was in addition to the normal provision for income tax related to pre-tax net operating income.\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights (at or for the period ended December 31, 2017)\nNet income was $2.1 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, in 4Q17. Pre-tax income increased 17.7% to $3.6 million, compared to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest margin was 4.03% compared to 4.05% in the preceding quarter and 3.99% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Annualized return on average assets was 0.93%. Annualized return on average equity was 10.68%. Total assets increased 15.2% to $900.1 million, compared to $781.3 million a year earlier. Total deposits increased 16.9% to $776.8 million from a year ago. Net loans increased 13.9% to $703.5 million from a year ago. Tangible book value per share increased 8.2% to $48.51 per share compared to $44.83 per share one year earlier. Declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.4731 per share, which represents a 2.29% yield based on the December 31, 2017, stock price ($82.60).\nBalance Sheet Review\n“Strong loan growth continued in the fourth quarter resulting in another quarter of double digit year-over-year loan growth, with the largest increase generated in the commercial real estate loan category,” said McComb. Net loans increased 13.9% to $703.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $617.9 million at December 31, 2016 and increased 3.3% compared to $681.4 million at September 30, 2017.\nHeartland’s total deposits increased 16.9% to $776.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $664.7 million a year earlier and increased 1.5% compared to $765.0 million three months earlier. Demand deposit accounts represented 25.1%; savings, NOW and money market accounts represented 37.8%; and CDs comprised 37.1% of the total deposit portfolio, at December 31, 2017.\nAssets increased 15.2% to $900.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $781.3 million a year earlier and shareholders’ equity increased 10.0% to $78.6 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $71.4 million one year ago. At year end, Heartland’s tangible book value increased 8.2% to $48.51 per share compared to $44.83 per share one year earlier.\nOperating Results\nHeartland’s net interest income before the provision for loan loss increased 14.6% to $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $7.3 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, and increased 3.6% compared to $8.1 million in the preceding quarter. For the full year, net interest income before the provision for loan loss increased 11.8% to $31.0 million, compared to $27.8 million in 2016.\n“While the net interest margin contracted two basis points compared to the preceding quarter, it expanded four basis points compared to the year ago quarter, largely due to improved yields on loans,” said McComb. Heartland’s net interest margin was 4.03% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.05% in the preceding quarter and 3.99% in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year, the net interest margin improved six basis points to 4.00% compared to 3.94% in 2016.\nTotal revenues (net interest income before the provision for loan losses, plus non-interest income) increased 16.5% to $9.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $8.2 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, and increased modestly compared to $9.4 million in the preceding quarter. For the year, total revenues increased 14.0% to $35.7 million, compared to $31.3 million in 2016.\nNoninterest income increased 31.8% to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $876,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago. Noninterest income was $1.4 million in the preceding quarter, which included $300,000 in proceeds from a gain on redemption of life insurance. For the year 2017, noninterest income increased 31.0% to $4.7 million, compared to $3.6 million for 2016.\nHeartland’s fourth quarter noninterest expenses were $5.7 million, compared to $5.4 million in the preceding quarter and $5.0 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the year, noninterest expenses were $21.6 million compared to $19.5 million in 2016. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 59.86%, compared to 57.35% for the preceding quarter and 61.27% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCredit Quality\nNonaccrual loans decreased 56.1% to $1.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $4.2 million a year earlier and decreased 42.3% compared to $3.2 million three months earlier. There were no loans past due 90 days and still accruing at December 31, 2017, compared to $753,000 at the end of the preceding quarter and none a year ago.\nPerforming restructured loans that were not included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018 were $1.7 million, compared to $1.8 million in the preceding quarter. Borrowers who are in financial difficulty and who have been granted concessions that may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, or payment alterations are categorized as restructured loans.\nThere was $40,000 in other real estate owned (OREO) and other non-performing assets on the books at December 31, 2017, compared to $400,000 a year ago.\nNonperforming assets (NPAs), consisting of nonperforming loans, OREO, and loans delinquent 90 days or more, decreased 52.3% to $1.9 million, or 0.21% of assets, at December 31, 2017, compared to $4.0 million, or 0.45% of assets, three months earlier, and decreased 59.1% compared to $4.6 million, or 0.59% of assets, a year ago.\nHeartland’s fourth quarter provision for loan losses was $255,000, the same as in the preceding quarter. This compares to $135,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago. The allowance for loan losses was $6.2 million, or 0.88% of total loans at December 31, 2017, compared to $6.4 million, or 1.00% of total loans at September 30, 2017, and $5.7 million, or 0.91% of total loans a year ago. As of December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses represented 336.5% of nonaccrual loans compared to 199.3% three months earlier, and 135.2% one year earlier. Net charge-offs were $377,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to $107,000 in the preceding quarter and $304,000 in the fourth quarter a year ago.\nAbout Heartland BancCorp\nHeartland BancCorp is a registered Ohio bank holding company and the parent of Heartland Bank, which operates fourteen full-service banking offices.
