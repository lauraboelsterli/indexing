    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French state-controlled utility EDF said on Monday that it was totally focused on the safety of its nuclear reactors, in response to a weekend newspaper article and yet-to-be-published book that is expected to reveal safety lapses.\nThe company said most of the elements in the article were known already and have been flagged to France’s ASN nuclear watchdog and the public in general.\n“EDF wants to reiterate that nuclear safety is its top priority,” the company said in a statement.\nIt added that the French nuclear industry was the most controlled in the world and that EDF fully complied with all requirements from the ASN, which carries over 400 on-site inspections every year.\nReporting by Bate FelixEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
