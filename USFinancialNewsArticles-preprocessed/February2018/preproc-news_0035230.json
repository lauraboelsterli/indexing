    "text": " 38 PM / Updated 28 minutes ago UK judge allows parties in Nornickel case to delay hearing to March Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - A London court judge, Stephen Phillips, said on Friday he would allow parties involved in the case related to Russiaâ€™s Norilsk Nickel ( GMKN.MM ) (Nornickel) to delay the injunction hearing until the week beginning March 5. Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin offered to buy a stake in Nornickel from Roman Abramovich. Rusal ( 0486.HK ), which also owns a stake in Nornickel and is controlled by businessman Oleg Deripaska, is seeking this injunction in order to block the deal.
