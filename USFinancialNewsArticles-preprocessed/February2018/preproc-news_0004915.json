    "text": "Otto Porter Jr. led five players in double figures with 20 points, and the Washington Wizards ran by the host Orlando Magic 115-98 at Amway Center on Saturday night.\nWashington matched a season high with its fourth straight win despite playing without the injured John Wall.\nTomas Satoransky, who has started in place of Wall, hit 7 of 9 from the field and had a career-high 19 points. Bradley Beal finished with 18 points and eight of his team’s 35 assists, while Markieff Morris scored 16 points for the Wizards.\nWashington center Marcin Gortat had a big game at both ends of the floor, finishing with 10 points and 11 rebounds.\nThe struggling Magic fell short of winning consecutive games for the first time since Nov. 10-11. Jonathon Simmons scored 15 points and Elfrid Payton added 14 for the Magic, who struggled with 20 turnovers.\nThe Wizards are 17-2 in their last 19 games against the Magic. Washington was 46-of-85 from the field (54.1 percent) and made seven shots from beyond the arc.\nThe Wizards led by nine at the break and continued to pull away in the third quarter. A jumper by Satoransky provided a 69-54 margin with 8:55 left in the third.\nJodie Meeks made a long jumper that increased Washington’s lead to 93-73 with 9:52 left in the game. The Magic struggled to make shots the rest of the way. Marreese Speights finally managed a 3-pointer with 2:55 left, but Orlando still trailed 111-91.\nOrlando forward Aaron Gordon has been dealing with a hip flexor and did not play for the third straight game. Speights once again started in his place and finished with 10 points.\nWashington got off to a quick start and led 25-15 on a layup by Gortat with 3:29 left in the first quarter. Beal made a jumper in the final seconds, the Wizards shot 60 percent and maintained a 31-25 lead heading into the second quarter.\nThe Wizards continued to stay in control and led 56-47 at the break and never trailed again.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
