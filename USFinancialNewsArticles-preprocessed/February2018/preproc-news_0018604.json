    "text": "HELSINKI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The Finnish government’s investment arm Solidium said on Wednesday it would sell its 3.2 percent stake in Swedish telecoms company Telia to institutional investors.\nSolidium said it would sell 137.124 million shares. That would value the offer at about 523 million euros ($642 million), based on Telia’s closing price on Wednesday.\nSolidium, which mainly holds stakes in listed Finnish companies that are considered nationally important, said it expected to announce the outcome of the offering on Thursday.
