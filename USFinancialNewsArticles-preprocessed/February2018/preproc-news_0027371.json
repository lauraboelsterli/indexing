    "text": "HAMBURG, Feb 12 (Reuters) - German grain trading house Mackprang has applied for insolvency proceedings, its chief executive said on Monday.\nWork will continue while a provisional administrator holds talks with creditors, said chief executive Jens Kass.\nThe company and its shareholders had been unable to reach agreement on financing with banks, he said.\nThe Hamburg-based company was founded 139 years ago and is involved in trading of milling and feed grains, malting barley, and feed meals such as rapeseed meal and soymeal, the company’s website says.\nThe company’s main shareholder is German trading house Bohnhorst.
