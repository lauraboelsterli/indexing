    "text": "ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stellar Acquisition III, Inc. (“Stellar”) (NASDAQ:STLR) announced today that it has entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to combine with Phunware, Inc. (“Phunware”). The transaction values Phunware at an enterprise value of $301 million, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with the transaction consideration to be paid in newly issued equity securities of Stellar.\nThe transaction with Phunware enables Stellar to enter two of the most innovative and rapidly growing sectors within the technology space: mobile cloud software and blockchain. Phunware’s mobile application lifecycle management platform delivers mobile marketing automation, analytics and business intelligence, alerts, notifications and messaging, content management, location-based services, audience engagement, audience monetization, vertical solutions, big data and cryptonetworking. The platform processes over 4 billion events per day, totaling over 1.4 trillion events per year. This amounts to petabytes of actionable data across thousands of mobile application portfolios. Currently, Phunware receives revenue from a large and diversified customer base that includes numerous Fortune 5000 companies in both Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) via recurring revenue streams and transactional formats.\nPhunware intends to initiate within the 1 st half of 2018 a Token Generation Event (“TGE”) based on its “PhunCoin™” cryptonetworking ecosystem.\nPhunware was established in February 2009, and has grown rapidly to date through acquisitions and venture capital offerings to strategic investors and partners. The company today has notable investors such as Wavemaker Partners (Draper Network Fund), Fraser McCombs Ventures, Maxima Ventures, Samsung, Cisco Investments, World Wrestling Entertainment, PLDT Capital, Central Texas Angel Network (CTAN), Baylor Angel Network (BAN) and others. We believe that having strategic partners with aligned interests is important in the achievement of common goals.\nFollowing the closing, the common stock and warrants of the combined entity are expected to trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the name Phunware, Inc. and trading symbols “PHUN” and “PHUNW”, respectively. The combined company will be led by Mr. Alan S. Knitowski, who will continue as Phunware’s Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Matthew Aune, who will continue as Phunware’s Chief Financial Officer. As part of the transaction, the combined company will redomesticate from the Marshall Islands (Stellar’s jurisdiction of formation) to Delaware.\nManagement Commentary\nMr. Alan S.

Merging with Stellar will enable us to scale that foundation through organic and inorganic growth, including the PhunCoin Token Generation Event. We are extremely proud of this important milestone and are excited for the future.”\nMr. Matt Aune , CFO of Phunware, added, “Since Phunware’s founding in 2009, we have seen dramatic growth both financially and as a platform.
