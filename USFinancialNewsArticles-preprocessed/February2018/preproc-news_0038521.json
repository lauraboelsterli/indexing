    "text": "Several \"copycat\" threats have been made at other schools in the communities surrounding Parkland, Florida , authorities said on Thursday, following a mass shooting at a high school that left 17 dead.\nAt a press conference, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters that law enforcement would classify copycat attempts or pranks as real threats requiring serious investigation by the Sheriff's office. Threats that aim to use up resources or make light of the situation will not be tolerated.\n\"We will investigate this and charge anyone accordingly with the maximum charge we possibly could, for doing something so horrific, so pathetic,\" said Israel.\nOn Wednesday, a shooting at Parkland High School left 17 dead and others wounded. The shooter, a 19-year old former Parkland student named Nikolas Cruz, is currently in custody and will appear in court on Thursday afternoon.",
