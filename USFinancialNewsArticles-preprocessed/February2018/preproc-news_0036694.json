    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MRC Global Inc. (NYSE: MRC), the largest global distributor, based on sales, of pipe, valves and fittings and related products and services to the energy industry, today announced fourth quarter 2017 results.\nThe company's sales were $903 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was 26% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016 and 6% lower than the third quarter of 2017 due to seasonality. As compared to 2016, all sectors increased driven primarily by midstream and upstream.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, which includes the impact of tax reform, as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $(24) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share. The results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include a provisional tax benefit of $50 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, related to the accounting for United States tax reform legislation. The fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 results include after-tax charges for severance and restructuring of $14 million, or $0.15 per diluted share and $7 million or $0.07 per diluted share, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2017 also includes after-tax charges of $6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the write off of inventory in the international segment related to reducing our local presence in Iraq.\n\"Fourth quarter results came in where we anticipated, sales were down 6% sequentially due to seasonality primarily in the midstream business and up 26% over the same quarter a year ago as a result of market improvements and solid execution, which resulted in Adjusted EBITDA of $43 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, during the quarter we repurchased $50 million of common stock at an average price of $15.57 under our $100 million share repurchase authorization,\" Andrew R. Lane, MRC Global's president and chief executive officer stated.\n\"Revenue grew 20% in 2017 over 2016, driven by our North American midstream and upstream sectors as the industry recovered from the downturn of 2015 and 2016. We continued to defend and gain market share including signing multi-year framework agreements with three integrated oil companies and we are well positioned for double digit revenue growth in 2018 with our customer contract positions in the improving oil and gas market. Because we are a U.S. tax payer, the U.S. tax reform legislation reducing the corporate tax rate has benefited our financial results in 2017. The lower rate is expected to provide earnings and cash flow benefits in 2018. However, our capital allocation plans have not changed. We intend to invest in the business for growth and return cash to shareholders as we continue to execute our share repurchase authorization,\" Mr. Lane added.\nMRC Global's fourth quarter 2017 gross profit was $141 million, or 15.6% of sales, an increase from fourth quarter 2016 gross profit of $122 million, or 17.0% of sales. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $6 million of non-cash inventory charges recorded in cost of sales. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 reflects an expense of $9 million and a benefit of $7 million, respectively, in cost of sales relating to the use of the last-in, first out (LIFO) method of inventory cost accounting.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $148 million, or 16.4% of sales, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $128 million, or 17.8% of sales, for the same period of 2016. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 include $14 million and $8 million of pre-tax severance and restructuring charges, respectively.\nAs a result of United States tax reform legislation signed into law in December 2017 which, among other things, lowered the federal tax rate for corporations to 21% from 35%, the company recorded a provisional income tax benefit of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. This benefit reflects the re-measurement of the company's net deferred tax liabilities to the new lower tax rate which was partially offset by the one-time transition tax on certain tax deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17 million for the same period in 2016. Please refer to the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to net income (loss) (a GAAP measure) in this release.\nSales by Segment\nU.S. sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $715 million, up $165 million, or 30%, from the same quarter in 2016. The increase was across all sectors. Increased well completions, midstream transmission and gathering deliveries and downstream project deliveries all drove the increase.\nCanadian sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $71 million, up $16 million, or 29%, from the same quarter in 2016 primarily due to the upstream business as a result of an increase in commodity prices which drove an increase in activity levels. Canadian sales were favorably impacted by $3 million as a result of a stronger Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\nInternational sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $117 million, up $3 million, or 3%, from the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the upstream sector partially offset by a decline in the downstream sector. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted sales by $6 million.\nSales by Sector\nUpstream sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 27% over the fourth quarter of 2016 to $277 million, or 31% of total sales. The increase in upstream sales was across all segments, led by our U.S. segment, which was up $35 million followed by our Canadian and International segments, which were each up $12 million as a result of increased customer activity.\nMidstream sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 40% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $375 million, or 41% of total sales. Sales to transmission and gathering customers were up 73% while sales to gas utility customers were up by 12% over the same quarter in 2016.\nDownstream sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 8% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to $251 million, or 28% of total sales. The U.S. downstream sector was the primary driver of the increase growing $26 million, or 16%, over the fourth quarter of last year.\nBalance Sheet\nCash balances were $48 million at December 31, 2017. Debt, net of cash, was $478 million as of December 31, 2017 and availability under our asset based lending facility was $437 million. Cash used in operations was $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, commensurate with expected growth of the business in 2018.\nShare Repurchase Program Update\nIn October 2017, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for common stock of up to $100 million. During the fourth quarter, the company purchased $50 million of its common stock at an average price of $15.57 per share. The outstanding share count as of December 31, 2017 is 91.3 million shares.\nThe shares may be repurchased at management's discretion in the open market. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. The program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time) on February 16, 2018.

Charges in 2017, recorded in the international segment, are related to reducing our local presence in Iraq. Charges in 2016, recorded in the international segment, are related to a restructuring of our Australian business and market conditions in Iraq as well as an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in the U.S. and Canada as a result of the market outlook for certain products.\n(2)\nRecorded in SG&A\n(3)\nCharge (pre-tax) related to employee severance and restructuring charges associated with actions taken in 2017 to improve profitability in our international segment and cost reduction initiatives related to the weak market conditions in 2016, recorded in SG&A\n(4)\nCharge (pre-tax) related to refinancing of our senior secured term loan and our asset based lending facility in 2017.\n(5)\nCharge (pre-tax) related to the settlement of litigation with Weatherford Canada Partnership in the second quarter 2017 recorded in Other, net. The company previously recognized a charge of $3 million associated with this matter in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles, and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of its LIFO inventory costing methodology. The company presents Adjusted EBITDA because the company believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator of the company's operating performance. Among other things, Adjusted EBITDA measures the company's operating performance without regard to certain non-recurring, non-cash or transaction-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA, however, does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA does not account for certain expenses, its utility as a measure of the company's operating performance has material limitations. Because of these limitations, the company does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a primary performance measure and also uses other measures, such as net income and sales, to measure operating performance. See the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for a more thorough discussion of the use of Adjusted EBITDA.\nMRC Global Inc.\nSupplemental Information (Unaudited)\nReconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP measure) to Gross Profit\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2017\nof Revenue\n2016\nof Revenue\nGross profit, as reported\n$\n141\n(1)\n15.6%\n$\n122\n17.0%\nDepreciation and amortization\n6\n0.7%\n6\n0.8%\nAmortization of intangibles\n11\n1.2%\n12\n1.7%\nIncrease (decrease) in LIFO reserve\n9\n1.0%\n(7)\n(1.0%)\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$\n167\n(1)\n18.5%\n$\n133\n18.5%\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\nDecember 31,\nPercentage\n2017\nof Revenue\n2016\nof Revenue\nGross profit, as reported\n$\n582\n(1)\n16.0%\n$\n468\n(1)\n15.4%\nDepreciation and amortization\n22\n0.6%\n22\n0.7%\nAmortization of intangibles\n45\n1.2%\n47\n1.6%\nIncrease (decrease) in LIFO reserve\n28\n0.8%\n(14)\n(0.5%)\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n$\n677\n(1)\n18.6%\n$\n523\n(1)\n17.2%\nNotes to above:\n(1)\nIncludes $6 million of non-cash charges (pre-tax) recorded in cost of goods sold for each of the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 as well as $45 million of non-cash charges (pre-tax) recorded in cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2016. Charges in 2017, recorded in the international segment, are related to reducing our local presence in Iraq. Charges in 2016, recorded in the international segment, are related to a restructuring of our Australian business and market conditions in Iraq as well as an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in the U.S. and Canada as a result of the market outlook for certain products.\nExcluding these charges for the three months ended December 31, 2017 gross profit, as reported would be $147 million (16.3%) and adjusted gross profit would be $173 million (19.2%). Excluding these charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 gross profit, as reported would be $588 million (16.1%) and adjusted gross profit would be $683 million (18.7%). Excluding these charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 gross profit, as reported would be $513 million (16.9%) and adjusted gross profit would be $568 million (18.7%).\nThe company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of its LIFO inventory costing methodology. The company presents Adjusted Gross Profit because the company believes it is a useful indicator of the company's operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions of which they have been involved. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. The company uses Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing its business. The company believes that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.\nMRC Global Inc.\nSupplemental Sales Information (Unaudited)\n(in millions)\nSales by Segment\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nU.S.\n$\n715\n$\n550\n$\n2,860\n$\n2,297\nCanada\n71\n55\n294\n243\nInternational\n117\n114\n492\n501\n$\n903\n$\n719\n$\n3,646\n$\n3,041\nSales by Product Line\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nType\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nLine pipe\n$\n168\n$\n99\n$\n685\n$\n444\nCarbon steel fittings and flanges\n143\n107\n548\n460\nTotal carbon steel pipe, fittings and flanges\n311\n206\n1,233\n904\nValves, automation, measurement and instrumentation\n332\n267\n1,319\n1,161\nGas products\n127\n111\n554\n443\nStainless steel alloy pipe and fittings\n47\n51\n183\n206\nOther\n86\n84\n357\n327\n$\n903\n$\n719\n$\n3,646\n$\n3,041\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mrc-global-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300599755.html\nSOURCE MRC Global Inc.",
