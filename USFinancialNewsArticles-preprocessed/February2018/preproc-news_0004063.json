    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 5:59 PM / Updated an hour ago From sewing machine to silver screen: meet the amateurs who acted with Day-Lewis Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Living thousands of miles from Hollywood and lacking any acting experience, Susan Clark and Joan Brown seemed unlikely candidates to land roles opposite Daniel Day-Lewis. \nBut, experts with a needle and thread, Brown, 74, and Clark, 67, have speaking roles in “Phantom Thread,” in which the triple Oscar winner Day-Lewis plays a couturier. \nThe film is set in a fashion house in 1950s London, a world the pair experienced, Brown as a ladies’ seamstress and Clark a dressmaking teacher. \nThe pair’s involvement in the film began when they were consulted for their fashion expertise - in their capacity as specialist sewing volunteers at London’s V&A Museum, but did not initially realise who they were dealing with. \n“I was talking to this very nice gentleman about one of the pieces of costume that they’ve got out and I looked down at his security pass and it said ‘Daniel Day-Lewis’ and I looked up into his face and I thought - oh, it is, isn’t it?” Clark said.

My passport is out of date at the moment,” Clark said. Reporting by Ania Poullain; Writing by Mark Hanrahan; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",
