    "text": "DELAND, Fla., Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARC Group Worldwide, Inc. (“ARC” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ARCW), a leading global provider of advanced manufacturing and metal 3D printing solutions, today reported its results for the period ending December 31, 2017, its fiscal second quarter 2018.\nQuarterly Financial Summary\nFiscal second quarter 2018 revenue from continuing operations was $18.4 million, compared to $27.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower metal injection molding (“MIM”) and plastics sales, the combination of reduced sales and delayed orders by customers in the firearm and defense markets. The Company’s international performance continues to improve, however, as revenues from Hungarian operations increased 16.6% year-over-year to $2.3 million. Finally, the Company’s 3DMT business unit reported record quarterly revenue of $0.9 million, a 63.1% increase over the comparable prior year period.\nLower production volumes and planned, targeted inventory reduction initiatives impacted the Company’s operational efficiency during the quarter, as gross profit from continuing operations was $(0.4) million, compared to $4.5 million for the prior year period. More specifically, as part of the Company’s plan to reduce inventory levels in order to improve cash flow and match current market conditions, the Company reduced selected inventory by $0.7 million within certain business units comprising the Precision Components Group. This reduction in inventory resulted in a corresponding similar increase in expense recognition, negatively impacting gross profit by $0.7 million in the quarter, or 16.2% of the overall decrease in gross margin. Further, the inventory initiatives also resulted in a significant reduction in production hours at associated facilities during the quarter, which further affected financial performance due to a reduction in ongoing cost absorption.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter 2018 declined to $3.6 million, a decrease from $4.7 million in the prior year period. Expense reductions were primarily attributable to the Company’s ongoing cost review and elimination initiatives.\nNet loss from continuing operations for the fiscal second quarter 2018 was $4.3 million, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $0.4 million for the prior year period.\nARC’s interim CEO, Drew M. Kelley, commented, “Management remains focused on returning the Company to profitability and improving cash flow generation by driving existing product revenue, increasing operational efficiency, and rightsizing the balance sheet. Overall, the quarterly results, while not indicative of the Company’s operating potential, do reflect progress towards our planned turnaround. Notably, during the quarter we refocused our sales approach and realigned our internal sales resources accordingly. While we expect the Company’s top line outlook to stabilize and begin to improve during the balance of our fiscal year, these changes were designed to better align our engineering and technical sales capabilities in order to drive incremental revenue from existing customers and on existing production parts. Similarly, while we are encouraged by the recent improving outlook for many customers in the firearms sector, we reallocated our sales resources to drive growth in other key markets, specifically the medical and aerospace industries – two key areas of growth for both our 3DMT and MIM businesses. Overall, given our recent cost reduction initiatives, we expect flow through from increased sales to impact the bottom-line with greater efficiency going forward as revenue returns to normalized levels.”\nMr. Kelley continued, “Having completed many of our initial strategic objectives during the prior quarters, including the elimination of more than $9.2 million in annual costs, driving working capital improvement, and divesting non-core businesses, one of our primary initiatives during the recent quarter was to reduce inventory levels in certain businesses to more sustainable levels based on current market demand. While these targeted reductions were detrimental to our financial results during the quarter, they were necessary in order to properly position the Company for greater operational and financial efficiency going forward. While we expect some inventory reductions to continue into the second half of fiscal year 2018, the financial impact should lessen, as several facilities have already begun to ramp up production given increased customer demand and a growing new product sales pipeline. Overall, as a product of these cost cutting and inventory reductions initiatives, we expect profitability and cash flow generation to improve throughout calendar year 2018.”\n“Finally, the Company recently announced a $10.0 million fully-committed, rights offering. We believe this investment by key shareholders demonstrates the Company’s overall intrinsic value and progress towards operational stability and growth.”\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nThe Company has provided non-GAAP financial information to provide additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe are representative or indicative of its results of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, EBITDA from Continuing Operations, EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations, Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations, Facility EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations, Adjusted Earnings, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations and Facility EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations are calculated by dividing EBITDA from Continuing Operations and Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations, respectively, by sales.\nThe reconciliation to GAAP is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDecember 31, January 1, For the three months ended: 2017 2017 Net Loss $ (4,322 ) $ (710 ) Interest Expense, Net 927 1,030 Income Taxes (366 ) 30 Depreciation and Amortization 2,534 2,498 Adjustment to Exclude Loss from Discontinued Operations 6 331 EBITDA from Continuing Operations $ (1,221 ) $ 3,179 EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations (6.7 )% 11.8 % Corporate Expenses 1,073 158 Facility EBITDA from Continuing Operations $ (148 ) $ 3,337 Facility EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations (0.8 )% 12.4 % Net Loss $ (4,322 ) $ (710 ) Adjustment to Exclude Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 6 331 Reorganization/Transaction Expenses 86 29 Adjusted Earnings $ (4,230 ) $ (350 ) Adjusted Earnings Per Share $ (0.23 ) $ (0.02 ) Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 18,265,323 18,123,883 EBITDA from Continuing Operations excludes interest expense, net and income taxes as these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures. EBITDA from Continuing Operations also excludes depreciation and amortization expense as these non-cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions, which may not be indicative of future capital expenditure requirements. EBITDA from Continuing Operations excludes the (income) or loss associated with discontinued operations.\nFacility EBITDA from Continuing Operations consists of EBITDA from our operating segments, which excludes Corporate Expenses. We believe this is a meaningful measurement of the operating performance of our manufacturing facilities. Corporate Expenses primarily consist of costs not allocated to our manufacturing facilities, such as compensation related costs for employees assigned to corporate, board of directors fees and expenses, professional fees, insurance costs, and marketing costs.\nAdjusted Earnings removes the impact of reorganization/transaction related expenses and the impact of discontinued operations. Reorganization expenses are primarily labor and labor related costs associated with the termination of employees. Transaction expenses are primarily professional fees related to the refinancing of debt and the sale of non-core assets.\nAbout ARC Group Worldwide, Inc.\nARC Group Worldwide, Inc. is a global advanced manufacturing and metal 3D printing service provider focused on accelerating speed to market for its customers.
