    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee said on Monday he spent his year in jail on “precious” self-reflection and promised to show a better side in future, after a high court suspended his jail sentence in a corruption scandal and set him free.\n“Again, I feel sorry to everyone for not showing my best side. And it has been a really precious time for a year reflecting on myself,” Lee told reporters at a detention centre.\nReporting by Haejin Choi, Writing by Ju-min Park; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
