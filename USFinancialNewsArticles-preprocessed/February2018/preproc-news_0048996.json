    "text": " 43 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Rwandan police fire teargas to disperse Congolese refugees protesting food rations cuts Reuters Staff 1 Min Read KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwandan police fired tear gas on Thursday to disperse at least 3,000 Congolese refugees who had been protesting for two days at a United Nations refugee office in western Rwanda against a reduction in food rations at their camp, witnesses said. “The situation here is bad. They are firing the tear gas,” Pastor Kamanzi, 50, told Reuters from the town of Karongi. The refugees had left their camp in Kiziba, some 15 km from Karongi, to protest against a 25 percent cut implemented last month in rations provided by the U.N. refugee agency.
