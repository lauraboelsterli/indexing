    "text": "PRISTINA (Reuters) - Suspected Balkan crime boss Naser Kelmendi was sentenced to six years in prison in Kosovo on Thursday for trafficking drugs, but cleared of murder, organized crime and other charges.\nThe Kosovo-born ethnic Albanian with Bosnian citizenship was blacklisted in 2012 by U.S. authorities, who have accused him of heading a family network distributing heroin and other drugs through Afghanistan to Turkey and into Europe.\nHe was arrested a year later in Kosovo on a warrant issued by Bosnia, where prosecutors accused him of a string of crimes in their territory.\nBut he stayed in Kosovo, as the two countries do not have an extradition agreement. His case was handled by judges from an EU mission, who take cases seen as too sensitive for the local judiciary.\nThe 61-year-old was convicted of drug trafficking but acquitted on eight other counts including participating in organized crime and aggravated murder.\nOrganized crime flourished in the Balkans during the ethnic wars that followed Yugoslaviaâ€™s break-up in the 1990s, leaving the region awash with weapons and a transit route for drug traffickers.\nBosnia prosecutors had accused him of involvement in the 2007 killing of Ramiz Delalic, a Bosnian Muslim warlord who switched to organized crime after the wars in the Balkans.\nHe denied all the charges, which also included the possession, distribution and sale of drugs.\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but Bosnia has not recognized it because of resistance from its Serb-dominated autonomous region, which comprises a half of the country and wants to show solidarity with Serbia.\nReporting by Fatos Bytyci; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ",
