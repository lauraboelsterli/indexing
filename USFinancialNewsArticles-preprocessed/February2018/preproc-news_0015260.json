    "text": "ATLANTA and SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVIR) and Vaxart, Inc. today announced that the companies have agreed to amend the terms of their previously announced merger agreement to increase the proposed ownership percentage of Aviragen stockholders of the combined company. Under the new terms, Aviragen stockholders would now own 49% of the combined company, up from 40% under the previous agreement. This nine percentage point improvement from 40% in the original agreement represents a 22.5% increase in the ownership stake that Aviragen stockholders will have in the combined company.\nThe amended agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. The Aviragen Board recommends that Aviragen stockholders vote FOR the merger at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on February 9, 2018. If stockholders have already voted FOR the merger, there is no need to vote again. If stockholders have not yet voted, they are encouraged to vote FOR the merger. If stockholders have voted AGAINST the merger, they may change their vote and vote FOR the merger. All votes must be received before 11:59 pm EST on February 8, 2018.\nWouter Latour, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vaxart, Inc., said, “The amended terms reflect our commitment to completing the transaction with Aviragen. Our Board and management believe in the strategic value of the merger and we look forward to creating meaningful value for all stockholders.”\nJoseph M. Patti, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aviragen Therapeutics, said, “Aviragen’s Board and management team have been focused on achieving the best possible outcome from our strategic review process. In working closely with one of our main stockholders to maximize the value of the proposed transaction, we have amended the merger agreement to underscore this commitment. Aviragen stockholders will now have a 22.5% increase in their ownership stake and a greater share of the upside potential of the combined company.”\nAviragen Special Meeting of Stockholders\nAviragen intends to reconvene its Special Meeting of Stockholders to vote on the proposed merger on February 9, 2018 at 12:00 pm EST. Should Aviragen stockholders vote to approve the proposed merger, Aviragen and Vaxart intend to close the transaction shortly thereafter.\nAviragen Stockholders are Encouraged to Vote FOR the Transaction Today\nAviragen’s Board strongly urges stockholders to vote FOR the proposed merger today. Each vote is extremely important, no matter how many or how few shares are owned. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Aviragen common stock properly cast at the Aviragen Special Meeting is required to approve the proposed merger. Please take a moment to vote FOR the proposals necessary to approve the proposed merger today – by telephone, by Internet or by signing, dating and returning the WHITE proxy card.
