    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cinedigm Corp (NASDAQ:CIDM) has acquired all North American distribution rights to the offbeat high school comedy CLASS RANK, directed by Eric Stoltz. Cinedigm will release the picture theatrically and on Digital and TV VOD on May 11, 2018, with a DVD Release to follow in June 2018, and an SVOD premiere later in 2018.\nRising stars, Olivia Holt (Disney’s XD’s KICKIN’ IT), who will be seen next in the upcoming Freeform series, Marvel’s CLOAK AND DAGGER, and Skyler Gisondo (Netflix’s SANTA CLARITA DIET, VACATION), topline the picture. Kristin Chenoweth (THE BOY NEXT DOOR, GLEE) and two-time Academy Award nominee Bruce Dern (NEBRASKA, HICKOK) round out the cast.\nShaun Sanghani produced and financed the film via his company SSS Entertainment producing alongside with Sandy Stern of Single Cell Pictures. Written by Benjamin August, the picture is helmed by actor-turned-director, Eric Stoltz (MASK, PULP FICTION), currently an Executive Producer on CBS’ MADAME SECRETARY.\nIn CLASS RANK, two high school outsiders, Veronica (Holt), a type-A personality with Ivy League aspirations and Bernard (Gisondo), a quirky nerd, join forces to overtake the local school board and eliminate the class-ranking system. Guided by their families, the two enter the perilous world of local politics and, in the process, learn a thing or two about love.\nCLASS RANK won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2017 Maui Film Festival, while Holt won Best Acting awards for her performance at both the 2017 Napa Valley Film Festival and Newport Beach Film Festival.\n“CLASS RANK is a smart, funny and warm-hearted picture that carries an empowering message for young people to speak up and not be afraid to challenge the status quo,” said Yolanda Macias, Cinedigm’s Executive Vice-President of Acquisitions. “Olivia and Skyler both shine as the young leads, and Eric’s incisive direction perfectly captures both those awkward, hilarious high school moments as well as those first brave steps we take toward finding ourselves and our voices.”\n“We were immediately impressed with Cinedigm’s energy, enthusiasm and distribution strategy for CLASS RANK,” said the film’s producers, Shaun Sanghani and Sandy Stern. “They are collaborative partners who truly support independent filmmaking, and we are excited to partner with them on our picture.\"\nThe deal was negotiated by Melody Fowler, Vice-President of Acquisitions for Cinedigm, and Andre Relis, President of VMI Worldwide, on behalf of the filmmakers.\nAbout VMI Worldwide\nVMI Worldwide is one of the leading, intercontinental sales, film finance and production companies based in the heart of the movie making capital of the world, Hollywood, California.
