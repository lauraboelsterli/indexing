    "text": "PASADENA, Calif., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- General Finance Corporation (NASDAQ:GFN), a leading specialty rental services company offering portable storage, modular space and liquid containment solutions in North America and in the Asia-Pacific region of Australia and New Zealand (the “Company”), today announced its consolidated financial results for the second quarter and six months (“YTD”) ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues were $92.1 million, compared to $72.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Leasing revenues comprised 60% of total non-manufacturing revenues versus 64% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Leasing revenues increased by approximately 11%, excluding the oil and gas sector and the favorable foreign currency impact. Adjusted EBITDA was $25.2 million, compared to $17.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, compared to 25% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $2.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. The provision for income taxes was $0.8 million, which included the re-measurement of our estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the federal tax enactment on December 22, 2017 that resulted in an estimated benefit of approximately $6.5 million. This estimated tax benefit was offset by, among other things, approximately $5.2 million for both the estimated transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a valuation allowance that was established to offset previously recognized deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carryforwards that we believe will not be realized. Average fleet unit utilization was 82%, compared to 79% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. Opened one greenfield location in the Asia-Pacific region during the quarter. One acquisition completed in North America during the quarter, adding two locations.\nYTD 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues were $169.0 million, compared to $135.1 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2017. Leasing revenues comprised 63% of total non-manufacturing revenues versus 65% for the first six months of fiscal year 2017. Leasing revenues increased by 10%, excluding the oil and gas sector and the favorable foreign currency impact. Adjusted EBITDA was $42.8 million, compared to $30.7 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25%, compared to 23% for the six months of fiscal year 2017. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $1.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2017. The provision for income taxes was $0.3 million, which included the re-measurement of our estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities, and other matters discussed above, as a result of the federal tax enactment on December 22, 2017. Average fleet unit utilization was 81%, compared to 77% in the first six months of fiscal year 2017. Opened three greenfield locations during the first six months of fiscal year 2017, two in the Asia-Pacific region and one in North America. Completed two acquisitions in North America during the six month period. Funded the successful acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of Royal Wolf.\nManagement Commentary\n\"We are pleased to report very strong performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as demonstrated by our highest quarterly level of revenues and adjusted EBITDA in three years,” said Ronald Valenta, Executive Chairman of the Board. “In North America, our core portable storage business continues to experience growth across all product lines, driven primarily by increasing average lease rates and fleet utilization. With the recovering oil and gas market in Texas, we continue to experience improved results in our liquid containment business, supported by our superior customer service and safety record. Our Asia-Pacific region also delivered its strongest quarterly performance in three years, where higher sales revenues included a large sale of a customized container product in the utilities sector.”\nMr. Jody Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer, added, “The efforts of all of our operating teams, combined with our disciplined and focused strategy over the past few years, have led to these positive results, and I am confident that our strong execution will continue across each of our businesses. Our year-to-date performance gives us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, as we continue to pursue our ongoing strategy of geographic expansion and diversification and lay a solid foundation for fiscal 2019 and beyond.”\nCharles Barrantes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “This quarter’s results mark the fourth quarter in a row where we have delivered year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and we expect that the second half of our current fiscal year will continue to show strong adjusted EBITDA growth over the second half of last fiscal year.”\nSecond Quarter 2018 Operating Summary\nNorth America\nRevenues from our North American leasing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 totaled $51.1 million, compared with $40.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of 26%. Leasing revenues increased by 30% on a year-over-year basis, most notably in the oil and gas, commercial and construction sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared with $10.9 million for the year-ago quarter, an increase of 46%. Adjusted EBITDA from Pac-Van and Lone Star increased by approximately 21% and 250% year-over-year, to $11.7 million and $4.2 million, respectively, from $9.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNorth American manufacturing revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 totaled $3.5 million and included intercompany sales of $1.4 million from products sold to our North American leasing operations. This compares to $1.9 million of total sales, including $0.3 million intercompany revenues during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. On a stand-alone basis, prior to intercompany adjustments, adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million for the quarter, as compared to a loss of $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nAsia-Pacific\nRevenues from the Asia-Pacific region for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 totaled $38.9 million, compared with $30.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of 30%. The increase in revenues was largely driven by two large sales to customers in the utilities and transportation sectors totaling approximately $10.5 million and were accompanied by a favorable foreign currency translation effect between periods. The large sales were partially offset by decreases in the oil and gas and industrial sectors. Leasing revenues were approximately flat on a year-over-year basis, where increases in the construction, mining, industrial and transportation sectors were offset by declines in the oil and gas sector. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2018 was $10.2 million, compared with $8.4 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of over 21%. On a local currency basis, revenues increased by 28% and adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 20%.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity Overview\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had total debt of $440.1 million and cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million, compared with $355.6 million and $7.8 million at June 30, 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2017, our Asia-Pacific leasing operations had $12.2 million (A$15.7 million) available to borrow under its $97.6 million (A$125.0 million) credit facility, and our North American leasing operations had $34.0 million available to borrow under its $237 million credit facility.\nDuring the first six months of fiscal year 2018, the Company generated cash from operating activities of $14.6 million, as compared to $10.9 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2017. For the first six months of fiscal year 2018, the Company invested a net $12.9 million ($11.6 million in North America and $1.3 million in the Asia-Pacific) in the lease fleet, as compared to $15.1 million in net fleet investment ($7.1 million in North America and $8.0 million in the Asia-Pacific) in the first six months of fiscal year 2017.\nReceivables were $54.7 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $44.4 million at June 30, 2017. Days sales outstanding in receivables at December 31, 2017, for our Asia-Pacific and North American leasing operations were 45 and 50 days, as compared to 49 and 46 days, respectively, as of June 30, 2017.\nOutlook\nBased on our year-to-date results and assuming the Australian dollar averages 0.78 versus the U.S. dollar for the remainder of fiscal year 2018, we now expect that consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of $320 million to $330 million and that consolidated adjusted EBITDA will increase by 28% to 34% in fiscal year 2018 from fiscal year 2017. This outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the second half of fiscal year 2018.\nConference Call Details\nManagement will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time (11:30 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company's operating results.

We calculate adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations. In addition, in evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the expenses excluded from our presentation of adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. We present adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, many of which present EBITDA and a form of adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. The following tables show our adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation from net income on a consolidated basis and from operating income (loss) for our geographic segments (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 Net income $ 1,370 $ 2,974 $ 626 $ 2,130 Add (deduct) — Provision for income taxes 913 809 417 291 Foreign currency exchange and other loss (gain) (189 ) 1,852 (94 ) 3,054 Interest expense 5,016 9,447 9,847 15,269 Interest income (13 ) (23 ) (36 ) (38 ) Depreciation and amortization 10,086 9,668 19,787 19,992 Share-based compensation expense 596 439 191 2,097 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,779 $ 25,166 $ 30,738 $ 42,795\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2016 Quarter Ended December 31, 2017 Asia-Pacific North America Asia-Pacific North America Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Operating income (loss) $ 3,956 $ 4,964 $ (733 ) $ (1,268 ) $ 6,251 $ 10,093 $ (77 ) $ (1,351 ) Add - Depreciation and amortization 4,218 5,851 198 8 3,936 5,778 137 9 Share-based compensation expense 194 82 22 298 - 87 13 339 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,368 $ 10,897 $ (513 ) $ (962 ) $ 10,187 $ 15,958 $ 73 $ (1,003 ) Intercompany adjustments $ (11 ) $ (49 )\nSix Months Ended December 31, 2016 Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 Asia-Pacific North America Asia-Pacific North America Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Leasing Leasing Manufacturing Corporate Operating income (loss) $ 6,819 $ 7,570 $ (1,351 ) $ (2,603 ) $ 7,054 $ 16,656 $ (663 ) $ (2,610 ) Add - Depreciation and amortization 8,026 11,732 396 10 8,495 11,527 335 18 Share-based compensation expense (522 ) 167 44 502 1,207 193 26 671 Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,323 $ 19,469 $ (911 ) $ (2,091 ) $ 16,756 $ 28,376 $ (302 ) $ (1,921 ) Intercompany adjustments $ (52 ) $ (114 )\nSource:General Finance Corporation",
