    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 6:00 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Cricket-Injured Du Plessis ruled out of India series Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCAPE TOWN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - South Africa captain Faf du Plessis has been ruled out of the remainder of the one-day and Twenty20 series against India due to a fractured finger. The injury could also sideline the 33-year-old from the first two tests against Australia next month. \nIt is another injury blow for the Proteas, who have already lost AB de Villiers due to a finger injury for the first three matches of the 50-over series against India. \nDu Plessis fractured his right index finger in the six wicket loss to India in the opening ODI in Durban on Thursday, a match in which he scored a 120 runs to anchor the home innings. \nHe will be out of action for between three and six weeks, Cricket South Africa said in a statement on Friday, leaving him in a race against time to be fit for the first of four tests against Australia that start on March 1. \nFarhaan Behardien has been called into the limited overs squad as a replacement, while the Proteas have also added uncapped Heinrich Klaasen as a reserve wicketkeeper-batsman. \nThere are five more ODIs in the series against India followed by three Twenty20 internationals.
