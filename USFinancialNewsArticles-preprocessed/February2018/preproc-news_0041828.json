    "text": "EMERYVILLE, Calif., NMI Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:NMIH) today reported a GAAP net loss of $1.8 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $14.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share were adjusted to reflect a one-time non-cash expense of $13.6 million primarily related to the re-measurement of the company’s net deferred tax asset as a result of tax reform, and a pre-tax non-cash expense of $3.4 million related to the change in fair value of the company’s warrant liability as a result of the increase in its stock price. This compares with net income of $12.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $12.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, after adjusting for the change in fair value of the warrant liability, in the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company reported net income of $59.7 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, and adjusted net income of $2.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, after adjusting for the change in fair value of the warrant liability and release of the valuation allowance on the company’s net deferred tax asset. We present the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share to increase the comparability of our financial results between periods. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\nBradley Shuster, Chairman and CEO of National MI, said, \"In the fourth quarter, National MI delivered record financial results, including record new insurance written of $6.9 billion, record net premiums earned of $50.1 million, record adjusted net income of $14.0 million, and record adjusted return-on-equity of 11.0%. National MI continued to build its portfolio of high-quality insurance in force at a rate that leads our industry. We also continued to make significant strides in customer development, activating 29 new customers in the fourth quarter and continuing to increase our volume with existing customers.”\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had primary insurance-in-force of $48.5 billion, up 12% from $43.3 billion at the prior quarter end and up 51% over $32.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. Premiums earned for the quarter were $50.1 million, including $4.2 million attributable to cancellation of single premium policies, which compares with $44.5 million, including $4.3 million related to cancellations, in the prior quarter. Premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 53% over premium revenue of $32.8 million in the same quarter a year ago, which included $5.1 million related to cancellations. NIW mix was 83% monthly premium product, which compares with 79% in the prior quarter and 75% in the fourth quarter of 2016. At quarter-end, cash and investments were $735 million, including $51 million at the holding company, and book equity was $509 million, equal to $8.41 per share. At quarter-end, the company had total PMIERs available assets of $528 million, which compares with risk-based required assets under PMIERs of $446 million.\nQuarter\nEnded Quarter\nEnded Quarter\nEnded Change Change 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2016 (1) Q/Q Y/Y Primary Insurance-in-Force ($billions) 48.47 43.26 32.17 12 % 51 % New Insurance Written - NIW ($billions) Monthly premium 5.74 4.83 3.90 19 % 47 % Single premium 1.14 1.28 1.34 -11 % -15 % Total 6.88 6.11 5.24 13 % 31 % Premiums Earned ($millions) 50.08 44.52 32.83 12 % 53 % Underwriting & Operating Expense ($millions) 28.30 24.65 23.28 15 % 22 % Loss Expense ($millions) 2.37 0.96 0.80 148 % 197 % Loss Ratio 4.7 % 2.1 % 2.4 % Cash & Investments ($millions) 735 713 677 3 % 9 % Book Equity ($millions) 509 511 476 0 % 7 % Book Value per Share 8.41\n8.53 8.04 -1 % 5 % (1) The 2016 prior period balance sheet has been revised.

Important factors that could cause actual events or results to indicated in such statements include, but are not limited to: changes in the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the GSEs), including decisions that have the impact of decreasing or discontinuing the use of mortgage insurance as credit enhancement; our ability to remain an eligible mortgage insurer under the current or future versions of their private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (PMIERs) and other requirements imposed by the GSEs, which they may change at any time; retention of our existing certificates of authority in each state and the District of Columbia (D.C.) and our ability to remain a mortgage insurer in good standing in each state and D.C.; our future profitability, liquidity and capital resources; actions of existing competitors, including other private mortgage insurers and governmental mortgage insurers like the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Veterans Administration (VA) (collectively, public MIs), and potential market entry by new competitors or consolidation of existing competitors; developments in the world's financial capital and reinsurance markets and our access to such markets; adoption of new or changes to existing laws and regulations that impact our business or financial condition directly or the mortgage insurance industry generally or their enforcement and implementation by regulators; changes to the GSEs' role in the secondary mortgage market driven by Congressional or regulatory action or other changes that could affect the residential mortgage industry generally or mortgage insurance industry in particular; potential future lawsuits, investigations or inquiries or resolution of current lawsuits or inquiries; changes in general economic, market and political conditions and policies, interest rates, inflation or other conditions that affect the housing market or the markets for home mortgages or mortgage insurance; our ability to successfully execute and implement our capital plans, including our ability to access the reinsurance market and to enter into, and receive approval for reinsurance arrangements on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, the GSEs and our regulators; our ability to implement our business strategy, including our ability to write mortgage insurance on low down payment residential mortgage loans, implement successfully and on a timely basis, complex infrastructure, systems, procedures, and internal controls to support our business and regulatory and reporting requirements of the insurance industry; our ability to attract and retain a diverse customer base, including the largest mortgage originators; failure of our pricing, risk management or investment strategies; emergence of unexpected claims and coverage issues, including claims exceeding our reserves or amounts we expected to experience; potential adverse impacts arising from recent natural disasters, including, with respect to the affected areas, a decline in new business, adverse effects on home prices, and an increase in notices of default on insured mortgages; the inability of our counter-parties, including third party reinsurers, to meet their obligations to us; our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, which could be limited or eliminated in various ways, including if we experience an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code; failure to maintain, improve and continue to develop necessary information technology systems or the failure of technology providers to perform as expected; and, our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel. These risks and uncertainties also include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the heading \"Risk Factors\" detailed in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as subsequently updated through other reports we file with the SEC. All subsequent written and oral attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement, which speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect new information, future events or circumstances that occur after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that use of the non-GAAP measures of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted return-on-equity facilitate the evaluation of our fundamental financial performance, thereby providing relevant information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way the Company's business performance is evaluated by management. These measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our fundamental operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers.\nAdjusted pre-tax income is defined as GAAP income before tax, excluding the effects of the non-cash loss or gain related to the change in fair value of our warrant liability.\nAdjusted net income is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of the aforementioned change in the fair value of our warrant liability and other discrete tax (benefits) expense which are infrequent and unusual non-operating items, such as the one-time non-cash charge due to a re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") in 2017 and the release of the valuation allowance held against certain of our net deferred tax assets in 2016. The amounts of adjustments to components of pre-tax income are tax effected using a federal statutory tax rate of 35%.\nAdjusted net income per diluted share is calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share by dividing (i) adjusted net income by (ii) diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which reflects share dilution from non-vested restricted stock units and from warrants when dilutive.\nAdjusted return-on-equity is calculated by dividing the adjusted income on an annualized basis by the average shareholders’ equity for the period.\nAlthough adjusted pre-tax net income and adjusted net income exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent items that are: (1) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) impacted by market, economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these adjustments. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by us.\n(1) Change in fair value of warrant liability . Outstanding warrants at the end of each reporting period are revalued, and any change in fair value is reported in the statements of operations in the period in which the change occurred. The change in the fair value of our warrant liability can vary significantly across periods and is influenced principally by equity market and general economic factors which may not impact or reflect our current period operating results. Trends in our operating performance can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of the change in fair value of our warrant liability.\n(2) Infrequent or unusual non-operating items. Our income tax expense for 2017 reflects a one-time non-cash charge due to a re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our income tax benefit in 2016 reflects a one-time non-cash benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance held against certain of our net deferred tax assets.\nInvestor Contact\nJohn M.
