    "text": "OXFORD, Miss., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Next Gear Solutions, developer of DASH, the market-leading restoration management software, has completed the acquisition of Moisture Mapper International. With this acquisition, Moisture Mapper joins DASH, MICA, DryTrack and Luxor CRM in the Next Gear Solutions product suite, reaffirming the NGS commitment to the property restoration space. By combining the technologies of DryTrack, MICA and Moisture Mapper, Next Gear Solutions will accelerate its services to leading property insurance carriers and its 4,000+ restoration contractors. This acquisition also brings John North, president of Moisture Mapper, and his entire team to the growing Next Gear family.\n\"Next Gear Solutions is all about simplifying the lives of contractors. Restoration contractors are being asked to shoulder more of the administrative burden in the claim process and are expected to do it from the job site,\" said Garret Gray, CEO of Next Gear Solutions. \"The future we envision is one of tighter integration across applications and less double-entry leading to more efficient workflows and a better experience for all involved in a claim.\"\n\"I am very excited to join the Next Gear team and consolidate our efforts toward the best-in-class field documentation product,\" said John North, Next Gear's new vice president of network development. \"I am confident that putting these teams and these products together under one umbrella will change the mitigation industry for the better.\"\nIn addition, Next Gear announces the hiring of Jesse Herrera to lead the company's newly formed Insurance Carrier Business Unit. Jesse joins Next Gear from Serent Capital, where he was a member of the Growth Team Strategic Operations Group. Prior to Serent, Jesse was EVP at Mitchell International and he brings over a decade of experience in the insurance market to Next Gear.\nThis is Next Gear's fourth acquisition in the past two years. Next Gear acquired ClientRunner in July 2016, Luxor CRM in December 2016 and MICA Software in July 2017.\nAbout Next Gear Solutions\nNext Gear Solutions, based in Oxford, Mississippi, was formed in 2008 with a mission to take restoration companies paperless, automate their workflow and bring efficiency to the entire business operation. Since 2009, Next Gear's software suite has grown to include solutions for managed repair networks, franchisors and other insurance solutions. Next Gear is the leading technology solution for the restoration contractor space with the largest footprint of best-in-class restoration contractors in five countries.\nAbout Moisture Mapper\nMoisture Mapper was founded in 2005 by a group of professionals that recognized a need in the property insurance industry for a common platform that could effectively document and communicate all aspects of the water mitigation \"process\" on both residential and commercial properties. As Moisture Mapper gained traction in the restoration industry, in addition to providing ease of use for contractor documentation, the business focus has grown dramatically for the data analysis tools insurers and Managed Repair Programs sought to minimize open file time and quickly pay and close claims.\nMedia Contact:\nSarah Barnes\nEmail: sarah.barnes@nextgearsolutions.com\nRelated Images\nnext-gear-solutions-has-acquired.png\nNext Gear Solutions has acquired Moisture Mapper International\nnext-gear-solutions.png\nNext Gear Solutions\nThe Leading Provider of Restoration Mobile Management Software\nmoisture-mapper-international.png\nMoisture Mapper International\nNow a Next Gear Solutions company\nRelated Links\nNext Gear Solutions\nMoisture Mapper\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/next-gear-solutions-has-completed-the-acquisition-of-moisture-mapper-international-300596807.html\nSOURCE Next Gear Solutions",
