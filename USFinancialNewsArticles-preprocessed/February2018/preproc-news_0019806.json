    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expects to have tough talks during a five-nation trip of the Middle East next week, including in Turkey, where he will urge leaders to rein in an offensive in northern Syria, U.S. officials said on Friday. \nBriefing reporters on Tillerson’s Feb. 11-16 trip to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt and Kuwait, U.S. officials acknowledged there would be difficult conversations at each stop. \nJordanian leaders were upset when the United States recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and suspended some aid for the Palestinians. \nIn Kuwait, Tillerson will attend an Iraq reconstruction conference at which Washington does not plan to contribute any money. Still, he hopes to make headway toward ending a dispute between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. \nKuwait has sought to broker an end to the dispute triggered when the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar last June. They accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and their arch-rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the countries are trying to curtail its sovereignty. \nTurkey, a U.S. ally, has launched a military air and ground operation into the Afrin region in northwest Syria targeting the Kurdish YPG militia despite U.S. objections. \nThe United States and Turkey are allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Yet they have diverging interests in the Syrian civil war, with Washington focused on defeating Islamic State and Ankara keen to prevent Syria’s Kurds from gaining autonomy and fueling Kurdish insurgents on Turkish soil. \n“We are urging them to show restraint in their operations in Afrin and to show restraint further along the line across the (border) in northern Syria,” a U.S. official told reporters in a conference call. “That’s going to be a difficult conversation.” \nSpeaking of U.S.-Turkish relations, he added: “Look it’s difficult. The rhetoric is hot. The Turks are angry, and this is a difficult time to do business but it’s our belief that there are still some very fundamental underlying shared interests.” \n‘REALLY TOUGH ISSUES” \nOn Jan. 21, Jordan’s King Abdullah told U.S. Vice President Mike Pence that Washington must rebuild “trust and confidence” in a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. \nTrump’s endorsement of Israel’s claim to Jerusalem as its capital drew condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world. It also broke with decades of U.S. policy that the city’s status be decided in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \nSpeaking of the trip generally, the U.S. official said: ”These are really tough issues and these are going to be tough conversations. \n“These are some of our closest partners but they are also partners with whom we are facing some of the toughest issues that we have to face in the region, whether its terrorism, whether it’s the future of U.S. assistance, whether it’s the final defeat of ISIS (the Islamic State militant group).” \nWriting by Arshad Mohammed; editing by Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio\n ",
