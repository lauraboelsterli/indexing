    "text": "- All-time records for credit and debit card processing volumes for both the Fourth Quarter and for Year 2017 -\nSAN ANTONIO, Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Payment Data Systems (NASDAQ: PYDS), an integrated electronic payment solutions provider, today announced the transaction processing results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Processing Results\nCredit card processing volumes for the fourth quarter of 2017 were up dramatically as compared to last year, and were the highest in the history of the company for any previous quarter. Credit card dollars processed during the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 274% over the same time period in 2016. Credit card transactions processed during the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 199% over the same time period in 2016. Credit card dollars processed during the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 90% over the third quarter of 2017. Credit cards transactions processed during the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 102% over the third quarter of 2017.\nElectronic check transaction volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017 were down 13% over the same time period in 2016. Returned check transactions processed during the fourth quarter of 2017 were down 18% over the same time period in 2016. Electronic check transaction volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 7% over the third quarter of 2017. Returned check transactions processed during fourth quarter of 2017 were flat as compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nTotal dollars processed for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded $818.5 million, the highest volume in any quarter over the last two years.\n2017 Annual Processing Results\nCredit card dollars processed for 2017 increased 78% compared to 2016, the highest in Company history. Credit card transactions processed increased 34% compared to 2016, and also set an all-time record.\nACH transaction processing volumes for 2017 decreased 15% compared to 2016. Returned check transactions processed during 2017 deceased 13% compared to 2016.\nTotal dollars processed for 2017 exceeded $2.8 billion, marking the third highest level in the history of the company, reflecting a decrease of 3% as compared to 2016.\n“We are thrilled to achieve the highest annual and quarterly levels of credit card processing volumes since our Company’s inception. This dramatic growth will lead to the Company posting record revenues for the fourth quarter and annual revenues for 2017. 2018 should also bring continued growth, and lead to even higher record revenues. As a result, we anticipate that fourth quarter revenues will exceed $5.5 million,” said Louis Hoch, President and CEO.\nCommenting further on the significant achievement, Vaden Landers, EVP & Chief Revenue Officer for Payment Data said, “the value of companies who are meeting and solving for all varieties of payment acceptance needs through deep integrations is at a level never before seen in our industry. Payment Data Systems, through its recent combination with Singular Payments, and combined with its leadership position in the ACH, pre-paid and other strategic sectors, is quickly gaining traction with software developers. These developers are embracing the reality that while they must deliver a robust payment offering to their downstream clients, becoming an ISO or Payment Facilitator represents more of a distraction than an opportunity.” Landers concluded, “Our PayFac-in-a-Box solution allows these tech innovators entre into the payments world through a suite of API’s, through which they can access as much or as little feature sets and functionality as is necessary to execute on their unique and very individual business models. We are excited about the future, and anticipate adding substantially to our growing roster of software providers over the remainder of 2018 and beyond.”\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this release include which are covered by safe harbors.
