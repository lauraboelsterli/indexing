    "text": "Reports positive 4Q comparable sales; exceeds FY17 earnings and comparable sales guidance\nCompany plans to return to comparable sales growth in 2018\nCINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) today reported fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results and is providing guidance for fiscal 2018 that reflects the company’s plan to return to comparable sales growth.\n“We are committed to returning Macy’s, Inc. to comparable sales growth in 2018 and will build on the momentum we created in the fourth quarter of 2017. Macy’s, Inc. had a solid fourth quarter, including strong performance in January, and the full year exceeded our expectations for annual comparable sales and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We are encouraged to see a trend improvement in our brick & mortar business, and we had the 34th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in our digital business,” said Jeff Gennette, Macy’s, Inc. chairman and chief executive officer. “Consumer spending was strong in the fourth quarter, and we were ready with improved execution and great products across all categories. We were disciplined with our promotional cadence and maintained a good inventory position. We head into 2018 with an improved base business, healthy inventories, a focused and engaged organization and a clear path to return Macy’s to growth.”\n“In 2017, we tested and iterated a number of merchandising and strategic initiatives as part of our North Star Strategy. These initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter performance, and in 2018 we are ready to scale as well as test additional revenue-driving initiatives. We are also encouraged by customer response to our new Star Rewards loyalty program,” said Gennette. “On the path to growth in 2018, we will continue to improve our execution, strengthen our product offerings and make the necessary investments to be competitive with today’s demanding consumer.”\nSales\nSales in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $8.666 billion, an increase of 1.8 percent, compared with sales of $8.515 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Comparable sales on an owned basis were up 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter and up 1.4 percent on an owned plus licensed basis. Total sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflect a 14 th week of sales, whereas comparable sales are on the same 13-week basis as fiscal 2016.\nSales in fiscal 2017 totaled $24.837 billion, down 3.7 percent from total sales of $25.778 billion in fiscal 2016. Comparable sales on an owned basis declined 2.2 percent in fiscal 2017. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis declined by 1.9 percent in fiscal 2017. Total sales for fiscal 2017 reflect a 53 rd week of sales, whereas comparable sales are on the same 52-week basis as fiscal 2016.\nEarnings Per Share\nFourth quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share were $4.31 compared to $1.54 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fiscal 2017 earnings per diluted share were $5.04 compared to $1.99 per share in fiscal 2016.\nThe following chart shows fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings per diluted share excluding restructuring and other costs, non-cash retirement plan settlement charges, net premiums on the early retirement of debt and the impact of federal tax reform on the company's deferred taxes. Results for 2016 exclude restructuring and other costs and non-cash retirement plan settlement charges.\nFourth quarter and fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share were positively impacted by 7 cents due to the change in the effective annual tax rate due to federal tax reform.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal-Year 2017 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Results\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 2016 2017 2016 Diluted EPS $4.31 $1.54 $5.04 $1.99 Exclude after-tax impact of restructuring, other costs, non-cash retirement plan settlement charges and net premiums on the early retirement of debt $0.37 $0.48 $0.59 $1.12 Deduct impact of federal tax reform on deferred taxes $(1.86) $0.00 $(1.86) $0.00 Adjusted diluted EPS excluding certain items identified above $2.82 $2.02 $3.77 $3.11 Operating Income\nMacy’s, Inc.’s operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.213 billion, or 14.0 percent of sales, compared to $815 million, or 9.6 percent of sales, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.397 billion, or 16.1 percent of sales, excluding restructuring and other costs of $152 million and non-cash retirement plan settlement charges of $32 million. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $234 million in book gains for the sale of the Union Square Men’s building (or 48 cents per diluted share), which was sold in fiscal 2016. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $1.062 billion, or 12.5 percent of sales, excluding $230 million of impairments, store closings and other costs and non-cash retirement plan settlement charges of $17 million.\nFor fiscal 2017, Macy’s, Inc.’s operating income totaled $1.807 billion, or 7.3 percent of sales, compared with operating income of $1.315 billion, or 5.1 percent of sales, for fiscal 2016. Operating income for fiscal 2017 totaled $2.098 billion, or 8.4 percent of sales, excluding $186 million of restructuring and other costs and $105 million of non-cash retirement plan settlement charges.\nMacy’s, Inc.’s fiscal 2016 operating income included $479 million of impairments, store closing and other costs. Excluding these items, as well as non-cash settlement charges related to the company’s retirement plans of $98 million, operating income for fiscal 2016 was $1.892 billion or 7.3 percent of sales.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.944 billion in fiscal 2017, compared with $1.801 billion in fiscal 2016. Net cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2017 was $373 million, compared with $187 million in fiscal 2016. Operating cash flows net of investing were $1.571 billion in fiscal 2017, compared with operating cash flows net of investing of $1.614 billion in fiscal 2016. During 2017, the company demonstrated its commitment to a strong balance sheet by utilizing excess cash to delever and reduce its debt by approximately $950 million.\nStore Openings/Closings\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the company opened two new freestanding Bluemercury beauty specialty stores for a total of 137 stores.\nIn fiscal 2017, the company opened 36 Bluemercury stores, two Macy's stores, 30 Backstage off-price stores within existing Macy’s stores and one Bloomingdale’s licensed location in Kuwait. The company closed 16 Macy's stores, all as previously disclosed. This includes the closure of the Waterfront store in Homestead, PA, which was announced at the end of the fourth quarter.\nIn February 2018, the company announced that it will close its Redmond Town Center main store in Redmond, WA, in early 2019. This brings the total to 83 of the approximately 100 store closures announced in August 2016.\nReal Estate Update\nIn fiscal 2017, the company's asset sales totaled $411 million in cash proceeds. These sales included stores as well as non-store real estate such as warehouses, outparcels and parking garages. Over the last three fiscal years, Macy's, Inc. has completed transactions totaling approximately $1.3 billion in cash proceeds.\nHeading into fiscal 2018, Macy's, Inc. continues to opportunistically evaluate its real estate portfolio to identify opportunities where the redevelopment value of its real estate exceeds that of non-strategic operating locations. The company also continues to focus on creating additional value from its flagship stores while adding vitality to the retail experience.\nIn February 2018, the company signed an agreement to sell floors 8 through 14 of its State Street store in Chicago to a private real estate fund sponsored by Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield intends to convert these largely unused floors into dynamic, creative office space. As part of this transaction, Macy's, Inc. will receive a total of $30 million ($27 million of consideration and a $3 million contribution for certain improvements), as well as upside participation in the ultimate value creation associated with the conversion of the upper floors to office space. This transaction will enable the company to make Macy's on State Street a more vibrant shopping destination. The company anticipates closing this transaction in the first half of fiscal 2018.\nThe company is now exploring opportunities to sell the approximately 240,000 gross square foot I. Magnin portion of the main Union Square building in San Francisco. Macy’s Union Square comprises multiple buildings, and the former I. Magnin flagship building, situated at the corner of Stockton and Geary Streets, is a separate structure well-suited for development. As previously announced, Macy’s sold the Union Square Men’s building and is incorporating the men's business into the main store. The company is also making additional enhancements to the Union Square main building through the conversion of street-level selling space into high-end retail shops that will be leased to third parties. The Union Square main building will remain the largest department store in the Bay Area and will comprise approximately 700,000 gross square feet.\nMacy’s, Inc. continues to work with Brookfield as part of its strategic alliance. The companies have agreed to certain terms on nine assets (of the approximately 50-asset portfolio), which Brookfield will redevelop once it has received the necessary approvals. Upon the completion of certain approvals, Macy’s, Inc. will either sell its interests in the individual assets to Brookfield or contribute them to individual joint ventures. If sold, the cumulative value is estimated to be approximately $50 million. Additionally, Macy's, Inc. would be entitled to an increased purchase price if certain financial targets are achieved for the three largest assets. The company expects that these developments will add vibrancy and desirability to the vicinity, enhancing the retail experience in these locations.\nLooking Ahead\nThe company is strategically investing to accelerate the rollout of a number of near-term growth initiatives impacting stores, technology and merchandising. The company has also developed an employee incentive program to drive results and engagement with associates at every level of the organization, with an emphasis on its hourly associates. These investments are expected to support the company’s return to comparable sales growth in fiscal 2018.\nGuidance for fiscal 2018 reflects the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition and retirement benefits. Macy's, Inc. has recast its quarterly preliminary and unaudited income statements and balance sheets for 2016 and 2017, which can be found on the investor relations page at www.macysinc.com .\nFor fiscal 2018, the company expects comparable sales on both an owned and an owned plus licensed basis to be flat to up 1 percent. Total sales are expected to be down between 0.5 percent and 2 percent in fiscal 2018. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.55 to $3.75 are expected in fiscal 2018, excluding anticipated settlement charges related to the company’s defined benefit plans. Adjusted earnings per diluted share include anticipated asset sale gains of $300 million to $325 million in fiscal 2018, compared to $544 million in asset sale gains for fiscal 2017. The company anticipates an effective annual tax rate of 23.25 percent for fiscal 2018.\nTotal sales guidance is provided on a 52-week basis in 2018 compared to a 53-week basis in 2017. Comparable sales guidance is provided on a 52-week basis in both 2018 and 2017.\nImportant Information Regarding Financial Measures\nPlease see the final pages of this news release for important information regarding the calculation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures.\nMacy’s, Inc. is one of the nation’s premier retailers.

However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis, which includes the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from operating income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period provides a useful supplemental measure that assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare this metric between past and future periods. Further, providing cash flow from operating activities net of cash used in investing activities is a useful measure in evaluating the company’s ability to generate cash from operations after giving effect to cash used by investing activities.\nThe reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, where the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders excluding certain items because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nMACY’S, INC.\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nChange in Comparable Sales\n14 Weeks\nEnded\nFebruary 3,\n2018\n53 Weeks\nEnded\nFebruary 3,\n2018\nIncrease (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 1) 1.3% (2.2)% Impact of growth in comparable sales of departments\nlicensed to third parties (Note 2) 0.1% 0.3% Increase (decrease) in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis 1.4% (1.9)% Notes:\n(1) Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales of macys.com and bloomingdales.com , adjusting for the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores undergoing remodeling, expansion or relocation remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales differ among companies in the retail industry.\n(2) Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales of macys.com and bloomingdales.com , adjusting for the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, in the calculation of comparable sales. The company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.\nMACY’S, INC.\nImportant Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nDiluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Macy's, Inc.
