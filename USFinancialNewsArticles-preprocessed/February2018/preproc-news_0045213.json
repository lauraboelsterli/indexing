For the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was $2.47 billion compared with $2.15 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 14.9%. For the fourth quarter, parts and services organic revenue growth was 4.8% and acquisition revenue growth was 6.1%, while the impact of exchange rates was 3.3%, for total parts and services revenue growth of 14.3%.\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $126 million, an increase of 31.2% as compared to $96 million for the same period of 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders was $126 million, an increase of 17.0% as compared to the $108 million for the same period of 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.41, an increase of 32.3% as compared to the $0.31 for the same period of 2016. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.41, an increase of 17.1% as compared to the $0.35 for the same period of 2016. Dominick Zarcone, President and Chief Executive Officer of LKQ Corporation, stated, “I am particularly pleased with the 5.0% organic revenue growth for parts and services achieved by our North America segment during the fourth quarter.”\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, made significant changes to federal income tax laws, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a net benefit of $22 million to its income tax provision related to the net impact of revaluing deferred tax balances at the new rate and recording an estimated provision for the repatriation tax. These tax impacts have been excluded from the measurement of adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nFull Year 2017 Reported Results\nFor the full year of 2017, revenue was $9.74 billion, an increase of 13.4% from $8.58 billion for 2016. For the full year of 2017, parts and services organic revenue growth was 4.1%, acquisition revenue growth was 9.1% and total parts and services revenue growth was 13.1%. On a per day basis, parts and services organic revenue growth was 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the full year 2017 was $1.74, an increase of 18.4% as compared to the $1.47 for the full year 2016. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders for the full year 2017 was $1.88, an increase of 11.2% as compared to the $1.69 for the full year 2016.\nMr. Zarcone commented, “Our 2017 results reflect the underlying strength of our business and our ability to grow, both organically and through acquisitions, despite headwinds we faced earlier in the year . Additionally, during 2017 our North America and Specialty segments reported their highest annual EBITDA margins in the past five years. I believe we entered 2018 with strong operating momentum, a clear strategy across all of our segments, and an industry leading team of over 43,000 employees dedicated to delivering on our mission.”\nCorporate Development\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company acquired the aftermarket business of Warn Industries, Inc., a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories.\nOn December 11, 2017, the Company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Stahlgruber GmbH (“Stahlgruber”) for an enterprise value of approximately €1.5 billion. Headquartered in Germany, Stahlgruber is a leading European wholesale distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars, tools, capital equipment and accessories with operations in Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia with further sales to Switzerland. The Stahlgruber transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 and is subject to regulatory approvals.\nIn addition to the Warn Industries and pending Stahlgruber acquisitions, during the fourth quarter of 2017 LKQ acquired four businesses, including an aftermarket parts distributor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, an automotive glass distributor in Kansas, an aftermarket parts distributor in the Netherlands, and an automotive glass distributor in New Jersey. Also, in the fourth quarter, LKQ’s European operations opened six new branches in Western Europe and nine new branches in Eastern Europe.\nMr. Zarcone commented, “Clearly, 2017 was another very active year for our development team resulting in the completion of 26 acquisitions, which expanded our geographic footprint, broadened the depth of our product offerings, and extended our leadership position in each of our operating segments. We look forward to closing the Stahlgruber acquisition in the near term so we can get to work integrating that business into our European operations.”\nOther Events\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company amended its credit facility to (i) extend the maturity date by approximately two years to January 29, 2023, (ii) increase the total availability under the revolving credit facility's multicurrency component from $2.45 billion to $2.75 billion, (iii) increase the permitted net leverage ratio thresholds, including a temporary step-up in the allowable net leverage ratio in the case of permitted acquisitions, (iv) modify the applicable margins and fees in the pricing grid, (v) increase the ability for the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, and (vi) make other immaterial or clarifying modifications and amendments to the credit agreement.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nIn 2017, cash flows from operations totaled $519 million, we made $179 million of capital expenditures, and we invested $513 million for acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, the balance sheet reflected cash of $280 million and outstanding debt of $3.4 billion. The unused capacity under the Company’s credit facilities at December 31, 2017 was approximately $1.4 billion.\nCompany Outlook\n2018 Guidance Organic revenue growth for parts & services 4.0% to 6.0% Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $646 million to $676 million Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders* $720 million to $750 million Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $2.07 to $2.16 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders * $2.30 to $2.40 Cash flows from operations $650 million to $700 million Capital expenditures $250 million to $280 million *Non-GAAP measures. See the table accompanying this release that reconciles the forecasted U.S. GAAP measures to the forecasted adjusted measures, which are non-GAAP.\nVarun Laroyia, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We expect the U.S. tax reform to have a favorable impact on our 2018 results. With the lower U.S. corporate tax rate, we estimate that our global effective tax rate will be approximately 26% in 2018. We intend to invest a portion of the U.S. based tax savings into programs that benefit our domestic employees.”\nOur guidance for 2018 is based on current conditions and does not include any results for the pending Stahlgruber acquisition. The guidance is based on current scrap prices and exchange rates. Changes in these figures may impact our ability to achieve the guidance. Adjusted figures exclude (to the extent applicable) the impact of restructuring and acquisition related expenses; amortization expense related to acquired intangibles; excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments; adjustments to the estimated tax reform provisions booked in 2017; losses on debt extinguishment; and gains and losses related to acquisitions or divestitures (including changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains and management’s presentation on the conference call will refer to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency revenue information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all companies that report revenue growth on a constant currency basis calculate such measure in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table compares revenue and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment: Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) % of Revenue % of Revenue % of Revenue % of Revenue Revenue North America $ 1,202,954 $ 1,107,778 $ 4,799,651 $ 4,444,625 Europe 971,641 779,284 3,636,811 2,920,470 Specialty 296,518 264,510 1,305,516 1,223,723 Eliminations (1,258 ) (1,166 ) (5,069 ) (4,787 ) Total revenue $ 2,469,855 $ 2,150,406 $ 9,736,909 $ 8,584,031 Segment EBITDA North America $ 152,781 12.7% $ 138,441 12.5% $ 655,275 13.7% $ 589,945 13.3% Europe 77,619 8.0% 63,542 8.2% 319,156 8.8% 283,608 9.7% Specialty 23,026 7.8% 20,344 7.7% 142,159 10.9% 131,427 10.7% Total Segment EBITDA $ 253,426 10.3% $ 222,327 10.3% $ 1,116,590 11.5% $ 1,004,980 11.7% We have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss. We calculate Segment EBITDA as EBITDA excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. EBITDA, which is the basis for Segment EBITDA, is calculated as net income excluding noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest (which includes loss on debt extinguishment) and income tax expense. Our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, uses Segment EBITDA as the key measure of our segment profit or loss. We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies. We also consider Segment EBITDA to be a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance, as it provides investors, securities analysts and other interested parties with supplemental information regarding the underlying trends in our ongoing operations. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Net Income to EBITDA and Segment EBITDA: Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income $ 120,655 $ 86,331 $ 530,228 $ 463,975 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (3,516 ) - (3,516 ) - Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders 124,171 86,331 533,744 463,975 Subtract: Net (loss) income from discontinued operations (2,215 ) (9,967 ) (6,746 ) 7,852 Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders 126,386 96,298 540,490 456,123 Add: Depreciation and amortization 60,368 54,265 219,546 191,433 Depreciation and amortization - cost of goods sold 3,327 1,899 10,657 6,901 Interest expense, net 26,814 23,680 100,620 87,682 Loss on debt extinguishment (1) 456 - 456 26,650 Provision for income taxes 29,354 47,341 235,560 220,566 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 246,705 223,483 1,107,329 989,355 Subtract: Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries 2,029 (73 ) 5,907 (592 ) Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related - - - 18,342 Gains on bargain purchases (120 ) 8,207 3,870 8,207 Add: Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 9,301 6,948 19,672 37,762 Inventory step-up adjustment – acquisition related 3,584 - 3,584 3,614 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities (4,255 ) 30 (4,218 ) 206 Segment EBITDA $ 253,426 $ 222,327 $ 1,116,590 $ 1,004,980 EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 10.0 % 10.4 % 11.4 % 11.5 % Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 10.3 % 10.3 % 11.5 % 11.7 % (1 ) Loss on debt extinguishment is considered a component of interest in calculating EBITDA.\nWe have presented EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our operating performance and the value of our business. We calculate EBITDA as net income excluding noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest (which includes loss on debt extinguishment) and income tax expense. EBITDA provides insight into our profitability trends and allows management and investors to analyze our operating results with and without the impact of noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest (which includes loss on debt extinguishment) and income tax expense. We believe EBITDA is used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the operating performance and the value of other companies, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.\nWe have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss and underlying trends in our ongoing operations. We calculate Segment EBITDA as EBITDA excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries.

In addition, not all companies that report EBITDA or Segment EBITDA information calculate EBITDA or Segment EBITDA in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders, respectively: Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands, except per share data) Net income $ 120,655 $ 86,331 $ 530,228 $ 463,975 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (3,516 ) - (3,516 ) - Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders 124,171 86,331 533,744 463,975 Subtract: Net (loss) income from discontinued operations (2,215 ) (9,967 ) (6,746 ) 7,852 Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders 126,386 96,298 540,490 456,123 Adjustments - continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: Amortization of acquired intangibles 26,225 23,557 97,388 81,748 Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 9,301 6,948 19,672 37,762 Loss on debt extinguishment 456 - 456 26,650 Inventory step-up adjustment – acquisition related 3,584 - 3,584 3,614 Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities (4,255 ) 30 (4,218 ) 206 Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related - - - (18,342 ) Gains on bargain purchases 120 (8,207 ) (3,870 ) (8,207 ) U.S. tax law change 2017 (22,188 ) - (22,188 ) - Excess tax benefit from stock-based payments (942 ) 30 (8,000 ) (11,441 ) Tax effect of adjustments (12,283 ) (10,574 ) (40,616 ) (45,646 ) Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $ 126,404 $ 108,082 $ 582,698 $ 522,467 Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 311,106 310,120 310,649 309,784 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: Reported $ 0.41 $ 0.31 $ 1.74 $ 1.47 Adjusted $ 0.41 $ 0.35 $ 1.88 $ 1.69 We have presented Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders as we believe these measures are useful for evaluating the core operating performance of our continuing business across reporting periods and in analyzing the company’s historical operating results. We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders as Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share adjusted to eliminate the impact of noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, restructuring and acquisition related expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, amortization expense related to acquired intangibles, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition-related gains and losses, excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments, the 2017 U.S. tax law change and any tax effect of these adjustments. The tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period or for certain discrete items the specific tax expense or benefit for the adjustment. These financial measures are used by management in its decision making and overall evaluation of operating performance of the company and are included in the metrics used to determine incentive compensation for our senior management.
