Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.3 million, compared to net income of $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable to common unitholders per diluted unit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.31, compared to net income attributable to common unitholders per diluted unit of $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2016. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 1% to $15.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 29% to $14.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and distributable cash flow increased 14% to $7.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, the Partnership reported rental revenue of $52.6 million, net income of $19.3 million, and net income attributable to common unitholders of $0.53 per diluted unit. The Partnership reported EBITDA of $48.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $51.7 million, and distributable cash flow of $28.8 million in the full year period ended December 31, 2017.\n“In 2017, we delivered another year of strong operating results as our core ground lease assets produced stable and consistent returns and the Partnership continued to grow its asset base through accretive acquisitions. In 2018, we expect to layer in more meaningful growth from our new development initiatives, while our core ground lease assets continue to deliver the stable and predictable cash flows that we have been accustomed to,” said Tim Brazy, Chief Executive Officer of the Partnership’s general partner.\nQuarterly Distributions\nOn January 24, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Partnership’s general partner declared a cash distribution of $0.3675 per common unit, or $1.47 per common unit on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This quarter’s cash distribution, which represents a 5.0% increase year-over-year, marks the twelfth consecutive quarter that the Partnership has increased its quarterly cash distribution since its IPO in November 2014. The distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to common unitholders of record as of February 5, 2018.\nOn January 22, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Partnership’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.49375 per Series B preferred unit, which is payable on February 15, 2018 to Series B preferred unitholders of record as of February 1, 2018.\nOn December 21, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Partnership’s general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.500 per Series A preferred unit, which was paid on January 16, 2018 to Series A preferred unitholders of record as of January 2, 2018.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had $304 million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) and $86 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under the Facility, subject to compliance with certain covenants.\nRecent Acquisitions\nSince the beginning of 2017 through January 18, 2018, the Partnership acquired a total of 350 assets for total consideration of approximately $219 million. The acquisitions were immediately accretive to the Partnership’s distributable cash flow, and funded primarily with borrowings under the Partnership’s existing Facility, and the issuance of common and preferred units.\nAt-The-Market (“ATM”) Equity Programs\nThrough its At-The-Market (“ATM”) issuance programs, the Partnership issued 240,426 common units, 704,445 Series A preferred units and 623,015 Series B preferred units for gross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million, $17.7 million and $15.6 million, respectively, for the full year 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Partnership’s outlook for acquisition volume is $250 million to $300 million in assets. This includes the right to purchase $200 million to $250 million in assets that the Partnership’s sponsor has expressed its intent to offer us, and approximately $50 million in new infrastructure deployments. These acquisitions and deployments, combined with organic portfolio growth, are expected to drive distribution growth of 10% over the fourth quarter 2017 distribution of $0.3675 per common unit by the fourth quarter 2018 (distribution to be paid in February 2019).\nConference Call Information\nThe Partnership will hold a conference call on Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial and operating results.

We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, current cash income tax expense, distributions to preferred unitholders, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, and maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances. We believe that to understand our performance further, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should be compared with our reported net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), as presented in our combined financial statements.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. As a result, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please see the “Reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow” table below.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control and are difficult to predict. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including examination of historical operating trends made by the management of the Partnership. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, the Partnership cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements in this press release include our expected distribution growth for 2018 and expected acquisition opportunities from our sponsor. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in the Partnership’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including the Partnership’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on February 15, 2018. These risks could cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nCONTACT:\nMarcelo Choi\nVice President, Investor Relations\n(213) 788-4528\nir@landmarkmlp.com\nLandmark Infrastructure Partners LP\nConsolidated and Combined Statements of Operations\nIn thousands, except per unit data\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (1) 2017 2016 (1) Revenue Rental revenue $ 14,482 $ 11,498 $ 52,625 $ 41,171 Expenses Management fees to affiliate — — — 196 Property operating 147 9 394 107 General and administrative 1,019 867 5,286 3,755 Acquisition-related 280 1,492 1,287 2,906 Amortization 3,711 3,016 13,537 11,191 Impairments — 40 848 1,275 Total expenses 5,157 5,424 21,352 19,430 Other income and expenses Interest and other income 419 316 1,587 1,225 Interest expense (5,468 ) (3,640 ) (18,399 ) (13,923 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — — (1,703 ) Realized loss on derivatives — — — (99 ) Unrealized gain on derivatives 1,786 6,042 1,675 2,306 Gain (loss) on sale of real property interests (5 ) — (5 ) 374 Total other income and expenses (3,268 ) 2,718 (15,142 ) (11,820 ) Income before income tax benefit 6,057 8,792 16,131 9,921 Income tax benefit (3,217 ) — (3,145 ) — Net income 9,274 8,792 19,276 9,921 Less: Pre-acquisition net (income) loss from Drop-down Assets (1) — (5 ) — 48 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 8 — 19 — Net income attributable to limited partners 9,266 8,797 19,257 9,873 Less: Distributions to preferred unitholders (2,001 ) (1,327 ) (6,673 ) (2,660 ) Less: General Partner's incentive distribution rights (193 ) (77 ) (488 ) (110 ) Net income attributable to common and subordinated unitholders $ 7,072 $ 7,393 $ 12,096 $ 7,103 Net income per common and subordinated unit Common units – basic $ 0.31 $ 0.34 $ 0.54 $ 0.46 Common units – diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.34 $ 0.53 $ 0.41 Subordinated units – basic and diluted $ 0.28 $ 0.33 $ 0.5 $ 0.23 Weighted average common and subordinated units outstanding Common units – basic 19,940 18,727 19,701 13,986 Common units – diluted 23,075 21,862 22,836 17,121 Subordinated units – basic and diluted 3,135 3,135 3,135 3,135 Other Data Total leased tenant sites (end of period) 2,157 1,956 2,157 1,956 Total available tenant sites (end of period) 2,239 2,022 2,239 2,022\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Partnership completed five drop-down acquisitions, (the “2016 Drop-down Assets”) from our sponsor Landmark Dividend LLC and affiliates (collectively “Landmark”). Since the entities are under common control, the assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at Landmark’s historical cost, with financial statements for prior periods retroactively adjusted to furnish comparative information. Financial information prior to the closing of each transaction has been retroactively adjusted for the 2016 Drop-down Assets. On April 1, 2017, the Partnership early adopted ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (“ASU No. 2017-01”). Under ASU 2017-01, the 2017 drop-down transactions were asset acquisitions with prior periods not retroactively adjusted. In addition, after the adoption of ASU No. 2017-01, acquisition costs for asset acquisitions are capitalized. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes and other information included in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2018.\nLandmark Infrastructure Partners LP\nConsolidated and Combined Balance Sheets\nIn thousands, except per unit data\n(Unaudited) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Assets Land $ 114,385 $ 88,845 Real property interests 596,422 490,030 Construction in progress 7,574 — Total land and real property interests 718,381 578,875 Accumulated amortization of real property interests (37,817 ) (25,967 ) Land and net real property interests 680,564 552,908 Investments in receivables, net 20,782 17,440 Cash and cash equivalents 9,188 2,711 Restricted cash 18,672 2,851 Rent receivables, net 4,141 2,372 Due from Landmark and affiliates 629 566 Deferred loan costs, net 3,589 2,797 Deferred rent receivable 4,252 1,379 Derivative asset 3,159 1,860 Other intangible assets, net 17,984 15,730 Other assets 5,039 2,446 Total assets $ 767,999 $ 603,060 Liabilities and equity Revolving credit facility $ 304,000 $ 224,500 Secured notes, net 187,249 112,435 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 4,978 4,374 Other intangible liabilities, net 12,833 13,061 Prepaid rent 4,581 3,984 Derivative liabilities — 376 Total liabilities 513,641 358,730 Commitments and contingencies Equity Series A cumulative redeemable preferred units, 1,568,402 and 863,957 units issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 36,604 19,393 Series B cumulative redeemable preferred units, 2,463,015 and 1,840,000 units issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 58,936 44,256 Common units, 20,146,458 and 19,450,555 units issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively 288,527 294,296 Subordinated units, 3,135,109 units issued and outstanding 19,641 22,524 General Partner (150,519 ) (135,630 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 968 (509 ) Total limited partners' equity 254,157 244,330 Noncontrolling interests 201 — Total equity 254,358 244,330 Total liabilities and equity $ 767,999 $ 603,060\nLandmark Infrastructure Partners LP\nReal Property Interest Table Available Tenant Sites (1) Leased Tenant Sites Real Property Interest Number of\nInfrastructure\nLocations (1) Number Average Number Average Tenant Site\nOccupancy\nRate (3)\nAverage Quarterly\nRental\nRevenue (6)\n(In thousands)\nPercentage\nof Quarterly\nRental\nRevenue (6) Remaining Remaining Monthly Property Lease Effective Rent Interest Term Per Tenant (Years) (Years) (2) Site (4)(5) Tenant Lease Assignment with Underlying Easement Wireless Communication 1,068 1,357 78.2 (7) 1,305 28.6 $ 7,282 51 % Outdoor Advertising 432 521 84.1 (7) 509 18 2,939 20 % Renewable Power Generation 21 53 29.1 (7) 53 28.4 466 3 % Subtotal 1,521 1,931 79.1 (7) 1,867 25.8 $ 10,687 74 % Tenant Lease Assignment only (8) Wireless Communication 154 213 49.3 195 18.3 $ 1,333 9 % Outdoor Advertising 24 25 59.7 25 15 196 1 % Renewable Power Generation 2 2 74.8 2 6.6 6 — % Subtotal 180 240 50.6 222 17.8 $ 1,535 10 % Tenant Lease on Fee Simple Wireless Communication 14 22 99 (7) 22 18.2 $ 136 1 % Outdoor Advertising 27 31 99 (7) 31 12.1 539 4 % Renewable Power Generation 13 15 99 (7) 15 31.9 1,585 11 % Subtotal 54 68 99 (7) 68 18.3 $ 2,260 16 % Total 1,755 2,239 76.6 (9) 2,157 24.7 $ 14,482 100 % Aggregate Portfolio Wireless Communication 1,236 1,592 74.6 1,522 27.1 96 % $ 1,838 $ 8,751 61 % Outdoor Advertising 483 577 83.8 565 17.6 98 % 1,754 3,674 25 % Renewable Power Generation 36 70 39.9 70 28.5 100 % 9,779 2,057 14 % Total 1,755 2,239 76.6 (9) 2,157 24.7 96 % $ 2,073 $ 14,482 100 %\n(1) “Available Tenant Sites” means the number of individual sites that could be leased. For example, if we have an easement on a single rooftop, on which three different tenants can lease space from us, this would be counted as three “tenant sites,” and all three tenant sites would be at a single infrastructure location with the same address. (2) Assumes the exercise of all remaining renewal options of tenant leases. Assuming no exercise of renewal options, the average remaining lease terms for our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, renewable power generation and aggregate portfolios as of December 31, 2017 were 3.8, 8.8, 18.0 and 5.3 years, respectively. (3) Represents the number of leased tenant sites divided by the number of available tenant sites. (4) Occupancy and average monthly effective rent per tenant site are shown only on an aggregate portfolio basis by industry. (5) Represents total monthly revenue excluding the impact of amortization of above and below market lease intangibles divided by the number of leased tenant sites. (6) Represents GAAP rental revenue recognized under existing tenant leases for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Excludes interest income on receivables. (7) Fee simple ownership and perpetual easements are shown as having a term of 99 years for purposes of calculating the average remaining term. (8) Reflects “springing lease agreements” whereby the cancellation or nonrenewal of a tenant lease entitles us to enter into a new ground lease with the property owner (up to the full property interest term) and a replacement tenant lease. The remaining lease assignment term is, therefore, equal to or longer than the remaining lease term. Also represents properties for which the “springing lease” feature has been exercised and has been replaced by a lease for the remaining lease term.
