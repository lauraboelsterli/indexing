    "text": "TULSA, Okla., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AAON, INC. (NASDAQ:AAON) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year 2017. Sales in the fourth quarter were $104.2 million, up 13.6% from $91.7 million in 2016. Net income was $15.8 million, increasing 38.1% from $11.4 million in the same period a year ago. Sales for the year 2017 reached a record level, $405.2 million, representing a gain of 5.5% compared to $384.0 million in 2016. Net income for 2017 was also a record, $54.5 million, rising 2.1% compared to $53.4 million in 2016.\nEarnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.30 per diluted share, up 39.4% from $0.21 per diluted share in 2016, based upon 52.9 million and 53.4 million diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Earnings per diluted share for the years 2017 and 2016 were $1.03 and $1.00, representing a gain of 3.0%, based upon 53.1 million and 53.4 million diluted shares outstanding, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $5.1 million to $13.7 million (13.2% of sales) from $8.6 million (9.4% of sales) as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is due to warranty expense and increases in salaries and benefits. For the year, SG&A expenses increased $10.7 million to $49.2 million (12.2% of sales) from $38.5 million (10.0% of sales) as compared to 2016. In addition to the increases in warranty from modifications made to our warranty policy, the Company had two officers retire during the year, which resulted in accelerated vesting of stock awards and approximately $1.0 million in additional stock compensation expense. The Company expects our SG&A expense will return to a more normal level in 2018.\nThe Tax Cuts and Job Act (the \"Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018. Due to this change, the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities on the enactment date, which resulted in a $4.4 million benefit to our income tax provision.\nNorman H. Asbjornson, CEO, said, \"The Act allows us to improve our compensation to employees and cash distribution to shareholders as well as defer future price increases to customers.\"\nMr. Asbjornson continued, \"Our financial condition at December 31, 2017 remained quite strong with a current ratio of 3.1:1 (including cash and short-term investments totaling $30.4 million). We also remain debt free. Our backlog at December 31, 2017 increased 65.3% to $81.2 million, from $49.1 million for the same period a year ago.\"\nGary Fields, President, added, \"During 2018, we will continue to witness the results of our significant capital investment program. Two new Water-Source Heat Pump lines will begin production and our state of the industry laboratory will initiate operations. These investments, I believe, will have a major impact on AAON's growth in the years ahead.\"\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. (Eastern Time) to discuss the fourth quarter and year 2017 results. To participate, call 1-888-241-0551 (code 4187646); or, for rebroadcast, call 1-855-859-2056 (code 4187646).\nAAON, Inc. is a manufacturer of air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, self-contained units and coils.

(“GAAP”), an additional non-GAAP financial measure is provided and reconciled in the following table. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company’s business trends and operating performance.\nEBITDAX\nEBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund operations.\nThe Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) depreciation, (2) amortization of bond premiums, (3) share-based compensation, (4) interest (income) expense and (5) income tax expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP.\nThe Company’s EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company’s operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company’s management team, and by other users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Years Ending\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net Income, a GAAP measure $ 15,770 $ 11,420 $ 54,498 $ 53,376 Depreciation 3,982 3,488 15,007 13,035 Amortization of bond premiums 8 33 47 249 Share-based compensation 1,498 1,185 6,458 4,357 Interest (income) expense (91 ) (102 ) (345 ) (541 ) Income tax expense 1,680 6,517 19,994 26,615 EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure $ 22,847 $ 22,541 $ 95,659 $ 97,091 For Further Information:\nJerry R.
