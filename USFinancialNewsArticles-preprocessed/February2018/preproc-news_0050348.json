    "text": "(Reuters) - Japan’s Shohei Ohtani had a rough outing in his spring training debut with the Los Angeles Angels on Saturday, giving up a home run and two runs in less than two innings.\nThe right-handed pitcher, who is also a strong hitter and considered a genuine two-way prospect, struck out two and walked one in the erratic start against the Milwaukee Brewers at Tempe, Arizona.\nBut the 23-year-old, who signed with the Angels in December, showed potential with his fastball topping 97 miles per hour.\nSlideshow (2 Images) He had been scheduled to pitch two full innings, but left with one out in the second after throwing 31 pitches, 17 of them for strikes.\nKeon Broxton hit a lead-off home run to open Milwaukee’s second innings.\nOhtani did not bat and Angels manager Mike Scioscia said he was likely to play as a designated hitter early next week.\nHe is the first player in nearly 100 years to attempt to play in the major leagues as a pitcher and hitter.\nReporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
