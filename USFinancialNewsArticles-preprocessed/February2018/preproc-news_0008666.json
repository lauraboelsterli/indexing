    "text": "BERLIN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Negotiators for a new grand coalition between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and Social Democrats may drop a proposal to progressively abolish Germany’s air transport tax, a source familiar with the negotiations said on Sunday.\nA working paper seen by Reuters on Friday had called for a gradual abolition of the tax, which generates over 1 billion euros for the government each year.\nBut on Sunday, a source said that proposal could be dropped from the final coalition agreement.\nThe tax is levied on ticket prices and costs between 7 and 40 euros ($9-$50), depending on the distance flown.\nReporting by Andreas Rinke,; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
