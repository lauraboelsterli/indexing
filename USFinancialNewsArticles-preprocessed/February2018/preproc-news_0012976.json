All amounts are in US dollars.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter were $438.1 million, a 15% increase relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA (note 1) was $40.5 million, up 32%, and Adjusted EPS (note 2) was $0.51, up 24% from the prior year quarter. GAAP Operating Earnings were $27.7 million, relative to $18.9 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.40 per share in the quarter, compared to $0.19 for the same quarter a year ago.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $1.71 billion, a 15% increase relative to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $162.0 million, up 24%, and Adjusted EPS was $2.03, up 25% versus the prior year of $1.62. GAAP Operating Earnings were $107.6 million, compared to $90.6 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted EPS for the year was $1.45, relative to $0.92 in the prior year.\n“We are pleased to close 2017 with another strong quarter of financial results, further reinforcing the robust growth we delivered throughout the year. Strong focus and execution around further improving our profitability and building out our company-owned operations were key drivers to our performance,” said Scott Patterson, Chief Executive Officer of FirstService. “We feel confident about the strategic direction and prospects across our businesses moving through 2018.”\nAbout FirstService Corporation\nFirstService Corporation is a North American leader in the property services sector serving its customers through two industry leading platforms: FirstService Residential - North America’s largest manager of residential communities; and FirstService Brands - one of North America’s largest providers of essential property services delivered through individually branded franchise systems and company-owned operations.\nFirstService generates US$1.7 billion in annual revenues and has more than 18,000 employees across North America.

More information is available at www.ﬁrstservice.com .\nSegmented Fourth Quarter Results\nFirstService Residential revenues totalled $290.9 million for the fourth quarter, up 6% relative to $274.4 million in the prior year quarter. The revenue increase was evenly split between organic growth and growth from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.4 million, compared to $17.2 million reported in the prior year period. Fourth quarter margin expansion resulted from continuing operating efficiencies and improved labour cost management relative to the prior year quarter. GAAP Operating Earnings were $17.5 million, versus $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of last year.\nFirstService Brands revenues totalled $147.2 million, up 38% versus $106.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was comprised of 16% organic growth and the balance from recent acquisitions. Organic growth for the quarter benefited from hurricane-related work at our Paul Davis National company-owned operations. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $20.2 million, up 26% versus the prior year quarter. GAAP Operating Earnings were $14.2 million, versus $10.5 million in the prior year quarter. The FirstService Brands division margin was lower in the quarter due to increased contribution from our faster-growing company-owned operations, including Paul Davis Restoration, California Closets and Century Fire Protection, relative to our higher margin franchised operations.\nCorporate costs, as presented in Adjusted EBITDA were $3.1 million in the fourth quarter, relative to $2.6 million in the prior year period. On a GAAP basis, corporate costs for the quarter were $3.9, relative to $3.1 million in the prior year period.\nSegmented Full Year Results\nFirstService Residential revenues were $1.2 billion, up 6% relative to 2016, with the increase comprised of 4% organic growth and 2% from acquisitions. Organic growth was primarily driven by competitive contract wins across our markets. Adjusted EBITDA was $99.9 million, up 19% versus the prior year, with related margin expansion driven by continued operating improvements and further optimization of our labour resources. GAAP Operating Earnings were $77.6 million, compared to $62.6 million in the prior year.\nFirstService Brands revenues for the year totalled $531.1 million, up 44% versus the prior year, comprised of 12% organic growth and the balance from recent acquisitions. Organic growth was largely due to very strong growth from our Paul Davis company-owned operations, particularly Paul Davis National, as well as double digit revenue growth at our California Closets and Century Fire company-owned operations and within our CertaPro Painters, California Closets and Floor Coverings International franchised systems. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $74.4 million, up 32% relative to the prior year. The division operating margin was impacted by the increased revenue mix from our faster-growing, lower-margin company-owned operations, as well as weak performance at Service America. GAAP Operating Earnings were $46.7 million, versus $41.2 million a year ago.\nCorporate costs, as presented in Adjusted EBITDA, were $12.3 million for the full year, relative to $10.1 million in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, corporate costs were $16.6 million, relative to $13.2 million a year ago. The increase reflects headcount additions at our corporate office, as well as the impact of foreign exchange.\nStock Repurchases\nDuring the year, the Company repurchased 271,378 Subordinate Voting Shares on the open market under its Normal Course Issuer Bid (“NCIB”) at an average price of $62.96 per share. All shares purchased under the NCIB were cancelled. The Company is authorized to repurchase up to an additional 2,958,622 Subordinate Voting Shares under its NCIB, which expires on August 23, 2018.\nConference Call & Presentation\nFirstService will be holding a conference call on Wednesday, February 7, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss results for the fourth quarter and full year.

Such factors include: (i) general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, impact demand for FirstService’s services and the cost of providing services; (ii) the ability of FirstService to implement its business strategy, including FirstService’s ability to acquire suitable acquisition candidates on acceptable terms and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with its existing businesses; (iii) changes in or the failure to comply with government regulations; and (iv) other factors which are described in FirstService’s annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2016 under the heading “Risk factors” (a copy of which may be obtained at www.sedar.com ) and Annual Report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (a copy of which may be obtained at www.sec.gov ), and subsequent filings (which factors are adopted herein).

This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and MD&A to be made available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nNotes\n1. Reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA:\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other expense (income); (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) goodwill impairment charges; (vi) acquisition-related items; and (vii) stock-based compensation expense. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its own operating performance and its ability to service debt, as well as an integral part of its planning and reporting systems. Additionally, this measure is used in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure because the Company believes such measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance because of the low capital intensity of its service operations. The Company believes this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA appears below.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended (in thousands of US$) December 31 December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net earnings $ 24,647 $ 11,716 $ 76,673 $ 54,243 Income tax 589 4,848 22,607 27,387 Other expense (income) 2 (60 ) (1,520 ) (232 ) Interest expense, net 2,489 2,413 9,867 9,152 Operating earnings 27,727 18,917 107,627 90,550 Depreciation and amortization 11,816 11,013 42,049 36,969 Goodwill impairment charge - - 6,150 - Acquisition-related items 68 209 2,019 61 Stock-based compensation expense 895 521 4,132 2,744 Adjusted EBITDA $ 40,506 $ 30,660 $ 161,977 $ 130,324 2. Reconciliation of net earnings and net earnings (loss) per common share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share:\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; (iv) goodwill impairment charges; (v) stock-based compensation expense; (vi) a stock-based compensation tax adjustment related to a US GAAP change; and (vii) an income tax recovery on the enactment of US Tax Reform. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per common share, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating this non-GAAP measure may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers.
