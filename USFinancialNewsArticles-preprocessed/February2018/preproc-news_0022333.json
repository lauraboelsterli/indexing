That is, private education will be an integral part of China's educational service system. The New Law has stated that the government could support private education development through purchasing their educational services, which will provide huge developmental opportunities for exceptional private educational services providers, and usher a new era for Hailing Education's strategic expansion.\nAs of 2016, the number of students in private primary, middle and high schools in China has surpassed 15.6 million. While Hailiang Education is the largest educational services provider of private primary, middle and high schools in China, the number of students served by Hailiang Education accounted for approximately 0.35% of the private school enrollment. Therefore, driven by these preferential policies, there is great potential for our Company in the education industry in the future.\nThe Company firmly believes that the primary, middle, and high schools in PRC private education section will be operated by the most influential educational services providers collectively. Hailiang Education will endeavor to be one of China's best, largest, and most profitable private educational services provider, thereby leading the industry in facilitating social welfare.\nThe Engagement of Mr. Cuiwei Ye as our Principal General Will Lead Hailiang Education into Outstanding Success\nOn the 3 rd of November 2017, Mr. Cuiwei Ye, the Deputy Director of the Academic Committee of Chinese Society of Education, China's Most Prestigious Educator, China's Outstanding Middle School Principal, China's Well-known Middle School Educator, was appointed the Principal General of Hailiang Education.

(\"Hailiang Group\"), and Hailiang Education Management Group Co., Ltd. (\"Hailiang Education Management\"). This cooperation affords Hailiang Education to operate private and public primary, middle and high schools constructed, merged and acquired or entrusted by Hailiang Group and Hailiang Education Management. Currently, Hailiang Education has owned or been providing educational services to an aggregate of 23 schools for more than 55,700 students, positioning the Company to embark on the path to become the largest educational services provider of private primary, middle and high school in China.\nHailiang Group Is Expected to Provide a Strong Foundation for Hailiang Education's Asset-Light Development Model\nThe Agreement is expected to rapidly enhance the asset-light development model of Hailiang Education and greatly improve the business prospects of the Company. As a result, the net growth of Hailiang Education is expected to increase at compound annual growth rate of 30% for a long period, making it possible to bring higher returns for our shareholders.\nAs a well-known, international private enterprise group, Hailiang Education continues to stand by the concept of \"working for the benefit of both the enterprise and the society\", giving priority to the development of education.

These excellent young people will be the most valuable resources of Hailiang Education, to provide the high-level educational and management services required by the cross-regional development of Hailiang Education in the future.\nThe International Cooperation with ELS Language Center and UK's Pate's Grammar School Will Speed Up Hailiang Education's Internationalization Process\nOn September 14 th , 2017, Hailiang Education signed a cooperation agreement with America's ELS language center to provide EAP program for Hailiang's students.
