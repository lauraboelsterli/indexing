Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4 percent to $2.98 (up 7 percent currency neutral) including a $0.04 per share contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition; Fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings per share results include an incremental $0.06 per share ($35 million pretax) impact from additional investments to drive accelerated growth in 2018 and beyond. Relative to the company's original outlook provided on February 17, 2017, full year 2017 earnings per share included a $0.19 (about $100 million pretax) impact from incremental investments; 2017 cash flow from operations reached approximately $1.5 billion and the company returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and, Revenue and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the transition quarter ending March 31, 2018 expected to approximate $2.9 billion and $0.65, respectively.\nGREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2017. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. This release refers to “reported” and “currency neutral” amounts, terms that are described under the heading “Currency Neutral - Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency.” Unless otherwise noted, “reported” and “currency neutral” amounts are the same. This release also refers to “continuing” and “discontinued” operations amounts, which are concepts described under the heading “Discontinued Operations - Nautica ® Brand Business, Licensing Business and Contemporary Brands.” Unless otherwise noted, results presented are based on continuing operations. This release also refers to “adjusted” amounts, terms that are described under the heading “Adjusted Amounts - Excluding Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker ® Transaction and Deal Related Expenses and the Impact of U.S. Tax Legislation.” Unless otherwise noted, “reported” and “adjusted” amounts are the same.\n“VF's fourth quarter results were stronger than we expected as growth continues to accelerate across core dimensions of our portfolio,” said Steve Rendle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We delivered a top-quartile total return for shareholders in 2017 and our strong performance provided us with the capacity to reinvest about $100 million back into our business. I am confident that our investments will accelerate growth and drive even stronger long term value for shareholders. We remain in the early phase of a multi-year journey to become a purpose led, agile, consumer centric organization. I am pleased with our early progress and look forward to building on our momentum in 2018.”\nCurrency Neutral - Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency\nThis release refers to “reported” amounts in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. This release also refers to “currency neutral” amounts, which exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.\nDiscontinued Operations - Nautica ® Brand Business, Licensing Business and Contemporary Brands\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reached the decision to sell its Nautica ® brand business and determined that it met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the company has classified the assets and liabilities of the Nautica ® brand business as held-for-sale and has included the results of this business in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nOn April 28, 2017, the company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group (LSG) business, including the Majestic ® brand. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the licensing business and completed the sale of the assets of the JanSport ® brand collegiate business in the fourth quarter of 2017. On August 26, 2016, the company completed the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses, which included the 7 For All Mankind ® , Splendid ® and Ella Moss ® brands. Accordingly, the company has removed the assets and liabilities of the licensing and the Contemporary Brands businesses as of the dates noted above and included the operating results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe company’s after-tax net loss from discontinued operations was $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes the operating results of the Nautica ® brand business, a noncash impairment charge to adjust the Nautica ® brand business to its estimated fair value, and the gain on sale of the assets of the JanSport ® brand collegiate business. The company's after-tax net loss from discontinued operations was $106 million for the full year 2017, which includes the loss on sale of the licensing business, the noncash impairment charges related to the Nautica ® brand business, and the operating results of the licensing and Nautica ® brand businesses.\nAdjusted Amounts - Excluding Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker ® Transaction and Deal Related Expenses and the Impact of U.S. Tax Legislation\nThis release refers to adjusted amounts that exclude transaction and deal related expenses associated with the acquisition of Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker ® . Total transaction and deal related expenses were $16 million and $21 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.\nAdjusted amounts in this release also exclude the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act reduces the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21 percent and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21 percent is also required. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of approximately $465 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Tax Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the Tax Act, these estimates may be adjusted during 2018.\nCombined, the above charges negatively impacted earnings per share by $1.19 for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. All adjusted amounts referenced herein exclude the effects of these amounts.\nReconciliations of measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identifies and quantifies all excluded items, and provides management’s view of why this information is useful to investors.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Income Statement Review\nRevenue increased 20 percent to $3.6 billion (up 18 percent currency neutral), including a $247 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, which closed on October 2, 2017. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, revenue increased 12 percent (up 10 percent currency neutral), driven by broad-based strength across VF’s international and direct-to-consumer platforms, Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and Workwear businesses. Gross margin improved 130 basis points to a quarterly record high of 51.5 percent, as benefits from pricing, lower restructuring costs, and a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses were partially offset by the Williamson-Dickie acquisition and changes in foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, gross margin increased 60 basis points to 51.6 percent. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, adjusted gross margin increased 140 basis points to 52.4 percent. Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted gross margin by 10 basis points. Operating income on a reported basis was $481 million. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased 6 percent to $497 million, including a $19 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 390 basis points to 13.2 percent. Adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points to 13.6 percent.

Fourth quarter loss per share was $0.18 on a reported basis, including a $1.16 negative impact from recent U.S. tax legislation. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 13 percent to $1.01, including a $0.04 contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Relative to the company's outlook provided on October 23, 2017, fourth quarter earnings per share included an incremental $0.06 ($35 million pretax) impact from additional investments to drive accelerated growth in 2018 and beyond.\nFiscal Year 2017 Income Statement Review\nRevenue increased 7 percent to $11.8 billion, including a $247 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, revenue increased 5 percent (up 4 percent currency neutral), driven by continued momentum in VF's international and direct-to-consumer platforms, Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and Workwear businesses. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to an annual record high of 50.5 percent, as benefits from pricing, lower product and restructuring costs, and a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses were partially offset by changes in foreign currency and the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. On an adjusted basis, gross margin increased 100 basis points to 50.5 percent. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points to 50.7 percent. Changes in foreign currency negatively affected gross margin by 60 basis points. Operating income on a reported basis increased 10 percent to $1.5 billion. Adjusted operating income decreased 2 percent to $1.5 billion, including a $19 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 30 basis points to 12.7 percent. Adjusted operating margin declined 120 basis points to 12.9 percent. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, adjusted operating margin declined 110 basis points to 13.0 percent. Changes in foreign currency negatively impacted operating margin by 50 basis points.

Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, inventories increased 3 percent. In 2017, VF’s cash flow from operations reached approximately $1.5 billion.

Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF from translating its foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars, and from entering foreign currency transactions. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present currency neutral financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. We use currency neutral information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of changes in the rates used to calculate foreign currency translation, and transaction gains and losses. Management believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparison of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses. To calculate foreign currency translation on a currency neutral basis, operating results for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period). Similarly, transaction gains and losses on a currency neutral basis are calculated using exchange rates from the comparable period of the prior year. These currency neutral performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The currency neutral information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nVF CORPORATION Supplemental Financial Information Business Segment Information – Currency Neutral Basis (Unaudited) (In thousands) Twelve Months Ended December 2017 As Reported Adjust for Foreign under GAAP Currency Exchange Currency Neutral Coalition revenues Outdoor & Action Sports $ 8,212,456 $ (45,711 ) $ 8,166,745 Jeanswear 2,655,361 (2,423 ) 2,652,938 Imagewear 830,215 (500 ) 829,715 Other 113,145 — 113,145 Total coalition revenues $ 11,811,177 $ (48,634 ) $ 11,762,543 Coalition profit (loss) Outdoor & Action Sports $ 1,378,294 $ 56,907 $ 1,435,201 Jeanswear 421,945 (3,886 ) 418,059 Imagewear 113,252 (1,796 ) 111,456 Other (3,086 ) — (3,086 ) Total coalition profit 1,910,405 51,225 1,961,630 Corporate and other expenses (408,030 ) 201 (407,829 ) Interest, net (85,880 ) — (85,880 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,416,495 $ 51,426 $ 1,467,921 Diluted earnings per share growth (30 )% 4 % (26 )% Currency Neutral Financial Information VF is a global company that reports financial information in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP.

Co. (“Williamson-Dickie”) acquisition and integration, $3.6 million ($2.9 million after-tax) of additional cost of goods sold recognized by Williamson-Dickie due to fair value inventory adjustments calculated as part of the purchase price accounting and $3.5 million ($3.1 million after-tax) of net benefit from the hedge of the purchase price and acquisition costs for the Icebreaker Holdings Limited acquisition. The diluted earnings per share impact was calculated using 400,378,000 shares. (b) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act reduces the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21% is also required. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of $465.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The diluted earnings per share impact was calculated using 400,378,000 and 403,559,000 shares for the three and twelve months ended December 2017, respectively. (c) The contribution from Williamson-Dickie represents the operating results from October 2, 2017 through December 30, 2017, excluding transaction and deal related costs. The income from continuing operations was calculated using a 20% tax rate and the diluted earnings per share impact was calculated using 400,378,000 and 403,559,000 shares for the three and twelve months ended December 2017, respectively. (d) Transaction and deal related costs for the twelve months ended December 2017 include $20.4 million ($17.1 million after-tax) of expenses related to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition and integration, $3.6 million ($2.9 million after-tax) of additional cost of goods sold recognized by Williamson-Dickie due to fair value inventory adjustments calculated as part of the purchase price accounting and $3.5 million ($3.1 million after-tax) of net benefit from the hedge of the purchase price and acquisition costs for the Icebreaker Holdings Limited acquisition. The diluted earnings per share impact was calculated using 403,559,000 shares. (e) Amounts shown in the table have been calculated using unrounded numbers. Non-GAAP Financial Information The financial information above has been presented on a GAAP basis, on an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of tax reform and transaction and deal related costs, and on an adjusted organic basis, which excludes the operating results of Williamson-Dickie from October 2, 2017 through December 30, 2017. These adjusted presentations are non-GAAP measures. Management believes these measures provide investors with useful supplemental information regarding VF's underlying business trends and the performance of VF's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. Management uses the above financial measures internally in its budgeting and review process and, in some cases, as a factor in determining compensation.
