Statements that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements. Certain of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"assumes,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"shall,\" \"will,\" \"seeks,\" \"targets,\" \"future,\" or other similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, and our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from results, performance or achievements expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the trading of our common stock, descriptions of management's strategy, plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions and descriptions of assumptions underlying any of the above matters and other statements that are not historical fact.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current beliefs, intentions and expectations and are not guarantees or indicative of future performance, nor should any conclusions be drawn or assumptions be made as to any potential outcome of any proposed transactions the Company considers.

New factors, risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, risks and uncertainties. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore any of these statements may prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the Company's objectives and plans will be achieved. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date such statements were made or any earlier date indicated, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in underlying assumptions or otherwise. If the Company were in any particular instance to update or correct a forward-looking statement, investors and others should not conclude that the Company would make additional updates or corrections thereafter.\nContact\nKimberly Perez\nSVP & Chief Accounting Officer\n813.421.7694\ninvestorrelations@ditech.com\nOr\nMichael Freitag / Andy Brimmer / Aaron Palash\nJoele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher\n(212) 355-4449\n1 As compared to the amount of outstanding corporate debt of the Company as of June 30, 2017.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walter-investment-management-corp-successfully-completes-financial-restructuring-300596533.html\nSOURCE Walter Investment Management Corp.",
