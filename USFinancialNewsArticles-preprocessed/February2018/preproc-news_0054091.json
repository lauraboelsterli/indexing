    "text": "GANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Germany shocked top-seeded Sweden 4-3 in overtime on Wednesday, beating the Swedes for the first time ever in Olympic play and booking a spot in the semi-final round of the menâ€™s ice hockey tournament.\nPatrick Reimer scored the game winner a minute and a half into the extra period.\nThe win means that Germany will contend for a medal which would be their first in more than four decades.\nSweden had beaten Germany 1-0 in the preliminary round last week.\nSince German unification in 1990, the Germans have never beaten Sweden in Olympic play, going 0-5. Even before that, the best result a German national team had earned against the Swedes in the Olympics was a 1-1 tie in 1984 at Sarajevo. East Germany were also winless, with a 0-1 record.\nThe last time a German team won a medal at the Olympics was 1976 in Innsbruck, Austria, when they won bronze.\nGermany will take on Canada in the semi-finals.
