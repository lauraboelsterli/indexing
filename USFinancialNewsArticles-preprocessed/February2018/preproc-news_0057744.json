    "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFourth quarter EPS of $0.22, including $0.08 benefit from U.S. tax reform, compared to EPS of $0.10 last year Gross margin expanded 220 basis points in the fourth quarter Net cash provided by operating activities of $167 million generated $118 million free cash flow in fiscal 2017\nChico's FAS, Inc. (NYSE: CHS) today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018.\nFor the fourteen weeks ended February 3, 2018 (\"the fourth quarter\"), the Company reported net income of $28.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net income of $13.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the thirteen weeks ended January 28, 2017 (\"last year's fourth quarter\"). Results for the fourth quarter include the favorable impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"U.S. tax reform\") of approximately $10 million after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, as well as the benefit of the 53 rd week of approximately $4 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share.\nFor the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018 (\"fiscal 2017\"), the Company reported net income of $101.0 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to net income of $91.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2017 (\"fiscal 2016\"). Results for fiscal 2017 include the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform of approximately $10 million after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share, as well as the benefit of the 53 rd week of approximately $4 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share. Results for fiscal 2016 include the unfavorable impact of restructuring and strategic charges and Boston Proper of $15.4 million after-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share.\n\"Our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrate clear progress in the execution of our strategic initiatives to drive improved performance and value creation,\" said Shelley Broader, CEO and President. \"In 2017, we strengthened our brands' positioning, enhanced the customer experience, maintained financial discipline and built a solid foundation for our next stage of profitable growth. We are excited about our sales-driving initiatives for 2018, and we are confident in our continued success.\"\nNet Sales\nFor the fourth quarter, net sales were $587.8 million compared to $600.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. This decrease of 2.2% primarily reflects a comparable sales decline of 5.2% as well as a decrease in selling square footage in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the $29 million benefit of the 53 rd week. The comparable sales decline consisted of lower average dollar sale and flat transaction count.\nFor fiscal 2017, net sales were $2.3 billion compared to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2016. This decrease of 7.8% primarily reflects a comparable sales decline of 7.7% as well as a decrease in selling square footage in fiscal 2017, partially offset by the $29 million benefit of the 53 rd week. The comparable sales decline consisted of lower average dollar sale and a decline in transaction count.\nComparable Sales (1)\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nFifty-Two Weeks Ended\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nJanuary 27, 2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nChico's\n(3.2)%\n(4.8)%\n(7.2)%\n(5.3)%\nWhite House Black Market\n(9.3)%\n(0.6)%\n(10.9)%\n(2.8)%\nSoma\n(2.3)%\n0.4%\n(1.5)%\n0.5%\nTotal Company\n(5.2)%\n(2.5)%\n(7.7)%\n(3.7)%\n(1) The 53 rd week is excluded from comparable sales calculations.\nGross Margin\nFor the fourth quarter, gross margin was $221.6 million, or 37.7% of net sales, compared to $213.4 million, or 35.5% of net sales, in last year's fourth quarter. This 220 basis point increase primarily reflects a 170 basis point improvement in merchandise margin driven by lower average unit costs and a reduction in store occupancy costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") were $192.0 million, or 32.7% of net sales, compared to $192.0 million, or 31.9% of net sales, for last year's fourth quarter. SG&A in the fourth quarter reflects a $13 million decline in store-related costs and marketing, primarily offset by the impact of the 53 rd week.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe fourth quarter effective tax rate was 4.4% which included an approximate $10 million benefit resulting from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, the fourth quarter effective tax rate was 37.7% compared to 35.4% for last year's fourth quarter. The fiscal 2017 effective tax rate was 29.7%. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, the fiscal 2017 effective tax rate was 36.4%.\nInventories\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, inventories totaled $233.7 million compared to $232.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Inventories at the end of the fourth quarter include a $16.5 million increase due to a change in shipping terms with a supplier in fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of the change in shipping terms, inventories decreased 6.5% reflecting continued inventory management.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, under its $300.0 million share repurchase program announced in November 2015, the Company repurchased 0.2 million shares for $1.7 million, at a weighted average of $8.66 per share with $136.2 million remaining under the program. During fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares for $27.4 million, at a weighted average of $10.16 per share.\n2018 Full-Year Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company is anticipating a low single-digit decline in consolidated comparable sales with comparable sales performance stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half.\nThe Company expects gross margin expansion in the range of 125 to 150 basis points over fiscal 2017, driven by decreased average unit costs and planned improvement in promotions. The Company also anticipates SG&A expenses to be approximately flat compared to fiscal 2017.\nThe Company estimates a fiscal 2018 tax rate in the range of 26% to 28%. The rate includes the benefit of the new 21% federal rate, partially offset by additional expenses due to changes in the deductibility of executive compensation and a lower benefit from state tax deductions.\nIn addition, the Company anticipates 2018 capital expenditures to be $70 million to $80 million, primarily driven by store reinvestments and technology enhancements.\nABOUT CHICO'S FAS, INC.\nThe Company, through its brands – Chico's, White House Black Market and Soma, is a leading omni-channel specialty retailer of women's private branded, sophisticated, casual-to-dressy clothing, intimates and complementary accessories.\nAs of February 3, 2018, the Company operated 1,460 stores in the US and Canada and sold merchandise through 94 franchise locations in Mexico.

unvested share-based payment awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities. As a result, such awards are required to be included in the calculation of earnings per common share pursuant to the \"two-class\" method. For the Company, participating securities are composed entirely of unvested restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\") that have met their relevant performance criteria.\nNet income per share is determined using the two-class method when it is more dilutive than the treasury stock method. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, including participating securities. Diluted net income per share reflects the dilutive effect of potential common shares from non-participating securities such as stock options, PSUs and restricted stock units. For the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018 and thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended January 28, 2017, potential common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS to the extent they were antidilutive.\nThe following unaudited table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share shown on the face of the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nFourteen\nWeeks Ended\nThirteen Weeks\nEnded\nFifty-Three\nWeeks Ended\nFifty-Two\nWeeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2018\nJanuary 28,\n2017\nFebruary 3,\n2018\nJanuary 28, 2017\nNumerator\nNet income\n$\n27,975\n$\n13,508\n$\n101,000\n$\n91,229\nNet income and dividends declared allocated to participating securities\n(617)\n(258)\n(2,300)\n(1,915)\nNet income available to common shareholders\n$\n27,358\n$\n13,250\n$\n98,700\n$\n89,314\nDenominator\nWeighted average common shares outstanding – basic\n124,747\n126,489\n125,341\n128,995\nDilutive effect of non-participating securities\n61\n416\n62\n242\nWeighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding – diluted\n124,808\n126,905\n125,403\n129,237\nNet income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.79\n$\n0.69\nDiluted\n$\n0.22\n$\n0.10\n$\n0.79\n$\n0.69\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\n(Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nSEC Regulation G - The Company reports its consolidated financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, to supplement these consolidated financial results, management believes that certain non-GAAP results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, GAAP measures.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which the Company defines as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow, when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash for discretionary and non-discretionary items after deducting purchases of property and equipment.\nFree cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities on a GAAP basis to free cash flow on a non-GAAP basis for the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018 is presented in the table below:\nChico's FAS, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nFifty-Three Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n166,873\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment, net\n(48,530)\nFree cash flow\n$\n118,343\nChico's FAS, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nStore Count and Square Footage\nFourteen Weeks Ended February 3, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nOctober 28, 2017\nNew Stores\nClosures\nFebruary 3, 2018\nStore count:\nChico's frontline boutiques\n576\n—\n(8)\n568\nChico's outlets\n117\n4\n(1)\n120\nChico's Canada\n4\n—\n—\n4\nWHBM frontline boutiques\n412\n—\n(8)\n404\nWHBM outlets\n69\n—\n—\n69\nWHBM Canada\n6\n—\n—\n6\nSoma frontline boutiques\n271\n1\n(2)\n270\nSoma outlets\n19\n—\n—\n19\nTotal Chico's FAS, Inc.\n1,474\n5\n(19)\n1,460\nOctober 28, 2017\nNew Stores\nClosures\nOther changes in SSF\nFebruary 3, 2018\nNet selling square footage (SSF):\nChico's frontline boutiques\n1,577,849\n—\n(22,561)\n383\n1,555,671\nChico's outlets\n294,257\n9,826\n(2,309)\n314\n302,088\nChico's Canada\n9,695\n—\n—\n—\n9,695\nWHBM frontline boutiques\n958,030\n—\n(18,424)\n—\n939,606\nWHBM outlets\n143,918\n—\n—\n45\n143,963\nWHBM Canada\n14,891\n—\n—\n—\n14,891\nSoma frontline boutiques\n513,548\n1,693\n(3,252)\n—\n511,989\nSoma outlets\n35,541\n—\n—\n—\n35,541\nTotal Chico's FAS, Inc.\n3,547,729\n11,519\n(46,546)\n742\n3,513,444\nAs of February 3, 2018 the Company also sold merchandise through 94 international franchise locations.\nChico's FAS, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nStore Count and Square Footage\nFifty-Three Weeks Ended February 3, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nJanuary 28, 2017\nNew Stores\nClosures\nFebruary 3, 2018\nStore count:\nChico's frontline boutiques\n587\n—\n(19)\n568\nChico's outlets\n116\n5\n(1)\n120\nChico's Canada\n4\n—\n—\n4\nWHBM frontline boutiques\n423\n—\n(19)\n404\nWHBM outlets\n71\n—\n(2)\n69\nWHBM Canada\n6\n—\n—\n6\nSoma frontline boutiques\n275\n2\n(7)\n270\nSoma outlets\n19\n—\n—\n19\nTotal Chico's FAS, Inc.\n1,501\n7\n(48)\n1,460\nJanuary 28, 2017\nNew Stores\nClosures\nOther changes in SSF\nFebruary 3, 2018\nNet selling square footage (SSF):\nChico's frontline boutiques\n1,606,730\n—\n(47,279)\n(3,780)\n1,555,671\nChico's outlets\n291,455\n12,163\n(2,309)\n779\n302,088\nChico's Canada\n9,695\n—\n—\n—\n9,695\nWHBM frontline boutiques\n984,754\n—\n(45,692)\n544\n939,606\nWHBM outlets\n148,457\n—\n(4,316)\n(178)\n143,963\nWHBM Canada\n14,891\n—\n—\n—\n14,891\nSoma frontline boutiques\n519,945\n3,882\n(12,885)\n1,047\n511,989\nSoma outlets\n35,637\n—\n—\n(96)\n35,541\nTotal Chico's FAS, Inc.\n3,611,564\n16,045\n(112,481)\n(1,684)\n3,513,444\nAs of February 3, 2018 the Company also sold merchandise through 94 international franchise locations.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chicos-fas-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2017-results-300605332.html\nSOURCE Chico's FAS, Inc.",
