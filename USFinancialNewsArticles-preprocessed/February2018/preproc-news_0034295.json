    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sanchez Energy Corporation (“Sanchez Energy” or the “Company”) announced today that it has closed its private offering to eligible purchasers of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior secured first lien notes due 2023 (the “senior notes”) at an offering price equal to 98.973% of par. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $483 million, after deducting initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. Sanchez Energy intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay total outstanding borrowings, and accrued interest and fees, under its and its restricted subsidiaries’ revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The senior notes are senior secured first lien obligations of Sanchez Energy and are guaranteed on a senior secured first lien basis by each of the Company’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. In connection with the closing of the offering, the Company has amended and restated its credit facility by, among other things, (i) reducing the size from the prior $350 million borrowing base with a $300 million aggregate commitment amount to a $25 million commitment to provide primarily for letters of credit and working capital, (ii) extending the maturity from 2019 to 2023, (iii) removing all material financial maintenance covenants and (iv) providing for the continued ability to hedge.\nThe securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
