According to the OECD over 56 percent of adults in the Great White North have earned some kind of education after high school.\nDuring the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suggested that Canadians' education was the nation's greatest resource.\n\"We need education to enable people to learn, think, and adapt,\" he said. \"Our natural resources are important, and they always will be. But Canadians know that what it takes to grow and prosper isn't just what's under our feet, it's what between our ears.\"\nCanada is followed by highly-educated countries like Japan, Isreal and Korea.\nThe United States ranked sixth on the OECD's list. According to the OECD, 45.7 percent of American adults between the ages of 25 and 64 have completed some kind of tertiary education in the form of a two-year degree, four-year degree or vocational program. The U.S. Census estimates that about 33 percent of American adults possess a bachelor's degree or more.\nLike this story?
