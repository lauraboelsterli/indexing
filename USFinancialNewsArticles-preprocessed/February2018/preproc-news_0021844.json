The 159% increase in revenues was driven by increases of 297% in mass notification system sales and 128% in AHD sales. Revenues increased in all of the Company's geographic sales regions, led by a $4.5 million improvement in the Americas, to $6.1 million, versus $1.6 million for the same period a year ago.\nOperating Income : Operating income was $1.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to an operating loss of $1.3 million for the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit improved to $4.0 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.2 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher sales and better fixed overhead absorption.\nNet Loss: In connection with the recent passage of the U.S. “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, the Company recorded non-cash tax charges of $2.7 million related to a $2.5 million re-measurement of the Company’s Federal net deferred tax assets at the new lower statutory rate, and $0.2 million in quarterly income tax expense. As a result, the Company reported a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.05 per share, for the fiscal first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.03 per share, for the fiscal first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet : Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.3 million to $15.1 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $12.8 million reported at September 30, 2017. Higher cash and cash equivalents were primarily due to $1.8 million of cash generated from operations during the quarter. Working capital totaled $26.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $25.4 million at September 30, 2017.\n“The 273% increase in revenues in the Americas and growth in international revenues over the same quarter a year ago, produced another strong quarter,” remarked Richard S. Danforth, Chief Executive Officer of LRAD Corporation. “Bookings for the quarter were also up in all our geographic sales regions compared to the same period last year, totaling $6.8 million, a 36% increase from fiscal Q1 2017. Backlog at December 31, 2017 remained strong at $11.4 million.”\nSelect Fiscal First Quarter 2018 Operating and Business Highlights\nAnnounced our largest order for the U.S. Air Force, a $1.0 million LRAD 500X-RE systems and accessories order for domestic and international U.S. Air Force bases. Received $870,000 in AHD orders for the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. Announced a $1.1 million follow-on AHD order from Southeast Asia for border and maritime security. Received a $1.5 million follow-on LRAD 360XT order from one of the largest oil & gas companies in Eurasia. The mobile mass notification systems are being equipped with our solar power option and integrated with a gas detection alarm system.\n“Last month’s acquisition of mass messaging software solutions provider Genasys Holding S.L. (“Genasys”) enables LRAD to now compete in the fastest growing segment of the mass notification industry,” continued Danforth. “We are working with the experienced Genasys team to incorporate its SMS-based distributed recipient technology with our advanced ONE VOICE ® systems to provide fully integrated, turnkey mass notification solutions.”\nDanforth concluded, “With our positive bookings trend and strong backlog, we are on track for fiscal year-over-year revenue growth.”\nWe include in this press release Non-GAAP operational metrics of bookings and backlog, which we believe provide helpful information to investors with respect to evaluating the Company’s performance. We consider bookings and backlog as leading indicators of future revenues and use these metrics to support production planning. Bookings is an internal, operational metric that measures the total dollar value of customer purchase orders executed in a period, regardless of the timing of the related revenue recognition. Backlog is a measure of purchase orders received that have not been shipped but are planned to ship within the next 12 months.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss fiscal first quarter 2018 financial results this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. E.T.
