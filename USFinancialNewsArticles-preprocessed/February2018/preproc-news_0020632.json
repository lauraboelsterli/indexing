    "text": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - Trucking firm Old Dominion Freight Line Inc reported a higher quarterly net income on Thursday, driven by a strengthening economy and higher prices it charges for the freight it carries because of tightening industry capacity.\nThe Thomasville, North Carolina-based company announced fourth-quarter earnings of profit of $197.25 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared with $68.51 million, or 83 cents per diluted share in the year-ago period.\nWall Street analysts on average expected $1.12 per share.
