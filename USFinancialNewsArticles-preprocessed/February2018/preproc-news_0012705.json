Where other conventional and “natural” cleaning products over-clean and destroy healthy microbes our bodies and environments need, Aunt Fannie’s family of products gets rid of the bad and nurtures the good, promoting a healthy balance with our bodies and indoor environments. Born out of a years-long journey to understand and resolve his family’s mysterious and life-threatening medical conditions, Mat Franken founded Aunt Fannie’s in 2013 with a mission to educate and enlighten us to what our ancestors understood. That a chemical-filled, hyper-sanitized home destroys the beneficial, human-friendly microorganisms our homes and families need for health and balance. Mat and his team have developed a family of microbiomic cleaning and pest solutions that all received the highest rating by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), out-ranking competing brands, based on the safety of the ingredients used and comprehensive ingredient disclosure. Aunt Fannie’s can be found in more than 1,600 retailers nationwide, including Target, Whole Foods, Bed Bath & Beyond, Safeway, Albertson’s, H-E-B Grocery Stores and Hy-Vee.
