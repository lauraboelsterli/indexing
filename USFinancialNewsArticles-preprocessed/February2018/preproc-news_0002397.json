    "text": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - India will allow unrestricted export of onions, the government said in an order on Friday, as prices of the politically-sensitive vegetable fell over a third in a month.\nThe worldâ€™s biggest exporter of onion had imposed curbs on overseas sales late last year in an attempt to soften local prices.\nIn November, the government set a minimum price of $850 per tonne for overseas sale of onions, but subsequently reduced it to $700 per tonne.\nUnrestricted exports from India could soften prices in key importing countries such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka, traders said.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
