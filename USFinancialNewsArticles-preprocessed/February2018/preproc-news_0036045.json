    "text": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Star Entertainment Group Ltd, Australiaâ€™s second-largest casino operator, reported a slump in half-year net profit as an unusually poor rate of house wins outweighed a recovery in the number of wealthy Chinese gamblers.\nIts net profit was A$32.9 million for the six months to Dec. 31, the company said on Friday, lower than the A$89 million average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company declared an interim dividend of 7.5 cents per share, unchanged from the previous year.
