    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NEC Display Solutions, a leading provider of commercial LCD display and projector solutions, announced today that CRN ®, a brand of The Channel Company , has named Richard Hutton, Senior Director Channel Marketing, and Betsy Larson, Vice President of Channel Sales, to its prestigious list of 2018 Channel Chiefs. The executives on this annual list represent top leaders in the IT channel who excel at driving growth and revenue in their organization through channel partners.\nChannel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the IT channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding channel partner programs.\nIn his first year at NEC Display, Hutton has focused on the ease of doing business, including simplifying the measurement of back-end programs for partners and ensuring that incentives are paid quickly. For example, he has led efforts to simplify claim processing for partner incentives, leading to more than 90 percent of claims being paid within four calendar days of claiming. Hutton has also travelled extensively to visit with partners and to listen to their concerns and successes. The Reseller Council continues to inform the channel strategy of the company, especially in Hutton’s drive to improve processes for partners in pricing and service.\nLarson has spent many years developing relationships built on trust and mutual success. She and NEC Display pride themselves on listening and understanding partners’ needs and the ability to quickly adjust to the changing needs of the channel to ensure profitable growth. In the last year, she has refined the NEC Display channel sales support efforts to strengthen valued channel relationships by increasing both inside and outside channel sales coverage.\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\n“The channel continues to evolve and change, and that’s what makes it so fascinating to be a part of,” said Hutton. “I’m convinced, innovative technology aside, the vendors that continue to simplify will be the ones who win. Why is Amazon Prime so huge? Is it the choice from millions of vendors or the free freight? No, it’s because it’s easy.”\n“I’m thrilled to be part of the NEC Display channel sales organization,” said Larson. “I enjoy contributing to NEC’s successes in understanding our partners’ strengthens and needs and helping the company to better support our partners and their solutions.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nFollow the Channel Company: Twitter , LinkedIn and Facebook\nTweet This: @TheChannelCo names @NEC_Display 's @RichardHutton67 and @BetsyatNEC to @CRN 2018 Channel Chiefs list #CRNChannelChiefs www.crn.com/channelchiefs\nAbout NEC Display Solutions of America, Inc.\nNEC Display Solutions of America, Inc., a leading designer and provider of innovative displays, offers the widest range of products on the market, such as commercial- and professional-grade large-screen LCD displays, desktop LCD monitors, direct view LED displays, a diverse line of multimedia and digital cinema projectors, and integrated display solutions.
