    "text": "Published: Feb 23, 2018 5:14 p.m. ET Share \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday signed off on security plans for converting a consular facility in Jerusalem Bloomberg News Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp., at a press conference in 2016 in Macau. \nBy Felicia Schwartz \nWASHINGTON—The State Department will open its embassy in Jerusalem in May and is entertaining an unusual offer from Sheldon Adelson, Republican Party donor and casino magnate, to help pay for a new facility after an initial move from Tel Aviv, U.S. officials said. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson late Thursday signed off on security plans for converting a consular facility in Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood. Officials said they are eyeing a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 14 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s declaring independence. \n“We are excited about taking this historic step, and look forward with anticipation to the May opening,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. \nAt first, David Friedman, U.S. ambassador to Israel, and a small group of aides will begin working from the facility. Next, the State Department will begin retrofitting that complex to accommodate more officials, and the department has begun efforts to plan and locate a site for a new embassy facility in Jerusalem. Adelson has offered to contribute to the effort to build a new embassy, but the discussions are informal so far. \nState Department officials are examining whether the U.S. could accept such a gift. Adelson’s offer was earlier reported by the Associated Press. A representative to Adelson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",
