    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that Russia launched an anti-U.S. campaign ahead of the 2016 election, but in a message on Twitter sent after Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged more than a dozen Russians with meddling in the election, Trump said his campaign did nothing wrong.\n“Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!” Trump said in a tweet.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; editing by Grant McCool\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
