    "text": "PRAGUE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Betting firm Fortuna investor Templeton Emerging Markets Group said on Wednesday that offer by majority holder Fortbet for all Fortuna stock and a plan to delist the firm did not fully reflect the company’s fair value.\nTempleton advises to holders of 10.6 percent of Fortuna stock.\n“The Templeton Emerging Markets Group, a unit of Templeton Asset Management Ltd. believes that the revised price per share offered does not fully reflect the fair value of the company,” it said in a statement.\nFortbet, part of Czech-Slovak investment group Penta Investments and holder of 79.8 percent in the firm prior to the buyout, offered 182.5 crowns per Fortuna share.\nThat valued the firm at 9.49 billion crowns ($447.83 million).\nSubscription runs until Feb. 23 and Fortuna was due to hold a general meeting on Feb. 15 on delisting the stock from the Prague and Warsaw exchanges.
