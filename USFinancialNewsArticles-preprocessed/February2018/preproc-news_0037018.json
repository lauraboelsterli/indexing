    "text": "BURLINGAME, Calif., Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Roobot , an industry leading Personal Shopping Assistant for retailers, manufacturers and service providers, today named David Rich and John Hardigree, who pioneered the use of predictive analytics at Accenture and Revolution Analytics (now part of Microsoft) as Executive Advisors. John, who is also an investor in the company, will play a key role joining the Board of Directors. And, together they will work with existing leadership to expand the company's partner ecosystem, enhance its strategic vision and help the company operationalize its vision for significantly improving the shopper experience for its clients.\nRich is Chairman and CEO of DBR & Associates, an independent consulting and advisory firm, where he, Hardigree and others focus on a portfolio of C-suite agenda topics such as \"Digital/Business Transformation\" nextgen \"Marketing Automation Platforms \", \"Artificial Intelligence/Analytics Applications\" and \"Virtual Reality Solutions\", as well as operationalizing \"Growth/Exit Strategies\". Prior to forming DBR & Associates, Rich and Hardigree successfully grew Revolution Analytics, the global leader in Open Source R (predictive analytics) tools, where they served as Executive Chairman/CEO and CBDO respectively, (as well as investors).
