Our outstanding execution drove a substantial increase in profitability from the third quarter. For full year 2017, Archrock Partners grew operating horsepower by 82,000 horsepower and drove new orders at elevated levels throughout the year.”\n“We are entering 2018 with a record backlog of new starts. Our focus in the coming year will be on the profitable execution of our growth plans, as well as closing the merger of Archrock and Archrock Partners to further strengthen our platform,” continued Childers. “In the first quarter of 2018, we implemented a price increase on the eligible portion of our installed base of horsepower and we have seen a substantial recovery in spot pricing, especially on large horsepower applications. During 2018, Archrock and Archrock Partners together expect to invest $200 to $220 million of growth capital into high demand large horsepower units to meet our customers’ needs. We expect that the efficient execution of our operations, recovering prices, and meaningful investment into our fleet will translate into improved earnings in 2018.”\n“In addition, the Energy Information Administration has forecasted that 2018 will have the largest increase in year-over-year growth of U.S. natural gas production on record, with additional growth into the next decade. Based on this forecast and initial production estimates for 2017, it appears that the leading edge of a substantial growth period for U.S. natural production has arrived. We believe U.S. natural gas production growth will drive demand for our services, and we intend to profitably capture this opportunity,” concluded Childers.\nNet income, excluding the item listed in the following sentence, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted common unit.
