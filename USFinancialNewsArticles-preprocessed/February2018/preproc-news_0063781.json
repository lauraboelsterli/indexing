    "text": "WESTMONT, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gamma Technologies, LLC, a software company and the maker of GT-SUITE, the leading multi-physics CAE system simulation tool serving the automotive and related industries, announced today that it has acquired the AutoLion® battery modeling software business from EC Power.\nAutoLion is the industry’s most advanced Li-ion battery simulation software used by battery suppliers and OEMs for both 1D and 3D battery analysis and design. It is a predictive, physics-based, simulation tool that models internal battery electrochemical processes, thus allowing fast evaluation of a wide range of battery chemistries (including mixed chemistries) and cell designs under even extreme conditions. It also models chemistry-specific degradation mechanisms and allows prediction of battery aging over a wide range of operating conditions, as well as battery safety simulation (resistance to abuse). In addition to the advanced simulation capabilities, AutoLion includes a comprehensive electrochemical database for many different materials and chemistries used in Li-ion batteries, reducing the burden for laboratory testing for electrochemical properties.\nAs a result, GT users can now access this battery modeling tool under the name AutoLion-GT, integrated into GT-SUITE and also directly with our new GT-DRIVE+ solution, for direct application to electrified vehicle systems and battery thermal modeling. This allows the use of these fast-running battery models as an integral part of vehicle system simulations to model battery performance and predict battery life.\nAnnouncing the acquisition, Dr. Thomas Morel, CEO and President of Gamma Technologies said, “This development exemplifies our commitment to our customers and users of GT-SUITE/GT-DRIVE+, by enhancing its already strong capabilities for modeling electrification concepts such as hybrids, battery electrics and fuel-cell vehicles. This combination strengthens the position of Gamma Technologies as the leading supplier of simulation tools for xEV development.”\nCommenting on the transaction, Prof. Chao-Yang Wang, Founder and Chairman of EC Power explained, “As a result of the research effort that we have invested in the creation of AutoLion, it is today the leading tool among battery researchers and suppliers globally. We feel that now is the right time to take AutoLion to the next level with GT, who are well positioned as a market-leader to introduce it to all OEMs as a part of a whole vehicle simulation.”\nA long-term agreement between ECP, Prof. Wang and GT assures an on-going cooperation to satisfy emerging customer needs through continued development of AutoLion and its adaptation to new technologies.\nAbout Gamma Technologies\nGamma Technologies, LLC. develops and licenses GT-SUITE, a leading multi-physics CAE system simulation software. GT-SUITE includes a complete library of physics-based modeling templates covering fluid flow, thermal systems, mechanics, electrics, magnetics, chemistry and controls. It supports the entire development cycle from concept to validation thanks to its modular architecture, adjustable model fidelity and open interface. GT-SUITE applications include a wide variety of engineering systems such as conventional and hybrid vehicles, powertrains and drivelines, engines, motors, compressors, catalysts, chemistry, acoustics, cooling, thermal management, HVAC, hydraulics, fuel systems, lubrication, mechanical systems, etc. ( www.gtisoft.com )\nAbout EC Power\nBased in State College, Pennsylvania, EC Power invents and develops a new paradigm of high-power, high-energy, long-lasting, fast charging, and safe batteries for vehicle electrification, renewable energy storage, and consumer electronics. EC Power is the inventor of the All-Climate Battery (ACB) technology (self-heating cell concept), which has received wide interest from and been licensed to vehicle OEMs and battery manufacturers globally. EC Power maintains a battery prototyping factory in Philipsburg, PA for innovative product development ( www.ecpowergroup.com ).\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006287/en/\nGamma Technologies\nDana Pellegrini, 630-325-5848\nMarketing Associate\nD.Pellegrini@gtisoft.com\nSource: Gamma Technologies, LLC.",
