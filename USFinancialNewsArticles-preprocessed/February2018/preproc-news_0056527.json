    "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Norsk Hydro has made a $345 million binding offer to buy a Rio Tinto aluminum plant in Iceland in its drive to produce more aluminum using renewable energy sources and bolster its position in Europe.\nThe deal would raise its capacity to produce primary aluminum by 210,000 tonnes to 2.4 million tonnes this year, it said. It will enable Norsk to produce more than 70 percent of its aluminum using renewable energy versus two-thirds of its output in November.\nIceland generates all its electricity from hydropower and geothermal energy.\nNorsk Hydro in November launched a low-carbon brand of aluminum and expected customers ranging from carmakers to packaging firms to pay a premium to help slow climate change. Producing aluminum requires great amounts of energy.\n“Having presence across the value chain is essential to create value from this growth and promote sustainable practices in our global operations,” Norsk Hydro CEO Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said in a statement.\nThe Icelandic plant also delivers 230,000 tonnes of extrusion ingot used in the European construction and transport sectors, from a newly built casthouse.\n“This will further strengthen Hydro’s position as the preferred and leading extrusion ingot supplier in Europe,” the company said.\nThe transaction, which also includes Rio Tinto’s 53-percent stake in an anode facility in the Netherlands and its 50-percent stake in an aluminum fluoride plant in Sweden, is expected to close in the second quarter.\nWriting by Gwladys Fouche; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
