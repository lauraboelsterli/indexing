Tenneco’s value-add revenue growth outpaced underlying industry production growth in all OE applications.

The company expects organic growth to outpace the industry with revenues driven by the ramp up of recently launched programs and Tenneco’s strong position on light vehicle platforms globally, double-digit year-over-year growth in commercial truck and off-highway revenues and a solid contribution from the global aftermarket.\nFull year 2018 and Mid-Term Revenue Outlook\nIn 2018, the company expects 5% organic growth, outpacing industry production by 3 percentage points, with increases in both the Ride Performance and Clean Air product lines. The company expects organic growth to be driven by:\nContent growth on light and commercial vehicle platforms; The continued industry recovery in regulated off-highway regions.\nAssumptions for the 2018 revenue outlook include:\nGlobal industry light vehicle production +2%** Global commercial truck production about flat** Off-highway engine production in regulated regions up by low double-digits** Organic growth is net of OE price downs Substrates estimated at 24% - 25% of total revenue\nIn 2019 and 2020, Tenneco expects revenue growth will continue to outpace industry production. In those years, the company expects organic growth of 6% - 8% in 2019, and 5% - 7% in 2020, including the current forecasted global light vehicle production growth of 2% in each year.\n“Tenneco is well-positioned to accelerate our proven track record of growth,” said Kesseler. “We expect our diverse business portfolio and multiple, sustainable growth drivers will continue to drive results that support investments in future growth and enhance returns to shareholders.”\nIn 2018, Tenneco expects:\nCapital expenditures between $380 million and $410 million; Annual interest expense between $75 million and $80 million; Cash taxes between $105 million and $125 million; Full year tax rate between 23% and 25%.\n*Year-over-year earnings comparisons reflect revisions to prior period financial results for certain immaterial adjustments as described in Tenneco’s form 10K/A for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n** Industry production estimates based on IHS Automotive January 2018 global light vehicle production forecast, Power Systems Research (PSR) January 2018 global commercial truck and bus production report and customer production schedules and Tenneco estimates for off-highway engine production in North America and Europe.\nAttachment 1\nStatements of Income – 3 Months\nStatements of Income – 12 Months\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Cash Flows – 3 Months\nStatements of Cash Flows – 12 Months\nAttachment 2\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to EBITDA including noncontrolling interests – 3 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Measures – 3 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to EBITDA including noncontrolling interests – 12 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Measures – 12 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue Measures – 3 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue Measures – 12 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue Measures – 3 Months and 12 Months\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures – Debt Net of Cash/Adjusted LTM EBITDA including noncontrolling interests\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue Measures – Original Equipment and Aftermarket Revenue – 3 Months and 12 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue and Earnings to Non-GAAP Revenue and Earnings Measures – 3 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue and Earnings to Non-GAAP Revenue and Earnings Measures – 12 Months\nReconciliation of GAAP Revenue to Non-GAAP Revenue Measures – Original Equipment Commercial Truck, Off-Highway and other revenues – 3 Months and 12 Months\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe company will host a conference call on Friday, February 9, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.

Adjustments similar to the ones reflected above have been recorded in earlier periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Using only the non-GAAP earnings measures to analyze earnings would have material limitations because its calculation is based on the subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that investors may find material. Management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings measures reflected above to understand and analyze the results of the business.

(1) Tenneco presents debt net of cash balances because management believes it is a useful measure of Tenneco's credit position and progress toward reducing leverage. The calculation is limited in that the company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\n(2) EBITDA including noncontrolling interests represents income before interest expense, income taxes, noncontrolling interests and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests is not a calculation based upon generally accepted accounting principles. The amounts included in the EBITDA including noncontrolling interests calculation, however, are derived from amounts included in the historical statements of income data. In addition, EBITDA including noncontrolling interests should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to Tenneco Inc. or operating income as an indicator of the company's operating performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Tenneco has presented EBITDA including noncontrolling interests because it regularly reviews EBITDA including noncontrolling interests as a measure of the company's performance. In addition, Tenneco believes its investors utilize and analyze the company's EBITDA including noncontrolling interests for similar purposes. Tenneco also believes EBITDA including noncontrolling interests assists investors in comparing a company's performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. However, the EBITDA including noncontrolling interests measure presented may not always be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the components of the calculation. (3) Adjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests is presented in order to reflect the results in a manner that allows a better understanding of operational activities separate from the financial impact of decisions made for the long term benefit of the company and other items impacting comparability between the periods. Similar adjustments to EBITDA including noncontrolling interests have been recorded in earlier periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. The company believes investors find the non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the company's financial results in any particular period. (4) Tenneco presents the above reconciliation of the ratio of debt net of cash to LTM adjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests to show trends that investors may find useful in understanding the company's ability to service its debt. For purposes of this calculation, LTM adjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests is used as an indicator of the company's performance and debt net of cash is presented as an indicator of the company's credit position and progress toward reducing the company's financial leverage. This reconciliation is provided as supplemental information and not intended to replace the company's existing covenant ratios or any other financial measures that investors may find useful in describing the company's financial position. See notes (1), (2) and (3) for a description of the limitations of using debt net of cash, EBITDA including noncontrolling interests and adjusted EBITDA including noncontrolling interests.\nATTACHMENT 2\nTENNECO INC.

Additionally, substrate sales include precious metals pricing, which may be volatile. Substrate sales occur when, at the direction of its OE customers, Tenneco purchases catalytic converters or components thereof from suppliers, uses them in its manufacturing processes and sells them as part of the completed system. While Tenneco original equipment customers assume the risk of this volatility, it impacts reported revenue. Excluding substrate sales removes this impact.
