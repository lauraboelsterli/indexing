    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: HIBB):\nComparable Store Sales Increase 1.6% in Fourth Quarter Estimated Impacts Provided for Tax Reform, Sale of Team Division, and 53 rd Week on Fiscal 2019 Revenue Comparisons\nHibbett Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: HIBB), an athletic specialty retailer, today provided the following business updates:\nPreliminary Unaudited Fourth Quarter Results\nThe fourth quarter and Fiscal 2018 ended on February 3, 2018, with the fourth quarter including 14 weeks of results and Fiscal 2018 including 53 weeks of results. Net sales for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, increased 8.0% to $266.7 million (including $13.5 million for the 53 rd week) compared with $246.9 million for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. Comparable store sales increased 1.6%. E-commerce sales represented 7.6% of total sales for the fourth quarter.\nBased on preliminary fourth quarter results, earnings per diluted share for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, are expected to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.51 compared with $0.54 reported for the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. This range includes an estimated gain on the sale of the Company’s Team Division of $0.07 per diluted share. The effect of tax reform is not expected to have a significant impact in the fourth quarter.\nJeff Rosenthal, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Results exceeded expectations for the quarter, driven by strength in branded apparel and footwear, and continued acceleration in our e-commerce business. As expected, the holiday season was very promotional, and we continued to take markdowns to reduce aged inventory. This resulted in continued gross margin pressure for the quarter, but allowed us to finish the year in a much better inventory position. Further details about sales trends and our future outlook will be discussed when we report fourth quarter results on March 16, 2018.”\nPreliminary Fiscal 2019 Outlook\nThe Company is providing preliminary guidance for Fiscal 2019 regarding tax reform legislation, the sale the Company’s Team Division, and the effect of the 53 rd week on revenue comparisons.\nTax Reform\nAs a result of recent tax reform changes, the Company’s federal tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% starting in January 2018. Although the legislation included other changes, this element will represent the most significant impact for the Company going forward. For Fiscal 2019, the Company expects to reallocate approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million of the tax savings into SG&A spending to benefit our team members and to enable continued investments in our omni-channel capability. The remainder will directly benefit net income.\nSale of Team Division\nDue to the sale of the Company’s Team Division in Fiscal 2018, the following effects will be realized in Fiscal 2019:\nRevenue will be negatively impacted by $7.6 million. The effect on earnings per diluted share is not expected to be material. The limited impact on earnings is a result of a decrease in annual earnings of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share due to the loss in revenue, offset by an expected gain when final deal contingencies are satisfied in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019.\nEffect of 53 rd Week on Revenue Comparisons\nDue to the 53 rd week in Fiscal 2018, each quarter in Fiscal 2019 starts one week later than the same quarter in Fiscal 2018. Due to this shift, revenue comparisons versus the prior year will be affected, most notably in the second and third quarters due to the timing of back-to-school sales. Second quarter will gain a week of back-to-school sales, and third quarter will lose a week of back-to-school sales. The chart below presents comparable store sales and net sales for Fiscal 2018 sales as originally reported, and adjusted to reflect the Fiscal 2019 calendar:\nFISCAL 2018 First Second Third Fourth Full Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Comparable store sales increase (originally reported) (4.9 %) (11.7 %) (1.3 %) 1.6 % (3.8 %) Comparable store sales increase (adjusted for week shift) (4.8 %) (11.0 %) 0.3 % 1.0 % (3.6 %) Impact of week shift 0.1 % 0.7 % 1.6 % (0.6 %) 0.2 % FISCAL 2018 First Second Third Fourth Full Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Net Sales (originally reported) $ 275.7 $ 188.0 $ 237.8 $ 266.7 $ 968.2 Net Sales (adjusted for week shift) $ 275.2 $ 206.0 $ 220.6 $ 265.8 $ 967.6 Impact of week shift ($0.5 ) $ 18.0 ($17.2 ) ($0.9 ) ($0.6 ) For Fiscal 2019, references to comparable store sales will reflect comparisons against the same period in the prior year as adjusted above, while total net sales will be compared against originally reported sales in the prior year.\nInvestor Conference Call and Simulcast\nHibbett Sports, Inc. will conduct a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET on Friday, March 16, 2018, to discuss fourth quarter and Fiscal 2018 results.
