    "text": "First sequential quarter increase in net sales since the second quarter of 2016 Positive annual sales momentum in Southeast Asia, Europe and Japan Maintained strong annual gross profit and operating income margins Increased quarterly dividend 8% to $0.13 per share\nLOS ANGELES, Feb. 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natural Health Trends Corp. (NASDAQ:NHTC), a leading direct-selling and e-commerce company that markets premium quality personal care, wellness and “quality of life” products under the NHT Global brand, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $46.1 million decreased 26% compared to $62.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and increased 15% compared to $40.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.\n- Revenue from the Company’s Hong Kong operations, which represented 86% of total revenue, was $39.6 million, a decrease of 29% compared to $56.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and an increase of 13% compared to $35.0 million in the third quarter of 2017.\n- Revenue outside of Hong Kong of $6.5 million increased 4% compared to $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and increased 27% compared to $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nOperating income of $8.7 million decreased 57% compared to $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and increased 2% compared to $8.5 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax provision of $13.3 million included a one-time net charge of $12.5 million, or an impact of $1.11 per diluted share, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). The one-time net charge is due to the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets.\nNet loss was $4.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $19.0 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, and net income of $7.3 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding the estimated impact of the Tax Act, Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is defined below and is reconciled to earnings per diluted share in the table entitled “Reconciliation from earnings per diluted share to Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share.” The number of Active Members 1 decreased 4% to 95,670 at December 31, 2017, compared to 99,690 at September 30, 2017, and decreased 20% compared to 118,960 at December 31, 2016.\n1 Natural Health Trends defines Active Members as those that have placed at least one product order with the Company during the preceding twelve month period.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $197.6 million decreased 31% compared to $287.7 million in 2016.\nOperating income of $43.1 million decreased 33% compared to $64.1 million in 2016. As a percent of total revenue, operating income was 22%, consistent with 2016.\nNet income was $23.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, compared to $55.1 million, or $4.83 per diluted share, in 2016. Excluding the estimated impact of the Tax Act, Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $3.20 for the full year of 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“While 2017 was a challenging year, we regained momentum in the fourth quarter with the first sequential quarter of sales growth since mid-2016,” commented Chris Sharng, President of Natural Health Trends Corp. “The overall sales decline can be traced to factors beyond our control which hindered our members’ ability to organize meetings and conduct business, including the G20 Summit in late 2016, the 20th Anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover and China’s Communist Party’s 19th National Congress.”\nMr. Sharng further commented, “We believe our ability to increase sales over the prior quarter was a result of the improvements we made to our commission plan, combined with a number of productive incentive trips and training programs held throughout the year. Additionally, we continued to gain traction in international markets such as Europe, Southeast Asia and Japan, which all grew sales over 2016. We have also worked hard to preserve our strong margin profile despite our top-line decline through diligent expense management that aligned our cost structure to current sales levels. As we look ahead to 2018, we believe our targeted training programs and promotions, opportunities for international expansion and new product introductions will translate into improved financial performance in the quarters to come.”\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $11.3 million, compared to $16.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $26.6 million, compared to $53.2 million in 2016. On February 6, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13, which represents an 8% increase over the prior quarter dividend. The dividend will be payable on March 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of February 27, 2018.\nThe Company expects to issue its 2017 audited financial results in March with its Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial results are preliminary and the accompanying financial statements have not been audited or have not yet been reviewed by the Company’s independent accountants. Significant updates and revisions may be required before the release of the Company’s 2017 audited financial results.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nThe Company included in this release a non-GAAP financial measure, “Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share,” which is derived by excluding the one-time net charge resulting from the Tax Act from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of “earnings per diluted share” for both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement’s exclusion of the one-time net charge in calculating Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share is intended to facilitate a more useful period-to-period comparison of the Company’s financial results and to provide additional information about the incremental impact of the Tax Act, namely the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets to which the Company was subject in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. This non-GAAP financial measure is supplemental and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company’s financial statements provided with this release include a reconciliation of Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to earnings per diluted share.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results today, Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
