    "text": "Feb 7 (Reuters) - Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia said on Wednesday its full-year net earned premium fell by 18 percent, in line with its guidance, due to changes in its premium earning pattern review.\nAustraliaâ€™s biggest mortgage insurer had earlier said its modified premium earning pattern reflected an expectation of risks principally from factors including losses from mining related regions.\nFull-year statutory net profit after tax was A$149.2 million ($117.90 million), down from A$203.1 million a year ago. ($1 = 1.2655 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Sandhya Sampath in Bengaluru, editing by G Crosse)\n ",
