    "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair ( RYA.I ) expects higher oil prices to push up short-haul air fares in Europe, but not until 2019, chief executive Michael O‘Leary said on Friday.\nThe global Brent crude benchmark LCOc1 briefly climbed above $70 a barrel in January for the first time in three years, up from about $50 for much of last year.\n“I think the big challenge for airlines this year is that oil is up around $70 a barrel,” O‘Leary told a conference call with investors, adding that the upward pressure on pricing is more likely in 2019 than this year.\nReporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by David Goodman\n ",
