    "text": "  Updated 13 minutes ago Iranian-American man returned to prison in after medical leave - lawyer   \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An 81-year-old Iranian-American man sentenced to 10 years in prison in Iran for spying and cooperating with the United States has been returned to prison after a short medical leave, his lawyer said in a statement on Tuesday. \nThe decision to send Baquer Namazi back to prison, despite the advice of the Iranian government’s own medical examiner, is “tantamount to a death sentence,” said Jared Genser, an attorney for the Namazi family. Namazi has been hospitalized four times in the past year, Genser said. Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Makini Brice",
