    "text": "Feb 1 (Reuters) - British meat supplier Cranswick Plc said third-quarter revenue was ahead of last year on volume growth and a strong trading over the Christmas period.\nThe pork and poultry supplier said export volumes to Far Eastern markets were well ahead of the same period last year.\nCranswick, which has a very strong presence in the pork export market of China, said UK pig prices have continued to ease during the period and the downward trend would reflect in selling prices.
