    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI), a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide, announced today that it is set to acquire Panjiva, Inc. (Panjiva) , a privately-held company that provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets.\nThe terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the coming weeks, were not disclosed.\n\"Panjiva is an exciting acquisition for our division given their core strength in leveraging machine intelligence to combine 1 billion transaction records into a proprietary supply chain graph,\" noted Mike Chinn, President of S&P Global Market Intelligence and Executive Vice President of Technology and Innovation at S&P Global . \"Their highly skilled and innovative leadership team and employees will help strengthen the insights, products and data that we provide to our clients throughout the world.\"\n\"Together with our customers, the Panjiva team has developed novel ways to generate value from global supply chain data. In the years ahead, we are committed to ensuring that both Panjiva and S&P Global customers receive unrivaled insight into global supply chains,\" commented Josh Green, Chief Executive Officer of Panjiva, who co-founded the company with Chief Technology Officer James Psota . \"As part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, we are confident that we can fulfill our ambitious goal of bringing transparency to global supply chains and are excited to continue to leverage technology to make sense of the rapidly expanding universe of unstructured data.\"\nPanjiva provides clients with macro data covering 95% of global trade flows, as well as transactional data covering 35% of global trade flows. The company tracks supply data from retailers, exporters and shippers across a myriad industries and commodities.\nThe acquisition of Panjiva is expected to be profitable in 2019 (excluding integration costs). Given the transaction's modest size, S&P Global does not expect a material impact to its adjusted earnings per share in 2018. The return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to exceed the Company's required rate of return (hurdle rate) shortly after the integration period.\nForward-Looking Statements: This press release contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which express management's current views concerning future events, trends, contingencies or results, appear at various places in this report and use words like \"anticipate,\" \"assume,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"future,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"strategy,\" \"target\" and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like \"could,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"should,\" \"will\" and \"would.\" For example, management may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: the outcome of contingencies; future actions by regulators; changes in the Company's business strategies and methods of generating revenue; the development and performance of the Company's services and products; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; the Company's effective tax rates; and the Company's cost structure, dividend policy, cash flows or liquidity.\nForward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements include, among other things:\nworldwide economic, political and regulatory conditions, including conditions that may result from legislative, regulatory and policy changes associated with the current U.S. administration or the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union; the rapidly evolving regulatory environment, in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, affecting Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices, including new and amended regulations and the Company's compliance therewith; the Company's ability to maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of confidential information and data, and the potential for unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that results in improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs; our ability to make acquisitions and dispositions and successfully integrate the businesses we acquire; the outcome of litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries; the health of debt and equity markets, including credit quality and spreads, the level of liquidity and future debt issuances; the demand and market for credit ratings in and across the sectors and geographies where the Company operates; concerns in the marketplace affecting the Company's credibility or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the integrity or utility of independent credit ratings; the effect of competitive products and pricing, including the level of success of new product developments and global expansion; consolidation in the Company's end-customer markets; the impact of customer cost-cutting pressures, including in the financial services industry and commodities markets; a decline in the demand for credit risk management tools by financial institutions; the level of merger and acquisition activity in the United States and abroad; the volatility of the energy marketplace and the health of the commodities markets; our ability to attract, incentivize and retain key employees; our ability to adjust to changes in European and United Kingdom markets as the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, and the impact of the United Kingdom's departure on our credit rating activities and other European and United Kingdom offerings; the Company's ability to successfully recover should it experience a disaster or other business continuity problem from a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber-attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event; changes in applicable tax or accounting requirements, including the impact of recent tax reform in the U.S.; the level of the Company's future cash flows and capital investments; the impact on the Company's revenue and net income caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and the Company's exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil penalties if it fails to comply with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable in the domestic and international jurisdictions in which it operates, including sanctions laws relating to countries such as Iran, Russia, Sudan and Syria, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, as well as import and export restrictions.\nThe factors noted above are not exhaustive. The Company and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks emerge frequently. Accordingly, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it is made, except as required by applicable law.
