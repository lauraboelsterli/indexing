    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. It’s my last day manning the newsletter before a short vacation. I’ll leave you in the capable hands of CMO Today’s Alex Bruell and Ben Mullin in my absence. Before I go: You must check out this addictive interactive game from Bloomberg, which places you in charge of a declining, rat-infested U.S. mall . Do you have the marketing expertise and patience with store owners begging for rent decreases to turn your mall around? (I didn’t.)\nDown the Tubes YouTube has been vocal recently about its efforts to clean up its platform, having come under criticism for its role in spreading misinformation. But an investigation by WSJ’s Jack Nicas finds that YouTube’s recommendation engine often highlights divisive or misleading videos , even when users haven’t shown an interest in that type of content. YouTube says its recommendations drive more than 70% of its viewing time. The recommendation engine was designed to keep people on the site longer and looks for videos that are drawing traffic. The problem is that often those videos tend to be sensational, and the recommendations only serve to make them more popular. After being presented with the findings, YouTube’s product management chief for recommendations, Johanna Wright, said, “We recognize that this is our responsibility” and “we have more to do.” For advertisers, the findings serve as another reminder to keep those whitelists in order and to note that YouTube’s “news” targeting category continues to look fairly risky for some brands.\nA New Fox in Town As 21st Century Fox prepares for the sale of the majority of its entertainment assets to Disney, it’s also readying the “new Fox.” To that end, analysts on its second-quarter earnings call Wednesday questioned the decision to shell out a hefty $3.3 billion for the NFL’s Thursday Night Football rights, given the league’s recent ratings declines. Indeed, lower ratings for the NFL and World Series games, plus lower spending from political advertisers, contributed to a difficult quarter for Fox’s broadcast TV unit. Revenue in that division fell 6% to $1.81 billion. But live sports still deliver the scale advertisers covet. CEO James Murdoch said that “as the scarcity value of large audiences coming together around national events continues to rise, we want to be the home of that kind of compelling product.” Those events also offer a “powerful platform” for other network promotions, he said. Another interesting data point from the earnings: Fox now has around 4 million subscribers across internet TV services such as Hulu and DirecTV Now. Hulu, which is jointly owned by Fox, NBCUniversal, Disney and Time Warner, crossed 17 million subscribers but lost $360 million in the quarter. Reminder: 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.\nWe’re Going Down the $PUB 2017 was a turbulent year for the advertising agency sector as companies battled challenges ranging from zero-based budgeting, to in-housing, transparency concerns and growing competition from consulting firms. Publicis Groupe posted organic growth of 0.8% last year , broadly in line with analysts’ estimates. But there’s more disruption ahead. Remember “Mediapalooza,” when an unprecedented number of clients put their media accounts up for review in 2015? You ain’t seen nothing yet. Publicis Media CEO Steve King said on the earnings call that we’re entering “Mediapalooza 2.” (There’s a great opportunity for a “Mediapalooza” rebrand here, surely. Send me your suggestions.) “The number of opportunities in media are going to be even greater than we saw in Mediapalooza 1,” Mr. King said, adding that Publicis is “much more optimistic” about its prospects than last time around, when the agency lost several major accounts, including Procter & Gamble. Elsewhere on the call, asked about the looming shadow of consultants, Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun said, “You won’t find any significant win” from a consultant or systems integrator when it comes to marketing.\nWho Put the Weight of the World On My Shoulders Mary Engle, the head of the Federal Trade Commission’s ad practices division, has an important reminder for ad agencies: “It’s not just clients who have responsibility for substantiating an ad’s claims.” Not heeding that warning could prove expensive. As Adweek reports, the FTC levied its largest-ever fine against an advertising agency this week . Minneapolis shop Marketing Architects has agreed to pay $2 million to settle a false advertising complaint, after the FTC found the agency created weight loss radio ads for a company called Direct Alternatives, which carried fake testimonials and dramatic weight-loss claims. The decision also bars Marketing Architects from assisting in the marketing and sale of weight-loss supplements “deceptively pitched to consumers.” Marketing Architects disagrees with the allegations in the complaint but said that it decided “settlement over litigation was the best path forward for the business” and that it has made improvements to its business. As Ms. Engle tells Adweek, weight loss is a particularly tricky category because it can be difficult to substantiate companies’ claims.\nBest of the rest Twitter reported its first profitable quarter as a publicly traded company after posting losses every quarter since going public in November 2013. The company, which saw a 2% increase in revenue to $731.6 million, credited growth in user engagement and improvements in its advertising offering. [ WSJ ]\nViacom’s revenue fell 8% to $3.07 billion for its first quarter on a drop in U.S. ad revenue, lower sales at its Paramount film studio and a reduction in the fees it collects from U.S. cable and satellite distributors. [ Variety ]\nLots of big-name publishers might be abandoning Facebook’s Instant Articles, but fake news sites are still taking advantage of the format. A BuzzFeed news investigation also found 24 fake sites that are signed up to the Facebook Audience Network, meaning Facebook shares a cut of their ad revenue. Facebook said in a statement: “We’ve launched a comprehensive effort across all products to take on these scammers, and we’re currently hosting third-party fact checkers from around the world to understand how we can more effectively solve the problem.” [ BuzzFeed News ]\nA study from research firm ABX found that while the proportion of women in Super Bowl ads grew to 73% from 62% a year ago, the percentage of ads where women played a “significant” role” fell to 34% from 43%. [ Ad Age ]\nInside Tronc’s sale of the L.A. Times and San Diego Union-Tribune to billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong. [ Nieman Lab ]\nABC says commercial time for its Oscars telecast is 98% sold out. [ Ad Age ]\nReddit co-Founder Alexis Ohanian is stepping aside to focus on his early-stage venture firm Initialized Capital. Mr. Ohanian will continue to sit on Reddit’s board.
