    "text": "LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH):\nNet loss of $4.59 per diluted share for the quarter. Medical care ratio excluding Marketplace declines to 88.8% from 90.9% in the third quarter of 2017. General and administrative expense ratio declines to 7.4% from 7.6% in the third quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter results include $356 million of impairment losses, restructuring and separation costs, and loss on debt extinguishment. Fourth quarter results include $53 million increased medical care costs for termination of cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidy payments effective October 1, 2017, and other Marketplace reserve adjustments. 2018 preliminary guidance of $3.00 - $3.50 net income per diluted share and $3.23 - $3.73 adjusted net income per diluted share. Preliminary guidance has been developed with conservative views of medical cost trends, Marketplace pricing adequacy, and the ultimate outcome of numerous profit improvement initiatives. Preliminary guidance will be updated once the Company has the benefit of first quarter earnings and further insight into the execution of these profit improvement initiatives.\nMolina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: MOH) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and provided its preliminary guidance for fiscal year 2018.\n“Our fourth quarter results are emblematic of the significant transition Molina is undertaking,” said Joe Zubretsky, president and CEO. “The disappointment of contract losses and related goodwill charges, continued restructuring costs, and catch up adjustments to unacceptable Marketplace results are legacies of the past. Looking forward, the core business results showed improvement quarter over quarter, and we took steps to strengthen the quality of the balance sheet, all of which serve as a solid platform to achieve our margin recovery and sustainability plan we outlined for investors last month. Medical cost control, administrative cost discipline, and capital strength remain at the fore of our plan.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Full Year Highlights\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollar amounts in millions, except per-share amounts) Premium revenue $ 4,689 $ 4,190 $ 18,854 $ 16,445 Operating (loss) income $ (269 ) $ (6 ) $ (555 ) $ 306 Net (loss) income $ (262 ) $ (47 ) $ (512 ) $ 52 Net (loss) income per diluted share $ (4.59 ) $ (0.85 ) $ (9.07 ) $ 0.92 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding 57.1 55.6 56.5 56.3 Operating Statistics: Medical care ratio (1) 90.7 % 91.7 % 90.6 % 89.8 % G&A ratio (2) 7.4 % 7.9 % 8.0 % 7.8 % Premium tax ratio (1) 2.2 % 2.9 % 2.3 % 2.8 % Effective income tax (benefit) expense rate (17.2 )% 54.5 % (16.4 )% 74.8 % Net (loss) profit margin (2) (5.3 )% (1.0 )% (2.6 )% 0.3 % (1) Medical care ratio represents medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue; premium tax ratio represents premium tax expenses as a percentage of premium revenue plus premium tax revenue.

Summary of Significant Items Affecting 2017 Financial Results\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (In millions, except per diluted share amounts) Amount Per Diluted\nShare (1)\nAmount Per Diluted\nShare (1)\nTermination of CSR subsidy payments for the fourth quarter of 2017 $ 73 $ 0.81 $ 73 $ 0.82 Marketplace adjustments for CSR subsidies, risk adjustment and medical loss ratio (MLR) floor liabilities for January through September 2017 dates of service 50 0.55 N/A N/A Marketplace adjustments related to risk adjustment, CSR subsidies, and other items for 2016 dates of service — — 47 0.52 Change in Marketplace premium deficiency reserve for 2017 dates of service (70 ) (0.77 ) (30 ) (0.33 ) Impairment losses 269 3.22 470 6.01 Restructuring and separation costs 73 0.81 234 2.86 Loss on debt extinguishment 14 0.24 14 0.24 Fee received for terminated Medicare acquisition — — (75 ) (0.84 ) $ 409 $ 4.86 $ 733 $ 9.28 (1) Amounts shown are before considering revaluation of related deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as applicable, and which is described further below. Except for certain items that are not deductible for tax purposes, per diluted share amounts are generally calculated at a statutory income tax rate of 37%, which is in excess of the effective tax rate recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Fourth Quarter 2017 Compared With Third Quarter 2017\nDevelopments in our business during 2017 limit the value of comparisons to 2016 performance. The Company believes that the comparison of 2017 fourth quarter performance with 2017 third quarter performance provides the most meaningful context for fourth quarter results.\nLoss before income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $316 million, compared with a loss before income tax benefit of $113 million for the third quarter of 2017. Net loss per diluted share was $4.59 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with net loss per diluted share of $1.70 reported for the third quarter of 2017.\nDespite the loss reported for the quarter, the performance of core operations and overall administrative cost efficiency improved in the fourth quarter when compared with the third quarter of 2017.\nMarketplace performance deteriorated due to normal seasonality and other matters discussed below. The Company has increased premium rates and reduced its Marketplace presence effective January 1, 2018 as part of its overall program to improve profitability.\nAmong the key developments affecting fourth quarter 2017 results were:\nThe medical care ratio for the Company’s Medicaid and Medicare programs combined (“core operations”) declined to 88.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, from 90.9% in the third quarter of 2017. The general and administrative expense ratio declined to 7.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 7.6% in the third quarter of 2017. The decision by the federal government to cease payment of Marketplace CSR subsidies in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased loss before income tax benefit for the quarter by approximately $73 million ($0.81 per diluted share). Despite its decision to record a charge in the fourth quarter for this item, the Company believes that it is legally entitled to these federal payments and will pursue all available means to collect them. Increases to Marketplace risk transfer and CSR liabilities related to the first three quarters of 2017 increased loss before income tax benefit by approximately $50 million ($0.55 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter. The reduction of the Marketplace-related premium deficiency reserve to zero as of December 31, 2017 reduced loss before income tax benefit by $70 million ($0.77 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter. Non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $269 million ($3.22 per diluted share) were incurred at the Florida, Illinois, and New Mexico health plans in the fourth quarter. Approximately $73 million ($0.81 per diluted share) of restructuring costs were recognized in the fourth quarter. Approximately $14 million ($0.24 per diluted share) of non-cash costs were recognized in the fourth quarter in connection with the issuance of our common shares in exchange for $141 million face value of our 1.625% convertible senior notes.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nThe revaluation of deferred tax assets in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in $54 million additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 ($0.94 per diluted share and $0.95 per diluted share, respectively). In addition, the effective tax benefit for 2017 is less than the statutory tax benefit due to the relatively large amount of reported expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, primarily relating to goodwill impairment losses and separation costs.\n2018 Preliminary Guidance\nThe Company has offered guidance on a preliminary basis because of the inherent uncertainty around achievement and the timing of its numerous profit improvement initiatives. While those initiatives extend across the various dimensions of managed care fundamentals, many are in the early stages of development and implementation.\nTherefore, the Company’s guidance should be viewed as a preliminary estimate of what it expects to achieve until the profit improvement initiatives manifest themselves in the earnings stream. Once it has the benefit of first quarter earnings and further insight into the execution of the profit improvement initiatives, the Company will be able to provide a firmer view of 2018 guidance.\nTo provide for an appropriate amount of execution risk, the Company’s preliminary guidance has been developed with appropriately conservative views of:\nMedical cost baseline in 2017; Medical cost trend for 2018; Potential rate increases and retained amounts of revenue at risk; and The turnaround of the Marketplace business until the achievement of the margins implicit in 2018 pricing is observed.\nThe following table summarizes 2018 Preliminary Guidance (1) :\nPremium revenue ~ $17.5B Service revenue ~ $525M Premium tax revenue ~ $410M Health insurer fees reimbursed ~ $295M Investment income and other revenue ~ $85M Total revenue ~ $18.8B Medical care costs ~ $15.6B Medical care ratio (2) ~ 89% Cost of service revenue ~ $480M General and administrative expenses ~ $1.4B G&A ratio (3) ~ 7.3% Premium tax expenses ~ $410M Health insurer fees ~ $310M Depreciation and amortization ~ $115M Interest expense and other income ~ $125M Income before income taxes $355M - $400M Net income $202M - $236M EBITDA (4) $632M - $676M Effective tax rate 41% - 43% Net profit margin (3) 1.1% - 1.3% Diluted weighted average shares ~ 67.3M Net income per share $3.00 - $3.50 Adjusted net income per share (4) $3.23 - $3.73 End-of-year Marketplace membership 303,000 End-of-year Non-Marketplace membership 3,738,000 (1) All amounts are estimates; actual results may differ materially.

For these reasons, management believes such measures are useful supplemental measures to investors in comparing our performance to the performance of other public companies in the health care industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for or superior to, GAAP measures.
