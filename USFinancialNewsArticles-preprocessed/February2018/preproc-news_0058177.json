Evolent is now supporting approximately 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries in its Next Generation ACO cohort nationwide.\nFrank Williams, chief executive officer of Evolent Health, Inc., commented, \"We are pleased with our results for the quarter and calendar year, having achieved our strategic and financial objectives while continuing to advance our position as the preferred partner for providers moving to value-based care.\"\nEvolent ended 2017 at the high end of its anticipated range for new partnerships, several of which included new geographies for Evolent operations, including Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and New Mexico. The company experienced continued growth from existing partners in the form of new lives added and the adoption of new service offerings. In the aggregate, the company added approximately 700,000 lives to its platform, bringing the total life count to approximately 2.7 million as of December 31, 2017. This represented a growth of approximately 34.8% over the prior year.\nMr. Williams continued, \"With momentum continuing through the end of the year and into 2018, we are excited to bring four new partners into our cohort of providers participating in the Next Generation ACO program, CoxHealth, FMOLHS-HLN, South Shore Health System and St. Joseph's Health. The commitment to two-sided risk models by CMS and its participating providers demonstrates that the movement toward public-private health care transformation remains strong as providers take steps toward more aggressive risk arrangements. We are pleased that the investments we've made in our technology platform, clinical knowledge base and risk management infrastructure are enabling Evolent to deliver deep expertise and drive strong clinical and financial results with these partners.\"\nMr. Williams added, \"Overall, we accomplished a tremendous amount strategically and operationally in 2017 in the face of a new administration and legislative uncertainty across the year in the Medicaid, Medicare and Exchange markets. Based on recent conversations and actions from CMS and local state governments, we are encouraged by the consistent commitment to value-based care programs which is reflected in a strong pipeline entering 2018.\"\nFinancial Results of Evolent Health, Inc.\nIn our earnings releases, prepared remarks, conference calls, slide presentations and webcasts, we may use or discuss non-GAAP financial measures.

For more information, visit www.evolenthealth.com\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nEvolent Health, Inc. is a holding company and its principal asset is all of the Class A common units in its operating subsidiary, Evolent Health LLC, which has owned all of our operating assets and substantially all of our business since inception. The financial results of Evolent Health LLC are consolidated in the financial statements of Evolent Health, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we present and discuss Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Services Revenue, True Health New Mexico Premium Revenue, Adjusted Transformation Revenue, Adjusted Platform and Operations Revenue, Adjusted Cost of Revenue, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted Depreciation and Amortization Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders, Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders and Adjusted Weighted-Average Class A and Class B Shares, which are all non-GAAP financial measures, as supplemental measures to help investors evaluate our fundamental operational performance.\nAdjusted Services Revenue, Adjusted Transformation Revenue and Adjusted Platform and Operations Revenue are defined as services revenue, transformation revenue, platform and operations revenue, respectively, adjusted to exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. Adjusted Revenue is defined as the sum of Adjusted Services Revenue and True Health New Mexico Premium Revenue less intercompany eliminations. Management uses Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Services Revenue, Adjusted Transformation Revenue and Adjusted Platform and Operations Revenue as supplemental performance measures because they reflect a complete view of the operational results. The measures are also useful to investors because they reflect the full view of our operational performance in line with how we generate our long term forecasts.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue and Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses are defined as cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, adjusted to exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expenses and transaction costs related to acquisitions and business combinations, securities offerings, as well as one-time adjustments. Management uses Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses as supplemental performance measures which are also useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of our long term operational costs while removing the effect of transaction costs that are one-time and costs that are non-cash (stock-based compensation expenses) in nature. Additionally, these supplemental performance measures facilitate understanding a breakdown of our Adjusted Total Operating Expenses.\nAdjusted Depreciation and Amortization Expenses is defined as depreciation and amortization expenses adjusted to exclude the impact of amortization expenses related to intangible assets acquired through acquisitions and business combinations. Management uses Adjusted Depreciation and Amortization Expenses as a supplemental performance measure because it reflects a complete view of the operational results. The measure is also useful to investors because it facilitates understanding a breakdown of our Adjusted Total Operating Expenses.\nAdjusted Total Operating Expenses is defined as the sum of Adjusted Cost of Revenue, Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses and Adjusted Depreciation and Amortization Expenses, and reflects the adjustments made in those non-GAAP measures. Adjusted Total Operating Expenses is adjusted to exclude the impact of one-time adjustments, such as goodwill impairment, and items arising from acquisitions and business combinations, such as (gain) loss on change in fair value of contingent consideration.\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss) is defined as Adjusted Revenue less Adjusted Total Operating Expenses, and reflects the adjustments made in those non-GAAP measures.\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Revenue less Adjusted Cost of Revenue, and reflects the adjustments made in those non-GAAP measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income (loss) attributable to Evolent Health, Inc. before interest income, interest expense, (provision) benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses), adjusted to exclude goodwill impairment, (gain) loss on change in fair value of contingent consideration, income (loss) from equity affiliates, other income (expense), net, net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests, purchase accounting adjustments, stock-based compensation expenses, transaction costs related to acquisitions and business combinations, such as (gain) loss on change in fair value of contingent consideration and securities offerings, as well as one-time adjustments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because the removal of transaction costs, one-time or non-cash items (depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expenses) allows us to focus on operational performance. We believe that this measure is also useful to investors because it allows further insight into the period over period operational performance in a manner that is comparable to other organizations in our industry and in the market in general.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders is defined as earnings (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted to exclude goodwill impairment, income (loss) from equity affiliates, (provision) benefit for income taxes, (gain) loss on change in fair value of contingent consideration, purchase accounting adjustments, stock-based compensation expenses and transaction costs related to acquisitions and business combinations, such as (gain) loss on change in fair value of contingent consideration, securities offerings, as well as one-time adjustments.\nAdjusted Weighted-Average Class A and Class B Shares is defined as weighted average common shares (diluted) adjusted to include, in periods of net loss, the dilutive or potentially dilutive effect of the assumed conversion of Class B common shares to Class A common shares.\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders is defined as Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders divided by Adjusted Weighted-Average Class A and Class B Shares, and reflects the adjustments made in those non-GAAP measures.\nManagement uses Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders, Adjusted Weighted-Average Class A and Class B Shares and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share Available to Class A and Class B Shareholders because these performance measures represent our core operating performance distributed amongst all of our investors which is not represented by the GAAP results across time due to our complex equity structure. We believe that these measures are also useful to investors for the same reason.\nThese adjusted measures do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measurements, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of these adjusted measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures is presented in the tables below. We believe these measures are useful across time in evaluating our fundamental core operating performance.\nEvolent Health, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands,

revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting from our acquisitions and business combinations. As part of the Reorganization and as a result of gaining control of Evolent Health LLC, we recorded the fair value of deferred revenue resulting in a $4.9 million reduction to the book value. This resulted in an adjustment of less than $0.1 million to transformation revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\n(2)\nAdjustments to cost of revenue include approximately $0.2 million and $1.5 million in stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including a one-time expense of approximately $1.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016, related to the acceleration of Valence Health's unvested equity awards that vested upon the close of the Valence Health acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense includes the value of equity awards granted to employees and non-employee directors of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries. Adjustments also include transaction costs of approximately $1.1 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting from acquisitions and business combinations.\n(3)\nAdjustments to selling, general and administrative expenses include approximately $4.0 million and $7.2 million in stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, including a one-time expense of approximately $2.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016, related to the acceleration of Valence Health's unvested equity awards that vested upon the close of the Valence Health acquisition.

In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.\nThese statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results contained in the Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others:\nthe structural change in the market for health care in the United States; uncertainty in the health care regulatory framework; uncertainty in the public exchange market; the uncertain impact of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waivers to Medicaid rules; the uncertain impact of the results of the 2018 congressional, state and local elections, as well as subsequent elections, may have on health care laws and regulations; our ability to effectively manage our growth; the significant portion of revenue we derive from our largest partners, and the potential loss, termination or renegotiation of customer contracts; our ability to offer new and innovative products and services; risks related to completed and future acquisitions, investments and alliances, including the acquisition of assets from New Mexico Health Connections (\"NMHC\") and the acquisitions of Valence Health, Inc., excluding Cicerone Health Solutions, Inc. (\"Valence Health\"), and Aldera Holdings, Inc. (\"Aldera\"), which may be difficult to integrate, divert management resources, result in unanticipated costs or dilute our stockholders; certain risks and uncertainties associated with the acquisition of assets from NMHC and the acquisition of Valence Health, including future revenues may be less than expected, the timing and extent of new lives expected to come onto the platform may not occur as expected and the expected results of Evolent may not be impacted as anticipated; the growth and success of our partners, which is difficult to predict and is subject to factors outside of our control, including premium pricing reductions, selection bias in at risk membership and the ability to control and, if necessary, reduce health care costs, particularly in New Mexico; our ability to attract new partners; the increasing number of risk-sharing arrangements we enter into with our partners; our ability to recover the significant upfront costs in our partner relationships; our ability to estimate the size of our target market; our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition; consolidation in the health care industry; competition which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry; risks related to governmental payor audits and actions, including whistleblower claims; our ability to partner with providers due to exclusivity provisions in our contracts; restrictions and penalties as a result of privacy and data protection laws; adequate protection of our intellectual property, including trademarks; any alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of third-party proprietary rights; our use of \"open source\" software; our ability to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information; our reliance on third parties and licensed technologies; our ability to use, disclose, de-identify or license data and to integrate third-party technologies; data loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems and service disruptions at our data centers; online security risks and breaches or failures of our security measures; our reliance on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our users; our reliance on third-party vendors to host and maintain our technology platform; our ability to contain health care costs, implement increases in premium rates on a timely basis, maintain adequate reserves for policy benefits or maintain cost effective provider agreements; the risk of a significant reduction in the enrollment in our health plan; our dependency on our key personnel, and our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel; the risk of potential future goodwill impairment on our results of operations; our indebtedness and our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to achieve profitability in the future; the requirements of being a public company; our adjusted results may not be representative of our future performance; the risk of potential future litigation; our holding company structure and dependence on distributions from Evolent Health LLC; our obligations to make payments to certain of our pre-IPO investors for certain tax benefits we may claim in the future; our ability to utilize benefits under the tax receivables agreement described herein; our ability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that we currently expect to result from past and future exchanges of Class B common units of Evolent Health LLC for our Class A common stock, and to utilize certain tax attributes of Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG; distributions that Evolent Health LLC will be required to make to us and to the other members of Evolent Health LLC; our obligations to make payments under the tax receivables agreement that may be accelerated or may exceed the tax benefits we realize; different interests among our pre-IPO investors, or between us and our pre-IPO investors; the terms of agreements between us and certain of our pre-IPO investors; the potential volatility of our Class A common stock price; the potential decline of our Class A common stock price if a substantial number of shares are sold or become available for sale or if a large number of Class B common units are exchanged for shares of Class A common stock; provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and provisions of Delaware law that discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of us; the ability of certain of our investors to compete with us without restrictions; provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees; our intention not to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock; our ability to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; our expectations regarding the additional management attention and costs that will be required as we transition from an \"emerging growth company\" to a \"large accelerated filer\"; and our lack of public company operating experience.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements. Our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2017, and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.\nFurther, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this release.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evolent-health-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300605313.html\nSOURCE Evolent Health, Inc.",
