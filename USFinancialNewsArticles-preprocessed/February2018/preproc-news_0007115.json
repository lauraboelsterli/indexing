    "text": "CRANBURY, N.J., Feb. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n1 ST Constitution Bancorp (NASDAQ:FCCY), the holding company (the “Company”) for 1 ST Constitution Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $574,000 and diluted earnings per share of $0.07 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $6.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.83.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included additional estimated income tax expense of $1.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, due to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017, which reduced the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, the Company revalued its net deferred tax assets to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate that would be in effect in future years.\nIn addition, merger-related expenses on an after-tax basis of $188,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the pending merger of New Jersey Community Bank with and into the Bank, were incurred during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAs a result of the additional income tax expense and the merger-related expenses, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $1.5 million, or 72.1%, compared to the corresponding period of 2016.\nNet income excluding the additional income tax expense and merger-related expenses (“Adjusted Net Income”) was $2.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $417,000, or 20.3%, compared to net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 of $2.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income was $8.8 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared to net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $9.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share. If the lower federal corporate income tax rate had been in effect in 2017, the Company’s reported 2017 income tax expense of $5.9 million, excluding the $1.7 million of tax expense due to the revaluation of the deferred taxes, would have been approximately $2.9 million, or $1.3 million lower.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Share are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the reported net income and net income per diluted share is included in this release.\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share that will be paid on February 27, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2018.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nReturn on average assets and return on average equity based on reported net income were 0.21% and 2.03%, respectively. Adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average equity based on Adjusted Net Income were 0.92% and 8.76%, respectively. Commercial business, commercial real estate and construction loans totaled $538.2 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $100.2 million, or 22.9%, compared to $438.1 million at December 31, 2016. Net interest income was $9.8 million and the net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.98%. The Bank recorded a provision for loan losses of $150,000 and net recoveries were $62,000. Non-performing assets were $7.1 million or 0.66% of assets at December 31, 2017. The Bank sold OREO properties totaling $356,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and owned no OREO properties at December 31, 2017. Book value per share and tangible book value per share were $13.81 and $12.27, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nRobert F. Mangano, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased to report that we continued to generate significant loan and deposit growth during the year. We generated good core deposit growth as total deposits grew $87.5 million and ended the year at $922 million, up approximately 10.5%. Total loans were up approximately 9% and closed the year at $789.9 million.”\nMr. Mangano also said, “On November 6, 2017, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire New Jersey Community Bank by merging it with and into the Bank. We are proceeding with our integration planning, have submitted the requisite applications with our bank regulators and have filed a Form S-4 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.”\nMr. Mangano added, “The addition of the two offices of New Jersey Community Bank and its employees and customers will enhance our presence in Monmouth County and provide additional growth opportunities for the Company and the Bank. We anticipate consummating the merger in the second quarter of 2018.”\nDiscussion of Financial Results\nNet interest income was $9.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and increased $1.2 million, or 13.7%, compared to net interest income of $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total interest income was $11.2 million and $10.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the increase in the yield on loans, which was 5.05% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.62% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Average interest-earning assets were $1.0 billion with a tax-equivalent yield of 4.49% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $971.0 million with a tax-equivalent yield of 4.15% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The 75 basis point increase in the Federal Reserve’s targeted federal funds rate and the corresponding increase in the Prime Rate since December of 2016 has had a positive effect on the yields of construction, commercial business and warehouse loans with variable interest rate terms.\nInterest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities was $1.4 million, with an interest cost of 0.75%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.4 million, with an interest cost of 0.73%, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $58,000 in interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected primarily higher deposit interest costs due to higher market interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter of 2016.\nThe net interest margin, on a fully tax-equivalent basis, increased to 3.98% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.64% for the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to the higher yield on average interest-earning assets.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $150,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to no provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to the growth and change in the mix of loans in the loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2017, loans totaled $789.9 million and the allowance for loan losses was $8.0 million, or 1.01% of total loans, compared to total loans of $724.8 million and an allowance for loan losses of $7.5 million, or 1.03% of total loans, at December 31, 2016. Management believes that the current economic conditions in the Bank’s markets are generally positive, and these factors were considered in management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, non-interest income was $1.9 million, representing a decline of $81,000 from non-interest income of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease of $117,000 in gains on sales of loans in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter of 2016, which was partially offset by an increase in other income. In the fourth quarter of 2017, residential lending activity produced $30.4 million of closed loans and $28.8 million of loan sales, which generated gains on sales of loans of $1.0 million, compared to $34.3 million of residential mortgage loans sold and $925,000 of gains recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in residential mortgage loans sold was due primarily to lower residential mortgage lending activity as a result of higher residential mortgage interest rates and a lower level of refinancing activity. In the fourth quarter of 2017, $1.5 million of SBA loans were sold and gains of $139,000 were recorded compared to $3.7 million of SBA loans sold and gains of $335,000 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. At December 31, 2017, approximately $2.0 million of SBA loans were available for sale, but were not sold due to tax planning considerations. SBA guaranteed commercial lending activity and loan sales vary from period to period and the level of activity is due primarily to the timing of loan originations. The pipeline of approved and committed SBA loans was $9.0 million, with another $11.1 million of loans in process, at December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest expenses were $8.1 million and $7.6 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $492,000, or 6.5%, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $267,000, or 5.7%, in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to increases in salaries, share-based compensation expense and benefits expense that were partially offset by a decrease in commissions paid to residential loan officers. Commission expense decreased due to the lower volume of residential mortgages originated in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Occupancy costs decreased $61,000, or 7.2%, due primarily to lower depreciation and building maintenance expenses as a result of the closing of a branch office at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Other operating expenses increased $292,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to merger-related expenses of $265,000.\nIncome tax expense was $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to income tax expense of $1.0 million for the same quarter of 2016. As previously discussed, the Company recorded additional income tax expense of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. The Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 also increased as a result of the non-deductibility of certain merger-related expenses and a portion of employee compensation expenses.\nAt December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $8.0 million compared to $7.5 million at December 31, 2016. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance was 1.01% at December 31, 2017 compared to 1.03% at December 31, 2016. The increase in the allowance for loan losses reflects the increase in loans and the change in the mix of loans since the end of 2016.\nTotal assets increased $41.1 million to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.04 billion at December 31, 2016 due primarily to a $65.1 million increase in total loans, which was partially offset by a decrease of $14.9 million in investment securities and a decrease of $10.6 million in loans held for sale. The increase in assets was funded primarily by an $87.5 million increase in deposits and a $6.9 million increase in shareholders’ equity. Borrowings declined by $52.6 million. Total portfolio loans at December 31, 2017 were $789.9 million compared to $724.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in loans was due primarily to an increase of $66.7 million in commercial real estate loans and a $40.4 million increase in construction loans, which were partially offset by a $26.8 million decrease in mortgage warehouse loans, a $7.0 million decrease in commercial business loans and a $4.3 million decrease in residential mortgage loans. The decline in mortgage warehouse loans reflects generally higher mortgage interest rates during 2017 compared to 2016, which reduced the volume of residential mortgage loan refinancing activity in 2017 compared to 2016 and resulted in a decline in the average balance of mortgage warehouse loans during 2017 and at December 31, 2017. The decline in residential mortgage loan refinancing activity more than offset the increase in home purchase financing activity during the period that was financed by the Bank’s warehouse loans to mortgage banking customers.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2017 were $922.0 million compared to $834.5 million at December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the growth in core deposits. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $25.7 million, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $62.0 million and savings deposits increased $9.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10.1 million in time deposits.\nRegulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank continue to reflect a strong capital position. Under current regulatory capital standards, the Company’s common equity Tier 1 to risk based assets (“CET1”), total risk-based capital, Tier I capital, and leverage ratios were 10.19%, 12.84%, 12.02% and 11.23%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The Bank’s CET1, total risk-based capital, Tier 1 capital and leverage ratios were 11.74%, 12.56%, 11.74% and 10.96%, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The Company and the Bank are considered “well capitalized” under these capital standards.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing loans were $7.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, three commercial loans with a total balance of $745,000 were classified as non-accrual.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Bank was notified that a shared national credit syndicated loan in which it was a participant in a $4.3 million facility had further deteriorated. The Bank downgraded the loan, which had a balance of $4.0 million, and placed it on non-accrual. In the second quarter, the borrower was recapitalized through an equity contribution by new investors and the loan was paid down by $906,000 and all interest was paid current. All loan payments for this borrower are current at December 31, 2017. Management continues to monitor the borrower’s financial position.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, there were net recoveries of $62,000 for loans previously charged off. The allowance for loan losses was 113% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2017 compared to 144% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2016.\nOverall, management observed generally stable trends in loan quality, with non-performing loans to total loans of 0.90% and non-performing assets to total assets of 0.66% at December 31, 2017 compared to non-performing loans to total loans of 0.72% and non-performing assets to total assets of 0.52% at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company held no OREO as of December 31, 2017 as the two commercial properties held as OREO at September 30, 2017 were sold during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAbout 1 ST Constitution Bancorp\n1 ST Constitution Bancorp, through its primary subsidiary, 1 ST Constitution Bank, operates 18 branch banking offices in Cranbury (2), Fort Lee, Hamilton, Hightstown, Hillsborough, Hopewell, Jamesburg, Lawrenceville, Perth Amboy, Plainsboro, Rocky Hill, Princeton, Rumson, Fair Haven, Shrewsbury, Little Silver and Asbury Park, New Jersey.\n1 ST Constitution Bancorp is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol “FCCY” and information about the Company can be accessed through the Internet at www.1STCONSTITUTION.com\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain information set forth in this press release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the rules, regulations and releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”).
