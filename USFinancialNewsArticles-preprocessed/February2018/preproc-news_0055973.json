    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Zimperium , the global leader in mobile threat defense (MTD), today announced that Eric Grotefeld has joined the company as chief revenue officer. Grotefeld brings more than 20 years of international leadership experience that will further develop Zimperium's industry-leading growth and global expansion. He will play a strategic role across Zimperium's products, leading all global sales and services.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Eric Grotefeld to the Zimperium team,\" said Shridhar Mittal, chief executive officer of Zimperium. \"As an experienced international technology industry executive, he will play an integral role in our global expansion, innovation and overall leadership in the mobile security market.\"\nGrotefeld has significant experience in creating new market opportunities with transformational digital technologies. He has a reputation for building and scaling highly effective organizations that care deeply about customer success, making him an asset to drive Zimperium's global go-to-market growth and customer engagement. Formerly, Grotefeld was an executive at ITKO and following the acquisition by CA Technologies, he became a senior vice president at CA Technologies. There he led the rapid global growth of the strategic DevOps Business Unit and helped to transform the way enterprises across all industry sectors deliver digital strategies. Prior to CA, Grotefeld held senior management positions at BEA Systems and Oracle.\n\"The team at Zimperium is exceptionally strong, and I am honored to be joining at such an exciting and opportune time in the mobile security market,\" said Eric Grotefeld, chief revenue officer at Zimperium. \"There has been a substantial and serious lack of general awareness about the current and ongoing threats unsecured mobile devices present to organizations in both the commercial and public sectors. However, all the evidence is now pointing to threat actors moving to target mobile as the primary platform. With the near ubiquity of mobile, it's easy to see why. Obviously, the risks are high when few organizations have any effective security for mobile and when you consider all the corporate data that's held on these devices, not to mention the potential access to corporate networks themselves from a compromised device or app. It's a threat our customers are taking very seriously. Zimperium provides the only on-device, enterprise-class solution capable of solving this problem.\"\nAbout Zimperium®\nZimperium, the global leader in mobile security, offers real-time, on-device protection against Android and iOS threats.
