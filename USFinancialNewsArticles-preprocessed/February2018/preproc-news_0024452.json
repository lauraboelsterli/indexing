    "text": "Getty Images FBI Director Christopher Wray \nThe head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation said his agency first flagged issues with its background check of Rob Porter to the administration in March, a timeline that conflicts with what the White House said it knew about the former aide’s past. \nPorter resigned last week amid accusations that he physically abused two ex-wives. He has denied the allegations. \nDirector Christopher Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that the FBI last year gave multiple updates to the White House on its findings about Porter. After sharing a partial report on Porter in March, the FBI provided its completed background check on Porter to the White House in July, Wray said. The White House asked follow-up questions, he said, and the FBI provided answers to those in November.",
