    "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mack-Cali Realty Corporation (NYSE: CLI) today reported its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nReported net income (loss) of $(0.01) per diluted share for the quarter; Achieved Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations per diluted share of $0.50 for the quarter; Leased 439,070 square feet of office space; finished at 87.6% leased in its Core portfolio; Grew office rental rates by 9.6% on a cash basis and 17.9% on a GAAP basis; Roseland stabilized portfolio was 96.6% leased at December 31, 2017, as compared to 97.4% for the third quarter; 2017 lease-up properties containing 1,162 units currently 96.7% leased; Completed property sales of $56 million in the fourth quarter; $528 million full year ($416 million of property sales and $112 million of J.V. interests); and Declared $0.20 per share quarterly common stock dividend.\nMichael J. DeMarco, Chief Executive Officer, commented \"We made considerable progress during 2017 in repositioning our office portfolio and converting subordinate interests in our Roseland residential portfolio into majority owned positions. Our office disposition activity has allowed us to further streamline property operations and deepen our focus on core markets. As Roseland's developments are put into service, we anticipate its contribution to operating income will grow meaningfully over the next three years. While leasing in the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations, for 2018 the Company is laser focused on waterfront leasing and executing an additional $400 million of non-core dispositions. Our approach positions Mack-Cali for NAV accretion and stronger earnings growth potential in the years ahead.\"\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n* All per share amounts presented below are on a diluted basis.\nNet income (loss) available to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $2.6 million, or $(0.01) per share, as compared to $15.2 million, or $0.17 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income available to common shareholders equaled $23.2 million, or $0.06 per share, as compared to $117.2 million, or $1.30 per share, for the same period last year.\nFunds from operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $50.0 million, or $0.50 per share, as compared to $32.8 million, or $0.33 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, FFO equaled $224.2 million, or $2.23 per share, as compared to $205 million, or $2.04 per share, for the same period last year.\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, Core FFO was $0.50 per share, as compared to $0.56 for the same period last year. For the full year 2017, Core FFO was $2.23 per share versus $2.15 for the same period last year.\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nMack-Cali's consolidated Core office properties were 87.6 percent leased at December 31, 2017, as compared to 90.1 percent leased at September 30, 2017 and 90.6 percent leased at December 31, 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 same store GAAP revenues for the office portfolio declined by 2.5 percent while same store GAAP NOI fell by 3.5 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2017, same store GAAP revenues increased by 2.2 percent driven by the ability to mark rents to market to partially offset the loss of office tenants in our waterfront properties. Same store GAAP NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 2.6 percent as the Company began to benefit from operating efficiencies resulting from existing non-core office assets. Fourth quarter 2017 same store cash revenues for the office portfolio declined by 3.4 percent while same store cash NOI fell by 5.0 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2017, same store cash revenues increased by 3.6 percent. Same store cash NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 5.0 percent.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company executed 38 leases at its consolidated in-service commercial portfolio totaling 439,070 square feet. Of these totals, seven leases for 80,087 square feet (18 percent) were for new leases and 31 leases for 358,983 square feet (82 percent) were for lease renewals and other tenant retention transactions. Rental rate roll up for fourth quarter 2017 transactions was 9.6 percent on a cash basis and 17.9 percent on a GAAP basis.\nThe Company's residential same store portfolio increased net operating income by 6.0 percent for the fourth quarter and 4.2 percent for the year. The same store portfolio is comprised of 3,528 units that were 96.6 percent leased at year-end. The Company's 2017 lease-up properties, which consist of Urby Harborside, Chase II at Overlook Ridge and Quarry Place at Tuckahoe, leased at an accelerated pace. Collectively, the properties, which comprise 1,162 units, are currently 96.7 percent leased.\nACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS/TRANSACTION ACTIVITY\nThe Company continued its repositioning efforts in the fourth quarter with the sale of three properties for $56 million. Total disposition activity for the year totaled $528 million. Additional dispositions of approximately $400 million are planned for 2018 and expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. This will conclude the Company's major disposition program with future sales occurring on a select one-off basis.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of 25 Christopher Columbus, a residential development site on the Jersey City waterfront, for $53 million using the proceeds from the dispositions as part of a 1031 exchange. Development of 25 Christopher Columbus is expected to begin in 2018; the property when completed, will comprise 718 units.\n2017 office property acquisitions totaled $395 million. In 2017, the Company also acquired residential development sites, including a mortgage note, totaling $212 million. The Company also acquired a multifamily property valued at $315 million using Rockpoint Capital and assuming a mortgage of $165 million. All of the acquisitions were funded in a tax efficient manner and with proceeds from the Company's disposition program and Rockpoint's capital.\nDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY\nDuring the quarter, Roseland broke ground on Riverwalk C, a 40/60 waterfront joint venture project with Prudential. When completed, Riverwalk will contain 360 units. The $187 million project is being funded with a $112 construction loan and $75 million of equity from the JV. Mack-Cali's equity contribution totals $30 million.\nBALANCE SHEET/CAPITAL MARKETS\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a debt-to-undepreciated assets ratio of 46.5 percent compared to 46.2 percent at September 30, 2017 and 41.6 percent at December 31, 2016. At year end, the Company's weighted average cost of debt was 3.9 percent and the weighted average maturity on its debt was 4.0 years. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 9.3x compared to 8.0x for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The Company had an interest coverage ratio of 3.3x for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.4x for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and 3.5x for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nDIVIDENDS\nIn December 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share (indicating an annual rate of $0.80 per common share) for the fourth quarter 2017, which was paid on January 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2018. The Company's Core FFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 40.0 percent.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company announced the appointment of David J.

The Company believes that FFO per share is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further believes that as FFO per share excludes the effect of depreciation, gains (or losses) from sales of properties and impairments related to depreciable rental property (all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance), FFO per share can facilitate comparison of operating performance between equity REITs.\nFFO per share should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders per share as an indication of the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO per share presented herein is not necessarily comparable to FFO per share presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition. However, the Company's FFO per share is comparable to the FFO per share of real estate companies that use the current definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). A reconciliation of net income per share to FFO per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nCore FFO is defined as FFO, as adjusted for certain items to facilitate comparative measurement of the Company's performance over time. Core FFO is presented solely as supplemental disclosure that the Company's management believes provides useful information to investors and analysts of its results, after adjusting for certain items to facilitate comparability of its performance from period to period. Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not intended to represent cash flow and is not indicative of cash flows provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. As there is not a generally accepted definition established for Core FFO, the Company's measures of Core FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO reported by other REITs. A reconciliation of net income per share to Core FFO in dollars and per share is included in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nOne of the country's leading Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Mack-Cali Realty Corporation is an owner, manager and developer of premier office and multifamily properties in select waterfront and transit-oriented markets throughout the Northeast.
