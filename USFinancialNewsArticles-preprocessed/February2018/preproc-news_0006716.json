    "text": "IRVINE, Calif. and PARIS, Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- In order to complement and expand its portfolio of strong brands and fulfill its growth objectives, particularly outside the euro area, Groupe Rocher is pleased to announce it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arbonne International, a leader in direct selling of botanically based beauty, personal care and nutrition products. Arbonne offers a wide range of vegan skincare, bath and body, and nutrition and makeup products.\nArbonne International, whose holding company is Natural Products Group (NPG), is headquartered in Irvine, California. NPG also owns Nature's Gate, a personal care brand, which is also part of this acquisition. With a production site and four integrated distribution sites, Arbonne is a global business with sales revenue in excess of 550 million dollars (450 million euros).\nFounded in Switzerland in 1975, and brought to the U.S. in 1980, Arbonne was created to fulfill the vision of founder Petter Mørck to develop botanically based skincare, cosmetics and nutrition products that are better for both consumers and the planet, while also providing an opportunity for people to become financially independent by joining a direct selling network.\nToday, approximately 800 employees and over 250,000 active independent consultants contribute to the success of the Arbonne brand whose botanically based, vegan, gluten- and GMO-free products are sold in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Poland.\nWHY IS GROUPE ROCHER ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ARBONNE INTERNATIONAL?\nGroupe Rocher and Arbonne have many things in common: The concept of robust brands that share real values, high quality and innovation standards, a wide range of natural products and a strong commitment to sustainability. Arbonne expects to be able to benefit from the resources and expertise offered by Groupe Rocher, thanks to the strength of its network (consumers, suppliers, partners).\nBris Rocher, CEO of Groupe Rocher, stated: \"This acquisition will be a real asset that will enable us to strengthen our positioning in the direct selling channel, which has seen an upturn over the past few years. We also have a heritage of providing employment opportunities —dating back to my grandfather, our founder, Yves Rocher, who cared deeply about providing employment since he started his business. This, combined with our direct selling know-how, should foster company growth and longevity.\"\nSaid, Kay Zanotti, CEO of Arbonne: \"We share with Groupe Rocher commitments to pure, botanically based products and sustainability, as well as a long-term business vision that is grounded in family values. We are particularly pleased with Groupe Rocher's keen appreciation of the many benefits of the direct selling model in providing flexible income opportunities, and a positive community of professional growth for individuals.\"\nThanks to recent investment in the digitization of the direct selling network, Arbonne can help Groupe Rocher enhance the direct selling model. Arbonne has implemented a state-of-the-art IT platform that will facilitate the move from traditional direct selling to \"social selling.\"\nThis pending acquisition (the value of which has not been released) will round off the portfolio of Groupe Rocher brands and positions the family-owned, Breton company as an operator that is growing more than ever before. Groupe Rocher has been able to reposition its business over time, thanks to its decisions regarding distribution channels and its commitments as an integrated company.\nABOUT GROUPE ROCHER\nThe Groupe Rocher is a profitable and independent family-run group (over 99% owned by the founder's family and with a philosophy of \"creative entrepreneurship\") with an original positioning (producer, harvester, manufacturer and distributor). Groupe Rocher sales (from nine brands dedicated to women's beauty and well-being: Yves Rocher, Petit Bateau, Stanhome, Dr. Pierre Ricaud, Daniel Jouvance, Kiotis, ID Parfums, Flormar and Sabon) amounted to more than €2 billion in 2017.\nMore than 17,000 employees work together to ensure the destiny of the group's brands, and the group has also created over 350,000 indirect jobs. The business is an integrated group, characterized by the diversity and synergies of its distribution methods: Remote sales (by correspondence, telephone, Internet), in-store sales (over 6,000 points of sale across the world — brands combined) and direct sales.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/groupe-rocher-enters-into-a-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-arbonne-international-300592453.html\nSOURCE Arbonne International, LLC",
