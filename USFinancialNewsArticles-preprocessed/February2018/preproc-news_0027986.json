They will require total investment of more than 400 million euros ($494 million).\n“This is a perfect fit with our strategy to deliver sustainable bottom line growth in accordance with Innogy’s financial targets to maximise value for the company and our shareholders,” Chief Executive Uwe Tigges said.\nThe acquisition follows Innogy’s deal in December to buy onshore wind power projects with more than 2 gigawatts of capacity in the United States, its first move into the world’s second biggest wind market.\nShares in Innogy were up 2.5 percent, outperforming a 1.7 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Utilities index. Shares in RWE, Innogy’s parent which holds a 76.8 percent stake, were up 4 percent.\nThe company’s shares were hit in December when it issued a profit warning related to its British energy supply business npower. Innogy’s CEO Peter Terium left the company shortly afterwards.\nInnogy said it would review all options regarding the Australian project’s ownership and financing structure.\nThe two solar plants are expected to begin commercial operation by the end of next year, Innogy said, adding it was also looking at investment opportunities in the field of battery storage and onshore wind in Australia.
