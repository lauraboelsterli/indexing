We continue to have important milestones to meet on large engineering development contracts and are making good progress on those efforts. The Plant improvements are going well and we continue to balance investments for future growth with our desire to maintain and increase return to our shareholders. All things considered we had a very good quarter.\nEspey's primary business is the development, design, and production of specialized military and industrial power supplies/transformers.
