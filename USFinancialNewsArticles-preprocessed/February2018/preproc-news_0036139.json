    "text": "Khris Middleton scored 13 of his 21 points in the second half as the Milwaukee Bucks overcame a slow start to beat the visiting Atlanta Hawks 97-92 Tuesday night at the Bradley Center.\nMiddleton hit 7 of 15 shots, grabbed seven rebounds and finished with three steals. Teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo also shook off a cold start, making 4 of 6 shots in the second half and finishing with 15 points, 15 rebounds, three steals and two blocks.\nDennis Schroder led Atlanta with 18 points and Kent Bazemore made four 3-pointers to finish with 17 but the Hawks shot just 38.4 percent from the floor. Atlanta’s Dewayne Dedmon contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds.\nSchroder and Bazemore combined for 22 first-half points and each hit a pair of 3-pointers for the Hawks, who led 53-31 at the break.\nThe Bucks only shot 34 percent in the first half but snapped out of their funk in the third as Jabari Parker capped off a 12-2 run by dunking over Mike Muscala and John Collins to put Milwaukee up 63-53 with 4:19 left in the quarter.\nA short hook from Middleton kept the run going. After Atlanta scored four straight, Milwaukee’s Eric Bledsoe fed Tyler Zeller for a dunk, Bledsoe knocked down a 3-pointer, and the Bucks went into the fourth with a 74-61 lead.\nAfter being outscored 33-18 in the third, Atlanta opened the final period with an 11-4 run that cut the deficit to six with 7:35 to play.\nBazemore cut the deficit to two on a 3-pointer with 5:20 remaining, and after a Zeller dunk, a 3-pointer from Ersan Ilyasova put the Hawks within a point.\nMilwaukee stretched its lead back to three only for Bazemore to hit another from long distance, knotting things up at 84 with 3:30 to play.\nAntetokounmpo hit a jumper, then took a feed from Middleton for an easy layup to put Milwaukee back up eight. Ilyasova missed a pair of 3-point attempts in that stretch, and a Bledsoe dunk put Milwaukee on top by six with two minutes to play.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
