The focus of the meeting in the Austrian capital would be the “fight against illegal migration”, said Kurz, whose new coalition with the right-wing Freedom Party has made it a priority to avoid a repeat of the chaotic mass flows of refugees and migrants into Austria from the Balkans in 2015. Austria will hold the presidency of EU ministerial councils from July until December this year. Reporting by Alastair Macdonald in Brussels; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek",
