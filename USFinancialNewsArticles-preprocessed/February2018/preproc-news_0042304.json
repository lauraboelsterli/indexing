    "text": "Oil production grows 48% year-over-year 4Q oil sales more than double vs. year ago Delaware Basin oil volumes jumped 37% in 4Q 17 vs. 3Q 17 Transitioning to longer laterals in the Delaware Basin Hidatsa and Mandan wells each set Williston Basin records for oil volumes Reserves replacement rate in 2017 was 459% before considering divestitures Closed Permian Midstream JV and San Juan legacy gas sale\nTULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) reported fourth-quarter 2017 oil volumes of 75,200 barrels per day, which was 68 percent higher vs. a year ago and 16 percent higher than third-quarter 2017.\nWPX reported an unaudited fourth-quarter 2017 net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $35 million, or a loss of $0.09 per share on a diluted basis. The adjusted net loss from continuing operations in fourth-quarter 2017 was $9 million, or a loss of $0.02 per share. A reconciliation accompanies this release, as well as full-year financial results.\nFourth-quarter adjusted EBITDAX was $255 million, which was 89 percent higher than a year ago. in fourth-quarter 2017 was $279 million, marking an 81 percent improvement over the same period a year ago.\nWPX’s first two North Sunday Island wells in the Williston Basin have 120-day cumulative production of more than 576,000 Boe (81% oil), consisting of 298,000 Boe from the Hidatsa North 14-23HX well and 278,000 Boe from the Mandan North 13-24HW well.\nAccording to internal and public data, WPX’s North Sunday Island wells have the highest cumulative oil production over 90-day and 120-day periods for individual horizontal wells in the history of the Williston Basin.\n“Our disciplined execution against our multi-year plan continues to deliver new catalysts for long-term value creation. These drivers include transitioning to longer laterals in the Delaware Basin, the incredible performance from our Williston wells, our forward-looking approach to midstream infrastructure and a fast track to dramatically reduced leverage,” said Rick Muncrief, chairman and chief executive officer.\nRECENT EVENTS\nDuring fourth-quarter 2017, WPX closed on the formation of a Permian Basin midstream joint venture with Howard Energy Partners and completed the divestiture of its legacy natural gas position in the San Juan Basin.\nWPX received $349 million from Howard in the joint venture transaction and $175 million on the legacy gas sale subject to post-closing adjustments.\nSubsequent to Dec. 31, 2017, WPX signed an agreement to sell its holdings in the San Juan Basin’s Gallup oil play for $700 million. This represents the remainder of WPX’s position in the basin. Closing is expected to occur in the first quarter.\nAlso in January 2018, WPX signed an agreement to divest certain non-operated mineral interests in the Williston Basin for $20 million. Closing is expected to occur in the first quarter.\nDELAWARE MIDSTREAM UPDATE\nWPX took a number of actions during 2017 to provide flow assurance for its anticipated oil and gas volumes in the Delaware Basin. This includes the joint venture with Howard Energy Partners to develop a crude oil gathering system and a new cryogenic natural gas processing complex.\nRoughly 90 percent of the planned 50-mile crude oil gathering system in the JV has been installed. The trunk line is designed to have a capacity of approximately 125,000 bbl/d. WPX already has more than 60 wells tied in to the system.\nThe in-service date for the first of two 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing trains at the Reeves County gas plant is on track for mid-year. Much of the primary equipment already is set on foundations at the site.\nIn January, WPX also exercised an option to further its involvement in WhiteWater Midstream – owner of the Agua Blanca Pipeline – by increasing its ownership from 10 to 20 percent.\nWPX also increased its capacity on Agua Blanca from 300,000 MMBtu/d to 500,000 MMBtu/d. The capacity increases incrementally over a five-year period until reaching 500,000 MMBtu/d. The projected in-service date is second-quarter 2018.\nWPX has a similar option to double its 12.5 percent ownership to 25 percent in a pipeline being developed by Oryx Midstream Services, which will provide WPX with 100,000 bbl/d of firm crude oil capacity from the Delaware Basin to Midland and Crane. WPX will likely exercise this option mid-year. The projected in-service date is fourth-quarter 2018.\nDELAWARE BASIN HIGHLIGHTS\nDelaware production averaged 58.7 Mboe/d in fourth-quarter 2017, up 41 percent vs. the sequential quarter and 134 percent higher than the same period in 2016.\nWPX’s fourth-quarter Delaware oil volumes of 31,200 bbl/d increased 37 percent vs. third-quarter 2017 and were 160 percent higher than a year ago.\nWPX had 24 first sales in the basin during the fourth quarter, marking its highest level in 2017. There were 18 completions in the Wolfcamp A interval; five X/Y wells and one D well.\nA 1.5-mile Wolfcamp X/Y lateral on the Lindsay 10-3 pad posted a 24-hour high of 3,634 Boe/d during initial production. It has 90-day cumulative production of 242,000 Boe (55% oil).\nA 2-mile Wolfcamp D lateral on the CBR 6-7 pad posted a 24-hour high of 3,639 Boe/d during initial production. It has 90-day cumulative production of 203,000 Boe (34% oil).\nWPX’s 1.5-mile Lindsay 10-15 pad continues to show strong results from the Wolfcamp A formation. WPX now has 90-day cumulative production of 1,050,000 Boe (55% oil) from five long laterals. Cumulative 90-day oil production from the five wells exceeds 576,000 barrels.\nWILLISTON BASIN HIGHLIGHTS\nWilliston Basin production averaged 38.7 Mboe/d in fourth-quarter 2017, up 8 percent vs. the sequential quarter and 34 percent higher than the same period in 2016.\nWPX’s fourth-quarter Williston oil volumes of 33,100 bbl/d increased 6 percent vs. third-quarter 2017 and were 38 percent higher than a year ago.\nWPX had six first sales in the basin during the fourth quarter – all two-mile laterals from the Mandaree South and Mabel Levings pads. Three are Bakken Wells and three are Three Forks wells.\nFour of the six fourth-quarter completions had 24-hour peak rates of approximately 3,400 Boe/d or better. The highest rate occurred on the Mandaree South 25-36HC well, which posted 3,837 Boe/d (81% oil).\nThe previously mentioned Hidatsa and Mandan North wells are the first two of 23 wells planned in the North Sunday Island area. Seven wells on the Arikara pad are scheduled for completion late in the first quarter. Another 11 wells are being drilled – seven on the Hidatsa pad and four on the Mandan North pad.\n2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOil and NGL sales of $398 million accounted for 91 percent of WPX’s fourth-quarter total product revenues of $439 million. Quarterly oil revenue grew 106 percent vs. the same period in 2016 driven by higher production volumes and higher average prices.\nWPX’s fourth-quarter 2017 net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $35 million was significantly favorable to a net loss of $174 million in the same period a year ago. The improvement was driven by higher oil volumes and higher margins on each barrel being produced.\nHigher product revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 vs. a year ago were offset by $210 million of unrealized net losses associated with its hedge book that resulted from higher forward oil prices in both 2018 and 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses improved considerably in fourth-quarter 2017, down 22 percent vs. the prior-year period. On a per Boe basis, G&A expenses declined 47 percent.\nThe adjusted net loss from continuing operations (a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain items typically excluded from published analyst estimates) in the fourth quarter was $9 million, compared with a net loss of $54 million a year ago.\nAdjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased from quarter-to-quarter throughout 2017, hitting a high of $255 million in fourth-quarter 2017. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures accompany this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDAX, excluding the cash impact from the settlement of derivatives, has now increased for seven consecutive quarters.\nFor full-year 2017, WPX reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $26 million, or a loss of $0.06 per share; an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $166 million, or a loss of $0.42 per share; and adjusted EBITDAX of $710 million. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures accompany this press release.\nOil differentials improved 30 percent year-over-year from $7.01 per barrel in 2016 to $4.93 per barrel in 2017.\nFor full-year 2017, the weighted average gross sales price – prior to revenue deductions – for oil increased 26 percent to $47.03 per barrel vs. a year ago. Natural gas prices increased 26 percent to $2.69 per Mcf. NGL prices increased 52 percent to $23.83 per barrel. Oil prices in the fourth quarter averaged $52.45 per barrel.\nWPX’s total liquidity as of Dec. 31, 2017, was approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.1 billion of capacity from its credit facility and $189 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n2017 PRODUCTION\nTotal production volumes of 130.6 Mboe/d in fourth-quarter 2017 were up 47 percent vs. a year ago and 17 percent higher than third-quarter 2017.\nLiquids volumes accounted for 70 percent of production in fourth-quarter 2017, up 8 percent vs. a year ago. Production for 2017 includes gas volumes from WPX’s legacy gas holdings in the San Juan Basin that were divested at year-end.\nFollowing WPX’s exit from the San Juan Basin with the expected sale of its Gallup holdings, production is expected to be approximately 80 percent liquids and 20 percent gas.\nYear-over-year total production increased 30 percent to 109.8 Mboe/d in 2017, predominately driven by development in the Delaware Basin. WPX has now posted double-digit oil volume growth each of the past six years.\nAverage Daily Production 4Q Full Year 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Oil (Mbbl/d) Delaware Basin 31.2 12.0 160 % 22.0 13.0 69 % Williston Basin 33.1 24.0 38 % 30.0 20.8 44 % San Juan Basin 10.9 8.7 25 % 9.3 7.6 22 % Other 0 0 NM 0 0.1 NM Subtotal (Mbbl/d) 75.2 44.7 68 % 61.3 41.5 48 % NGLs (Mbbl/d) Delaware Basin 9.8 4.5 118 % 7.5 4.0 88 % Williston Basin 2.8 2.4 17 % 2.5 2.1 19 % San Juan Basin 4.2 3.7 14 % 3.8 3.8 0 % Other 0 0.1 NM 0 0.1 NM Subtotal (Mbbl/d) 16.8 10.7 57 % 13.8 10.0 38 % Natural gas (MMcf/d) Delaware Basin 106 52 104 % 78 43 81 % Williston Basin 17 14 21 % 14 13 8 % San Juan Basin 108 117 -8 % 112 125 -10 % Other 0 17 NM 4 18 78 % Subtotal (MMcf/d) 231 200 16 % 209 199 5 % Total Production (Mboe/d) 130.6 88.7 47 % 109.8 84.6 30 % NM denotes a percentage change that is immaterial or not meaningful.\nSan Juan Basin volumes are expected to be reclassified as discontinued operations in 2018.\nTotal capital spending for full-year 2017 was $1.2 billion, including land purchases and investments in midstream development.\nWPX completed 137 gross operated wells (127 net) across its operating areas during 2017 and participated in another 28 gross (5 net) non-operated wells.\n2017 PROVED RESERVES\nWPX’s proved reserves at Dec. 31, 2017, were 436.2 MMBoe. Sixty percent of the company’s proved reserves were oil, up from 50 percent in 2016.\nThe company replaced its overall 2017 production at a rate of 459 percent excluding divestitures. Approximately 77 percent of WPX’s reserves are oil and NGL, up from 65 percent at year-end 2016.\nPermian proved reserves increased 76 percent from a year ago to 252.4 MMBoe at year-end 2017. Williston proved reserves grew 25 percent to 131.2 MMBoe. San Juan proved reserves decreased 42 percent to 52.6 MMBoe as a result of divesting natural gas holdings in the basin.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nWPX provided 2018 pro forma production guidance on Feb. 5 based on the assumed closing of the sale of its Gallup oil holdings in the San Juan Basin. That guidance is unchanged. WPX expects 75-80 Mbbl/d of oil and 117-126 Mboe/d of production on a pro forma basis this year.\nFor 2018, WPX has 56,979 bbl/d of oil hedged at a weighted average price of $52.72 per barrel; 131,616 MMBtu/d of natural gas hedged at a weighted average price of $2.99 per MMBtu; and 11,335 bbl/d of NGL hedged. Hedge prices for NGL barrel components are included in the appendix of the webcast slide deck at www.wpxenergy.com . For 2019, WPX has 34,000 bbl/d of oil hedged at a weighted average price of $52.30 per barrel.\nWPX is providing additional detail for its 2018 planned capital spending. Total capital spending for continuing ops and midstream equity investments is estimated at $1,160 million to $1,310 million. That figure includes funding for land acquisition and midstream construction. Capital for drilling and completions is $1,040 million to $1,110 million.\nWPX’s divestiture of its Gallup oil holdings for $700 million accelerates the company’s deleveraging efforts. A significant portion of the proceeds are slated for debt reduction. WPX believes it can reduce its net debt/EBITDAX to a target level of 1.5x during 2019.\nJOIN THURSDAY’S WEBCAST\nThe company’s next webcast takes place on Feb. 22 beginning at 10 a.m. Eastern.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that the company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the company. Statements regarding future drilling and production are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of oil and gas. These risks include, but are not limited to, the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; uncertainties inherent in estimating oil, natural gas and NGL reserves; drilling risks; environmental risks; and political or regulatory changes. Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release, even if subsequently made available by WPX Energy on its website or otherwise. WPX Energy does not undertake and expressly disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available from us at WPX Energy, Attn: Investor Relations, P.O. Box 21810, Tulsa, Okla., 74102, or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nAdditionally, the SEC requires oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and governmental regulations. The SEC permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves. From time to time, we elect to use “probable” reserves and “possible” reserves, excluding their valuation. The SEC defines “probable” reserves as “those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.” The SEC defines “possible” reserves as “those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves.” The Company has applied these definitions in estimating probable and possible reserves. Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. Any reserve estimates provided in this presentation that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the SEC’s reserves reporting guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our SEC filings that may be accessed through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nThe SEC’s rules prohibit us from filing resource estimates. Our resource estimations include estimates of hydrocarbon quantities for (i) new areas for which we do not have sufficient information to date to classify as proved, probable or even possible reserves, (ii) other areas to take into account the low level of certainty of recovery of the resources and (iii) uneconomic proved, probable or possible reserves. Resource estimates do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery and are therefore not indicative of the expected future recovery and should not be relied upon. Resource estimates might never be recovered and are contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors.\nWPX Energy, Inc.
