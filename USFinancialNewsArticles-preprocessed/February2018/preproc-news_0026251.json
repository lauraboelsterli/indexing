    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 1:02 AM / Updated 19 hours ago Olympics: Norovirus outbreak tapers off as Games get underway Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizers   11 new cases of a virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea had been confirmed at the Games, bringing the total to 139. \nThe number of new norovirus cases is a steep drop-off from the 42 new cases confirmed on Thursday and 54 a day earlier. \nThe virus had broken out in the leadup to Friday’s opening ceremony in Pyeongchang and led to some 1,200 security staff being quarantined. Organizers had to call in military personnel to replace them. \nAs yet, no athletes have been confirmed to have contracted the highly contagious virus. An outbreak at last year’s World Athletics Championship in London forced competitors from several countries to miss events. \nPOCOG said several agencies were cooperating to stifle the outbreak, with water quality being tested and inspections taking place at venues, restaurants, hotels and worker accommodation.
