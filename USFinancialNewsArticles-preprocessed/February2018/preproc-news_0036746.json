    "text": "Feb 16 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s U.S. unit said on Friday it would recall about 228,508 trucks in the United States, Canada, Mexico and some other markets to prevent drivers from unintentionally shifting their vehicles out of “park.”\nThe brake transmission shift interlock (BTSI) may overheat on some vehicles, FCA US LLC said, adding that it would cause the shifter to be repositioned without brake-pedal application, or the presence of a key in the ignition.\nThe company said it is unaware of any injuries or accidents related to this recall, which is limited to vehicles equipped with gear-shifters on their steering columns.\nIn December, the unit said it would recall about 1.8 million trucks in the United States, Canada, Mexico and some other markets to fix a part if not operating could allow the driver to shift out of park without depressing the brake pedal.
