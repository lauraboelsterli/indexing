    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a release issued yesterday under the same headline by Nicholas Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:NICK), please note a change in the Portfolio Summary table. In the third column of the second-to-last row, the figure should be \"10.13%\" rather than \"15.20\" as originally issued. The corrected release follows:\nNicholas Financial Reports 3rd Quarter Results\nNicholas Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:NICK) announced that its pretax income for the three months ending December 31, 2017 was $.8 million. In the month of December 2017, the Company had a one-time income tax expense adjustment of $3.4 million relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) which reduced net income to a net loss. The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.9 million.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016 the Company had pretax earnings of $2.6 million and net earnings of $1.6 million. Diluted net loss per share decreased to $0.37 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.21 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Revenue decreased 7% to $20.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Company announced that its pretax income for the nine months ending December 31, 2017 was $2.7 million. In the month of December 2017, the Company had a one-time income tax expense adjustment of $3.4 million relating to the TCJA which reduced net income to a net loss. The net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.7 million.\nFor the nine months ended December 31, 2016 the Company had pretax earnings of $10.5 million and net earnings of $6.5 million. Diluted net loss per share decreased to $0.22 for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.83 for the nine months ended December 31, 2016. Revenue decreased 5% to $64.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $67.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law (“TCJA”). The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes to tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1, 2018. The decrease in the enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of $3.4 million in December 2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31, 2017.\nAs noted in prior filings the Company began modifying its underwriting guidelines, including the use of alternative data, in an effort to improve the quality of contracts being purchased. These changes led to approximately a 39% and 36% reduction in Contracts acquired during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016. The reduction in Contracts purchased during these periods resulted in a reduction of revenue during both the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016.\nOur net earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 were also affected by a $4.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses as compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2016 due to continued higher charge-offs and past-due accounts.\n“Although we are still very aware of excessive competition and its impact on the industry, Nicholas is now more focused on our own operations, procedures and performance. Since I returned to the Company in December 2017, we have recommitted ourselves to the Branch model and all the benefits that model offers. Along with that comes a recommitment to the underwriting discipline and pricing controls that made Nicholas a very successful company for decades. These are the same disciplines and controls that will help us regain control of our portfolio, minimize loses and increase returns,” said Doug Marohn, President and CEO.\nNicholas Financial, Inc. is one of the largest publicly-traded specialty consumer finance companies in North America. The Company operates branch locations in both Southeastern and Midwestern U.S. states. The Company has approximately 7,885,000 shares of voting common stock outstanding.
