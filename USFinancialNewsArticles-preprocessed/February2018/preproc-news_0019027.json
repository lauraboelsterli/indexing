On a trailing-twelve month basis, these businesses have generated over $200 million in segment income.\"\nRecent Business Highlights\nLiveRamp® added over 50 new direct clients during the quarter and added several new partner integrations . Marketers can now onboard and activate their data across a growing network of more than 550 publishers and marketing technology providers. Audience Solutions announced the launch of a new partnership with 4INFO to deliver location-based audience segments, modeled by Acxiom. The data-as-a-service solution combines 4INFO's Predictive Visitors™ audience segments with Acxiom data to create location-informed targeting segments for digital campaigns. Marketing Services posted its second largest bookings quarter since the Company divisionalized, driven by several meaningful new logo and upsell wins. Acxiom received the 2018 Supplier of the Year award from Walmart Services in recognition of its high level of performance and service. Acxiom was recognized as a great workplace by the independent analysts at Great Places to Work® . For the second year in a row, Acxiom earned this credential based on positive employee feedback in areas such as culture, rewards, work-life balance, communication and leadership. In addition, Great Places to Work and FORTUNE named Acxiom one of the 2018 Best Workplaces in Technology. Acxiom repurchased 729,000 shares for approximately $20 million during the quarter . Since the inception of its share repurchase program in August 2011, Acxiom has repurchased 18.4 million shares for $325 million, with $75 million remaining under authorization.\nFinancial Outlook\nAcxiom's non-GAAP guidance excludes the impact of non-cash stock compensation, purchased intangible asset amortization, restructuring charges and business separation costs.\nFor fiscal 2018, Acxiom now expects to report:\nRevenue of between $910 million and $915 million, an increase of approximately 6% year-over-year after adjusting for the Acxiom Impact divestiture. This is reduced from our previous guidance of between $920 million and $930 million primarily as a result of lower expected revenue from Audience Solutions. GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $0.19 and $0.23. Included in this guidance is an assumed tax reform benefit of approximately $0.28. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $0.85 and $0.89, an increase of between 20% and 25% year-over-year. Included in this guidance is an assumed tax reform benefit of between $0.04 and $0.05. This guidance is unchanged on a comparable basis.\nConference Call\nAcxiom will hold a conference call at 4:00 p.m. CT today to further discuss this information. Interested parties are invited to listen to the call which will be broadcast via the Internet and can be found on our investor site .

We believe these measures are helpful in understanding our past performance and our future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures and schedules are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated GAAP financial statements. Our management regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and to make operating decisions. These measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is also based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings per share, income from operations and adjusted EBITDA reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects when applicable:\nPurchased intangible asset amortization: We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) developed technology, (ii) customer and publisher relationships, and (iii) trade names. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance.\nNon-cash stock compensation: Non-cash stock compensation consists of charges for associate restricted stock units, performance shares and stock options in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.\nRestructuring charges: During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for associates whose positions were eliminated, lease termination charges, and leasehold improvement write offs. These items, reported as gains, losses, and other items, net, are excluded from non-GAAP results because such amounts are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.\nSeparation and transformation costs: In previous years, we incurred significant expenses in connection with the separation of our IT Infrastructure Management (\"ITO\") and the subsequent transformation of our remaining operating segments. This work enabled us to transform our external reporting and provide investors with enhanced transparency and more granular segment-level disclosures in addition to facilitating the ITO disposition. In the prior and current year, we are incurring expenses to further separate the financial statements of our three operating segments, with particular focus on segment-level balance sheets, and to evaluate portfolio priorities. Our criteria for excluding separation and transformation expenses from our non-GAAP measures is as follows: 1) projects are discrete in nature; 2) excluded expenses consist only of third-party consulting fees that we would not incur otherwise; and 3) we do not exclude employee related expenses or other costs associated with the ongoing operations of our business. We substantially completed these projects during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we will likely incur transaction analysis and support expenses related to the Company's announced evaluation of strategic options for its Marketing Solutions business. Our criteria for excluding these transaction related costs are the same. We believe excluding these items from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful for investors and provides meaningful supplemental information.\nOur non-GAAP financial schedules are:\nNon-GAAP EPS and Non-GAAP Income from Operations: Our non-GAAP earnings per share and Non-GAAP income from operations reflect adjustments as described above, as well as the related tax effects where applicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations before income taxes, other expenses, depreciation and amortization, and including adjustments as described above. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments and to compare our results to those of our competitors. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates analysis by investors in evaluating the Company's performance and trends. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance.\nFree Cash Flow to Equity: To supplement our statement of cash flows, we use a non-GAAP measure of cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free cash flow to equity is defined as operating cash flow less cash used by investing activities (excluding the impact of cash paid in acquisitions), less required payments of debt, and excluding the impact of discontinued operations. Management believes that this measure of cash flow is meaningful since it represents the amount of money available from continuing operations for the Company's discretionary spending after funding all required obligations including scheduled debt payments. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow to equity is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180206006192/en/\nAcxiom Investor Relations\nLauren Dillard, 650-372-2242\ninvestor.relations@acxiom.com\nEACXM\nSource: Acxiom Corporation",
