    "text": "CALGARY, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Pembina Pipeline Corporation (\"Pembina\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: PPL; NYSE: PBA) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a common share cash dividend for February 2018 of $0.18 per share to be paid, subject to applicable law, on March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 25, 2018. This dividend is designated an \"eligible dividend\" for Canadian income tax purposes. For non-resident shareholders, Pembina's common share dividends should be considered \"qualified dividends\" and may be subject to Canadian withholding tax.\nFor shareholders receiving their common share dividends in U.S. funds, the February 2018 cash dividend is expected to be approximately U.S. $0.1454 per share (before deduction of any applicable Canadian withholding tax) based on a currency exchange rate of 0.8078. The actual U.S. dollar dividend will depend on the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate on the payment date and will be subject to applicable withholding taxes.\nConfirmation of Record and Payment Date Policy\nPembina pays cash dividends on its common shares in Canadian dollars on a monthly basis to shareholders of record on the 25th calendar day of each month (except for the December record date, which is December 31st), if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors.
