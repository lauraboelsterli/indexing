    "text": "EL DORADO, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Deltic Timber Corporation (NYSE:DEL):\nDELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA SUMMARY FOURTH QUARTER 2017 2016 Net sales $ 72,041,000\n58,493,000 Net income 189,000 3,143,000 Earnings per common share Basic .02 .26 Assuming dilution .02 .26 Average common shares outstanding Basic 12,078,004 12,022,689 Assuming dilution 12,162,947 12,110,305 YEAR-TO-DATE 2017 2016 Net sales $ 242,265,000 219,363,000 Net income 6,488,000 9,245,000 Earnings per common share Basic .53 .76 Assuming dilution .53 .76 Average common shares outstanding Basic 12,070,270 12,009,534 Assuming dilution 12,150,185 12,073,888 Deltic Timber Corporation (NYSE:DEL), a natural resources company, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet sales totaled $72.1 million, compared to $58.5 million for fourth quarter 2016 Net income was $.2 million, or $.02 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $3.1 million, or $.26 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016 Fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted Net income 1 , which excludes Potlatch merger-related costs, was $11.3 million, or $.92 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.1 million, or $.26 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016\nFinancial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 benefited from increased operating income in the Woodlands and Manufacturing segments as demand for the Company's timber and wood products remained strong during the fourth quarter, but were offset by significantly increased corporate general and administration expenses related to the Agreement and Plan of Merger agreed upon by Deltic and Potlatch on October 22, 2017.\nWoodlands Segment\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nSold 327,570 tons of pine sawtimber, 83% above Q4 2016 Pine sawtimber prices averaged $28/ton, an increase of $1/ton from previous-year fourth quarter Sold 185,200 tons of pine pulpwood, 74% above Q4 2016 Pine pulpwood prices averaged $7/ton, a decrease of $1/ton from previous-year fourth quarter Sold approximately 851 acres of Higher Better Use (\"HBU\") timberland for $2,400/acre, compared to no sales in Q4 2016\nWoodlands Segment Financial Results\n($ in millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Q3 2017 Segment net sales $ 18.8 9.3 11.3 Segment operating income $ 9.9 4.2 5.4 Woodlands segment operating income increased in fourth quarter of 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016 due to higher volumes of sawtimber and pulpwood sold combined with sales of 851 acres of HBU timberland. The increase in timber volume sold was mainly due to Company sales of timber through timber deeds as part of the Company's strategic initiatives.\nManufacturing Segment\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nSold 68.1 million board feet of lumber, 7% above Q4 2016 Lumber prices averaged $22/MBF higher than Q4 2016 Sold 24.7 million square feet of Medium Density Fiberboard (\"MDF\"), 4% above Q4 2016 MDF prices increased $8/MSF compared to Q4 2016\nManufacturing Segment Financial Results\n($ in millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Q3 2017 Segment net sales $ 45.8 40.7 48.3 Segment operating income $ 5.2 3.2 3.7 Manufacturing segment operating income increased in fourth quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016, principally as a result of increased lumber sales volumes and price per MBF sold, combined with a higher sales volume of MDF and lower per-unit cost at the MDF plant.\nReal Estate Segment\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nSold 78 residential lots compared to 77 lots in Q4 2016 Residential lot sales prices averaged $98,000/lot, an increase of 19% from Q4 2016, due to mix Sold 4.8 acres of commercial acreage, which included the 35,000-square-foot retail center, compared to 23 acres in Q4 2016 Commercial sales price averaged $1,068,000 per acre, compared to $232,000 per acre in Q4 2016\nReal Estate Segment Financial Results\n($ in millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Q3 2017 Segment net sales $ 13.9 13.6 6.2 Segment operating income/(loss) $ 5.1 6.4 1.0 Real Estate segment operating income was lower in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016 as increased revenue from residential lot sales was offset by a write-down to the basis of the Company's speculative homes in our Red Oak Ridge development. Lot sales reflect the closings of successful lot offerings in three Chenal Valley neighborhoods and in the Wildwood development during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCorporate Segment General and Administrative Expense, Interest Expense, and Income Tax Expense\nCorporate segment general and administrative expense was $20.5 million, compared to $8.1 million for the same period of 2016. The increase is primarily due to higher legal and professional fees related to the merger with Potlatch. The provision for income tax was a benefit of $2.8 million, compared to an expense of $.3 million in the prior-year’s fourth quarter. The current year provision included a $2.5 million benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $4 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $11 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. There were no timberland acquisition expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to timberland acquisition expenditures of $.6 million during the same period of 2016.\n1 Supplemental Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe following table sets forth the Company's Adjusted Net Income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
