    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inphi Corporation (NYSE:IPHI), a leader in high-speed data movement interconnects, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017.\nGAAP Results\nRevenue from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $85.7 million on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, up 6% year-over-year, compared with $80.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This revenue growth reflects an increase in demand for COLORZ® inter-data center solutions and coherent DSP products from the ClariPhy acquisition partially offset by decrease in demand for linear transimpedance amplifier and linear driver products.\nGross margin from continuing operations under GAAP in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 62.0%, compared with 67.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles from the ClariPhy acquisition and change in the product mix.\nGAAP operating loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.3 million or (6.2%) of revenue from continuing operations, compared to GAAP income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $8.5 million or 10.5% of revenue from continuing operations. The loss was mainly due to amortization of acquired intangibles and increased expenses from the ClariPhy acquisition.\nGAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was almost break-even at $0.1 million, compared with GAAP net income from continuing operations of $19.1 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we recorded a tax benefit of $11.8 million primarily due to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to the new federal tax rate of 21% and the tax effect of intercompany transfer of intellectual property rights.\nInphi reports revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss), and earnings per share from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, net income, earnings per share from continuing operations, as well as a description of the items excluded from the non-GAAP calculations, is included in the financial statements portion of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Results\nGross margin from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 70.3%, compared with 73.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was largely due to change in product mix.\nNon-GAAP operating income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.2 million from continuing operations, compared with $23.4 million from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of our net investment in developing new Coherent DSP components as part of the ClariPhy acquisition.\nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $16.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share. This compares with non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $20.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“As we previously reported over the past few months, we continue to experience customer inventory burn and slow demand in the China long-haul and metro markets,” said President and CEO, Ford Tamer. “While visibility remains limited, we have recently received positive requests from some of our customers for increased demand starting in Q2. So, we believe that Q1, 2018, will be the bottom and we can resume growth starting in Q2. We also remain confident in the many growth vectors for Inphi revenue in the second half of 2018. This is based on new design wins for PAM DSPs, with associated linear TiAs and drivers, inside US cloud data centers driven by AI, Infiniband and Ethernet networking applications; M200 coherent DSP ramp in Europe, Asia and US; the ramp of Inphi’s 400G coherent TiAs and drivers; and continued growth of COLORZ in the second half of the year in US and China.”\nFull Year 2017 Results\nRevenue from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $348.2 million, compared with $266.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. GAAP net loss from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $74.9 million, or ($1.78) per diluted share, on approximately 42.2 million basic weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares with GAAP net income from continuing operations of $26.5 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on approximately 44.1 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $67.2 million, or $1.52 per diluted weighted average common share outstanding, on approximately 44.3 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares with non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $66.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, or $1.51 per diluted weighted average common share outstanding, on approximately 44.0 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following statements are based on the company’s current expectations for the first quarter of 2018. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. A reconciliation between the GAAP and Non-GAAP outlook is included at the end of this press release.\nRevenue in Q1 2018 is expected to be in a range of $58.0 million to $62.0 million. The midpoint being $60.0 million. GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 55.1% to 56.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 67.4% to 68.4%. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be in the range of $12.5 million to $12.7 million. GAAP results are expected to be a net loss in a range between $21.5 million to $22.7 million, or ($0.50) – ($0.53) per basic share, based on 42.8 million estimated weighted average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net loss, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and inventory step up fair value related to acquisitions and noncash interest on convertible debt, is expected to be in the range of $1.6 million to $2.6 million, or ($0.04) - ($0.06) per basic and diluted share, based on 42.8 million estimated weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding.\nQuarterly Conference Call Today\nInphi plans to hold a conference call today at 5 p.m. Eastern Time / 2 p.m. Pacific Time with Ford Tamer, president and chief executive officer, and John Edmunds, chief financial officer, to discuss the fourth quarter 2017 results.\nThe call can be accessed by dialing (844) 459-2451, participant passcode: 1179617.

INPHI CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(in thousands of dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nTo supplement the financial data presented on a GAAP basis, the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude stock-based compensation, legal, transition costs and other expenses, purchase price fair value adjustments related to acquisitions, impairment of certain intangibles, non-cash interest expense related to convertible debt, indirect expenses associated with discontinued operations and deferred tax asset valuation allowance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP. These results should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company believes that its non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations because it excludes charges or benefits that management considers to be outside of the Company’s core operating results. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures of gross margin, income from operations, net income and earnings per share, in combination with the Company’s financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective and a more meaningful understanding of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. In addition, the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to review and assess the financial performance of the Company, to determine executive officer incentive compensation and to plan and forecast performance in future periods. The Company’s non-GAAP measurements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are not an alternative to GAAP financial information, and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other companies.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME (in thousands of dollars, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP gross margin to Non-GAAP gross margin GAAP gross margin $ 53,084 $ 54,289 $ 196,503 $ 180,696 Adjustments to GAAP gross margin: Stock-based compensation 391 (a) 506 (a) 2,045 (a) 1,796 (a) Acquisition related expenses 20 (b) - 143 (b) 47 (b) Amortization of inventory step-up - 851 (c) 9,304 (c) 1,092 (c) Amortization of intangibles 6,752 (d) 3,598 (d) 28,502 (d) 12,223 (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets (17 ) (e) 25 (e) (5 ) (e) 98 (e) Impairment of certain developed technology - - 10,174 (g) - Non-GAAP gross margin $ 60,230 $ 59,269 $ 246,666 $ 195,952 GAAP operating expenses to Non-GAAP operating expenses GAAP research and development $ 41,965 $ 30,808 $ 200,539 $ 108,013 Adjustments to GAAP research and development: Stock-based compensation (7,887 ) (a) (4,942 ) (a) (28,846 ) (a) (17,390 ) (a) Acquisition related expenses (367 ) (b) - (1,839 ) (b) (372 ) (b) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets (216 ) (e) (18 ) (e) (767 ) (e) (192 ) (e) Indirect expenses associated with discontinued operations - - - (1,904 ) (f) Impairment of in-process research and development - - (36,840 ) (g) - Non-GAAP research and development $ 33,495 $ 25,848 $ 132,247 $ 88,155 GAAP sales and marketing $ 10,801 $ 8,252 $ 42,381 $ 26,534 Adjustments to GAAP sales and marketing: Stock-based compensation (2,292 ) (a) (1,379 ) (a) (8,340 ) (a) (4,405 ) (a) Acquisition related expenses (179 ) (b) - (772 ) (b) (193 ) (b) Amortization of intangibles (2,432 ) (d) (595 ) (d) (9,725 ) (d) (1,207 ) (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets (28 ) (e) (30 ) (e) (103 ) (e) (102 ) (e) Non-GAAP sales and marketing $ 5,870 $ 6,248 $ 23,441 $ 20,627 GAAP general and administrative $ 5,605 $ 6,765 $ 23,782 $ 21,201 Adjustments to GAAP general and administrative: Stock-based compensation (1,895 ) (a) (1,293 ) (a) (5,602 ) (a) (4,407 ) (a) Acquisition related expenses (3 ) (b) (1,626 ) (b) (756 ) (b) (1,663 ) (b) Amortization of intangibles (116 ) (d) (58 ) (d) (464 ) (d) (196 ) (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets 67 (e) (11 ) (e) 279 (e) (26 ) (e) Non-GAAP general and administrative $ 3,658 $ 3,777 $ 17,239 $ 14,909 Non-GAAP total operating expenses $ 43,023 $ 35,873 $ 172,927 $ 123,691 GAAP net income (loss) to Non-GAAP net income GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations $ 102 $ 19,064 $ (74,904 ) $ 26,513 Adjusting items to GAAP net income (loss): Operating expenses related to stock-based compensation expense 12,465 (a) 8,120 (a) 44,833 (a) 27,998 (a) Acquisition related expenses 569 (b) 1,626 (b) 3,510 (b) 2,275 (b) Amortization of inventory fair value step-up - 851 (c) 9,304 (c) 1,092 (c) Amortization of intangibles related to purchase price 9,300 (d) 4,251 (d) 38,691 (d) 13,626 (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets 160 (e) 84 (e) 586 (e) 418 (e) Indirect expenses associated with discontinued operations - - - 1,904 (f) Impairment of certain intangibles from ClariPhy acquisition - - 47,014 (g) - Loss on retirement of certain property and equipment from ClariPhy acquisition - - 77 (h) - Accretion and amortization expense on convertible debt 6,356 (i) 5,920 (i) 24,574 (i) 14,156 (i) Gain on sale of cost method investment - - - (1,138 ) (j) Valuation allowance and tax effect of the adjustments above from GAAP to non-GAAP (12,723 ) (k) (19,158 ) (k) (26,523 ) (k) (20,390 ) (k) Non-GAAP net income $ 16,229 $ 20,758 $ 67,162 $ 66,454 Shares used in computing non-GAAP basic earnings per share 42,595,179 41,226,267 42,165,213 40,565,433 Shares used in computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share before offsetting shares from call option 44,335,639 44,910,456 44,524,224 44,124,881 Offsetting shares from call option - (369,196 ) (201,291 ) (92,299 ) Shares used in computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 44,335,639 44,541,260 44,322,933 44,032,582 Non-GAAP earnings per share: Basic $ 0.38 $ 0.50 $ 1.59 $ 1.64 Diluted $ 0.37 $ 0.47 $ 1.52 $ 1.51 GAAP gross margin as a % of revenue 62.0 % 67.1 % 56.4 % 67.9 % Stock-based compensation 0.5 % 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.7 % Amortization and write-off of inventory fair value step-up and intangibles 7.8 % 5.6 % 13.8 % 5.0 % Non-GAAP gross margin as a % of revenue 70.3 % 73.3 % 70.8 % 73.6 %\n(a) Reflects the stock-based compensation expense recorded relating to stock based awards.
