    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - New engines made by Pratt & Whitney for the latest Airbus single-aisle jetliner, the A320neo, pose a potential shut-down risk, the U.S. aviation regulator said on Wednesday.\nThe Federal Avation Administration’s formal warning follows a similar action by European regulators on Feb. 9, and cites a “knife edge seal fracture” in the engine that could lead to an engine stall“ and consequent inflight shutdown and rejected takeoffs,” the FAA said in an airworthiness directive.
