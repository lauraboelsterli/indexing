    "text": "FALLS CHURCH, Va., Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CSRA Inc. (NYSE: CSRA), a leading provider of next-generation IT solutions and professional services to government organizations, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, which ended December 29, 2017.\n\"CSRA is the clear leader in next-generation IT delivery for the federal government, which is increasingly looking to harness the transformational potential of the cloud,\" said Larry Prior, CSRA president and CEO. \"Our strong third quarter results demonstrate the power of that premise. We delivered robust revenue growth with important new programs and strategic acquisitions while maintaining our industry-leading margins. Our focus on innovation with leading technology partners continues to drive strong business development success, which signals that our long-term model is solid and our foundation is strong.\"\nSummary Operating Results (Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions, except\nper share data)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nRevenue\n$\n1,309\n$\n1,222\n$\n3,810\n$\n3,739\nOperating income\n$\n128\n$\n104\n$\n398\n$\n346\nNet income attributable to CSRA\ncommon stockholders\n$\n188\n$\n126\n$\n341\n$\n267\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$\n1.14\n$\n0.76\n$\n2.07\n$\n1.62\nNon-GAAP Measures:\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n201\n$\n188\n$\n604\n$\n586\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n0.56\n$\n0.44\n$\n1.50\n$\n1.43\nNote: All figures are unaudited; refer to Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this news\nrelease for a more detailed discussion of management's use of non-GAAP measures and for reconciliations to\nGAAP financial measures.\nRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $1.31 billion, up 7 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, the largest year-over-year increase since the Company was formed in November 2015, reflecting both organic growth and contributions from recent acquisitions. Revenue for the quarter was up 3 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 despite higher seasonal leave-taking, which historically dampens third quarter revenue approximately 3 percentage points.\nOperating income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 of $128 million (9.8 percent operating margin) included $59 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense; $4 million of cash expense for acquisition, integration, and other costs; and $8 million of non-cash loss on the sale of the Company's corporate headquarters building (net of $2 million reimbursable portion). Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes these items, was $201 million for the third quarter, up 7 percent year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4 percent was above the Company's long-term target range 14 to 15 percent as the result of strong contract performance and disciplined cost management.\nNet income attributable to CSRA shareholders for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $188 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to $126 million, or $0.76 per share in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. As a result of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" of 2017, the effective tax rate for the quarter was (64.1) percent, which includes a benefit of $101 million associated with the estimated net effect of the Act on CSRA's deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of the period. Absent that adjustment, the Company's provision for current period income taxes was recognized using a prorated statutory rate, which makes the year-to-date rate excluding that benefit equal the effective rate expected for the full fiscal year of 2018.\nAdjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the one-time benefit associated with the net deferred tax liabilities; the impact of pension and other post-retirement plans; costs directly associated with acquisition, separation, and merger transactions; and the amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets, was $0.56 for the quarter, up 27% compared to $0.44 in the comparable period in fiscal year 2017. Excluding all impacts of tax reform, including the deferred tax liability adjustments and the lower statutory rate, CSRA's effective tax rate in the third quarter would have been 31.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS would have been $0.49, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year.\nCash Management and Capital Deployment\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, operating cash flow was $157 million, and free cash flow was $133 million, or about 1.4 times adjusted net income. The strong cash generation reflected improvements in working capital compared to the first half of the year. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) for the quarter were 59 days. The $33 million of gross cash proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction are not included in operating or free cash flow and do not impact DSO.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company returned $17 million to shareholders through its regular quarterly cash dividend program. In addition, the Company completed its acquisition of Praxis Engineering Technologies LLC (\"Praxis\"), a leader in providing mission applications to ensure the success of Intelligence Community customers, for approximately $235 million in cash.\nOn December 29, 2017, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which increased borrowings under the Term Loan B facility by $200 million and extended the maturity dates of the Tranche A2 facility and Revolving Credit facility by one year. The additional borrowings under the Term Loan B facility were immediately applied to repay in full the aggregate principal amount of advances outstanding under the Revolving Credit facility, which had been used to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration for NES Associates, LLC and Praxis and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Third Amendment.\nAt quarter end, the Company had $80 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt (excluding capital lease obligations). In December 2017, the Board of Directors declared that the Company would pay a cash dividend of $0.10 per share. Payment of the dividend was made on January 25, 2018 to CSRA stockholders of record at the close of business on January 4, 2018.\nBusiness Development\nBookings in the third quarter totaled $1.6 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, the twelfth consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x or higher. Bookings for the trailing twelve months totaled $8.8 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7x.\nIncluded in the quarterly bookings were several particularly important single-award prime contracts:\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Enterprise Service Desk (ESD). The VA awarded CSRA a five-year, $238 million task order to transition 12 existing national IT service desks to an ESD for enterprise-class IT services and support. This project represents the VA's first migration of critical services to a managed service environment, which will be operated at CSRA's Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, La. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS). Under a $677 million contract extending up to 12 and a half years, CSRA will support the system operations, maintenance, and development of the TFMS, as it has done since 1981. Under the new contract, CSRA will incorporate the FAA's NextGen future technologies program that provides air traffic managers the most up-to-date situational awareness to minimize delays and increase air safety. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Call Center. CSRA received a two-year, $62 million task order to provide citizenship and immigration information to customers of the USCIS Customer Engagement Center (CEC). This award expands CSRA's work with the CEC, and CSRA is now the sole provider of these services to the CEC. The CEC accepts between 12 million and 14 million phone calls and web chats annually.\nThe Company's backlog of signed business orders at the end of third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $18.2 billion, of which $2.6 billion was funded.\nForward Guidance\nWith three quarters of reported performance, the Company is modifying its previously announced guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018 as specified in the table below. Free cash flow guidance is unchanged. The Company elects to provide ranges for certain metrics that are not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP because it cannot make reliable estimates of key items that would be necessary to provide guidance for its GAAP operating and cash flow measures, including pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments and amounts associated with any changes to its receivables purchase agreement.\nMetric\nFiscal Year 2018\nRevenue (millions)\n$5,150 - $5,200\nAdjusted EBITDA (millions)\n$805 - $825\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\n$2.00 - $2.05\nFree Cash Flow (millions)\n$330 - $380\nCSRA chief financial officer Dave Keffer commented, \"With strong financial performance across the board, we are able to maintain or improve our guidance ranges for all metrics. Our ranges imply strong organic growth in our fourth quarter, and tax reform is helping to drive strong earnings growth and free cash flows.\"\nConference Call\nCSRA executive management will hold a conference call on February 7, 2018, at 5 p.m. Eastern to discuss the financial results and outlook and answer questions.

The following table summarizes revenue and segment operating income by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(Dollars in millions; unaudited)\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nRevenue\nDefense and Intelligence\n$\n605\n$\n556\n$\n1,687\n$\n1,699\nCivil\n704\n666\n2,123\n2,040\nSegment operating income (a)\nDefense and Intelligence\n70\n37\n203\n149\nCivil\n88\n91\n283\n270\nNotes:\n(a) Excludes segment operating income (loss) for the Corporate segment as well as acquisition, integration, and other costs.\nFor the three months ended December 29, 2017, Defense and Intelligence segment revenues increased by $49 million, or 9 percent, compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year. The primary drivers of the increase were the acquisitions of NES and Praxis and increased work scope on a contract to provide logistics and maintenance support for Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, partially offset by declines in the Army Logistics Modernization Program and the U.S. Strategic Command Information Technology Capabilities Contract, which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. Third quarter fiscal year 2018 Civil segment revenues increased by $38 million, or 6 percent compared to revenues from the same period of the prior year, driven by the expansion of recent program wins at several agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of Personnel Management, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Environmental Protection Agency.\nDefense and Intelligence segment operating margin for the quarter increased to 11.5% from 6.7% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven in part by exceptional performance on a large fixed price program. Conversely, Civil segment operating margin decreased to 12.5% from 13.7% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017; the decrease is primarily due to higher direct costs associated with software license fees that were partially offset by lower indirect costs related to depreciation and amortization.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables illustrate the items and means to reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. CSRA management believes that adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and margin, and free cash flow provide useful additional information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations, as they provide additional measures of the Company's profitability and ability to service its debt. In addition, these measures are considered important measures by financial analysts covering CSRA, and are used in determining executive compensation.\nOur non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently than similarly named measures reported by other companies. In addition, using non-GAAP measures may have limited value as they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on reported financial results and cash flows. When analyzing CSRA's performance, it is important to evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation and use adjusted measures in addition to, and not as an alternative to, GAAP measures.\nThe major adjustments to GAAP to derive adjusted metrics are summarized below:\nPlan Impacts. At the time of the Spin-off on November 27, 2015, CSRA assumed the assets and obligations of the pension and other post-retirement plans from CSC. The recurring net non-cash benefits associated with these plans are excluded from all quarters. The mark-to-market effect in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 is excluded in the adjusted metrics; there were no other plan remeasurements in the current or year-ago quarterly or year-to-date periods. Acquisition, Integration, and Other Costs. Costs directly associated with acquisitions, including integration costs and costs associated with the separation and merger transactions, are excluded from adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. Acquisition-related Intangible Amortization. All amortization associated with acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. Net Deferred Tax Liabilities. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" of 2017. The Company is required to evaluate its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 29, 2017 using the new statutory rates. The benefit of approximately $101 million associated with the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liability is excluded from adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS. Sale-Leaseback Transaction. On November 2, 2017, CSRA closed a sale-leaseback transaction with MCPII 3170 Fairview, LLC, pursuant to which the Company sold its corporate headquarters property in Falls Church, Va. and simultaneously leased back a significant portion of the building. The gross sale price was $33 million, and the Company recognized a loss of approximately $10 million. The proceeds from the sale are excluded from free cash flow, and the $8 million unbillable portion of the loss is excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nCSRA INC.\nADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n117\n$\n204\n$\n366\n$\n434\nAcquisition, integration, and other costs\n3\n5\n17\n18\nOther separation-related items (within SG&A and cost of services) (a)\n9\n23\n8\n31\nActuarial and settlement (gains) losses of the defined benefit plans (\"Plans\")\n—\n(114)\n—\n(114)\nNet benefit of defined benefit plans\n(20)\n(23)\n(61)\n(72)\nAmortization of backlog associated with SRA acquisition (b)\n—\n11\n—\n43\nOther acquisition & spin-off-related intangible amortization (c)\n15\n12\n45\n42\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n124\n118\n375\n382\nAdjusted income tax expense (d)\n27\n44\n119\n138\nAdjusted net income\n97\n74\n256\n244\nLess: Noncontrolling interest\n4\n2\n9\n9\nAdjusted net income attributable to CSRA common stockholders\n$\n93\n$\n72\n$\n247\n$\n235\nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.56\n$\n0.44\n$\n1.50\n$\n1.43\nNotes: Adjusted net income attributable to CSRA common stockholders may not equal the sum of the component figures due to rounding.\n(a)\nThe nine months ended December 29, 2017 includes approximately $2 million of interest expense for the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the restructuring of the Company's debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The three and nine months ended December 29, 2017 includes approximately $8 million of unbilled, non-cash loss on the sale of the Company's corporate headquarters building.\n(b)\nTotal value of $65 million amortized over the period November 30, 2015 to November 30, 2016 is included in Income before income taxes.\n(c)\nThe nine months ended December 29, 2017 includes $4.9 million in accelerated amortization expense related to software acquired in the spin-off of the North American Public Sector business from Computer Sciences Corporation, now known as DXC Technology, (\"Spin-off\") that was discontinued for further use in the period.\n(d)\nFor the nine months ended December 29, 2017, the adjusted income tax expense utilizes an effective rate of 31.85%, which reflects the projected rate for the fiscal year, absent the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from enactment of the Tax Act. For the three and nine months ended December 30, 2016, the adjusted income tax utilizes the effective tax rate for GAAP purposes.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Margin\nDuring the nine months ended December 29, 2017, CSRA adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-07—Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which changes the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement costs. Previously, operating income included net periodic benefits of CSRA's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Under the new presentation, operating income excludes this benefit, so it is no longer deducted to compute adjusted EBITDA. The prior periods have been revised to conform with current period presentation.\nCSRA INC.\nADJUSTED EBITDA (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDecember 30,\n2016\nOperating Income\n$\n128\n$\n104\n$\n398\n$\n346\nLess: other expense, net\n(2)\n(1)\n(5)\n(3)\nOther separation-related items (within SG&A and cost of services) (a)\n9\n15\n7\n22\nAdd:\nAcquisition, integration and other costs (b)\n3\n5\n17\n18\nDepreciation and amortization\n59\n61\n175\n189\nAmortization of contract-related intangibles\n—\n—\n—\n3\nStock-based compensation\n4\n4\n11\n11\nForeign currency loss\n1\n—\n1\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n201\n$\n188\n$\n604\n$\n586\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\n15.4\n%\n15.4\n%\n15.9\n%\n15.7\n%\nNotes:\n(a)\nThe fiscal year 2017 periods include $14 million of stock-based compensation that was associated with the SRA merger.\n(b)\nConsists of costs directly associated with the Spin-off and the merger with SRA International Inc.
