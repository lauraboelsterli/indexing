    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN) today announced the appointment of Keith McGregor as a Senior Managing Director in the Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment, continuing to deepen the firm’s global company-side restructuring capabilities.\nMr. McGregor, who joins FTI Consulting from EY, will be based in New York. In his role, he will focus on working with distressed companies, their stakeholders and prospective alternative capital providers across multiple sectors globally. He brings more than 25 years of experience in restructuring as a financial advisor, restructuring banker and chief restructuring officer (“CRO”) in multinational and domestic situations across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.\n“We continue to look for the right opportunities to enhance our company-side advisory practice, as we did with the addition of the team from the CDG Group in 2017,” said Michael Eisenband , Global Co-Leader of the Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment at FTI Consulting. “Keith draws on his extensive background working with corporations, governments and financiers to help his clients identify value from financial and operational restructurings. His experience is a perfect complement to our ongoing commitment to be the leading diversified global restructuring practice.”\nMr. McGregor spent three years with EY’s U.S. restructuring business in New York, where he worked on restructurings in the energy, consumer products, infrastructure and media sectors, both in and out of Chapter 11. Before moving to New York, Mr. McGregor led EY’s restructuring group in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa and supported the development of the global corporate finance practice in the United States and Asia Pacific. He has deep experience in retail restructurings as both an advisor and executive. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, he has personally led large and complex restructurings across multiple industries with a capitalization of more than $100 billion.\nCommenting on his appointment, Mr. McGregor said, “The most important factor for me was the ability to fully leverage my experience with the breadth of FTI Consulting’s platform. It has a leading reputation globally, and in addition the diversified offerings enable the firm to provide services to clients beyond pure restructuring, which is increasingly important, especially to alternative capital providers. The depth and breadth of the platform and the expertise are a perfect fit, and I am excited to begin working with the team.”\nAbout FTI Consulting\nFTI Consulting, Inc. is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political & regulatory, reputational and transactional.
