    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BridgeSat announced today that optics, laser and aerospace specialist Tanya Ramond has joined the company as director of product management. Ramond’s 23-plus years of market analysis, engineering management and hands-on R&D work will help BridgeSat revolutionize global communications with a free-space optical network for low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites that’s faster and less expensive than traditional radio frequency (RF) solutions.\nRamond joins BridgeSat from Sapienne Consulting, which she founded to provide technology strategy, product road mapping, market feasibility analysis and other services to clients in industries including optics, laser and aerospace. She also served as CTO of York Space Systems.\nIn nearly a decade at Ball Aerospace & Technologies, Ramond was engineering manager for several multi-million-dollar R&D projects for customers such as NASA. This role included successfully getting troubled projects back on schedule and working with multidisciplinary teams in optics and mechanical, electrical and thermal engineering. She also provided new business support with proposals for clients.\nRamond’s work with lasers began in 2001 as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where she researched the use of femtosecond lasers for frequency metrology and hand-built lasers.\n“Between its industry-first partnership with NASA and contracts with the Swedish Space Corporation and the Japanese government, all in less than a year, BridgeSat has quickly established itself as the go-to partner for organizations that want a fundamentally superior approach to satellite communications,” Ramond said. “These wins show that unlike many early-stage companies, BridgeSat has already moved from promising to delivering. I’m excited to have a role in BridgeSat’s pioneering work.”\n“Tanya knows—and does—what it takes to get and keep complex projects and products on track, and that expertise is critical as BridgeSat quickly adds major customers and partners such as NASA,” said Barry Matsumori, BridgeSat CEO . “She will also develop creative technical and business solutions to meet customer expectations.”\nAbout BridgeSat\nBridgeSat is enabling the future of space using optical communications solutions through a global network of ground stations and space terminals. These systems will enable high bandwidth solutions for unique applications as well as complement RF in hybrid networks. BridgeSat has further developed applications for LEO and GEO satellite systems.\nMore information can be found at www.bridgesatinc.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227005424/en/\nBridgeSat\nValerie Christopherson\nLora Wilson\n+1 949 608 0276\nbridgesat@globalresultspr.com\nSource: BridgeSat",
