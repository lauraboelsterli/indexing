    "text": "Achieves Record Annual Revenues\nProvides Fiscal 2018 Financial Estimates\nAnnounces Twenty-Sixth Consecutive Quarterly Dividend Increase\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- j2 Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: JCOM) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, provided fiscal 2018 financial estimates and announced that its Board of Directors has declared an increased quarterly cash dividend of $0.405 per share.\n“j2 continues to demonstrate its power as a vertically-driven, Internet information and services company,” said Vivek Shah, CEO of j2 Global. “We have an expanding portfolio of some of the best ad- and subscription-supported brands on the Internet. We remain committed to the strategy and operating model that produced record results last year and should help us achieve our goals in 2018.”\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nQ4 2017 quarterly revenues increased 25.7% to a Q4 record of $316.4 million compared to $251.8 million for Q4 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased 4.9% to $85.4 million compared to $89.8 million for Q4 2016. Q4 2017 free cash flow (1) decreased 8.9% to $75.3 million compared to $82.7 million for Q4 2016. The decline in free cash flow (1) is due to a greater percentage of the revenues and EBITDA coming from the media business which has a longer collection cycle resulting in less cash inflows associated with accounts receivable of approximately $19.0 million in comparison to Q4 2016.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share (2) increased 14.6% to $1.02 in Q4 2017 compared to $0.89 for Q4 2016. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share (2)(3) for the quarter increased 20.1% to $1.79 compared to $1.49 for Q4 2016.\nGAAP net income increased 15.5% to $49.9 million in Q4 2017 compared to $43.2 million for Q4 2016.\nQuarterly Adjusted EBITDA (4) increased 21.8% to $141.9 million in the quarter compared to $116.5 million for Q4 2016.\nj2 ended the quarter with approximately $408.7 million in cash and investments after deploying approximately $149.4 million during the quarter for acquisitions and the payment of j2’s regular quarterly dividends.\nKey financial results for Q4 2017 versus Q4 2016 are set forth in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts). Reconciliations of Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures are attached to this Press Release.\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 % Change Revenues Cloud Services $146.9 million $143.0 million 2.7% Digital Media $169.5 million $108.8 million 55.8% Total Revenue:\n$316.4 million $251.8 million 25.7% Operating Income $76.2 million $68.2 million 11.7% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $85.4 million $89.8 million (4.9)% Free Cash Flow (1) $75.3 million $82.7 million (8.9)% GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share (2) $1.02 $0.89 14.6% Adjusted Non-GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share (2) (3) $1.79 $1.49 20.1% GAAP Net Income $49.9 million $43.2 million 15.5% Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income $87.3 million $72.2 million 20.9% Adjusted EBITDA (4) $141.9 million $116.5 million 21.8% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (4) 44.8% 46.3% (1.5)% FULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS\n2017 revenues increased 27.9% to a record of $1,117.8 million in 2017 compared to $874.3 million for 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased 6.4% to $264.4 million in 2017 compared to $282.4 million for 2016. 2017 free cash flow (1) decreased 1.2% to $264.8 million compared to $267.9 million for 2016. The decline in free cash flow (1) is due to additional cash outflows associated with income taxes of approximately $28.0 million and a greater percentage of the revenues and EBITDA coming from the media business which has a longer collection cycle resulting in less cash inflows associated with accounts receivable of approximately $7.0 million in comparison to 2016.\nGAAP earnings per diluted share (5) decreased 9.6% to $2.83 in 2017 compared to $3.13 for 2016. The decrease over the prior comparable period is primarily attributed to the increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of the $650 million 6.0% Senior Notes due in 2025, the loss on extinguishment of the $250 million 8.0% Senior Notes and the increased amortization expense associated with acquisitions, most notably Everyday Health. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share (5)(6) for the year increased 13.0% to $5.64 compared to $4.99 for 2016.\nGAAP net income decreased by 8.5% to $139.4 million in 2017 compared to $152.4 million for 2016. The decrease over the prior comparable period is primarily attributed to the increase in interest expense associated with the issuance of the $650 million 6.0% Senior Notes due in 2025, the loss on extinguishment of the $250 million 8.0% Senior Notes and the increased amortization expense associated with acquisitions, most notably Everyday Health.\nAnnual Adjusted EBITDA (4) increased 16.9% to $463.0 million in 2017 compared to $396.1 million for 2016.\nj2 ended the year with approximately $408.7 million in cash and investments after deploying approximately $256.1 million during the year for acquisitions and the payment of j2’s regular quarterly dividends.\nKey financial results for 2017 versus 2016 are set forth in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts). Reconciliations of Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures are attached to this Press Release.\n2017 2016 % Change Revenues Cloud Services $578.9 million $567.0 million 2.1% Digital Media $538.9 million $307.3 million 75.4% Total Revenue:\n$1,117.8 million $874.3 million 27.9% Operating Income $245.7 million $242.6 million 1.3% Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $264.4 million $282.4 million (6.4)% Free Cash Flow (1) $264.8 million $267.9 million (1.2)% GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share (5) $2.83 $3.13 (9.6)% Adjusted Non-GAAP Earnings per Diluted Share (5) (6) $5.64 $4.99 13.0% GAAP Net Income $139.4 million $152.4 million (8.5)% Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income $275.1 million $243.9 million 12.8% Adjusted EBITDA (4) $463.0 million $396.1 million 16.9% Adjusted EBITDA Margin (4) 41.4% 45.3% (3.9)% BUSINESS OUTLOOK\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company estimates that it will achieve revenues between $1.20 billion and $1.25 billion, Adjusted EBITDA between $480 million and $505 million and Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of between $5.95 and $6.25.\nAdjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2018 excludes share-based compensation of between $31 million and $34 million, amortization of acquired intangibles and the impact of any currently unanticipated items, in each case net of tax.\nIt is anticipated that the non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2018 (exclusive of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions) will be between 23.0% and 25.0%.\nThe Company has not reconciled the Adjusted non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and tax rate guidance included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability with respect to costs related to acquisitions and taxation, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable and significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.\nDIVIDEND\nj2’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.405 per common share, a $0.01, or 2.5% increase versus last quarter’s dividend. This is j2’s twenty-sixth consecutive quarterly dividend increase since its first quarterly dividend in September 2011. The dividend will be paid on March 9, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2018. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval.\nEXTENSION OF SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nThe Company has extended its one-year five million share repurchase program set to expire February 19, 2018 by an additional year. Approximately 1.9 million shares remain available for purchase under the program.\nNotes :\n(1) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment, plus excess tax benefit from share-based compensation.

These Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nFor more information on these Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, please see the appropriate GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP reconciliation tables included within the attached Exhibit to this release.\nj2 GLOBAL, INC.

The Company also understands that this Adjusted non-GAAP measure is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the Company’s performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of this Adjusted non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.\nAdjusted non-GAAP EPS is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, net income per share and may be different from Non-GAAP measures with similar or even identical names used by other companies. In addition, this Adjusted non-GAAP measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This Adjusted non-GAAP measure has limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with US GAAP, the Company uses the following Non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted non-GAAP net income, and Adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS (collectively the “Non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.\n(1) Share Based Compensation. The Company excludes stock-based compensation because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. The Company further believes this measure is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in its financial statements. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(2) Acquisition Related Integration Costs. The Company excludes certain acquisition and related integration costs such as severance, lease terminations, retention bonuses and other acquisition-specific items. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(3) Interest Costs. In June 2014, the Company issued $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible senior notes. In accordance with GAAP, the Company separately accounts for the value of the liability and equity features of its outstanding convertible senior notes in a manner that reflects the Company’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The value of the conversion feature, reflected as a debt discount, is amortized to interest expense over time. Accordingly, the Company recognizes imputed interest expense on its convertible senior notes of approximately 5.8% in its income statement. The Company excludes the difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense of 3.25% because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding core operational performance. In addition, the Company has excluded 3 days of overlapping interest expense in June and the month of July in connection with the 8.0% senior unsecured notes and deferred issuance costs associated with the repayment of the line of credit. The Company has determined excluding these items from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(4) Amortization. The Company excludes amortization of patents and acquired intangible assets because it is non-cash in nature and because the Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results and comparisons to peers, many of which similarly exclude this item.\n(5) Tax Expense/Benefit from Prior Years. The Company excludes certain income tax-related items in respect of income tax audit settlements and their related FIN 48 accrual reversals. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\n(6) Gain on Sale of Investment. The Company excludes the gain on sale of its strategic equity investment in Carbonite, Inc. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\n(7) Gain on Sale of Businesses. The Company excludes the gain on sale of its businesses of Cambridge BioMarketing LLC, Web24, and Tea Leaves Health, LLC. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\n(8) Tax Expense due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company excludes certain income tax-related items in respect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, specifically, the non-current tax associated with the repatriation of untaxed foreign earnings, the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the revaluation for uncertain tax positions from prior years. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\n(9) Convertible Debt Dilution. The Company excludes convertible debt dilution from diluted EPS. The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In addition, excluding this item from the Non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to historical operating results.\nThe Company presents Adjusted non-GAAP Cost of Revenues, Adjusted non-GAAP Research, Development and Engineering, Adjusted non-GAAP Sales and Marketing, Adjusted non-GAAP General and Administrative, Adjusted non-GAAP Interest Expense, Adjusted non-GAAP Other Income, Adjusted non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Adjusted non-GAAP Net Income because the Company believes that these provide useful information about our operating results and enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects.\nj2 GLOBAL, INC.\nNET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION\nTHREE MONTHS AND TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\n(UNAUDITED, IN THOUSANDS)\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 49,871 $ 43,158 $ 139,425 $ 152,439 Plus: Interest expense, net 16,372 10,400 67,777 41,370 Other income, net (22,696 ) (438 ) (22,035 ) (10,243 ) Income tax expense 32,669 15,041 60,541 59,000 Depreciation and amortization 43,444 33,522 162,041 122,091 Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures: Share-based compensation and the associated payroll tax expense 8,997 3,703 22,737 13,650 Acquisition-related integration costs 11,253 12,973 27,489 18,782 Indirect tax expense (benefit) from prior years 1,970 (1,900 ) 4,977 (1,000 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 141,880 $ 116,459 $ 462,952 $ 396,089 Adjusted EBITDA as calculated above represents earnings before interest and other expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the items used to reconcile GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, including (1) share-based compensation, (2) certain acquisition-related integration costs, (3) additional indirect tax expense from prior years and (4) certain gains on sale of businesses.
