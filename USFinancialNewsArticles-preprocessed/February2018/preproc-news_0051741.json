    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Graham Holdings Company (NYSE:GHC) today reported net income attributable to common shares of $302.0 million ($53.89 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $168.6 million ($29.80 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income attributable to common shares of $214.2 million ($38.52 per share), compared to $36.9 million ($6.57 per share) for the same period of 2016. The Company’s results for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017 include a significant net deferred income tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in December 2017.\nThe results for 2017 and 2016 were affected by a number of items as described in the following paragraphs. Excluding these items, net income attributable to common shares was $128.6 million ($22.93 per share) for 2017, compared to $167.6 million ($29.66 per share) for 2016. Excluding these items, net income attributable to common shares was $43.2 million ($7.77 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $54.4 million ($9.68 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2016. (Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Information schedule attached to this release for additional details.)\nItems included in the Company’s net income for 2017 are listed below, and fourth quarter activity, if any, is highlighted for each item:\n$10.0 million in restructuring charges at the education division (after-tax impact of $6.3 million, or $1.12 per share); $7.2 million of these charges were recorded in the fourth quarter (after-tax impact of $4.5 million, or $0.81 per share); a $9.2 million goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge in other businesses (after-tax impact of $5.8 million, or $1.03 per share); $3.3 million in non-operating foreign currency gains (after-tax impact of $2.1 million, or $0.37 per share); $3.3 million in losses were recorded in the fourth quarter (after-tax impact of $2.1 million or $0.37 per share); $177.5 million in fourth quarter net deferred tax benefits related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 ($31.68 per share); and $5.9 million in income tax benefits related to stock compensation ($1.06 per share).\nItems included in the Company’s net income for 2016 are listed below, and fourth quarter activity, if any, is highlighted for each item:\nan $18.0 million fourth quarter gain related to a bulk lump sum pension program offering (after-tax impact of $10.8 million, or $1.92 per share); $11.9 million in restructuring charges at the education division (after-tax impact of $7.7 million, or $1.36 per share); $7.0 million of these charges were recorded in the fourth quarter (after-tax impact of $4.5 million, or $0.81 per share); $16.8 million in net non-operating gains from the sales of assets and write-downs of cost and equity method investments (after tax impact of $9.5 million, or $1.62 per share); $30.7 million in losses were recorded in the fourth quarter (after-tax impact of $19.5 million, or $3.47 per share); $39.9 million in non-operating foreign currency losses (after-tax impact of $25.5 million, or $4.51 per share); $6.6 million in losses were recorded in the fourth quarter (after-tax impact of $4.2 million, or $0.75 per share); and a net nonrecurring $13.9 million deferred tax benefit related to Kaplan ($2.47 per share).\nRevenue for 2017 was $2,591.8 million, up 4% from $2,481.9 million in 2016. Revenues increased in other businesses, offset by a decline at the education division. The Company reported operating income for 2017 of $209.1 million, a decrease of 31%, from $303.5 million in 2016. Operating results declined at the television broadcasting and education divisions and in other businesses.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was $675.8 million, up 7% from $629.6 million in 2016. Revenues increased in other businesses and at the television broadcasting division, offset by a decline at the education division. The Company reported operating income of $67.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $109.5 million in 2016. Operating results declined at the education and television broadcasting divisions, offset by an increase in other businesses.\nOn April 27, 2017, certain Kaplan subsidiaries entered into a Contribution and Transfer Agreement (Transfer Agreement) to contribute Kaplan University (KU), its institutional assets and operations to a new, non-profit, public-benefit corporation affiliated with Purdue University (Purdue) in exchange for a Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA) to provide key non-academic operations support to the new university for an initial term of 30 years with a buy-out option after six years. The transfer does not include any of the assets of Kaplan University School of Professional and Continuing Education (KU-PACE), which provides professional training and exam preparation for professional certifications and licensures, nor does it include the transfer of other Kaplan businesses such as Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan International.\nConsummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transfer Agreement is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, regulatory approvals from the U.S. Department of Education (ED), the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE) and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), which is the regional accreditor of both Purdue and KU, and certain other state educational agencies and accreditors of programs. In the third quarter of 2017, ICHE granted its approval and the ED provided preliminary approval based on its review of a pre-acquisition application, subject to certain conditions. Kaplan is unable to predict with certainty when and if HLC approval will be obtained; however, a decision is not expected to be received until later in the first quarter of 2018. If the transaction is not consummated by April 30, 2018, either party may terminate the Transfer Agreement.\nDivision Results\nEducation\nEducation division revenue in 2017 totaled $1,516.8 million, down 5% from $1,598.5 million in 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, education division revenue totaled $380.6 million, down 3% from $391.2 million for the same period of 2016.\nKaplan reported operating income of $75.2 million for 2017, a 20% decrease from $93.6 million in 2016; Kaplan reported operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $19.8 million, a 34% decrease from $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2017, operating results declined at Kaplan Higher Education (KHE), partially offset by improved results at Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) and Kaplan International.\nIn recent years, Kaplan has formulated and implemented restructuring plans at its various businesses that have resulted in restructuring costs in 2017 and 2016, with the objective of establishing lower cost levels in future periods. Across all businesses, restructuring costs totaled $10.0 million in 2017 and $11.9 million in 2016. Restructuring costs totaled $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nA summary of Kaplan’s operating results is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 December 31 (in thousands) 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Revenue Higher education $ 130,291 $ 144,916 (10 ) $ 547,264 $ 617,047 (11 ) Test preparation 60,320 62,454 (3 ) 273,298 286,556 (5 ) Kaplan international 190,431 184,294 3 697,999 696,362 — Kaplan corporate and other 174 24 — 294 214 37 Intersegment elimination (641 ) (452 ) — (2,079 ) (1,718 ) — $ 380,575 $ 391,236 (3 ) $ 1,516,776 $ 1,598,461 (5 ) Operating Income (Loss) Higher education $ 5,153 $ 16,595 (69 ) $ 44,277 $ 66,632 (34 ) Test preparation 1,300 (3,715 ) — 11,507 9,599 20 Kaplan international 21,721 25,461 (15 ) 50,730 48,398 5 Kaplan corporate and other (7,167 ) (6,084 ) (18 ) (26,326 ) (23,452 ) (12 ) Amortization of intangible assets (1,364 ) (2,358 ) 42 (5,162 ) (7,516 ) 31 Intersegment elimination 179 20 — 143 (29 ) — $ 19,822 $ 29,919 (34 ) $ 75,169 $ 93,632 (20 ) KHE includes Kaplan’s domestic postsecondary education businesses, made up of fixed-facility colleges and online postsecondary and career programs. KHE also includes the domestic professional training and other continuing education businesses.\nIn 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, KHE revenue declined 11% and 10%, respectively, due to declines in average enrollments at Kaplan University. KHE operating income declined in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to lower enrollment at Kaplan University, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Restructuring costs at KHE were $1.8 million and $1.2 million for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, compared to $7.2 million and $5.5 million for 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.\nNew higher education student enrollments at Kaplan University declined 4% in 2017 due to lower demand across Kaplan University programs. Total students at Kaplan University were 28,718 at December 31, 2017, down 11% from December 31, 2016.\nKaplan University higher education student enrollments by certificate and degree programs are as follows:\nAs of December 31 2017 2016 Certificate 9.5 % 7.7 % Associate’s 16.5 % 18.1 % Bachelor’s 50.9 % 50.9 % Master’s 23.1 % 23.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % KTP includes Kaplan’s standardized test preparation and new economy skills training programs. KTP revenue declined 5% in 2017 and 3% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Enrollments, excluding the new economy skills training offerings, were up 4% in 2017; however, unit prices were generally lower. In comparison to 2016, KTP operating results improved in 2017 due primarily to operating cost efficiencies. Operating losses for the new economy skills training programs were $16.7 million and $13.0 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, including restructuring costs incurred in connection with the closing of Dev Bootcamp that was completed in the second half of 2017. Dev Bootcamp made up the majority of KTP’s new economy skills training programs.\nKaplan International includes English-language programs and postsecondary education and professional training businesses largely outside the United States. Kaplan International revenue increased slightly in 2017, and on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 2%, primarily due to growth in Pathways enrollments. Revenue was up in the fourth quarter of 2017; however, on a constant currency basis, revenue decreased 1%, largely due to timing of class starts at Pathways in the fourth quarter of 2017. Kaplan International operating income increased 5% in 2017, due largely to improved Pathways program results, partially offset by a decline in Singapore. Operating income decreased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2017 largely due to timing of class starts at Pathways. Restructuring costs at Kaplan International totaled $3.8 million and $4.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nKaplan corporate and other represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.’s corporate office, other minor businesses and certain shared activities.\nTelevision Broadcasting\nOn January 17, 2017, the Company closed on its agreement with Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc. and Media General, Inc. to acquire WCWJ, a CW affiliate television station in Jacksonville, FL, and WSLS, an NBC affiliate television station in Roanoke, VA, for $60 million in cash and the assumption of certain pension obligations. The Company continues to operate both stations under their current network affiliations.\nRevenue at the television broadcasting division increased slightly to $409.9 million in 2017, from $409.7 million in 2016. Excluding revenue from the two newly acquired stations, revenue declined 6% due to a $28.7 million decrease in political advertising revenue, $13.1 million in 2016 incremental summer Olympics-related advertising revenue at the Company’s NBC affiliates, lower network revenue and the adverse impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by $20.7 million in increased retransmission revenues. As previously disclosed, the Company’s NBC affiliates in Houston and Detroit are operating under a new contract with NBC effective January 1, 2017 that has resulted in a significant increase in network fees in 2017, compared to 2016. Operating income for 2017 was down 32% to $137.2 million, from $200.5 million in 2016 due to lower revenues, the significantly higher network fees and increased amortization of intangibles expense.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue increased 2% to $111.0 million, from $108.8 million in 2016. Excluding revenue from the two newly acquired stations, revenue declined 4% due to a $15.3 million decrease in political advertising revenue and lower network revenue, partially offset by $5.9 million in higher retransmission revenues and an increase in advertising revenue in several key sectors. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was down 30% to $39.0 million, from $55.9 million in the same period of 2016, due to the significantly higher network fees and increased amortization of intangible assets expense.\nOther Businesses\nManufacturing includes four businesses: Dekko, a manufacturer of electrical workspace solutions, architectural lighting and electrical components and assemblies; Joyce/Dayton Corp., a manufacturer of screw jacks and other linear motion systems; Forney, a supplier of products and systems that control and monitor combustion processes in electric utility and industrial applications; and Hoover Treated Wood Products, Inc., a supplier of pressure impregnated kiln-dried lumber and plywood products for fire retardant and preservative applications that the Company acquired in April 2017. In September 2016, Dekko acquired Electri-Cable Assemblies (ECA), a manufacturer of power, data and electrical solutions for the office furniture industry.\nIn the second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $9.2 million goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge at Forney, due to lower than expected revenues resulting from sluggish overall demand for its energy products. Excluding this impairment charge, manufacturing revenues and operating income increased in 2017 due to the Hoover acquisition and growth and improved results at Dekko, including the ECA acquisition, offset by a decline in results at Forney, which included $1.2 million in expense related to a separation incentive program implemented in the third quarter of 2017 that was mostly funded from the assets of the Company’s pension plan.\nGraham Healthcare Group (GHG) provides home health and hospice services in three states. In June 2016, the Company acquired the outstanding 20% redeemable noncontrolling interest in Residential Healthcare (Residential). Also in June 2016, Celtic Healthcare (Celtic) and Residential combined their business operations and the Company now owns 90% of the combined entity. The Company incurred approximately $2.0 million in expenses in conjunction with these transactions in the second quarter of 2016. At the end of June 2017, GHG acquired Hometown Home Health and Hospice, a Lapeer, MI-based healthcare services provider. Healthcare revenues increased 5% in 2017, while operating results were down, due largely to increased bad debt expenses and higher information systems and other integration costs.\nIn June 2016, Residential and a Michigan hospital formed a joint venture to provide home health services to West Michigan patients. GHG manages the operations of the joint venture and holds a 40% interest. The pro rata operating results of the joint venture are included in the Company’s equity in earnings of affiliates. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 that is included in other income (expense), net.\nSocialCode is a provider of marketing solutions on social, mobile and video platforms. SocialCode revenue increased 5% in 2017 and 1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, due to continued growth in digital advertising service revenues. SocialCode reported an operating loss of $3.7 million and operating income of $4.5 million in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, compared to an operating loss of $12.4 million and operating income of $2.9 million in 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. SocialCode’s operating results included incentive accruals of $1.4 million and $0.2 million related to phantom equity appreciation plans in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively; whereas 2016 results included incentive accruals of $12.8 million and $0.8 million related to phantom equity plans for the relevant periods.\nOther businesses also include Slate and Foreign Policy, which publish online and print magazines and websites; and two investment stage businesses, Panoply and CyberVista. Losses from each of these businesses in 2017 adversely affected operating results.\nCorporate Office\nCorporate office includes the expenses of the Company’s corporate office, the pension credit for the Company’s traditional defined benefit plan and certain continuing obligations related to prior business dispositions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an $18.0 million gain related to a bulk lump sum pension program offering.\nExcluding the pension gain, the total pension credit for the Company’s traditional defined benefit plan was $72.9 million and $64.1 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nExcluding the pension credit, corporate office expenses increased slightly in 2017 due primarily to higher professional services costs.\nEquity in Losses of Affiliates\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company held interests in a number of home health and hospice joint ventures, and interests in several other affiliates. During 2017, the Company acquired approximately 11% of Intersection Holdings, LLC, a company that provides digital marketing and advertising services and products for cities, transit systems, airports, and other public and private spaces. The Company recorded equity in losses of affiliates of $3.2 million for 2017, compared to $7.9 million in 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded an $8.4 million write-down on its investment in HomeHero, a company that managed an online senior home care marketplace.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense)\nThe Company recorded total other non-operating income, net, of $4.2 million in 2017, compared to non-operating expense, net, of $12.6 million in 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded other non-operating expense, net, of $2.6 million, compared to $28.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe 2017 non-operating income, net, included $3.3 million in foreign currency gains ($3.3 million in foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter) and other items. The 2016 non-operating expense, net, included $39.9 million in foreign currency losses ($6.6 million in foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter); $29.4 million in cost method investment write-downs ($14.2 million in the fourth quarter); and $1.8 million in net losses on the sales of marketable securities ($8.0 million loss in the fourth quarter), partially offset by a $34.1 million gain on the sale of land; an $18.9 million gain on the sale of a business; a $3.2 million gain on the Residential joint venture transaction and other items.\nNet Interest Expense and Related Balances\nThe Company incurred net interest expense of $27.3 million in 2017, compared to $32.3 million in 2016; net interest expense totaled $4.9 million and $9.8 million for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $493.3 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 6.3%, and cash, marketable securities and other investments of $964.7 million. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $491.8 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 6.3%, and cash, marketable securities and other investments of $1,119.1 million.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\nThe Company is reporting an income tax benefit of $119.7 million for 2017, which was significantly impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Overall, the Company recorded a $177.5 million net deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of enactment of this legislation, due largely to the revaluation of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal tax rate and a significant reduction in the amount of deferred taxes previously provided on undistributed earnings of investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $5.9 million income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock awards in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires all excess income tax benefits and deficiencies from stock compensation to be recorded as discrete items in the provision for income taxes. Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 34.9%.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2016 was 32.4%. In the third quarter of 2016, a net nonrecurring $8.3 million deferred tax benefit related to Kaplan’s international operations was recorded. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company benefited from a favorable $5.6 million out of period deferred tax adjustment related to the KHE goodwill impairment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate in 2016 was 37.9%.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017 was based on 5,552,163 and 5,508,530 weighted average shares, respectively, compared to 5,588,733 and 5,555,510 weighted average shares, respectively, for 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2016. At December 31, 2017, there were 5,504,494 shares outstanding. On November 9, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to acquire up to 500,000 shares of Class B common stock; the Company has remaining authorization for 472,678 shares as of December 31, 2017.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains certain forward-looking statements that are based largely on the Company’s current expectations.
