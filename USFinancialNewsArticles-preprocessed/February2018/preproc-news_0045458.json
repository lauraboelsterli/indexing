    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SJW Group (NYSE: SJW) today reported financial results for the annual and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. SJW Group net income was $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $52.8 million for the same period in 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $2.86 and $2.57 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating revenue was $389.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $339.7 million in 2016. The $49.5 million increase in revenue was primarily attributable to $41.1 million in cumulative rate changes, $15.4 million in higher customer usage, $1.2 million in revenue from new customers, $885,000 change in the net recognition of certain other balancing and memorandum accounts, $515,000 increase in recycled water revenue, and $179,000 in higher revenue recorded in our Water Conservation Memorandum Account (\"WCMA\"). These increases were partially offset by $8.8 million in true-up revenue recognized as a part of the decision on our 2016 California General Rate Case decision in the prior year and $1.0 million in lower revenue from our real estate operations.\nWater production expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $156.8 million compared to $124.3 million in 2016, an increase of $32.5 million. The increase in water production expenses was attributable to $17.0 million in higher per unit costs for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges, $9.6 million in higher customer water usage, and $5.9 million due to a decrease in the use of available surface water supplies. Operating expenses, excluding water production costs, increased $12.1 million to $134.4 million from $122.3 million. The increase was primarily due to $7.0 million of higher administrative and general expenses, $3.6 million of higher depreciation expenses due to assets placed in service in 2016, and $1.5 million in higher maintenance and property taxes and other non-income taxes.\nOther expense and income in 2017 included a pre-tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale of Texas Water Alliance Limited to the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, $6.3 million on the sale of 444 West Santa Clara Street Limited Partnership's interests in the commercial building and land the partnership owned, and sale of undeveloped land which SJW Land Company owned for a pre-tax gain of $580,000. Other expense and income in 2016 included the condemnation sale of the Company's real estate investment property in Arizona for a pre-tax gain of approximately $10.0 million and a $3.2 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 159,151 shares of California Water Service Group stock.\nThe effective consolidated income tax rates were approximately 37% and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nNet income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $17.3 million, compared to $13.7 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share were $0.84 and $0.67 for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOperating revenue was $93.5 million in the quarter compared to $79.3 million in 2016. The $14.2 million increase in revenue was attributable to $9.2 million in higher customer usage, $7.5 million in cumulative rate changes, and $416,000 in revenue from new customers. These increases were partially offset by $2.5 million in lower revenue recorded in our WCMA and a $382,000 change in the net recognition of certain other balancing and memorandum accounts.\nWater production expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $39.2 million versus $31.0 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $8.2 million. The increase in water production expenses was primarily attributable to $4.8 million in higher customer water usage and $3.5 million in higher per unit costs for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges. Operating expenses, excluding water production costs, increased $4.2 million to $36.1 million from $31.9 million. The increase was primarily due to $3.2 million in higher administrative and general expenses, $939,000 of higher depreciation expenses, and $374,000 in higher property taxes and other non-income taxes. These increases were partially offset by $257,000 of lower maintenance expenses.\nOther expense and income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a pre-tax gain of $12.5 million related to the sale of Texas Water Alliance Limited to the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority compared to the condemnation sale of the Company's real estate investment property in Arizona for a pre-tax gain of approximately $10.0 million in the same period of 2016.\nThe effective consolidated income tax rates were 33% and 37% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change is primarily due to the tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in the federal statutory income tax rate arising from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nSJW Group is a publicly traded holding company headquartered in San Jose, California. SJW Group is the parent company of San Jose Water Company, SJWTX, Inc., and SJW Land Company.
