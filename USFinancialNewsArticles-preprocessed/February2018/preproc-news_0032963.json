    "text": "PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - The womenâ€™s snowboard slopestyle event at the Winter Olympics continues to be plagued by the fierce winds blowing through Phoenix Snow Park with the final delayed on Monday.\nThe final had been scheduled to start at 1000 local time (0100 GMT) but has been delayed for at least 75 minutes.\nQualification for the event was canceled on Sunday due to the wind, with all of 26 the competitors progressing straight into the final, which will consist of two runs.\nThe best score over the two runs counts as their final mark.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ",
