    "text": "SHANGHAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - China has expressed concerns over excessive protectionism in the steel sector by the United States, and urged it to show restraint in using trade remedy measures, an official with Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Tuesday.\nWang Hejun, the head of MOFCOM’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau, made the comments after the U.S. launched a trade investigation over steel imports from multiple countries, including China.\nWang said in a statement published on the MOFCOM website that excessive protection is not a remedy and will only lead to a “vicious circle” of trade actions.
