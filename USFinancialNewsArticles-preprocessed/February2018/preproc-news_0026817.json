    "text": "RIYADH, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabiaâ€™s largest food products company, Savola Group, reported a fourth-quarter loss on Sunday but said it was much smaller than a year earlier due to higher profit margins and a lower impairment loss at one of its subsidiaries.\nIts net loss for the three months to Dec. 31, 2017, was 37.5 mln riyals ($10 million), compared with a loss of 915.7 million riyals a year earlier.\nNCB Capital forecast Savola would make a quarterly net profit of 144 million riyals.\nSavola said a higher share of profits from associate companies and lower operating expenses also helped its fourth-quarter performance compared to a year earlier.\nIt also said an impairment loss, related to operations at one of its subsidiaries, was reduced in the last quarter of 2017 to 222 million riyals from 573.8 million riyals a year ago.\nSales for the fourth quarter, however, fell to 5.8 billion riyals, from 6.8 billion a year ago.\nThe company said it would withhold dividend distributions for 2018.\n($1 = 3.7502 riyals)\nReporting by Marwa Rashad; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
