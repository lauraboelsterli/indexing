    "text": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Truckmaker AB Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) is dropping the head of Geely-owned ( 0175.HK ) Volvo Cars from its board because of competition concerns after the Chinese group took an almost 10 percent stake in rival Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ).\nVolvo Cars is a subsidiary of Zheijang Geely Holding Group Co whose main owner is Li Shufu. It was announced on Friday that Li, Geely’s founder, had built up an almost 10 percent stake in Daimler.\nFILE PHOTO: The Geely Automobile Holdings logo is pictured at the Auto China 2016 auto show in Beijing, China April 25, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson has been a board member of AB Volvo since 2016. He was the CEO of German truckmaker MAN ( MANG.DE ) until 2009, and became CEO of Volvo Cars in 2012, two years after Geely bought the company.\n“The reason that Hakan Samuelsson is not proposed for re-election is the announcement that Geely Group has become the largest shareholder of the German vehicle manufacturer Daimler, one of the Volvo Group’s major competitors,” the AB Volvo election committee said in a statement.\nHowever, it will not be so simple to sever ties with Geely.\nThe Chinese company struck a deal in December to buy activist investor Cevian Capital’s stake in AB Volvo, comprising 8.2 percent of shares and 15.6 percent of voting rights in the truck maker.\nReporting by Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
