    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bugcrowd , the leader in crowdsourced security, announced today the addition of two new executives: Rick Beattie as vice president of global sales and Jonathan Gohstand as vice president of product. These seasoned executives will help accelerate growth, allowing the company to meet the growing demand for crowdsourced security.\n“Traditional methods of protecting and preventing a breach are simply not reducing the threat of attack — the attack surface continues to grow each and every day,” said Rick Beattie, VP of global sales, Bugcrowd. “The ability to harness the power of a global community of security practitioners is truly the best way to protect organizations’ IP and assets. The Bugcrowd team and Board are committed to this mission, and I am extremely excited to be part of this dynamic and growing company.\"\nWith more than 20 years experience in enterprise sales, Rick Beattie brings a deep understanding of the cybersecurity landscape and strong understanding of the needs of today’s CISO. Beattie has a proven track record for building and accelerating revenue. Prior to Bugcrowd, he served as vice president of sales at Carbon Black and has held sales leadership roles at Q1 Labs and F5 Networks.\n“The crowdsourced security landscape is one of the most dynamic in the industry today and Bugcrowd is the innovator in the space,” said Jonathan Gohstand, VP of product, Bugcrowd. “The combination of a great team and a great approach to the challenge of cybersecurity made joining Bugcrowd a no-brainer. I’m thrilled to join an organization that is driving the direction of the industry and the future of cybersecurity.”\nJonathan Gohstand brings 20 years of experience driving product roadmap and strategy to his role as vice president of product for Bugcrowd. Gohstand will lead product and product marketing, building on top of the company's success as the pioneer and leader of crowdsourced security testing. Prior to Bugcrowd, Gohstand served as vice president of product management at Infoblox. He has also held marketing and product leadership positions at AlephCloud Systems, Inc., VMWare and Cisco Systems.\n“As a rapidly growing organization, we not only need leaders with a proven track record of success, we also need leaders who believe in our mission,” said Ashish Gupta, CEO, Bugcrowd. “Both Rick and Jonathan bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to their roles at Bugcrowd. Their combined experience with creating and executing programs for revenue generation, as well as leading product strategy and go-to-market, make them the perfect candidates to fuel our expansion.\"\nAdditional Resources:\nRead Bugcrowd Customer Stories Read the latest report: Inside the Mind of a Hacker Follow us on Twitter Follow us on LinkedIn\nAbout Bugcrowd\nBugcrowd is trusted by more of the Fortune 50 than any other crowdsourced security platform.
