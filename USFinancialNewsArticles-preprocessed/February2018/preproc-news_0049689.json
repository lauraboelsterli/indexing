    "text": "POWAY, CA, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solar Integrated Roofing Corporation (OTCPINK: SIRC) CEO Dave Massey appeared on MoneyTV with Donald Baillargeon and discussed their record revenues for fiscal Q4, which ends February 28, 2018.\n“We’re very excited,” said Massey, “not only are we achieving record revenues for our fiscal 4th quarter, but record profits as well. That’s a tough thing to do at the same time.”\nMassey also announced the hiring of Brian Wilson as Operations Director. “Brian came to us from a very large company, has 15 years of experience in solar and he is hard at work creating systems to improve our efficiency,” Massey added. “Hiring Brian also negated the need for us to move forward with an LOI we had previously announced, so we have canceled that agreement.\"\nThe company also consolidated their office space into one location, to facilitate having the entire operation under one roof. “We previously had sales in one place and operations in another,” recalled Massey. “Now we’re together in one location and a side benefit is saving nearly ten thousand dollars per month!”\nMassey also said solar tariffs being announced by the Trump administration will have no effect on their operations.\nThe interview with Dave Massey can be viewed online at http://www.moneytv.net or https://vimeo.com/256004003 .\nAbout Solar Integrated Roofing Corporation\nSolar Integrated Roofing Corporation (SIRC) is an integrated solar and roofing installation company specializing in commercial and residential properties with a focus on acquisitions of like companies to build a footprint nationally.
