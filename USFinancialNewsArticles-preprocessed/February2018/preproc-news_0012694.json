    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 11:57 AM / in 16 minutes Milan court throws out Parmalat's $2.2 billion Citi claim Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - A Milan court has thrown out a 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion) claim by Italy’s Parmalat against Citigroup, the U.S. bank said on Wednesday, in a case relating to the dairy group’s 2003 collapse. \n“The Court of Milan has granted Citigroup’s motion to dismiss in its entirety a civil claim for 1.8 billion euros,” the U.S. bank said in a statement. \nCiti said the court had ruled the claim duplicated one already brought in 2008 by a court in New Jersey which was dismissed as “unmeritorious”, adding it should not be allowed to proceed in the Italian courts. \nParmalat said in a statement it considered the Milan court’s decision “mistaken and unfair”, adding it would appeal. \nThe Italian dairy group was relaunched in 2005 after going bankrupt following a financial scandal two years earlier. It was taken over by France’s Lactalis in 2011. \nWhen Lactalis last year launched a bid for the Parmalat shares it did not own, minority shareholders said the price offered was too low, in part because of the potential cash-in from the lawsuit. \nCitigroup was advised by law firm Clifford & Chance. \n($1 = 0.8098 euros)",
