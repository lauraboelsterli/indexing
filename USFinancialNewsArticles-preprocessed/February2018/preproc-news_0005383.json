It earlier touched its lowest level since Dec. 6. * Financial information company Thomson Reuters Corp was the biggest decliner for the second straight day, after some analysts cut their ratings. Rating agency Standard & Poor's also placed the company on credit watch \"negative\" from \"stable,\" and Moody's Investor Service put its rating on review for a downgrade. The company on Tuesday announced a deal to sell 55 percent of its Financial & Risk business to Blackstone Group . * NovaGold Resources was among the biggest decliners. * Gold prices fell 0.2 percent to $1,342.58 an ounce. * Hudbay Minerals was the biggest gainer on the index, rising 2.6 percent, despite a 0.4 percent drop in copper prices .
