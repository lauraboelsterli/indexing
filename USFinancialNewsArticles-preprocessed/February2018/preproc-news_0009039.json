    "text": "SÃO PAULO, Feb. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- We present below the differences between our financial statements in BRGAAP 1 and in International Financial Reporting Standards - IFRS. We emphasize that the main difference in the result and equity relates to the allowance for loan losses, that uses the concept of incurred loss in IFRS and of expected loss in BRGAAP.\nThe complete consolidated financial statements under IFRS for January to December 2017 are available at our website: www.itau.com.br / investor-relations .\nComparison between BRGAAP 1 and IFRS\nR$ million\nBalance Sheet\nBRGAAP\nAdjustments and\nReclassifications 2\nIFRS\nBRGAAP\nAdjustments and\nReclassifications 2\nIFRS\nDec/31/2017\nDec/31/2016\nTotal Assets\n1,503,503\n(68,534)\n1,434,969\n1,427,084\n(73,843)\n1,353,241\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Reserve Requirements, Interbank Deposits,\nSecurities Under Repurchase Agreements, Financial Assets and Derivatives ³\n834,616\n(9,718)\n824,900\n767,222\n(16,395)\n750,827\nLoan Operations\n493,595\n(228)\n493,367\n491,225\n(859)\n490,366\n(-) Allowance for Loan Losses 4\n(35,360)\n7,465\n(27,895)\n(35,986)\n9,014\n(26,972)\nOther Financial Assets 5\n111,780\n(52,212)\n59,568\n106,458\n(52,541)\n53,917\nTax Assets 6\n59,648\n(17,720)\n41,927\n61,210\n(16,936)\n44,274\nInvestments in associates and jointly controlled entities, Goodwill, Fixed and\nIntangible Assets, Assets Held for Sale and Other Assets\n39,224\n3,879\n43,102\n36,954\n3,875\n40,829\nCurrent Liabilities and Long Term Liabilities\n1,364,565\n(77,603)\n1,286,964\n1,299,869\n(81,442)\n1,218,427\nDeposits\n402,938\n-\n402,938\n329,414\n-\n329,414\nDeposits Received Under Securities Repurchase Agreements 3\n323,910\n(11,276)\n312,634\n366,038\n(16,874)\n349,164\nFinancial Liabilities Held for Trading, Derivatives, Interbank and Institutional funding\n255,100\n207\n255,309\n257,167\n(228)\n256,939\nOther Financial Liabilities 5\n129,770\n(52,157)\n77,613\n123,604\n(51,772)\n71,832\nReserves for Insurance, Private Pension and Capitalization\n183,747\n786\n184,533\n156,656\n567\n157,223\nProvisions and Other Liabilities\n48,660\n(2,561)\n46,098\n49,320\n(1,301)\n48,019\nTax Liabilities 6\n20,440\n(12,602)\n7,839\n17,670\n(11,834)\n5,836\nTotal Stockholders' Equity\n138,938\n9,069\n148,005\n127,215\n7,599\n134,814\nNon-controlling interests\n12,014\n1,152\n13,165\n11,625\n607\n12,232\nControlling Stockholders' Equity 7\n126,924\n7,917\n134,840\n115,590\n6,992\n122,582\n1 BRGAAP represents the accounting practices adopted in Brazil for financial institutions, according to regulation of the Brazilian Central Bank;\n2 Resulted from reclassifications between assets and liabilities and other effects from IFRS adoption;\n3 Resulted from the elimination of transactions between the parent company and exclusive funds (mainly PGBL and VGBL fund quotas), which are consolidated under IFRS;\n4 Implementation of the criteria for calculating the Allowance for Loan Losses as defined in IFRS;\n5 Difference in accounting, mainly for Foreign Exchange Portfolio, which started to be considered as net effect of Assets and Liabilities;\n6 Difference in accounting, mainly for deferred taxes, which are now treated as a net effect of Assets and Liabilities in each of the consolidated companies;\n7 Conciliation of Controlling Stockholders' Equity is presented in the following table.\nBelow, the conciliation of the Result and Equity, and the conceptual description of the major adjustments.\nConciliation\nR$ million\nAdjustments\nEquity\nResult\nDec/31/2017\n4 th Q/17\n3 rd Q/17\n4 th Q/16\njan-dec/17\njan-dec/16\nBRGAAP - Values Attributable to Controlling Stockholders\n126,924\n5,821\n6,077\n5,543\n23,965\n21,639\n(a) Allowance for Loan Losses\n5,257\n(291)\n(89)\n240\n(457)\n1,325\n(b) Adjustment to market value of shares and quotas\n186\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(c) Acquisition of interest in Porto Seguro Itaú Unibanco Participações S.A.\n450\n(4)\n(4)\n(4)\n(15)\n(15)\n(d) Effective interest rate\n(84)\n(7)\n(2)\n(5)\n(8)\n20\n(e) Financial Leasing Operation\n586\n(40)\n(33)\n2\n(131)\n125\n(f) Other adjustments\n1,520\n5\n98\n218\n549\n171\nIFRS - Values Attributable to Controlling Stockholders\n134,840\n5,485\n6,048\n5,994\n23,903\n23,263\nIFRS - Values Attributable to Minority Stockholders\n13,165\n195\n(130)\n(52)\n365\n319\nIFRS - Values Attributable to Controlling Stockholders and Minority Stockholders\n148,005\n5,680\n5,918\n5,942\n24,268\n23,582\nDifferences between IFRS and BRGAAP Financial Statements\n(a) On IFRS (IAS 39), loan losses allowances must be made when there is objective evidence that loan operations have suffered a reduction in its value (Incurred Loss). On BRGAAP, the expected loss model is used 8 .\n(b) On IFRS (IAS 39 and 32), stocks and quotas classified as permanent investments were measured at fair value and its gains and losses were recorded directly on Equity, with no impact on the income statement of the period.\n(c) On IFRS, the effect of accounting at fair value the acquisition of the participation in Porto Seguro Itaú Unibanco Participações S.A. was recognized.\n(d) On the IFRS (IAS 39), the assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are recognized according to the methodology of effective interest rate, which appropriates the revenues and costs directly attributed to the acquisition, issue or disposal for the period of operation. On BRGAAP, the recognition of expenses and revenues from fees occurs at the time of contracting these operations.\n(e) Under IFRS (IAS 17) the financial leasing operations are recorded as Fixed Assets on the other hand of Other Financial Liabilities. On BRGAAP, as of September 30, 2015, the consideration of these transactions are now recorded in income in accordance with CMN Resolution No. 3,617/08.\n(f) Other Adjustments mainly comprise the difference in the eligibility of operations of the Cash Flow Hedge for purposes of IFRS and the reversal of the Goodwill\nAmortizations pursuant the BRGAAP.\n8 For more details see our Complete Financial Statements for January to December, 2017\nFor comparison purposes, we present on the table below the Result and the Recurring Result according to the IFRS and the BRGAAP.\nR$ million\nRecurring Result\n4 th Q/17\n3 rd Q/17\njan-dec/17\njan-dec/16\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nResult - Attributable to Controlling Stockholders\n5,821\n5,485\n(336)\n6,077\n6,048\n(29)\n23,965\n23,903\n(62)\n21,639\n23,263\n1,624\nExclusion of the Non-Recurring Events\n459\n424\n(35)\n177\n52\n(125)\n914\n496\n(418)\n583\n251\n(332)\nProvision Expenses for Citibank Integration\n277\n277\n-\n-\n-\n-\n277\n277\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGoodwill Amortization\n135\n-\n(135)\n125\n-\n(125)\n508\n-\n(508)\n441\n-\n(441)\nDisposal of IRB shares\n-\n-\n-\n(155)\n(155)\n-\n(155)\n(155)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nLiability Adequacy Test\n(145)\n(45)\n100\n-\n-\n-\n(165)\n(74)\n91\n(109)\n-\n109\nCivil Lawsuits - Economic Plans\n-\n-\n-\n61\n61\n-\n101\n101\n-\n224\n224\n-\nTax Contingencies and Legal Liabilities\n184\n184\n-\n9\n9\n-\n226\n226\n-\n6\n6\n-\nImpairment\n7\n7\n-\n137\n137\n-\n152\n152\n-\n181\n181\n-\nProgram for the Settlement or Installment Payment of Taxes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(14)\n(14)\n-\nPension Fund\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(130)\n(130)\n-\nOthers\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(31)\n(31)\n-\n(18)\n(18)\n-\nRecurring Result - Attributable to Controlling Stockholders\n6,280\n5,909\n(371)\n6,254\n6,100\n(154)\n24,879\n24,399\n(481)\n22,222\n23,514\n1,291\nThe tables in this report show the figures in millions.
