    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has handed Canada a list of nine people in Canada who are suspected of trying to revive a Sikh separatist movement in the Indian state of Punjab, a state official said on Thursday.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is visiting India and on Wednesday he traveled to Punjab where he told state leaders his country would not support anyone trying to reignite the movement for an independent Sikh homeland called Khalistan.\nAn aide to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said the list of suspects was handed to the Canadian side during the meeting with Trudeau.\n“The information has been shared with them. These are part of ongoing investigations,” Singh’s media adviser, Raveen Thukral, told Reuters.\nCanada is home to an influential Sikh community and Indian leaders say there are some fringe groups there that are still sympathetic to the cause of Khalistan.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends an 'India-Canada Business Session', in New Delhi, India, February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Sikh militants began agitating for a separate homeland in India in the 1970s.\nIndia’s then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, sent the military into the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine for Sikhs, to flush out separatists there at the height of the revolt in 1984.\nSlideshow (2 Images) A few months later, Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards at her home in Delhi.\nThe Sikh insurgency petered out in the 1990s.\nThe government in Punjab has urged Canada to act against any fringe Sikh elements trying to radicalize young people, Thukral said.\nTrudeau cited a separatist movement in the Canadian province of Quebec and told his hosts he had dealt with such threats and was fully aware of the dangers of violence, Thukral said.\nReporting by Malini Menon; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani, Robert Birsel\n ",
