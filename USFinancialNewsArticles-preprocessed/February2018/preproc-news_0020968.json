The local share price index futures rose 28 points to 5,818.0, a 58.8-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.8 percent on Wednesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose slightly in early trade. (Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Chopra)",
