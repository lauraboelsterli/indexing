Guyette will succeed VSP Global Board Member Rob Lynch, who has served as interim President and CEO since April 2017.\nGuyette, age 53, has more than 20 years of experience in building, growing and leading large health plan organizations and most recently served as President and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota. In that role, he was responsible for the strategy and operations of the state's largest health plan, serving 2.9 million members, with a full scope of health plan products and services.\n\"The Board of Directors is extremely confident in Michael Guyette's ability to lead VSP Global successfully into the future through a time of unprecedented competition and change,\" said Daniel L.
