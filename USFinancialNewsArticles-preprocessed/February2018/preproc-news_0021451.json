    "text": "Feb 9 (Reuters) - Australian Myer Holdings Ltd said it expects its first half net profit after tax to be in the range of A$37 million to A$41 million ($29 million to $32 million), while flagging a possible writedown, due to a decline in trading conditions.\nMyer said total first-half sales were down 3.6 percent to A$1.72 billion, while falling 3 percent on a comparable store sales basis.\nThe embattled department store operator flagged a possible impairment charge for the first half of 2018.\nIn December last year, Myer said weaker-than-expected pre-Christmas trading would hit its first-half profit.\n$1 = 1.2865 Australian dollars $1 = 1.2860 Australian dollars Reporting by Sandhya Sampath in Bengaluru\n ",
