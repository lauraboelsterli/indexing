    "text": "Feb 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s Cameco Corp on Friday reported a smaller loss for the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, helped by higher prices and its efforts to streamline its business.\nCameco, one of the world’s largest uranium producers, said net loss narrowed to C$62 million ($49 million), or 16 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from C$144 million, or 36 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue fell to C$809 million from C$887 million.
