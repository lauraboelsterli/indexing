A Prince of Wales tartan mackintosh coat inspired by a uniform opened the catwalk of the Rome-based group that is part of French luxury giant LVMH. Long camel coats, skirt ensembles, embroidered dresses and designs with sleek geometric black and white patterns followed down a catwalk lit in beige colors. Fine pleated details on the sides of skirts and dresses and square shouldered capes, long and short, were the signature of the clothes by the creative duo formed by Chanel’s Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi, scion of the label’s founding family. Fendi. REUTERS/Tony Gentile LVMH named Christian Dior executive Serge Brunschwig as the new head of Fendi on Tuesday after former CEO Pietro Beccari took the helm of the whole Dior business last November. Brunschwig told Reuters he had “great ambitions” for the brand.

Reilly worked with the Fendi for its menswear line presented in January. The new designs included a white maxi t-shirt and chunky black fur jumper with the Fendi logo mimicking that from Italian sportswear company Fila. The ‘Double F’ bag and a new version of the brand’s well-known ‘Peekaboo’ bag, the X-lite, debuted in the collection, a style note said. Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",
