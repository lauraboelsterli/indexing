    "text": "Leon Bennett | Getty Images Logan Paul attends a film premiere in Culver City, California, on October 18, 2017 YouTube has punished Logan Paul, one of the video site's biggest stars, again.\nThis time the world's largest video site has temporarily turned off all of the ads in Paul's videos, for offenses that include tasering a rat in a YouTube video and promising, presumably in jest, to eat laundry detergent.\nEarlier this year YouTube had previously reprimanded Paul for showing the body of a suicide victim, by taking him off its most lucrative advertising tier and scrapping a YouTube-sponsored movie that was supposed to star Paul.\nRead more from Recode: \nHow to find the TV channels you want online \nShould YouTube police its top stars' videos? \nTwitter made a profit by cutting costs, not by growing its business \n\nHere's a statement from a YouTube rep:\n\"After careful consideration, we have decided to temporarily suspend ads on Logan Paul's YouTube channels. This is not a decision we made lightly, however, we believe he has exhibited a pattern of behavior in his videos that makes his channel not only unsuitable for advertisers, but also potentially damaging to the broader creator community.\"\nUp until this year Paul was one of YouTube's favorite stars, with more than 10 million subscribers. But YouTube has also spent the last year fending off a series of controversies about inappropriate content on the site, and is trying to convince marketers that the site is a safe place for them to run their ads.\nIf you want to watch Paul tasering a rat, you can see it near the five-minute mark of this clip, published February 5.\nIt's worth noting that another one of Paul's actions that bothered YouTube executives didn't happen on YouTube. Instead, they're upset that he joked about the Tide Pod challenge to his Twitter followers, via a now-deleted tweet. \nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content sharing arrangement. NBCUniversal is also a minority investor in Buzzfeed.",
