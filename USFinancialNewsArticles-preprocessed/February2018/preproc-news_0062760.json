For the three months ended December 31, 2017, Delek Logistics reported net income attributable to all partners of $18.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted common limited partner unit. This compares to net income attributable to all partners of $15.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted common limited partner unit, in the fourth quarter 2016. Distributable cash flow was $21.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $20.5 million in the prior-year period.\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") was $31.2 million compared to $24.4 million in the prior-year period. The combination of a higher gross margin per barrel in west Texas, improved performance from the Paline Pipeline and the east Texas marketing agreement were the primary factors in the year-over-year increase.\nFor 2017, net income attributable to all partners was $69.4 million, or $2.09 per diluted common limited partner unit. This compares to net income attributable to all partners of $62.8 million, or $2.07 per diluted common limited partner unit for 2016. Net cash from operations was $87.7 million and distributable cash flow was $85.0 million in 2017 compared to net cash from operations of $100.7 million and distributable cash flow of $83.1 million in 2016. EBITDA was $115.0 million in 2017, compared to $97.3 million in 2016.\nUzi Yemin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Delek Logistics' general partner, remarked: \"Our operations performed well in the fourth quarter resulting in our highest quarterly EBITDA to date. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $511 million of capacity on our credit facility and a total leverage ratio of approximately 3.8 times. This financial position supported the 6.6 percent year-over-year increase in our declared fourth quarter distribution. For 2017, our annual distribution declared per limited partner unit was 10.1 percent above 2016.\"\nYemin concluded, \"I am excited about the future growth at Delek Logistics. We expect to close on the drop down of logistics assets from Delek US' Big Spring, Texas refinery in March with an effective date of March 1. These assets are expected to provide approximately $40.0 million of EBITDA on an annualized basis and will be financed with our existing borrowing capacity on the credit facility. Through our new joint venture with Green Plains Partners, we announced an agreement to acquire two third party terminals, which fits with our strategy to grow in our existing market areas. This joint venture should benefit from synergies between complementary assets and be better positioned to support Delek US' Tyler, Texas and El Dorado, Arkansas refineries and third party customers. The expansion of the Paline Pipeline capacity to 42,000 barrels per day is expected to be completed in early March and this should provide incremental growth from this asset as crude oil differentials support future shipments on this pipeline. We anticipate that the financial flexibility provided by our balance sheet and our focus on growth initiatives should support a distribution per limited partner unit increase of at least 10% annually through 2019.\"\nBig Spring Logistics Asset Dropdown\nOn February 26, 2018, a definitive agreement was entered into with Delek US to acquire the Big Spring logistics assets, subject to customary closing conditions. These assets consist of storage tanks, terminals and a new marketing agreement associated with Delek US' Big Spring, Texas refinery. The expected annual EBITDA is $40.2 million and the purchase price is $315.0 million, which equates to a 7.8x EBITDA multiple. This dropdown will be financed through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on the revolving credit facility.\nThis acquisition consists of the following assets and agreements:\nStorage tanks and salt wells - Approximately 2.9 million barrels of aggregate shell capacity, consisting of 62 tanks, 4 salt wells and ancillary assets, including piping and pumps located at the refinery and at Duncan, Oklahoma.\nProducts terminals - An asphalt terminal that operated at 3,900 barrels per day during the second half of 2017 and a light products terminal with 54,000 barrels per day throughput capacity, which operated at 28,000 barrels per day during the second half of 2017.\nMarketing agreement - As part of this transaction, Delek US will enter into a new wholesale marketing agreement whereby Delek Logistics will provide services necessary to market various refinery products produced at the Big Spring refinery. During the second half of 2017, total sales volume for products to be covered by this agreement was approximately 74,700 barrels per day. In connection with the closing of the transaction, Delek US, Delek Logistics and various of their subsidiaries would enter into various long-term agreements for these assets. The transaction and related agreements were approved by the Conflicts Committee of Delek Logistics’ general partner, which is comprised solely of independent directors. The Conflicts Committee engaged Duff & Phelps to act as its financial advisor and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP to act as its legal counsel.\nJoint Venture Formation and Terminal Acquisition\nOn February 20, 2018, Delek Logistics and Green Plains Partners LP (NASDAQ:GPP) announced the formation of a 50/50 joint venture, DKGP Energy Terminals LLC (\"DKGP\"). DKGP signed a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire two light products terminals from an affiliate of American Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:AMID). These light products terminals are located in Caddo Mills, Texas and North Little Rock, Arkansas. The total purchase price for these assets is $138.5 million in cash. Subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, this transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018.\nIf completed, DKGP is expected to consist of the assets purchased from an affiliate of American Midstream and assets contributed by Delek Logistics, with a total value of approximately $162.5 million. Taking into consideration the combination of the assets, synergies and future growth, the joint venture is currently forecasted to generate annualized EBITDA of approximately $19.2 million in 2019. Delek Logistics is expected to contribute to the joint venture its North Little Rock, Arkansas terminal with throughput capacity of 17,100 barrels per day and its Greenville tank farm located in Caddo Mills, Texas with approximately 330,000 barrels of aggregate shell capacity, which together will be valued at $24.0 million, along with $57.25 million in cash. Green Plains Partners will contribute $81.25 million in cash to DKGP. The DKGP board will oversee the newly formed joint venture and will appoint Delek Logistics as the operator with day-to-day operational responsibilities of the four terminals.\nDistribution and Liquidity\nOn January 23, 2018, Delek Logistics declared a quarterly cash distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.725 per limited partner unit, which equates to $2.90 per limited partner unit on an annualized basis. This distribution was paid on February 12, 2018 to unitholders of record on February 2, 2018. This represents a 1.4 percent increase from the third quarter 2017 distribution of $0.715 per limited partner unit, or $2.86 per limited partner unit on an annualized basis, and a 6.6 percent increase over Delek Logistics’ fourth quarter 2016 distribution of $0.680 per limited partner unit, or $2.72 per limited partner unit annualized. For the fourth quarter 2017, the total cash distribution declared to all partners, including IDRs, was approximately $22.8 million. Based on the declared distribution for the fourth quarter 2017, the distributable cash flow coverage ratio for the fourth quarter was 0.96x. For 2017, the annual distributable coverage ratio was 0.97x.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Delek Logistics had total debt of approximately $422.6 million and cash of $4.7 million. Additional borrowing capacity, subject to certain covenants, under the $700.0 million credit facility was $511.1 million.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $151.2 million compared to $124.7 million in the prior year period. The increase in revenue is primarily due to higher sales prices in the west Texas wholesale business. Total operating expenses were $12.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter 2016. This increase was primarily due to outside services, maintenance, variable expenses and employee expenses. Total segment contribution margin was $32.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $27.2 million in the fourth quarter 2016. General and administrative expenses were $3.6 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $2.3 million in the prior year period primarily due to professional services and employee expenses.\nPipelines and Transportation Segment\nContribution margin in the fourth quarter 2017 was $18.7 million compared to $16.8 million in the fourth quarter 2016. This change was primarily due to improved performance on the Paline Pipeline and Lion Pipeline system, partially offset by lower volume on the SALA system. During the fourth quarter 2017, the Paline Pipeline was a FERC regulated pipeline with a tariff established for potential shippers, compared to the prior year period when 10,000 barrels per day of the pipeline capacity was under contract with a third-party for a monthly fee. Operating expenses were $8.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period primarily due to outside services and variable costs.\nWholesale Marketing and Terminalling Segment\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, contribution margin was $14.0 million, compared to $10.3 million in the fourth quarter 2016. This increase was primarily due to improved performance in the west Texas wholesale operations and east Texas marketing agreement on a year-over-year basis. Operating expenses increased to $3.7 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $1.8 million in the prior year period primarily due to outside services.\nIn the west Texas wholesale business, average throughput in the fourth quarter 2017 was 14,322 barrels per day compared to 13,906 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2016. The wholesale gross margin in west Texas increased year-over-year to $5.18 per barrel and included approximately $1.7 million, or $1.26 per barrel, from renewable identification numbers (RINs) generated in the quarter. During the fourth quarter 2016, the wholesale gross margin was $1.96 per barrel and included $1.9 million from RINs, or $1.51 per barrel. On a year-over-year basis, continued growth in drilling activity in the Permian Basin increased fuel demand and improved the supply/demand balance, which led to improved performance in the west Texas wholesale business.\nAverage terminalling throughput volume of 130,547 barrels per day during the quarter increased on a year-over-year basis from 119,934 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2016 primarily due to higher throughput at the Tyler, Texas terminal. During the fourth quarter 2017, average volume under the east Texas marketing agreement with Delek US was 78,810 barrels per day compared to 68,114 barrels per day during the fourth quarter 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results | Conference Call Information\nDelek Logistics will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 7:30 a.m. Central Time.
