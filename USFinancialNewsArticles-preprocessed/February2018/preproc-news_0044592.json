    "text": "EVANSTON, Ill., Fidus Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:FDUS) (“Fidus” or the “Company”) today announced that, in connection with its previously disclosed registered public offering of $43.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% notes due 2023 (the “Existing Notes”) that closed on February 2, 2018, the underwriters of such offering have exercised their overallotment option in full to purchase an additional $6.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% notes due 2023 (the “Additional Notes” and together with the Existing Notes, the “Notes”). The total net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes is approximately $48.1 million based on a public offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, after deducting payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\nThe Existing Notes started trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “FDUSL” on February 5, 2018, and the Additional Notes will trade with the Existing Notes under the same trading symbol.\nThe Notes will mature on February 1, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company’s option on or after February 1, 2020 upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days written notice by mail prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable thereon for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to the date fixed for redemption. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per year, payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2018. The Notes were rated “A-”* by Egan-Jones Ratings Company.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under its existing credit facility with ING Capital LLC, an affiliate of an underwriter in this offering. However, the Company may re-borrow under its credit facility and use such borrowings to invest in lower middle-market companies in accordance with its investment objective and strategies and for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of January 29, 2018, the Company had $50.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility. The credit facility matures on June 16, 2019, and borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest on a per annum basis equal to (i) the alternate base rate plus 2.5% or (ii) the applicable LIBOR, which varies depending on the period of the borrowing under the credit facility, plus 3.5%. The alternate base rate is equal to the greater of (i) prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the three-month LIBOR plus 1.0%.\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company , acted as sole bookrunner for the offering. Janney Montgomery Scott LLC and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. acted as co-leads for the offering. B. Riley FBR, Inc., BB&T Capital Markets, a division of BB&T Securities, LLC, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., a subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE AMERICAN:LTS), and ING Financial Markets LLC acted as co-managers for the offering.\nThis press release is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor will there be any sale of the Notes referred to in this press release, in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\nA shelf registration statement relating to these securities is on file with and has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering may be made only by means of a prospectus and a related prospectus supplement, copies of which may be obtained, when available, from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Attn: Debt Capital Markets, 787 Seventh Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10019, (telephone number: 1-800-966-1559).
