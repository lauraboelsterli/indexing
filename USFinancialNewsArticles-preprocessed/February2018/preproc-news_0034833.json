    "text": "DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP) (NYSE: TNH) today reported net earnings of $49.4 million on net sales of $97.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This compares to net earnings of $44.1 million on net sales of $93.4 million for the 2016 fourth quarter. Net earnings allocable to common units was $26.6 million ($1.44 per common unit) and $34.3 million ($1.85 per common unit) for the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters, respectively. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a gain of $14.3 million on the sale of TNCLP's 50% joint venture interest in Oklahoma CO2 Partnership (OKCO2), which added $0.42 to fourth quarter 2017 earnings per common unit. Results for the fourth quarter of 2017 also included an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $0.9 million compared to a gain of $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The derivative portfolio at December 31, 2017 includes natural gas derivatives that hedge a portion of natural gas purchases through December 2018.\nFor the full year 2017, TNCLP reported net earnings of $153.9 million on net sales of $397.2 million. This compares to net earnings of $209.3 million on net sales of $418.3 million for the full year 2016. Net earnings allocable to common units was $109.8 million ($5.93 per common unit) and $139.9 million ($7.56 per common unit) for the full year 2017 and 2016, respectively. Results for the full year 2017 included a gain of $14.3 million on the sale of OKCO2, which added $0.55 to the full year 2017 earnings per common unit. Results for the full year 2017 included an unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $10.6 million compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market gain of $35.3 million for the full year 2016.\nOn February 7, 2018, Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. announced that, in accordance with Section 17.1 of TNCLP’s First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the “Partnership Agreement”), Terra Nitrogen GP Inc., a Delaware corporation and the sole general partner of TNCLP (“TNGP”), has elected to exercise the right, assigned to TNGP by TNCLP, to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in TNCLP not already owned by TNGP or its affiliates (the “Units”). TNGP will purchase the Units on April 2, 2018 for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per Unit. The purchase price was determined in accordance with Section 17.1 of the Partnership Agreement.\nAnalysis of Results\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $97.5 million, compared to $93.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, due to higher ammonia sales volumes and higher UAN selling prices that were partially offset by lower ammonia selling prices and lower UAN sales volume.\nComparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016, TNCLP’s:\nAmmonia sales volume increased by 16 percent and UAN sales volume decreased by 2 percent; Ammonia average selling prices decreased by 10 percent and UAN average selling prices increased by 7 percent; and Realized natural gas cost per MMBtu decreased by 8 percent.\nOn October 2, 2017, TNCLP sold its 50% interest in OKCO2, a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility to the joint venture partner. Prior to the sale, TNCLP had accounted for this interest as an equity method investment. TNCLP received proceeds of $16.3 million for the sale and recorded a gain of $14.3 million after the completion of certain customary closing requirements and working capital adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash Distribution\nCash distributions are based on Available Cash for the quarter and depend on TNCLP’s earnings as well as cash requirements for working capital needs and capital and other expenditures. For the full year 2017, capital expenditures were $27.2 million as compared to $33.1 million for the full year 2016. Cash distributions per common unit also vary based on increasing amounts allocable to the General Partner when cumulative distributions exceed targeted levels. TNCLP reported on February 7, 2018, the declaration of a cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, of $2.03 per common unit payable February 28, 2018 to holders of record as of February 16, 2018. With this distribution, TNCLP cumulative distributions continue to exceed targeted levels. This compares to a cash distribution of $1.22 per common unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The proceeds from the sale of the joint venture interest were included in the determination of Available Cash for the fourth quarter of 2017 and added $0.45 per common unit to the distribution.\nThis release serves as a qualified notice to nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b). Please note that 100 percent of TNCLP’s distributions to foreign investors are attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.
