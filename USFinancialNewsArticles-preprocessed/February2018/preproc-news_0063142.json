Our financial measures under GAAP include non-cash deferred tax benefits related to our senior convertible notes as listed in the itemized reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release. Management believes that presentation of operating results that excludes this item provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of our core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is therefore useful to investors in analyzing and assessing our past and future operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as its supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business.\nAbout DexCom, Inc.\nDexCom, Inc., headquartered in San Diego, California, is developing and marketing continuous glucose monitoring systems for ambulatory use by people with diabetes and by healthcare providers.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that are not purely historical regarding DexCom’s or its management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations and strategies for the future.
