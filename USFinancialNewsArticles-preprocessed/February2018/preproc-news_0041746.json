    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the \"Fund\") announced today the adoption of a three-year discount management program (the \"Program\") that is expected to end in 2020. The Fund intends to repurchase its common shares in the Program based on three 3-month measurement periods (each a \"Measurement Period\"). If the Fund's common shares trade at an average daily discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") of more than 7.5% during a Measurement Period (a \"Trigger Event\"), the Fund intends to offer to repurchase 10% of its outstanding common shares for the First Measurement Period (as defined below) and, subject to the Board’s approval, at least 5% of its outstanding common shares for each of the second and third Measurement Periods.\nThe Fund's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") has determined that the first of the three Measurement Periods under the Program will begin as of December 1, 2017 and end on February 28, 2018 (\"First Measurement Period\"). If the Fund's common shares trade at an average daily discount to NAV of greater than 7.5% during the First Measurement Period, the Fund will offer to repurchase 10% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV determined on the trading day after the repurchase expires. The date of the subsequent Measurement Periods and the size of each subsequent repurchase and any applicable discount to NAV will be determined by the Board at a later date and a press release will be promptly issued after the end of each Measurement Period detailing the measurement period dates and results.\nThe Program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value. The Board intends to approve repurchases indicated by the occurrence of a Trigger Event subject to its fiduciary obligations. There is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of the shares that they desire to sell in any particular repurchase that is executed.\nThe Fund is of the view that the Program provides sufficient liquidity to the market for common shareholders. However, there can be no assurances as to the effect that the Program will have on the Fund's market discounts.\nImportant Notice\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer or a solicitation to buy any common shares. Any offer to purchase any Fund common shares in the First Measurement Period will be made pursuant to an offer on Schedule TO. COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ ANY TENDER OFFER MATERIALS RELATED TO THE FIRST MEASUREMENT PERIOD, INCLUDING THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND ANY SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT REGARDING THE FIRST MEASUREMENT PERIOD, AS THEY MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISION REGARDING TENDERING THEIR SHARES. Common shareholders may obtain a free copy of any of these statements and other documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov or by directing such requests to the Fund.\nAbout the Fund\nThe Fund is a diversified, closed-end investment company whose primary investment objective is to seek to provide current income by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies’ debt instruments, including corporate loans, which are rated in the lower rating categories of the established rating services (BBB or lower by S&P’s or Baa or lower by Moody’s) or unrated debt instruments, which are in the judgment of the investment adviser of equivalent quality, and secondary investment objective is to provide capital appreciation.\nCommon shares of closed-end investment companies often trade at a discount to their NAVs, and the Fund's common shares may also trade at a discount to their NAV, although it is possible that they may trade at or at a premium above NAV. The market price of the Fund's common shares is determined by such factors as relative demand for and supply of such common shares in the market, the Fund's NAV, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its common shares will trade at, below or above NAV.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock helps investors build better financial futures. As a fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. As of December 31, 2017, the firm managed approximately $6.288 trillion in assets on behalf of investors worldwide.
