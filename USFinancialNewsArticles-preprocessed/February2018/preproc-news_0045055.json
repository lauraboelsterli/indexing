    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE:ETE) (“ETE” or the “Partnership”) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nETE’s net income attributable to partners was $251 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $233 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, was $263 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $299 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is primarily driven by a reduction in incentive distributions as previously agreed to between ETE and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”). These incentive distribution waivers, the majority of which were originally provided to support ETP’s funding of its growth capital projects, are scheduled to reduce significantly as ETP’s projects are completed and volumes ramp up in the near term.\nThe Partnership’s recent key accomplishments and other developments include the following:\nIn October 2017, ETE issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2023. The $990 million net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under its term loan facility and for general partnership purposes. In October 2017, ETE amended its existing senior secured term loan agreement to reduce the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans from 2.75% to 2.0% and for base rate loans 1.75% to 1.0%. In January 2018, ETE announced an agreement to acquire the general partner of USA Compression Partners, LP (“USAC”) and approximately 12.5 million USAC common units from USA Compression Holdings. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2018. In January 2018, Sunoco LP redeemed all outstanding Sunoco LP Series A Preferred Units held by ETE for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $313 million. The redemption amount included the original consideration of $300 million and a 1% call premium plus accrued and unpaid quarterly distributions. On February 20, 2018, the Partnership paid a quarterly distribution of $0.305 per ETE common unit for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, or $1.22 per unit on an annualized basis. As of December 31, 2017, ETE’s $1.50 billion revolving credit facility had $1.19 billion of outstanding borrowings and its leverage ratio, as defined by the credit agreement, was 3.68x.\nThe Partnership has scheduled a conference call for 8:00 a.m. Central Time, Thursday, February 22, 2018 to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results. The conference call will be broadcast live via an internet webcast, which can be accessed through www.energytransfer.com and will also be available for replay on the Partnership’s website for a limited time.\nThe Partnership’s principal sources of cash flow are derived from distributions related to its direct and indirect investments in the limited and general partner interests in Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) and Sunoco LP, including 100% of ETP’s and Sunoco LP’s incentive distribution rights, as well as the Partnership’s ownership of Lake Charles LNG. The Partnership’s primary cash requirements are for expenses, debt service requirements and distributions to its partners.\nEnergy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) is a master limited partnership that owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) and Sunoco LP (NYSE: SUN). ETE also owns Lake Charles LNG Company. On a consolidated basis, ETE’s family of companies owns and operates a diverse portfolio of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and refined products assets, as well as retail and wholesale motor fuel operations and LNG terminalling.

The Partnership’s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP financial measures such as net income, cash flow from operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted. The Partnership defines Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, for a period as cash distributions expected to be received in respect of such period in connection with the Partnership’s investments in limited and general partner interests, net of the Partnership’s cash expenditures for costs and interest expense. The Partnership’s definitions of Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, also include distributable cash flow from Lake Charles LNG to the Partnership. For Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, certain transaction-related expenses that are included in net income are excluded.\nDistributable Cash Flow is a significant liquidity measure used by the Partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the Partnership to the distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders. Due to cash expenses incurred from time to time in connection with the Partnership’s merger and acquisition activities and other transactions, Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is also a significant liquidity measure used by the Partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the Partnership to the distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders. Using these measures, the Partnership’s management can compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows for a period to planned cash distributions for such period.\nDistributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are also important non-GAAP financial measures for our limited partners since these indicate to investors whether the Partnership’s investments are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distribution levels. Financial measures such as Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are quantitative standards used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is in part measured by its yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow, and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is net income for ETE on a stand-alone basis (the “Parent Company”).\nDistribution Coverage Ratio. The Partnership defines Distribution Coverage Ratio for a period as Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, divided by total cash distributions expected to be paid to the partners of ETE in respect of such period.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR PARENT COMPANY\nFollowing are condensed balance sheets and statements of operations of the Parent Company on a stand-alone basis.\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\n(unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 ASSETS Current assets $ 67 $ 57 Property, plant and equipment, net 27 36 Advances to and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 6,082 5,088 Intangible assets, net — 1 Goodwill 9 9 Other non-current assets, net 8 10 Total assets $ 6,193 $ 5,201 LIABILITIES AND PARTNERS’ CAPITAL Current liabilities $ 70 $ 92 Long-term debt, less current maturities 6,700 6,358 Note payable to affiliate 617 443 Other non-current liabilities 2 2 Commitments and contingencies Partners’ deficit: General Partner (3 ) (3 ) Limited Partners: Common unitholders (1,643 ) (1,871 ) Series A Convertible Preferred Units 450 180 Total partners’ deficit (1,196 ) (1,694 ) Total liabilities and partners’ deficit $ 6,193 $ 5,201 STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ (6 ) $ (29 ) $ (31 ) $ (185 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest expense, net of interest capitalized (90 ) (83 ) (347 ) (327 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 369 345 1,381 1,511 Loss on extinguishments of debt (22 ) — (47 ) — Other, net — — (2 ) (4 ) NET INCOME 251 233 954 995 General Partner’s interest in net income — 1 2 3 Convertible Unitholders’ interest in income 12 6 37 9 Limited Partners’ interest in net income $ 239 $ 226 $ 915 $ 983\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221006399/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nEnergy Transfer\nLyndsay Hannah, Brent Ratliff, Helen Ryoo, 214-981-0795\nor\nMedia Relations:\nVicki Granado, 214-840-5820\nSource: Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.",
