    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 6:23 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Cricket-Kohli magic leads India to big win over South Africa Nick Said 1 Min Read \nCAPE TOWN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - India captain Virat Kohli continued his excellent recent form to smash a sparkling unbeaten century and lead his side to a comprehensive 124-run victory over South Africa in the third One-Day International at Newlands on Wednesday. \nKohli made 160 not out from 159 balls as India, who had been put into bat, posted 303 for six in their 50 overs, before restricting their hosts to 179 all out to take a 3-0 lead in the series. \nSouth Africaâ€™s brittle batting lineup, without injured stalwarts Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers and Quinton de Kock, were stifled once more by the Indian spinners as Kuldeep Yadav, who took career-best figures (4-23 in 9 overs), and Yuzvendra Chahal (4-46 in 9 overs) strangled their innings. \nThe fourth match will be played at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Saturday.
