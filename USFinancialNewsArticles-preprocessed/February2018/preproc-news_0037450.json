    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Layne Christensen Company (\"LAYN\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: LAYN) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Granite Construction Incorporated (\"GVA\") (NYSE: GVA). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of LAYN will be entitled to receive 0.27 of a share of GVA for each LAYN share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether LAYN's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, according to the acquisition announcement, this is a strategic transaction through which GVA anticipates:\nThe creation of a platform for growth by leveraging LAYN's infrastructure and drilling services, its water management expertise, its broad and diverse portfolio, and its growing customer-base to position GVA as an industry leader and expand its national footprint; and\nThe delivery of substantial financial benefits.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether LAYN shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own LAYN shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/layne-christensen-company/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-layne-christensen-company-merger-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-layn-shareholders-300599734.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
