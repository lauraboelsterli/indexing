In connection with this transaction, the Company incurred approximately $60.2 million in defeasance costs; During 2017, repaid $102.1 million of mortgage debt, excluding amortization, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.63%, of which $7.7 million was repaid during the fourth quarter with an interest rate of 7.70%.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 112 retail operating properties representing 20.3 million square feet. The Company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RPAI. Additional information about the Company is available at www.rpai.com .\nSAFE HARBOR LANGUAGE\nThe statements and certain other information contained in this press release, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" \"continue\" or \"anticipates\" and variations of such words or similar expressions or the negative of such words, constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current views about its plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to the Company and on assumptions it has made. Although the Company believes that its plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company can give no assurance that such plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Furthermore, these forward-looking statements should be considered as subject to the many that exist in the Company's operations and business environment. Such could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic, business and financial conditions, and changes in the Company's industry and changes in the real estate markets in particular, rental rates and/or vacancy rates, frequency and magnitude of defaults on, early terminations of or non-renewal of leases by tenants, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or a significant number of smaller tenants, interest rates or operating costs, real estate valuations, the availability, terms and deployment of capital, general volatility of the capital and credit markets and the market price of the Company's Class A common stock, risks generally associated with real estate acquisitions and dispositions, including the Company's ability to identify and pursue acquisition and disposition opportunities, risks generally associated with redevelopment, including the impact of construction delays and cost overruns, the Company's ability to lease redeveloped space and identify and pursue redevelopment opportunities, competitive and cost factors, the Company's ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms, the Company's ability to create long-term shareholder value, satisfaction of closing conditions to the pending transactions described herein, regulatory changes and other risk factors, including those detailed in the sections of the Company's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC titled \"Risk Factors.\" The Company assumes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), an industry trade group, Funds From Operations (FFO) means net income (loss) computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real estate. The Company has adopted the NAREIT definition in its computation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. The Company believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO attributable to common shareholders provides a basis for comparing its performance and operations to those of other real estate investment trusts (REITs). The Company believes that FFO attributable to common shareholders, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess the operating performance of REITs. FFO attributable to common shareholders does not represent an alternative to (i) \"Net income\" or \"Net income attributable to common shareholders\" as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, or (ii) \"Cash flows from operating activities\" in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.\nThe Company also reports Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders, which is defined as FFO attributable to common shareholders excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which the Company does not consider representative of the comparable operating results of its real estate operating portfolio, which is its core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating transactions and other events include, but are not limited to, the impact on earnings from gains or losses associated with the early extinguishment of debt or other liabilities, impairment charges to write down the carrying value of assets other than depreciable real estate, litigation involving the Company, including actual or anticipated settlement and associated legal costs, the impact on earnings from executive separation and the excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred stock redemption, which are not otherwise adjusted in the Company's calculation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. The Company believes that Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess the operating performance of REITs. Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders does not represent an alternative to (i) \"Net income\" or \"Net income attributable to common shareholders\" as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, or (ii) \"Cash flows from operating activities\" in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.\nThe Company also reports Net Operating Income (NOI), which it defines as all revenues other than straight-line rental income, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fee income, less real estate taxes and all operating expenses other than straight-line ground rent expense (non-cash) and amortization of acquired ground lease intangibles (non-cash). NOI consists of Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties. Same Store NOI for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 represents NOI from the Company's same store portfolio consisting of 102 retail operating properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized prior to January 1, 2016. NOI from Other Investment Properties for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 represents NOI primarily from properties acquired during 2016 and 2017, the Company's one remaining office property, three properties where the Company has begun redevelopment and/or activities in anticipation of future redevelopment, the properties that were sold or held for sale in 2016 and 2017, the net income from the Company's wholly-owned captive insurance company and the historical ground rent expense related to an existing same store investment property that was subject to a ground lease with a third party prior to the Company's acquisition of the fee interest on April 29, 2016. The Company believes that NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties, which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide an additional and useful operating perspective not immediately apparent from \"Operating income\" or \"Net income attributable to common shareholders\" in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these measures to evaluate its performance on a property-by-property basis because they allow management to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on the Company's operating results. NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties do not represent alternatives to \"Net income\" or \"Net income attributable to common shareholders\" in accordance with GAAP as indicators of the Company's financial performance. Comparison of the Company's presentation of NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure and represents net income attributable to common shareholders before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing performance. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the Company's performance from period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner in addition to standard financial measurements under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to \"Net income attributable to common shareholders\" as an indicator of the Company's financial performance. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure and represents (i) the Company's total notional debt, excluding unamortized premium, discount and capitalized loan fees, less cash and cash equivalents and disposition proceeds temporarily restricted related to potential Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges (1031 Exchanges) divided by (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the prior three months, annualized. The Company believes that this ratio is useful because it provides investors with information regarding its total notional debt net of cash and cash equivalents and disposition proceeds temporarily restricted related to potential 1031 Exchanges, which could be used to repay debt, compared to its performance as measured using Adjusted EBITDA. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nMichael Fitzmaurice\nSenior Vice President – Finance\nRetail Properties of America, Inc.\n(630) 634-4233\nRetail Properties of America,
