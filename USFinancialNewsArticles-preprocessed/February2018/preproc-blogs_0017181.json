    "text": "CNBC.com Getty Images SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at the International Astronautical Congress on September 29, 2017 in Adelaide, Australia. Musk detailed the long-term technical challenges that need to be solved in order to support the creation of a permanent, self-sustaining human presence on Mars. \nTesla reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Wednesday, and the company said it is on track to meet its Model 3 production goals. \nThe company also said it delivered a record number of Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles in the quarter. \nTesla said it posted a loss of $675 million, or $4.01 per share, in the latest quarter, its biggest loss ever. A year ago, Tesla lost $121 million, or 78 cents per share. \nAfter adjusting for one-time items, the company lost $513 million, or $3.04 per share. \nTesla reported negative free cash flow of $276.7 million, compared with $1.4 billion in the previous quarter, and $969.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. \nSome analysts had expected Tesla's cash burn to slow down, but warned that it remains a risk. \nDeliveries of Tesla's higher-priced Model S and Model X vehicles grew 10 percent globally over Tesla's prior record in the third quarter, and 28 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. \nDespite concerns Model 3 would cannibalize sales of these pricier models, Tesla said customer foot traffic has increased considerably in stores where Model 3 is on display and orders for Model S and Model X have increased. \n\"There has been an even bigger increase in solar and Powerwall sales,\" Tesla said. \nTesla opened 12 new store and service locations, for a total of 330 locations around the world at the end of 2017. Tesla increased productivity at existing service stations by 50 percent, doubling service capacity. Tesla's Mobile Service performs 30 percent of all service jobs. \nShares of the company were flat Wednesday evening. \nHere's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Adjusted loss per share: $3.04 vs. $3.12 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $3.29 billion vs. $3.28 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters \nTesla said it is on track to meet its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the second quarter, executives said Wednesday. Tesla had originally planned to reach the target by the end of 2017, but has since moved the deadline twice. \n\"We continue to target weekly Model 3 production rates of 2,500 by the end of Q1,\" the company said. \nProducing the Model 3, a sedan that starts at $35,000, on a mass market scale is widely considered crucial to Tesla's ambition of becoming a major automaker. Hopes that it will hit this target are considered one of the primary factors that have pushed Tesla's share price far above those of its much larger and profitable U.S. competitors, Ford and GM.",
