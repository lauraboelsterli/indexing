    "text": "HICKORY, N.C., Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Transportation Insight, a multi-modal Enterprise Logistics Provider and business strategist, announces that Executive Vice President of Enterprise Business Solutions Ken Wacker has been named a Provider Pro to Know by Supply & Demand Chain Executive magazine. In an economic environment where many forces have the potential to drive enterprise success and failure, Wacker works with executive decision-makers to assess performance gaps and implement real-world, operational solutions that help clients evolve to sustain long-term competitive advantage.\n\"Ken's executive expertise positions him to approach business challenges from the same strategic view as corporate leaders focused on improving enterprise performance. With three decades spent helping clients evaluate and transform their business processes, he is able to align this high-level focus with an actionable roadmap,\" says Transportation Insight President and CEO Chris Baltz. \"At a time when transportation marketplace trends create downward pressure on bottom-line performance, Ken is an effective change agent for our client partners working to increase profitability and improve customer service.\"\nWacker's insight has been featured in industry publications, such as \"Accelerating Enterprise Logistics with Top-Tier Multi-Modal Solutions\" in Inbound Logistics and \"The Parcel Shipping Issues Keeping You Awake at Night\" in Retail Touchpoints. He regularly shares market trends and Transportation Insight's solutions approach at industry events such as Operations Summit, Parcel Forum and the Internet Retailer Conference and Exhibition.\nWacker's executive lens enables him to understand organizational goals at the highest level and determine how an enterprise's strategic mission cascades into the supply chain and back-office functions. His knowledge of outsourced business processes, integrated technology solutions and logistics and information management make him a valued resource to business executives faced with implementing operational change. As customer service demands accelerate, shipping capacity tightens and supply chain disruptions occur, Transportation Insight relies on Wacker's relevant expert insight and objective viewpoint to help clients realize rapid return on transformation.\n\"If you are not making requisite changes, if you are not thinking about incremental advances to become essentially more effective and efficient, you may not sustain your competitiveness, which then translates to fundamental questions: Are you growing your top line? Are you growing your bottom line? And are you delivering return on invested capital?\" Wacker says. \"The reason why moderated change management is important today is because most of the directives related to the strategy of an organization – to grow, to become more profitable, to become more relevant, to scale, to increase customer service , to position the enterprise to create higher equity value – all require some element of change and an element of change behavior.\"\nWacker challenges clients to think in fact-based ways about metrics associated with key areas of improvement: operational service, human capital workflow, cost and waste reduction, performance management, compliance and risk mitigation. Within that framework, Transportation Insight leverages its technology platform to manage the flow of information from points throughout the supply chain.\nWacker is among three Transportation Insight thought leaders to receive recognition as 2018 Pros to Know. Vice President of Solutions Engineering Sophie Dabbs and Senior Director of Integrated Solutions Bill Loftis were also selected as Pros to Know from more than 300 nominations. With this year's awards, Transportation Insight's industry experts have received Pro to Know recognition nine times in the past five years.\nThe Pros to Know Awards recognize supply chain executives, and manufacturing and non-manufacturing enterprises, that are leading initiatives to help prepare their companies' supply chains for the significant challenges of today's business climate.
