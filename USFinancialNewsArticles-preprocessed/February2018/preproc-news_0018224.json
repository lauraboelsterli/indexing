    "text": "3:33 PM EST \nLive news broadcasts have come to Apple’s TV app. \nPeople can use the TV app to watch live news from outlets like CBS News, CNN, Fox News, CNBC, and Bloomberg on iPhones, iPads and the Apple TV streaming device. \nTech publication 9to5Mac spotted the update late Thursday, and noted that people must install the latest versions of iOS and tvOS (the Apple TV operating system) in order to view the broadcasts. \nThe TV app aggregates each of the media outlet’s broadcasts in one place, which makes it easier to watch them without having to open each individual app. However, people must install each news organization’s individual apps on their device before they can watch the broadcasts via the Apple TV app. ATV added live news alongside sports (at least on beta) pic.twitter.com/vW1AJ7yaUn \n— Teddy Svoronos (@tedsvo) February 9, 2018 \nThe updated TV app also appears to work with Siri, Apple voice-activated digital assistant. For example, users can ask Siri to show a Bloomberg broadcast, which will trigger the live stream, notes TechCrunch . \nBesides now being able to watch live news broadcasts, people can also use the Apple TV app to watch shows or movies they bought or rented via iTunes, or watch certain sports events via a Sports category that features some ESPN broadcasts. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nIn December, Amazon’s Prime video streaming service became available through the Apple TV app, allowing people to search for shows on Amazon Prime within the Apple app. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
