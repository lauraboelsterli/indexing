    "text": "LONG BEACH, Calif., Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Harbor Associates, LLC (\"Harbor\") has acquired The Commons at Valencia Gateway via an all-cash deal in a joint venture with Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Real Estate (\"GSAM PRE\"). The project is a two building, 156,628 SF office campus on 10.25 acres located at 25124 & 25152 Springfield Court in the city of Valencia, California. The portfolio is currently 81% leased to fifteen tenants. Tom Bohlinger, Ryan Smith and Justin Hager of JLL represented the seller in the transaction.\nHarbor plans to renovate the common areas and build out new spec suites to provide a best-in-class workplace for the Santa Clarita Valley while implementing energy saving improvements like EV charging stations. Upgraded gathering areas including an outdoor patio overlooking the adjacent Valencia Country Club golf course will be core elements of the asset repositioning strategy. The vacant office suites will receive new finishes throughout including LED lighting to bring the suites into a more marketable condition.\nThe project marks the eleventh acquisition for Harbor in the last three years. The acquisition expands Harbor's portfolio to 16 buildings encompassing over 1,000,000 square feet.\nThe Commons at Valencia Gateway is one of the newest office projects in the submarket, and the Class A steel-framed buildings were completed in 2005. The buildings offer tremendous I-5 freeway visibility and ingress/egress off Valencia Boulevard. The project offers above standard parking with a two-story parking structure and surface parking at a 4:1,000 parking ratio. The property features mountain and golf course views along with efficient and divisible floorplates.\nPaul Miszkowicz, Principal for Harbor, states, \"We like the office market in Valencia and believe that the recently approved 5,000+ homes at the Newhall Ranch development coupled with the Disney | ABC Studios at The Ranch's 58-acre soundstage development will provide new demand drivers for the submarket. We continue to seek compelling opportunities in suburban office locations that are out of favor with many institutional investors through our deep network of brokerage relationships and ability to move quickly and close all-cash.\"\nJoon Choi, Principal for Harbor, adds, \"We are excited about the opportunity to update this Class A office campus that already benefits from its unrivaled access to the freeway and superior golf course views. By adding onsite amenities, building high finish spec suites, and implementing energy savings initiatives, we intend on creating a best-in-class environment for tenants in the Santa Clarita Valley.\"\nJustin Loiacono, Principal for Harbor, comments, \"The Commons at Valencia Gateway marks the 11th value-add office acquisition for Harbor in the last three years. The acquisition expands Harbor's portfolio to 16 buildings across 11 different projects with square footage more than 1,000,000 square feet. We intend on building on our recent momentum by sourcing new opportunities and pursuing similar strategies in suburban office markets in order to meet our acquisition goal of $250M over the next 12 months. We have a robust pipeline of activity behind this transaction and look forward to continuing to build our Southern California portfolio.\"\nJoseph Sumberg, Co-head of GSAM PRE, notes, \"We believe that, despite the negative stigma surrounding the concept of suburban office, the fundamentals for certain properties in this sub-property type can be quite compelling. We are interested in pursuing other compelling opportunities to purchase best-in-class assets like the Commons at Valencia in fundamentally attractive suburban markets.\"\nAbout Harbor: Harbor Associates, LLC ( www.harborassociates.com ) is a value-add operating platform focused on acquiring and repositioning under-performing commercial real estate assets throughout Denver and Southern California.
