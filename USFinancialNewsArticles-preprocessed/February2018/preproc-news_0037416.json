No one appeared to be hurt, however. Gut seemed to catch one of the early gates with the tip of a ski, causing her to fall, slide down the mountain out of control and slam into several photographers, who were trying to jump out of her path. Manuela Moelgg of Italy is the early race leader. Reporting by Mark Trevelyan and Rory Carroll; Editing by John O'Brien",
