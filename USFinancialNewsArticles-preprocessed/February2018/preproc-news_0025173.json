    "text": "Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Joe Ingles 24 to lead the visiting Utah Jazz past the Portland Trail Blazers 115-96 Sunday night at Moda Center.\nRudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 11 rebounds as the Jazz won their ninth consecutive game and ended Portland’s nine-game home winning streak.\nJae Crowder -- donning a Utah uniform for the first time after a three-team trade -- chipped in 15 points and five rebounds off the bench for the Jazz. Utah’s Derrick Favors also scored 15.\nDamian Lillard, coming off a 50-point game Friday at Sacramento, led the Trail Blazers with 39 points. CJ McCollum added 22, and Shabazz Napier scored 10.\nTrailing by a point at halftime, the Jazz outscored the Blazers 38-19 in the third quarter to break the game open.\nUtah held Portland to 40.7 percent shooting from the field and dominated the battle in rebounds (58-37), points in the paint (44-30) and fast-break points (16-8). The Jazz shot 48.6 percent from the floor and made 13 of 26 3-point attempts and 20 of 22 free-throw tries in the game.\nPortland was 9 of 25 from beyond the arc and 21 of 25 at the foul line.\nThe Jazz led only 13-10 early despite Portland’s 2-for-14 shooting start. With Lillard scoring 13 points, the Blazers took a 26-19 advantage into the second quarter.\nPortland increased the difference to 30-19 early in the quarter, but Utah used a 7-0 run to draw within 30-26. The Jazz cut their deficit to 44-43 at the half.\nIngles scored 10 points in a 3 1/2-minute span as Utah opened the third quarter with a 15-2 spurt to go in front 58-46. The Jazz upped the spread to 72-54 late in the quarter and carried an 81-63 edge into the final period.\nUtah spiked its lead to 93-68 early in the fourth quarter. Portland scored six points in a row to trim it to 93-74 with 6:10 remaining. The Blazers got as close at 102-90 on a pair of free throws by Lillard with 2:05 to go.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
