    "text": "10 COMMENTS Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who built both Miramax and The Weinstein Company, helped spark the independent film movement of the 1990s.\nBut in October 2017, Harvey Weinstein was fired from the company he founded with his brother, after multiple news outlets published allegations of decades of sexual abuse.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against the studio alleging sexual harassment and civil-rights violations earlier this month. And the Weinstein Co. said late Sunday that it will file for bankruptcy “in the coming days” after talks to sell the company outside of chapter 11 fell apart.\nThe video above traces the brothers’ rise to prominence, from the early days when they bought and distributed independent art house films, to the height of their careers, when they produced star-driven projects with directors such as Quentin Tarantino.\nRelated\nWeinstein Co. Says It Will File for Bankruptcy —With additional reporting by Jonathan Randles.",
