    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The dollar extended its losses against the yen and set a fresh 15-month low on Thursday, with the selling accelerating after it breached the previous day’s trough.\nThe dollar dropped below Wednesday’s nadir of 106.725 yen and fell to as low as 106.42 yen, its weakest level since November 2016. The U.S. currency later pared some of its losses and was last down 0.3 percent on the day at 106.64 yen.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
