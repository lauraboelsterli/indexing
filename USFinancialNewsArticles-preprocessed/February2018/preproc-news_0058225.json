    "text": "20 years of biopharma clinical development and medical affairs experience Prior Clinical lead for Tysabri at Elan Pharmaceuticals Prior Medical lead for Questcor\nALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BioTime, Inc. (NYSE American: BTX), a late-stage, clinical biotechnology company developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases, today announced the appointment of Gary S. Hogge, DVM, MS, PhD, as Sr. Vice President, Clinical and Medical Affairs, a newly created position.\n\"The depth and breadth of Gary's expertise in developing and supporting the commercialization of a number of products over a broad range of therapeutic areas, makes him an ideal fit for BioTime,\" said Adi Mohanty, Co-Chief Executive Officer at BioTime. \"Gary's combination of clinical development and medical affairs leadership of marketed products will enhance our team as we prepare Renevia for CE Mark and OpRegen for expanded clinical development in patients with earlier stages of dry AMD.\"\nDr. Hogge, an industry veteran with approximately 20 years of experience, has been working as a consultant with us for the past several months. Gary has held a variety of roles of increasing responsibility across multiple therapeutic areas in both clinical development and medical affairs. Previously Gary was the Vice President of Medical Affairs at Questcor Pharmaceuticals and before that held multiple leadership roles in both clinical development and medical affairs at Elan Pharmaceuticals including responsibility for the global clinical development of Tysabri ® (natalizumab) in Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, and for building and leading the medical affairs function. He served as medical director following the approval and launch of Tysabri. Prior to those accomplishments, he worked in clinical development for Ceplene ® (histamine dihydrochloride) at Maxim Pharmaceuticals and in the immunology research and development group at Pfizer. Dr. Hogge obtained his bachelor's degree and DVM from Colorado State University, his MS and PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was a visiting scientist at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research QIMR in Brisbane, Australia.\n\"I am thrilled to join the BioTime team and look forward to contributing to the pipeline and our lead programs, Renevia and OpRegen,\" said Dr. Hogge.\nAbout BioTime, Inc.\nBioTime is a late stage clinical biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases. Its clinical programs are based on two platform technologies: cell replacement and cell/drug delivery. With its cell replacement platform, BioTime is creating new cells and tissues with its proprietary pluripotent cell technologies. These cells and tissues are developed to replace those that are either rendered dysfunctional or lost due to degenerative diseases. BioTime's cell/drug delivery programs are based upon its proprietary HyStem ® cell and drug delivery matrix technology. HyStem ® was designed to provide for the transfer, retention, engraftment and metabolic support of cellular replacement therapy. BioTime's lead cell delivery clinical program, Renevia ® , which consists of our proprietary HyStem ® cell-transplantation delivery matrix combined with the patient's own adipose progenitor cells (Fat), met its primary endpoint in an EU pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in HIV patients in 2017. Submission for approval of Renevia ® in the EU is expected to be early 2018, with possible approval in 2018. There were no device related serious adverse events reported to date. Our lead cell replacement clinical program, OpRegen ® , which is a retinal pigment epithelium transplant therapy, is in a Phase I/IIa multicenter trial for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in developing countries. There were no related serious adverse events reported to date. BioTime also has significant equity holdings in two publicly traded companies, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE American: AST) and OncoCyte Corporation (NYSE American: OCX), and a private company, AgeX Therapeutics, Inc.\nBioTime common stock is traded on the NYSE American and TASE under the symbol BTX.
