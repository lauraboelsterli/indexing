    "text": "Former IBM Sales Leader to Expand Footprint of ThirdChannel’s Retail Intelligence Platform\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ThirdChannel , the retail intelligence platform that reveals retail execution issues in stores and generates action plans to allocate resources where there’s opportunity to drive higher sales, today announced the appointment of Tom Morris as Vice President of Sales. In the wake of strong momentum and upcoming enhancements to ThirdChannel’s retail intelligence platform, Tom will be responsible for growing revenue and the platform’s reach within existing and new markets.\n“We’re excited to welcome Tom to the ThirdChannel team, as we continue our mission to help brands and retailers navigate the changes to physical stores that are driving a renaissance in the industry,” said Gina Ashe, CEO, ThirdChannel. “As VP of sales, Tom will grow ThirdChannel’s Sales and Customer Success teams, and build out our sales infrastructure to support planned growth. His background at IBM and other companies selling technology to manage the retail experience for consumers will be a key asset as we help more brands and retailers to unlock sales potential in stores.”\nTom brings more than a decade of experience in eCommerce and enterprise software industry sales. He joins ThirdChannel from IBM Tealeaf, where he held a range of sales leadership positions, most recently serving as worldwide sales leader and North American market executive of global technology services. While there, Tom managed operations of an organization of more than $200 million per year, helping to increase new sales growth by 122 percent year-over-year, while cutting cost of sales by 30 percent. Throughout his career, Tom has also held leadership positions in sales at SAP SuccessFactors, webMethods/Software AG, United Devices and others.\n“I’m proud to be joining the ThirdChannel team, as we usher physical retail into the digital era,” said Tom Morris, VP of sales, ThirdChannel. “Physical retail revenue is booming, but if brands and retailers want to deliver a personalized, positive shopping experience, they need access to the real-time data, tracking and analytics that companies enjoy with eCommerce. ThirdChannel is leading the pack when it comes to offering a holistic view of sales and on-the-ground data, and I’m excited to expose more retailers and brands to the kinds of data-driven insights that are needed to solve store compliance issues and improve sales.”\nAbout ThirdChannel\nThirdChannel is the platform that the world’s leading manufacturing brands and retailers use to see in real time what's happening — or should be happening — with products on the ground in thousands of stores, and generates action plans to drive higher sales.
