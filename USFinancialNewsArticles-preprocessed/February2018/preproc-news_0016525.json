    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will only consider an immigration reform bill that has President Donald Trump’s support, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday as lawmakers continue to weigh possible reforms amid larger budget negotiations.\n“We’re not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesn’t support... it’s going to be a bill that we support, that the president supports,” Ryan told reporters at a news conference.\nTrump on Monday appeared to reject a plan that was showing bipartisan support in the House and Senate.\nReporting by Richard Cowan and David Morgan; Writing by Susan Heavey\n ",
