    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. (the “Company”) today declared its regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per Common Share payable on March 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2018.\nThe Company also announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) has approved its normal course issuer bid renewal for a portion of its Common Shares. The normal course issuer bid will be made in accordance with the requirements of the TSX. The Company may begin to purchase Common Shares on February 16, 2018, under this renewal.\nAs of January 31, 2018, 31,234,484 Common Shares were outstanding. Pursuant to the renewed normal course issuer bid, the Company is permitted to acquire a maximum of 2,782,596 Common Shares, being 10% of the public float as of January 31, 2018, in the 12-month period commencing February 16, 2018, and ending on February 15, 2019. Repurchases under the normal course issuer bid will be made by the Company on the open market through the facilities of the TSX or alternative Canadian trading systems and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The price that the Company will pay for any Common Shares will be the market price of such Common Shares at the time of acquisition. Under the normal course issuer bid, the Company may repurchase a maximum of 25,219 Common Shares on the TSX during any trading day. This limitation does not apply to repurchases made pursuant to block purchase exemptions. Any Common Shares that are repurchased under the normal course issuer bid will be cancelled upon their repurchase by the Company.\nThe Company believes that the repurchase by the Company of a portion of outstanding Common Shares may, in certain circumstances, represent an appropriate use of available cash.\nPursuant to a previous notice of intention to conduct a normal course issuer bid, under which the Company sought and received approval from the TSX to purchase up to 2,739,018 Common Shares for the period of February 16, 2017, to February 15, 2018, no Common Shares have been repurchased as of the date of this press release.\nGluskin Sheff + Associates Inc. is one of Canada’s pre-eminent wealth management firms, serving high net worth private clients, estates, trusts and institutional investors.
