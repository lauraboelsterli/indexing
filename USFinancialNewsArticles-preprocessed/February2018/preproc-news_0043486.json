    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Burcon NutraScience Corporation (TSX:BU) (NASDAQ:BUR) (\" Burcon \") is pleased to announce that, further to its press release dated February 14, 2018 with respect to the completion of Burcon's rights offering (the \" Rights Offering \"), Burcon has issued 6,114,361 Common shares of Burcon (\" Common Shares \") at a price of $0.57 per share for aggregate gross proceeds to Burcon of $3,485,186 under the Rights Offering.\nTotal subscriptions, including those exercised pursuant to the additional subscription privilege, represented 64.7% of the Common Shares available under the Rights Offering.\nA total of 4,676,627 Common Shares were issued pursuant to the basic subscription privilege of the Rights Offering. Of these, 2,371,724 Common Shares were issued to insiders of Burcon and 2,304,903 Common Shares were issued to all other persons. A total of 1,437,734 Common Shares were issued pursuant to the additional subscription privilege of the Rights Offering. Of these, 70,000 Common Shares were issued to insiders of Burcon and 1,367,734 Common Shares were issued to all other persons. Following completion of the Rights Offering, Burcon has 43,941,536 Common Shares issued and outstanding.\nTo the knowledge of Burcon, after reasonably inquiry, no persons became an insider of Burcon from the distribution under the Rights Offering.\nAllan Yap, Burcon's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, acted as guarantor of the Rights Offering, having agreed to purchase from Burcon such number of Common Shares available to be purchased, but not otherwise subscribed for, that would result in 4,728,397 Common Shares being issued under the Rights Offering (the \" Standby Commitment \"), being up to 50% of the Rights Offering. As 64.7% of the Rights Offering was subscribed to, Allan Yap was not required to fulfill his obligations under the Standby Commitment .\nAs compensation for providing the Standby Commitment, Allan Yap received non-transferable Common Share purchase warrants (the \" Standby Warrants \") entitling Mr. Yap to acquire up to 1,182,099 Common Shares. The exercise price under the Standby Warrants is $0.69 per Common Share, and the Standby Warrants will expire two years after issuance. In accordance with the policies of the Toronto Stock Exchange, the issuance of the Standby Warrants to Allan Yap is subject to shareholder approval, which will be sought at Burcon's next annual meeting, which is expected to be held in September 2018.\nThe estimated net proceeds of the Rights Offering will be used to fund the Company's ongoing and expanded research and development program, further strengthen and expand its intellectual property portfolio and for general working capital. The Company's research and development will be focused on its Peazazz® pea protein extraction and purification technology. Burcon will continue its discussions with a select group of potential strategic partners to commercialize Peazazz®. Research and development work, ranging from applications work to shelf-life testing, is and will continue to be undertaken to provide samples to these parties for potential market applications for Peazazz®. Burcon has designed and built a large-scale pilot production facility, complete with an analytical laboratory, for the development and small-scale production of proteins from various plant sources. The research work is primarily undertaken by our technical team at this facility, with research and development contracted out as necessary.\nAbout Burcon NutraScience Corporation\nBurcon is a leader in developing technologies for the production of valuable plant-sourced ingredients for use in food, nutrition, wellness and supplement products.
