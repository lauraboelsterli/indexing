    "text": "WATERTOWN, Mass., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exergen Corporation is pleased to announce that its Senior Vice President and Chief Clinical Scientist, Dr. Marybeth Pompei, has accepted a new Affiliate Professor position with Northeastern University Bouvé College of Health Sciences School of Nursing, expanding her responsibilities at Exergen in support of the nursing profession. For the last two years, Exergen has served as Mission Sponsor of the School’s Nurse Innovation & Entrepreneurship program . Their mission, which aligns with Exergen’s, is elevating nurses’ ability to become innovators and bring their ideas to life.\nLeader in nursing innovation, appointed Affiliate Professor at Northeastern University Bouvé College of Health Sciences School of Nursing\nNurse, scientist and an entrepreneurial businessperson, Dr. Pompei is a member of the Advisory Board for Northeastern University’s Nurse Innovation and Entrepreneurship program and frequently serves as a keynote speaker at school conferences. Northeastern University is ranked one of the Best Graduate Nursing Schools by U.S. News & World Report .\n“Marybeth is a true pioneer in the field of nursing. For over 30 years, she has been a role model, mentor and advisor for nurses nationwide. Her extensive clinical knowledge and an in-depth understanding of evolving medical care and clinical requirements has made her an invaluable leader at Exergen,” said Dr. Francesco Pompei, President and CEO, Exergen Corporation. “We’re excited to watch Marybeth extend her skills to teaching Northeastern nursing students, where she will continue to make a lasting impact on thousands of nurses.”\nExergen Corporation’s dedication to advancing the field of nursing extends far beyond product development. In addition to manufacturing and marketing a professional and consumer model of the TemporalScanner thermometer, the company supports nurses in a wide variety of settings. Dr. Pompei clearly recognizes that nurses are not only on the frontline of patient care, they are the future of healthcare. Attending more than a dozen nurse affiliated conferences and providing online educational tools and certification programs are only some of the ways in which Exergen is hands-on in the field of nursing.\nBillions of temperatures are taken each year and, to deliver optimal patient care, healthcare professionals need a high quality, noninvasive thermometer. Exergen is committed to providing that with the TemporalScanner, which provides critical clinical benefits of accuracy, comfort and ease of use. This makes it a transformational product for healthcare professionals, particularly nurses who are the first to see a patient.\n“We have been working with Marybeth for over two years now as part of our Nurse Innovation and Entrepreneurship program and are thrilled to have her officially join our Northeastern team as a faculty member,” said Nancy Hanrahan, Professor and Dean of the Northeastern School of Nursing and Associate Dean of the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. “Her clinical expertise, combined with her entrepreneurial approach to the field of nursing, make her an outstanding addition to our institution.”\nDr. Pompei’s training in nursing was at St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center (Boston, MA) and Catholic University of America (Washington D.C.). She received undergraduate and graduate education in business at the University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia) and Harvard University, and returned to medicine at The Neiswanger Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy at Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, where she earned a Master’s Degree in Bioethics and Health Policy. Continuing her medical education at Albany Medical College, Alden March Bioethics Institute, earning her doctorate in Biomedical Ethics. In her Northeastern Affiliate Professor role, Dr. Pompei teaches a formal course in Bioethics to nursing students.\nABOUT EXERGEN CORPORATION\nExergen manufactures and markets two types of the TemporalScanner thermometer: a professional version for doctors' offices and hospitals, and a consumer model sold in major retailers nationwide.
