    "text": "Michael Bisch to lead Yolo County’s largest provider of food to the hungry\nWOODLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Yolo Food Bank announced today that longtime civic leader Michael Bisch has been chosen as the organization’s new executive director.\nBisch is well-known for his community involvement. He has been a commercial real estate broker and served for several years as the president of Davis Downtown, contributing his time and expertise to numerous civic efforts.\n“As the demand for the Yolo Food Bank’s services has grown, Michael Bisch possesses the right combination of skills to bring people together, build teams and partnerships throughout the communities we serve, enabling our core business to flourish,” said Tom Muller, President of the Yolo Food Bank Board of Directors. “Michael will play an important role in providing leadership and strategic direction to guide the Food Bank into the future.”\nCity of Davis Mayor, Robb Davis, said, \"I know Michael well. He will lead the Food Bank with integrity, patience, honesty, and great skill. He will work well with staff and stakeholders in all situations. Michael is a great choice to lead the Food Bank.\"\nBisch said he is honored to have the opportunity to serve the community in this new position. “Hunger in Yolo Country remains higher than the national average and I look forward to making a difference in the lives of those we are serving who are struggling to put food on the table,” Bisch said. “I’ve found the Food Bank staff to be very motivated by our mission of eliminating hunger and malnutrition in our county; there’s a very special spirit here.”\nBisch succeeds Kevin Sanchez, who served with the Food Bank for five years. Sanchez is recognized for growing both food distribution and produce delivery, the acquisition of a new warehouse facility and for his role in an ongoing capital campaign raising more than $4.5 million toward building renovation and debt retirement.\nDistributing more than 4 million pounds of food annually, Yolo Food Bank’s mission is to end hunger and malnutrition in Yolo County. With the support from donors of food, funds and time, as well as partnerships with more than 60 local agencies, Yolo Food Bank serves the needs of 19,000 Yolo County households, or approximately 52,000 individuals, every month.\nTo donate food items, support the capital campaign or for volunteer opportunities, please visit yolofoodbank.org or call (530) 668-0690.
