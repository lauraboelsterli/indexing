    "text": "By Jamie Ducharme 7:50 AM EST \nMario and Luigi will soon be headed to a theater near you, according to an announcement from Nintendo (ntdoy) . \nThe game maker is teaming up with Illumination, the studio behind smash hits Despicable Me and Minions , to produce an animated movie based on the world of Super Mario Bros., according to the announcement. The film will be co-financed and distributed by Universal Pictures, but Nintendo’s announcement did not specify a release date. \nThe new film — rumored for several months — will be co-produced by Chris Meledandri, the founder and CEO of Illumination, and Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Super Mario. \nThe animated effort will follow a live action Super Mario movie, fittingly titled Super Mario Bros., that dropped in 1993. The project grossed only $20.1 million off a $42 million budget, according to IMDB . SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
