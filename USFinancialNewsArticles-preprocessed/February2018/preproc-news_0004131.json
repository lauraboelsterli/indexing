    "text": "MILLINGTON, N.J., Jan. 31, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MSB Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:MSBF) (the “Company”), parent company of Millington Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company reported net income of $272,000, or $0.05 per diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net income of $478,000, or $0.09 per diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the full 2017 year was $2.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share, for the full year of 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded additional tax provision of $678,000, or $0.12 per diluted common share, due to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 which significantly reduced corporate tax rates. The impact of the change was the primary reason for the decrease in earnings for the fourth quarter. Excluding the additional tax provision, net income would have been $950,000, or $0.17 per diluted common share.\nHighlights for the quarter:\nNet interest margin improved 11 basis points to 3.30% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 3.19% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nEfficiency ratio improved to 62.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 69.0% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 driven by an increase in net interest income year over year.\nNon-performing assets were at 0.73% of total assets at December 31, 2017 compared with 1.51% at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 130.99% at December 31, 2017 compared to 64.13% at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company’s balance sheet reflected total asset growth of $101.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016, combined with improving asset quality, and capital levels that exceeded regulatory standards for a well-capitalized institution.\nSelected Financial Ratios (unaudited; annualized where applicable) As of or for the quarter ended: 12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nReturn on average assets 0.20 % 0.90 % 0.59 % 0.48 % 0.44 % Return on average equity 1.48 % 6.31 % 3.91 % 2.97 % 2.62 % Net interest margin 3.30 % 3.37 % 3.35 % 3.29 % 3.19 % Loans / deposit ratio 105.46 % 116.04 % 109.31 % 112.26 % 101.58 % Shareholders' equity / total assets 12.97 % 13.39 % 14.79 % 15.37 % 15.85 % Efficiency ratio 62.26 % 64.21 % 68.02 % 71.83 % 68.96 % Book value per common share $ 12.66 $ 12.57 $ 13.07 $ 12.93 $ 12.81 Net Interest Income\nTotal interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.4 million, or 36.2%, to $5.4 million compared to $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest income increased in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to a $128.7 million increase in average loan balances. Total interest expense increased by $403,000, or 62.1%, to $1.1 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nNet interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $1.0 million, or 31.1% to $4.3 million compared to the same three month period in 2016. The change for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily a result of an increase in average earning assets of $110.7 million. The annualized net interest spread was 3.12% and 3.02% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company's annualized net interest margin increased to 3.30% compared to 3.19% for the corresponding three month period in 2016.\nTotal interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased $5.3 million, or 37.1%, to $19.5 million compared to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as average earning assets increased $100.3 million year over year. Total interest expense increased by $1.2 million, or 53.4%, to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as average interest-bearing liabilities increased $97.1 million year over year.\nNet interest income grew $4.1 million, or 34.0%, to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Net interest income and net interest margin continue to increase due primarily to the growth in the Company’s commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios.\nEarnings Summary for Period Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table presents condensed consolidated statements of income data for the periods indicated.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income (unaudited) (dollars in thousands, except for per share data)\nFor the quarter ended: 12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nNet interest income $ 4,325 $ 4,190 $ 3,924 $ 3,595 $ 3,300 Provision for loan losses 200 490 300 195 300 Net interest income after provision for loan losses 4,125 3,700 3,624 3,400 3,000 Other income 211 205 219 187 205 Other expense 2,824 2,822 2,818 2,717 2,417 Income before income taxes 1,512 1,083 1,025 870 788 Income taxes (benefit) 1,240 (86 ) 293 321 310 Net income $ 272 $ 1,169 $ 732 $ 549 $ 478 Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.05 $ 0.21 $ 0.13 $ 0.10 $ 0.09 Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.21 $ 0.13 $ 0.10 $ 0.09 Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 5,577 5,564 5,540 5,520 5,510 Diluted 5,588 5,575 5,679 5,614 5,596 Statement of Condition Highlights at December 31, 2017\nBalance sheet growth, with total assets amounting to $563.0 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $101.4 million, or 22.0%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nThe Company’s total gross loans receivable were $499.2 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $119.5 million, or 31.5%, from December 31, 2016.\nSecurities held to maturity were $38.5 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 12.8%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nDeposits totaled $448.9 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $86.6 million, or 23.9%, compared to December 31, 2016.\nBorrowings totaled $37.7 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $15.0 million, or 66.2%, compared to $22.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents condensed consolidated statements of condition data as of the dates indicated.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Condition (unaudited) (in thousands) At: 12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2016\nCash and due from banks $ 2,030 $ 1,800 $ 1,839 $ 2,051 $\n1,388 Interest-earning demand deposits with banks 20,279 6,971 7,195 9,198 19,994 Securities held to maturity 38,482 40,752 42,441 42,716 44,104 Loans receivable, net of allowance 473,405 461,285 426,370 398,447 368,007 Premises and equipment 8,698 8,804 8,902 8,918 8,957 Federal home Loan Bank of New York stock, at cost 2,131 3,512 2,263 2,626 1,433 Bank owned life insurance 14,197 14,097 13,996 13,891 13,784 Accrued interest receivable 1,607 1,548 1,402 1,277 1,378 Other assets 2,211 2,988 2,690 2,784 2,601 Total assets $ 563,040 $ 541,757 $ 507,098 $ 481,908 $ 461,646 Deposits $ 448,913 $ 397,510 $ 390,063 $ 354,931 $ 362,299 Borrowings 37,675 68,375 38,675 49,175 22,675 Other liabilities 3,427 3,332 3,371 3,735 3,487 Shareholders' equity 73,025 72,540 74,989 74,067 73,185 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 563,040 $ 541,757 $ 507,098 $ 481,908 $ 461,646 Loans\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company’s net loan portfolio totaled $473.4 million, an increase of $105.4 million, or 28.6%, compared to $368.0 million at December 31, 2016.

Total loans receivable increased $119.5 million to $499.2 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $379.7 million at December 31, 2016. The increase primarily reflects a $72.0 million increase in commercial real estate loans, a $28.2 million increase in commercial and industrial loans and a $27.2 million increase in construction loans.

Shriner, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shriner added, “Not only did we push past $500 million in assets and returned to shareholders a $0.425 special dividend in 2017, our Lending Department achieved two consecutive years of $100 million in loan growth, an accomplishment our Company will not soon forget. Our Company will continue to pursue loan portfolio growth but not at the expense of asset quality.”\nMr. Shriner further added, “Like most financial institutions, we were required to revalue our deferred tax asset as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While this negatively impacted our results in the last quarter, going forward we will benefit from the significant reduction in tax rates.”\nForward Looking Statement Disclaimer\nThe foregoing release may contain concerning the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company.
