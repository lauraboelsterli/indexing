It will have as big an impact as tax cuts,” said Tomoaki Shishido, fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities.\nThe Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX and often seen as investors’ “fear gauge”, fell 2.3 points to 27.73, but that was still more than twice the levels generally seen in the past few months.\nCombined with an expected economic boost from President Donald Trump’s planned tax cuts, the increased deficit spending could overheat already strong U.S. growth and accelerate inflation to levels not seen over a decade.\nSuch fears drove the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield back up to 2.84 percent, near Monday’s four-year peak of 2.885 percent.\nThe Senate and the House were both expected to vote on the deal on Thursday, amid some opposition on both sides of the aisle.\n“The news yesterday has set up a test for 3 percent on 10-year Treasury yields,” said Francois Savary, CIO at Prime Partners, a Swiss wealth manager. “They have made no effort to go for any consolidation, which shows they don’t want to control what’s happening with budget finances.”\nIn Europe, bond yields were also higher, with the prospect of increased fiscal spending after Wednesday’s coalition government deal in Germany adding to some upward pressure on yields.\nBOE AWAITED In currency markets, sterling was a touch weaker at $1.3865 , not far from Tuesday’s two-week low of $1.3838, ahead of a Bank of England meeting.\nThe BoE is widely expected to keep rates on hold as it weighs up the impact of November’s rate rise on the economy.\nInvestors are more focused on whether any of the nine rate-setters vote for a hike at this meeting. That would be seen as adding to the likelihood of an increase in May, the next time the BoE is due to update its economic forecasts.\nThe budget deal in Washington supported the dollar against a broad range of currencies. At 0942 GMT it stood at 90.554, up 0.33 percent on the day.\nEurope’s single currency dipped to $1.2231, its lowest level in more than two weeks, while the dollar was 0.3 percent firmer at 109.66 Japanese yen. New Zealand’s dollar fell to a four-week low at $0.7190 after New Zealand’s central bank lowered its forecasts for inflation right out to 2020 and said stock market volatility this week was a warning that investors were nervous about the risk of higher inflation and rising interest rates.\nThe Chinese yuan, which last month posted its biggest monthly gain ever, slipped back 0.5 percent to 6.3205 per dollar .\nOil prices largely reversed earlier falls on Thursday as a North Sea pipeline outage and record Chinese imports countered U.S. crude production soaring past 10 million barrels per day.\nAdditional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo and Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
