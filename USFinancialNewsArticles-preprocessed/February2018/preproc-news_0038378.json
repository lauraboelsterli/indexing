(Reuters) - President Donald Trump will meet Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan at Trumpâ€™s Florida resort on Sunday to discuss legislative priorities, White House spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said. No further details were provided about the meeting or topics. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks at a news conference with Republican leaders after a closed conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Immigration may come up in the Trump-Ryan meeting. The U.S. Senate rejected a series of bills on Thursday to protect young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Trump is spending a long weekend in Florida. He often holds meetings with officials during regular trips to his properties outside of Washington. The president and his wife, Melania Trump, arrived in Florida on Friday evening and visited a hospital where victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, were being treated.
