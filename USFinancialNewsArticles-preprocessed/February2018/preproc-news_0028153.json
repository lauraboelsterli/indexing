    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 11:28 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Unilever threatens to cut back online ads over 'toxic' content Martinne Geller , Douglas Busvine 5 Min Read \nLONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Unilever ( ULVR.L )( UNc.AS ), one of the world’s biggest spenders on advertising, has threatened to pull ads from digital platforms such as Facebook and Google if they “create division” in society or fail to protect children. \nKeith Weed, chief marketing officer at Unilever, which makes Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soap, will explain the plan in a speech on Monday at the annual Interactive Advertising Bureau conference in California. \nWeed will call on the technology industry to improve transparency and consumer trust in an era of fake news and “toxic” online content. \n“Unilever, as a trusted advertiser, do not want to advertise on platforms which do not make a positive contribution to society,” Weed plans to say, according to a copy of the speech seen beforehand. \nThe speech does not accuse any specific platform, but says trust in social media is at a new low due to a perceived lack of focus by tech firms in keeping illegal, unethical and extremist material off their websites. \nUnilever also said it was committed to tackling gender stereotypes in advertising and will only partner with organizations committed to creating better digital infrastructure. \n“Fake news, racism, sexism, terrorists spreading messages of hate, toxic content directed at children ... it is in the digital media industry’s interest to listen and act on this,” Weed plans to say. “Before viewers stop viewing, advertisers stop advertising and publishers stop publishing.” \nWeed will also discuss a new partnership with IBM ( IBM.N ), piloting blockchain technology for advertising that could reduce advertising fraud by providing reliable measurement metrics. \nUnilever itself was heavily criticized last year for a Dove advert on Facebook that many saw as racist. BIG BUDGET \nUnilever spent about 7.7 billion euros ($9.4 billion) on marketing last year. Digital advertising accounts for about one-third of its spend, the company said in September.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo \nOver the last five years, its spending on digital media has more than doubled while its investment in creating digital content has gone up by 60 percent. \nIts spending on traditional media is down slightly, but under a cost savings drive it has cut the number of ads it makes and agencies it works with. These efficiencies resulted in 35 percent lower investment creating traditional content. \nGoogle, part of Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ), and Facebook ( FB.O ) are estimated to have half of online ad revenue worldwide in 2017 and more than 60 percent in the United States, according to research firm eMarketer. \nOfficials at Google in Europe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook said in a statement: \n“We fully support Unilever’s commitments and are working closely with them.” \nWeed has recently explained his views in meetings with all of Unilever’s digital partners, including Facebook, Google, Twitter ( TWTR.N ), Snap ( SNAP.N ) and Amazon ( AMZN.O ). \nHis comments echo complaints made by Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ) Chief Brand Officer Mark Pritchard, who has lamented fake ad clicks by automated ‘bots’, the risk an ad can appear online next to an ISIS recruitment video and the realization that people do not watch video commercials any more. \nOnly 25 percent of online ad spending reaches the consumer, with the rest skimmed off by a “murky, non-transparent, even fraudulent supply chain” within the industry, Pritchard told a conference last year. \nLast year, video-sharing site YouTube faced two advertiser boycotts after newspaper reports found ads of major brands appearing next to questionable videos. \nAfter the first boycott, which related to videos from Islamic extremists, there was scant evidence of any impact on revenue of its owner, Alphabet. \nFacebook executives visiting Europe last month made a public show of contrition about the social media giant’s slow response to abuses on its platform, seeking to avoid further legislation similar to a new hate speech law in Germany it says goes too far.
