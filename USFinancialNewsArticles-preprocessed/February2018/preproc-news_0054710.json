(2) Total debt outstanding divided by total debt outstanding plus equity market capitalization based on the Company’s closing share price of $19.61 on December 31, 2017. Comparable Hotels is defined as the 239 hotels owned by the Company as of December 31, 2017. For hotels acquired during the periods noted, the Company has included, as applicable, results of those hotels for periods prior to the Company's ownership, and for dispositions, results have been excluded for the Company's period of ownership. Results for periods prior to the Company's ownership have not been included in the Company's actual Consolidated Financial Statements and are included only for comparison purposes. Results included for periods prior to the Company's ownership are based on information from the prior owner of each hotel and have not been audited or adjusted.\nJustin Knight, President and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Hospitality REIT, commented, “The Company achieved an increase in Comparable Hotels RevPAR of 3.5 percent for the quarter and 1.6 percent for the year, due in part to increased demand in Houston and portions of Florida. Despite a low rate growth environment and ongoing wage pressure driven by low unemployment, we achieved a strong Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin of 37.8 percent for the year. We are pleased to have completed seven strategic hotel acquisitions in recent months, adding to our portfolio’s geographic diversity and increasing our exposure in strong business and leisure markets. Our results continue to highlight the benefits of our geographically diverse portfolio of rooms-focused Marriott and Hilton branded hotels, complemented by a strong flexible balance sheet, and we are confident this strategy will continue to benefit shareholders over the long term.”\nTransactional Activity\nAcquisitions\nOn February 2, 2017, Apple Hospitality acquired the newly constructed 124-room Courtyard by Marriott ® in Fort Worth, Texas, for a gross purchase price of approximately $18 million. On September 12, 2017, the Company acquired the newly constructed Hilton Garden Inn ® and Home2 Suites by Hilton ® hotels in Birmingham, Alabama, with a combined total of 210 rooms, for a combined gross purchase price of approximately $38 million. On October 13, 2017, the Company acquired an existing 179-room Residence Inn by Marriott ® in Portland, Maine, for a gross purchase price of approximately $56 million. On October 20, 2017, the Company acquired an existing 136-room Residence Inn by Marriott ® in the Murray suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah, for a gross purchase price of approximately $26 million. On December 1, 2017, the Company acquired an existing 135-room Home2 Suites by Hilton ® in Anchorage, Alaska, for a gross purchase price of approximately $24 million. On February 5, 2018, the Company acquired an existing 119-room Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton ® in Atlanta, Georgia, and an existing 144-room Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton ® in Memphis, Tennessee, for a combined gross purchase price of $63 million.\nDispositions\nOn April 20, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the 224-room Hilton ® in Dallas, Texas, for a gross sales price of approximately $56 million, including debt assumed by the buyer of approximately $27 million. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $16 million in the second quarter of 2017. On October 5, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the 316-room Marriott ® in Fairfax, Virginia, for a gross sales price of approximately $42 million. As a result of the sale, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nMerger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\nEffective September 1, 2016, Apple Hospitality completed its merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc. (“Apple Ten”). The merger added 56 Marriott® and Hilton® branded primarily select-service and extended-stay hotels with 7,209 guest rooms to the Company’s portfolio. As consideration in the merger, the Company issued approximately 49 million common shares and paid approximately $94 million to the Apple Ten shareholders, and assumed approximately $257 million of debt.\nCapital Improvements\nApple Hospitality consistently reinvests in its hotels to maintain and enhance each property’s relevance and competitive position within its respective market. During the 2017, the Company invested approximately $69 million in capital expenditures. The Company plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels and anticipates investing $70 million to $80 million in capital improvements during 2018, which includes various scheduled renovation projects for approximately 30 to 35 properties.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Markets\n Apple Hospitality had approximately $1.2 billion of total outstanding indebtedness with a current combined weighted-average interest rate of approximately 3.6 percent for 2018. Excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments, the Company’s total outstanding indebtedness is comprised of approximately $457 million in property-level debt secured by 29 hotels and $767 million outstanding on its unsecured credit facilities. Apple Hospitality’s undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities at December 31, 2017, was approximately $433 million. The Company’s total debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2017, was approximately 21 percent, which provides Apple Hospitality with financial flexibility to fund capital requirements and pursue opportunities in the marketplace.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold approximately 6.9 million common shares under its at-the-market offering program at a weighted-average market sales price of approximately $19.55 per common share and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $135.1 million and proceeds net of offering costs of approximately $132.9 million. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of these shares to pay down borrowings on its revolving credit facility, providing additional capacity for strategic growth while maintaining the Company’s strong balance sheet.\nRenaissance ® New York Hotel 57\nThe fourth quarter of 2017 includes a $38 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Company’s Renaissance ® New York Hotel 57, as a result of declines in the hotel’s current and projected cash flows. The hotel has been and is expected to be impacted by a combination of: declines in existing and forecasted hotel market conditions in New York City; new supply in the market; and the loss of retail tenants and the extended period of time and incremental costs it has taken and is anticipated to take to re-lease the available retail space.\nShareholder Distributions\nApple Hospitality paid distributions of $0.30 per common share during the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, and $1.20 per common share for the 2017. Based on the Company’s common share closing price of $18.16 on February 20, 2018, the annual distribution represents an annual yield of approximately 6.6 percent. The Company’s Board of Directors, in consultation with management, will continue to regularly monitor the Company’s distribution rate relative to the performance of its hotels, capital improvement needs, varying economic cycles, acquisitions and dispositions. At its discretion, the Company’s Board of Directors may make adjustments as determined to be prudent in relation to other cash requirements of the Company.\n2018 Outlook\nApple Hospitality is providing its operational and financial outlook for 2018. This outlook, which is based on management’s current view of both operating and economic fundamentals of the Company’s existing portfolio of hotels, does not take into account any unanticipated developments in its business or changes in its operating environment, nor does it take into account any unannounced hotel acquisitions or dispositions. Comparable Hotels RevPAR Growth and Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin % guidance include properties acquired, as if the hotels were owned as of January 1, 2017, and exclude completed dispositions since January 1, 2017. For the full year 2018, the Company anticipates:\n2018 Guidance (1) Low-End High-End Net income $197 Million $221 Million Comparable Hotels RevPAR Growth 0.0% 2.0% Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin % 36.8% 37.8% Adjusted EBITDA $437 Million $457 Million (1) Explanations of and reconciliations to net income guidance of Adjusted EBITDA guidance are included below.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss), cash flow from operations, or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company’s results between periods and with other REITs. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to net income (loss) are provided in the following pages.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer\nCertain statements contained in this press release other than historical facts may be considered These forward- predictions and generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as “may,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “goal,” “plan,” “should,” “will,” “predict,” “potential,” “outlook,” “strategy,” and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the agreements governing the Company’s indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance.\nThe Company considers the exclusion or inclusion of certain additional items from EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) useful, including (i) the exclusion of transaction and litigation costs (reimbursements), gains or losses from sales of real estate, and the loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets, as these items do not represent ongoing operations, and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels.\nThe Company further excludes actual corporate-level general and administrative expense for the Company from Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Hotel EBITDA) to isolate property-level operational performance over which the Company’s hotel operators have direct control. The Company believes Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding operating performance and is used by management to measure the performance of the Company’s hotels and effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA on a quarterly basis from March 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended 3/31/2016 6/30/2016 9/30/2016 12/31/2016 3/31/2017 6/30/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Net income (loss) $ 34,686 $ 54,718 $ 13,694 $ 41,554 $ 34,365 $ 87,606 $ 62,824 $ (2,303 ) Depreciation 33,484 33,824 37,343 43,512 43,767 43,893 44,110 44,729 Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net 262 119 132 161 165 168 165 165 Interest and other expense, net 8,803 9,560 10,156 11,507 11,717 11,849 12,024 11,753 Income tax (benefit) expense 263 360 (7 ) (185 ) 250 259 203 135 EBITDA 77,498 98,581 61,318 96,549 90,264 143,775 119,326 54,479 Transaction and litigation costs (reimbursements) 293 1,116 36,452 (2,872 ) - (2,586 ) - - (Gain) Loss on sale of real estate - - - 153 - (16,140 ) 157 (312 ) Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets - - 5,471 - 7,875 - - 38,000 Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense 819 817 843 940 939 938 917 906 Adjusted EBITDA $ 78,610 $ 100,514 $ 104,084 $ 94,770 $ 99,078 $ 125,987 $ 120,400 $ 93,073 General and administrative expense 4,828 5,060 2,623 4,521 6,754 6,151 5,350 8,086 Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ 83,438 $ 105,574 $ 106,707 $ 99,291 $ 105,832 $ 132,138 $ 125,750 $ 101,159 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\n2018 Guidance Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nThe guidance of net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that the expectations will be achieved or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in political, economic, competitive and specific market conditions; the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties; the level of capital expenditures may change significantly, which will directly affect the level of depreciation expense, interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of debt repayments may change significantly based on market conditions, which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving the Company's common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business described herein and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2017.\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s GAAP net income guidance to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nYear Ending December 31, 2018 Low-End High-End Net income $ 197,375 $ 220,975 Depreciation 183,000 181,000 Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net 600 600 Interest and other expense, net 51,500 49,500 Income tax expense 800 1,200 EBITDA 433,275 453,275 Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense 3,725 3,725 Adjusted EBITDA $ 437,000 $ 457,000 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to FFO and MFFO\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nThe Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), which defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the Nareit definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company further adjusts FFO (MFFO) for certain additional items that are not in Nareit’s definition of FFO, including: (i) the exclusion of transaction and litigation costs (reimbursements), as these costs do not represent ongoing operations, and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense, as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s GAAP net income (loss) to FFO and MFFO for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (2,303 ) $ 41,554 $ 182,492 $ 144,652 Depreciation of real estate owned 44,500 43,282 175,581 147,244 (Gain) loss on sale of real estate (312 ) 153 (16,295 ) 153 Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets 38,000 - 45,875 5,471 Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net 165 161 663 674 Funds from operations 80,050 85,150 388,316 298,194 Transaction and litigation costs (reimbursements) - (2,872 ) (2,586 ) 34,989 Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense 906 940 3,700 3,419 Modified funds from operations $ 80,956 $ 83,218 $ 389,430 $ 336,602 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.\nDebt Summary\n(Unaudited)\n($ in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2017\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2020 Thereafter Total Fair Market Value Total debt: Maturities $ 11,964 $ 139,622 $ 452,223 $ 96,415 $ 108,034 $ 416,077 $ 1,224,335 $ 1,221,312 Average interest rates 3.6% 3.6% 3.8% 4.0% 3.9% 3.8% Variable rate debt: Maturities $ - $ 106,900 $ 425,000 $ 50,000 $ - $ 185,000 $ 766,900 $ 768,745 Average interest rates (1) 3.1% 3.1% 3.2% 3.3% 3.4% 3.4% Fixed rate debt: Maturities $ 11,964 $ 32,722 $ 27,223 $ 46,415 $ 108,034 $ 231,077 $ 457,435 $ 452,567 Average interest rates 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.4% 4.2% 4.1%\n___",
