    "text": "SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Singapore’s Wilmar International Ltd, the world’s largest palm oil processor, posted a 36.6 percent fall in its fourth-quarter core net profit, hurt by weaker results in its tropical oils and sugar businesses.\nThe company, whose biggest shareholders include U.S. agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland Co, reported a net profit of $427.5 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a year-ago profit of $560.8 million.\nIt posted a core net profit, which excludes non-operating items, of $373.9 million, compared with $589.5 million a year earlier.\nWilmar posted a 25.4 percent rise in annual net profit at $1.22 billion versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.
