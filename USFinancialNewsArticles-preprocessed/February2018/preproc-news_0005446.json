Australia’s fertility rate is 1.8.\nUnder the deal, the Singapore Medical and CHA consortium will acquire 65 percent of the Brisbane-based company, which operates seven clinics, mostly in eastern Australia.\nSingapore Medical Group listed in 2009, has a market capitalisation of S$278 million ($212 million) and operates 36 medical centres in the city-state. The deal was announced outside market hours in Singapore.\nCHA runs hospitals and fertility clinics in Korea, as well as facilities in Tokyo and Los Angeles.\nKyeong Wook Yoon, the chief executive officer of Seoul-based CHA, said the Australian investment gave the company access to markets across the Pacific Rim region.\nCity Fertility CEO Adnan Catakovic said the partnership would seek to grow in Australia, pursuing research partnerships with universities and expanding egg and sperm banks.\nIn related deals, CVC Capital Partners Fund VI last year paid $703 million for Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd womens health businesses, including contraception and fertility products.\nIn 2016 Hungarian drugmaker Richter bought Swiss biotech company Finox Holding for $194 million.\n$1 = 1.3117 Singapore dollars Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
