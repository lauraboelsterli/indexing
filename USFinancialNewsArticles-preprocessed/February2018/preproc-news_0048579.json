    "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio, Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE-- PAO Group, Inc. (OTC:PAOG), a physicians practice management company, focused on the proper use of cannabis for treatment of chronic, and terminal patients, announces today that, in analysis of details necessary to further expedite growth in shareholder value, the Company will begin streamlining operations in its Alternative Medicine Centers of America to exclusively include Corporate Owned facilities.\n“It has always been the case that the Corporate owned facilities are more profitable than the affiliate locations,” states CEO Robert Weber. “That said, the affiliate locations were a necessity in bootstrapping multiple locations and now that we have reached a sort of critical mass in both Ohio and Florida, the company is pleased to announce that we are now in the process of acquiring or replacing all of our existing affiliate locations to improve quality of patient services and overall profitability.”\n“We are also announcing our Grand Opening of new locations in Florida: Jacksonville, and St. Augustine. Jacksonville will open in early March, with St. Augustine to follow shortly thereafter. We are thrilled with the continued expansion of our brand, and services toward socially responsible profits, and overall success in our mission to provide communities and patients with the most efficacious solutions as an alternative measure to the pitfalls of opiate-based care,” states Weber.\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that Alternative Medicine Centers of America will be launching opiate addiction treatment, beginning with its North Florida clinics.\n“We are launching a pilot program in our North Florida clinics to offer opiate addiction treatment for indigent, and uninsured patients. Our sister company Rising Biosciences, Inc. was able to create an effective alternative compound for opiate addiction and will be making these available to indigent and uninsured patients in a comprehensive program including treatment via counseling, and medication to battle opioid addiction with an immediate discount for patients that facilitate affordable and responsible care. These discounts will also serve the company with significant tax benefits.”\nAlternative Medicine Centers of America provides health education, lifestyle coaching, and naturopathic medicine essential to an individual's successful achievement of personal wellness. Our success comes from providing patients with safe and confidential access to quality alternative healthcare, while providing them with the most professional support systems available. Alternative Medicine Centers of America provides the community and patient with the most current, innovative and dynamic wellness information and services possible. Alternative Medicine Centers of America brings to light personal wellness potential for patients and facilitates their journey to harmonious fitness.\nVisit our website at: www.PAO.Group Contact us: info@pao.group or 1-888-PAO-Group \"Like\" and \"Share\" PAO Group on Facebook/paogroupinc and follow us on Twitter @paogroup\nForward-Looking Statements: Certain statements in this news release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of Rule 175 under the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 3b-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and are subject to the safe harbor created by those rules.
