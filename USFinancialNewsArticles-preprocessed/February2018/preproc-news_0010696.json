    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Apollo”) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Our strong results for the fourth quarter capped an exceptional 2017 for Apollo,” said Leon Black, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Driven by outstanding investment performance of the funds we manage, during the year we grew our total assets under management by 30% to nearly $250 billion. Compared with 2016, fee-related earnings increased by almost 20%, while our declared cash distribution rose by 45% and our economic net income advanced by more than 50%. As we look to 2018 and beyond, we believe Apollo’s integrated global platform will continue to position us to deliver strong returns to our investors.”\nApollo issued a full detailed presentation of its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 results, which can be viewed through the Investor Relations section of Apollo’s website at http://ir.agm.com .\nDistributions\nApollo has declared a cash distribution of $0.66 per Class A share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.
