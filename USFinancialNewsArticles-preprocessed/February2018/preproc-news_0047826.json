    "text": "AKRON, Ohio, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported full-year 2017 GAAP losses of $(1.7) billion, or $(3.88) per basic and diluted share of common stock on revenues of $14 billion. In 2016, the company recorded GAAP losses of $(6.2) billion, or $(14.49) per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $14.6 billion. Results for both periods primarily reflect the impact of non-cash asset impairment and plant exit costs related to the company's competitive generation fleet, and 2017 results also include a charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOperating (non-GAAP) earnings* for 2017 were $3.07 per basic share of common stock, which was at the upper end of the company's most recent guidance. In 2016, operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $2.63 per basic share of common stock.\n\"Throughout the past year, our company has made important progress in our transition to a fully regulated utility,\" said Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer. \"This strategy and the opportunities for growth in our regulated businesses earned the confidence of prominent investors. With their equity investment earlier this year, we began 2018 with stronger corporate financial metrics, and we are well positioned to accelerate growth in our transmission and distribution businesses, as we continue our exit from competitive generation.\"\nThe company is introducing 2018 regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings** guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per diluted share, representing operating earnings from the regulated distribution and transmission businesses, net of the corporate segment. The company also announced a compound annual growth rate projection for its regulated operations, excluding the Ohio DMR and offset by the corporate segment, of 6 to 8 percent through 2021, which includes more than $10 billion in regulated capital investments planned over that time period.\nFourth Quarter Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported a GAAP loss of $(2.5) billion or $(5.62) per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $3.4 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company reported a GAAP loss of $(5.8) billion, or $(13.44) per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $3.4 billion. Results for both periods primarily reflect the impact of impairments and plant exit costs related to the company's competitive generation fleet, and 2017 results also include charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as described below.\nOperating (non-GAAP) earnings* for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.71 per basic share of common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2016, operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $0.38 per basic share of common stock.\nIn FirstEnergy's Regulated Distribution business, fourth quarter 2017 earnings increased compared to the same period in 2016 primarily as a result of rates that went into effect in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey in January 2017, as well as higher weather-related usage in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFourth quarter total distribution deliveries increased 1.6 percent compared to the same period in 2016. Residential sales increased 3.9 percent as a result of heating degree days that were 9 percent above the same period of 2016, while sales to commercial customers decreased 3.2 percent. Deliveries to industrial customers increased 3.2 percent, primarily due to higher usage in the shale gas and steel sectors. This marked the sixth consecutive quarterly increase in the company's industrial distribution sales.\nIn the Regulated Transmission business, fourth quarter earnings benefited from a higher rate base associated with the company's Energizing the Future transmission program and higher revenues for JCP&L's transmission assets.\nIn the Competitive Energy Services segment, lower depreciation expense and general taxes were offset by a decrease in commodity margin related to lower contract sales and higher operating expenses.\nIn the Corporate/Other segment, operating expenses decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, but this was offset by higher net financing costs.\nFull Year 2017 Segment Results\nFor the full year of 2017, earnings increased in the Regulated Distribution business as a result of the rates that went into effect in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey in January 2017. These rates more than offset the effect of significantly milder weather in 2017 and higher depreciation expense.\nIn the Regulated Transmission business, full-year 2017 results benefited from the company's continued investments in the Energizing the Future initiative, partially offset by higher operating expenses, depreciation and general taxes.\nFull year results in the Competitive Energy Services segment primarily reflect a decrease in commodity margin related to lower contract sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by lower depreciation expense and general taxes.\nResults from the Corporate/Other segment decreased full year 2017 earnings due primarily to higher interest expense.\nImpairment of Competitive Assets and Impact of Tax Reform\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, FirstEnergy recorded non-cash, pre-tax asset impairment and plant exit costs of $2.4 billion, or $3.38 per share, primarily to fully impair the carrying value of its nuclear generating assets, increase the nuclear asset retirement obligations, and reduce the carrying value of the Pleasants Power Station. In addition, the company recognized a fourth quarter non-cash charge to income tax expense of $1.2 billion, or $2.68 per share, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nConsolidated GAAP EPS to Operating (Non-GAAP) EPS* Reconciliation\nFourth Quarter\nFull Year\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nBasic Earnings (Loss) Per Share (GAAP)\n$(5.62)\n$(13.44)\n$(3.88)\n$(14.49)\nExcluding Special Items*:\nMark-to-market adjustments\nPension/OPEB actuarial assumptions\n0.19\n0.21\n0.19\n0.21\nOther\n0.03\n0.03\n0.12\n0.01\nRegulatory charges\n0.05\n0.01\n0.10\n0.13\nAsset impairment/Plant exit costs\n3.38\n13.54\n3.83\n16.67\nDebt redemption costs\n—\n0.01\n0.01\n0.02\nTrust securities impairment\n—\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\nTax reform\n2.68\n—\n2.68\n—\nMerger accounting – commodity contracts\n—\n0.01\n—\n0.05\nTotal Special Items*\n6.33\n13.82\n6.95\n17.12\nBasic EPS - Operating (Non-GAAP)\n$0.71\n$0.38\n$3.07\n$2.63\n* Per share amounts for the special items and earnings drivers above are based on the after-tax effect of each item divided by forecasted weighted average basic shares outstanding for the period. The current and deferred income tax effect was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pretax amount with the exception of the 2016 Asset impairment/Plant exit costs that included an impairment of goodwill, of which $433 million of the $800 million pre-tax impairment was non-deductible for tax purposes, and the 2016 valuation allowances recorded against state and local NOL carryforwards of $159 million. With the exception of these items included in Asset impairment/Plant exit costs, the income tax rates range from 35% to 42% for the 2016 and 2017 periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\n*Operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) exclude \"special items\" as described herein, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) per share is also a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the CES segment and to the extent it excludes \"special items.\" Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. The Company's management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. Regulated Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share are calculated based on the regulated distribution and regulated transmission segments, and including the corporate segment, divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Management uses operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses), operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) by segment, and Regulated Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) and Regulated Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the company's peer group. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.\n** Does not include Competitive Energy Services segment. Special items in 2018 cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 2018 operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per diluted share is based on forecasted GAAP net income for Regulated Distribution, Regulated Transmission, less the Corporate/Other segment of $1,205 million to $1,365 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 536 million. Forecasted net income (loss) ranges by segment are as follows; $1,130 million to $1,240 million for Regulated Distribution, $370 million - $410 million for Regulated Transmission, and ($295) million - ($285) million at Corporate/Other. 1Q 2018 regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per diluted share is based on forecasted GAAP net income for Regulated Distribution, Regulated Transmission, less the Corporate/Other segment of $320 million to $375 million.\nConsolidated Report and Teleconference\nFirstEnergy's Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which provides highlights on company developments and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, is posted on the company's Investor Information website – www.firstenergycorp.com/ir .
