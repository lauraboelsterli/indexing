    "text": "0 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court blocked victims of Iranian-backed terrorism from seizing Persian antiquities on loan to a U.S. university, holding that Tehran’s property is protected by a federal law that immunizes foreign governments from most lawsuits.\nThe case provided a rare moment of ideological unity in unlikely circumstances, as the justices on Wednesday unanimously agreed with the Trump administration to favor a regime the U.S. classifies as a state sponsor of terrorism against Americans injured in a Hamas suicide bombing.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said Iran had the better argument—that while Congress has allowed victims to sue state sponsors of terrorism, plaintiffs largely are limited to seizing such regimes’ commercial assets, rather than any property they might own.\nCongress sought to strike a “careful balance between respecting the immunity historically afforded to foreign sovereigns and holding them accountable, in certain circumstances, for their actions,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. For instance, “a foreign sovereign will be stripped of jurisdictional immunity when a claim is based upon commercial activity in the United States.”\nSince the 1970s, federal law has permitted lawsuits against, say, a state-owned airline, much as a consumer could sue a private commercial carrier. After Congress diluted sovereign immunity for state sponsors of terrorism, lower courts divided over whether any property the foreign government owned could be seized to satisfy a judgment, or only the same kinds of commercial property already at litigation risk.\nWednesday’s decision adopted the narrower interpretation. The Trump administration, maintaining a longstanding U.S. government position, had urged that approach.\nWhile saying it condemns terrorism and sympathizes with its victims, the Justice Department’s brief argued that “litigation against foreign states in U.S. courts can have significant foreign affairs implications for the United States, and can affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States in the courts of other nations.”\nThe case originated in 1997, when the Palestinian militant organization Hamas orchestrated three suicide bombings in Jerusalem that killed five people and injured 200. In 2003, eight Americans injured in the attacks and their relatives won a $71.5 million federal-court judgment against Iran for providing material support to Hamas.\nThe ancient clay tablets at the University of Chicago have been on loan from Iran since the 1930s. Photo: Persepolis Fortification Archive Project, Oriental Institute, University of Chicago Frustrated by the paucity of Iranian assets in the U.S., they sought to seize the Persepolis Collection, some 30,000 ancient clay tablets that have been on loan from Iran to the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute since the 1930s.\nAsher Perlin, a Hollywood, Fla., lawyer who represented the victims, said the ruling “was a difficult loss for my clients who have been waiting for justice for more than 20 years.”\n“With Iranian antiquities at stake the court had a rare opportunity to hold Iran’s feet to the fire and compel it to pay a U.S. judgment,” he said. “We regret that the court let that opportunity slip away.”\nMr. Perlin said the plaintiffs would have sought to sell the collection to “a responsible institutional purchaser,” but scholars feared the loss of a unique cultural legacy. University of Chicago archaeologists discovered the trove at Persepolis, the Persian capital destroyed by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C.\nThe small clay tablets, some the size of a domino, include cuneiform inscriptions and seals that document mundane activities under the Achaemenid dynasty. “They are vouchers and ledgers from the food exchange,” said David Strauss, a University of Chicago law professor who represented both the university and Iran at the December court arguments.\nThe loan, made by the Pahlavi dynasty that Islamic fundamentalists overthrew in 1979, was intended to allow scholars to research, translate and catalog the tablets. While researchers have had more than 80 years to finish the task, Mr. Strauss said archaeologists don’t move at a 21st century pace.\n“They’ve barely started,” he said.",
