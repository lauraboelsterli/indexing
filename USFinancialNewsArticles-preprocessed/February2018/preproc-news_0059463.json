    "text": "Provide Update on Key Benefits of Pending Merger and Comprehensive Evaluation of Strategic Opportunities Leading Up to Definitive Merger Agreement\nBioCryst and Idera Boards of Directors Unanimously Recommend Respective Stockholders Vote “FOR” the Proposed Merger\nRESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. and EXTON, Pa., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:BCRX) (“BioCryst”), and Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDRA) (“Idera”), today filed a joint preliminary proxy statement/prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with the proposed merger, containing detailed information about the merger agreement and the transaction. The companies also today filed an investor presentation with the SEC that provides an update on certain key benefits of the companies’ pending merger.\nAs announced on January 22, 2018, BioCryst and Idera entered into a definitive agreement to combine and form a new enterprise focused on the development and commercialization of medicines to serve more patients suffering from rare diseases.\nHighlights of the presentation, which is available on the Investor Relations section of both companies’ websites, as well as www.sec.gov , include:\nCombination creates a differentiated biotech company focused on innovative rare disease therapies. This is a highly complementary and value-enhancing transaction, combining BioCryst, a developer of oral therapies for life threatening rare diseases and Idera, a rare disease company with strong immune-oncology assets. The combined company will be a unique player in rare diseases, with enhanced scale, a strong competitive position in the marketplace, a robust late-stage pipeline and financial strength and flexibility.\nRobust pipeline with increased opportunities for success. The combination establishes a diversified and innovative late-stage pipeline with two highly attractive Phase 3 rare disease assets and two promising Phase 2 rare disease assets that are expected to create more opportunities for success. Exciting late-stage programs include BCX7353 and IMO-2125, along with a variety of early-stage programs and supporting assets. The combined company’s Phase 3 programs create a financially strong foundation to support a robust, rare disease focused pipeline that is positioned to build greater and more sustainable value for the benefit of stockholders as well as patients with rare diseases beyond what the two companies could achieve alone.\nThe combination brings together two synergistic discovery engines with enhanced development opportunities. Together, BioCryst and Idera will be positioned to leverage both structure-guided small molecule design and nucleic acid / oligonucleotide chemistry within one organization. This will afford the combined company with the opportunity to expand the number of rare disease targets that the companies’ technologies could be applied to and enhance market opportunities through potentially more effective and unique joint small molecule and oligo treatments for rare diseases.\nThe combined company will have increased financial strength and flexibility and meaningful synergy opportunities. The combined company will have a net cash balance of approximately $243 million 1 and expects to realize approximately $20 million in cash synergies in year two and a total of $30 million in annual pre-tax cost synergies in year three after closing. The Company expects synergies to primarily come from consolidating facilities and other expense savings. The combination also creates opportunities to generate near-term sources of non-dilutive capital, which can be more effectively put to work to maximize the portfolio’s market potential and to maximize stockholder value creation.\nBioCryst and Idera undertook robust evaluations of strategic options before announcing the proposed merger. BioCryst and Idera have engaged, well-advised Boards comprised of highly experienced directors with extensive industry knowledge. Both Boards retained leading financial and legal advisors to assist in evaluating strategic options. The BioCryst Board met numerous times over a two-year period to discuss value enhancing opportunities. Throughout the review, the BioCryst Board looked at a number of potential strategic opportunities such as mergers, bolt-on acquisitions and in-licensing transactions. Idera also engaged in discussions with multiple parties regarding potential licensing and collaboration arrangements. Following each company’s discussions with numerous potential partners and in-depth reviews of strategic options, the BioCryst and Idera Boards determined the merger made strategic and financial sense and is a unique opportunity to enhance stockholder value.\nBioCryst and Idera are encouraged by positive commentary from Wall Street analysts. The Companies also highlight in the presentation commentary by Wall Street analysts regarding the value-creation potential and benefits of the combination, including enhanced scale, pipeline diversification, complementary and synergistic discovery platforms and increased financial flexibility.\n1 Unaudited pro-forma cash balance as of December 31, 2017\nThe BioCryst and Idera Boards of Directors unanimously recommend that stockholders of both companies vote “FOR” the proposed merger at their respective Special Meetings of Stockholders. The dates of the meetings have not yet been announced.\nJ.P.

LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Idera and Latham & Watkins, LLP is acting as Idera’s legal counsel.\nBioCryst 2017 Financial Results\nBioCryst separately today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and filed a separate investor presentation related to its financial results.
