    "text": "ST. LOUIS and BALTIMORE, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bandura Systems , which pioneered the threat intelligence gateway (TIG) in part with the U.S. Department of Defense, today announced Chris Fedde will serve as its new CEO. TIGs, stand-alone threat prevention appliances that can process millions more Internet threat indicators than traditional network security enforcement approaches, help protect corporate networks by blocking known threats and offloading traffic from entering or leaving the network and reducing the number of events that need detection and response.\nBandura's new CEO, Chris Fedde\n“Bandura’s technology can now put the power of threat intelligence to work for businesses of every size. Its products’ ability to significantly reduce staff workload, while avoiding incident response expense, is compelling and urgently needed,” said Fedde. “Bandura has that rare distinction of having literally invented an entirely new cybersecurity market segment and I’m excited about the opportunity to keep Bandura at the forefront of this fast-growing market.”\nPreviously Fedde founded and served as president of Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc., which was sold to a firewall vendor owned by Silicon Valley investors. Prior to Hexis, Fedde was President and CEO of SafeNet, Inc. where he led the company to more than $450 million in revenue and established it as one of the largest independent security technology companies in the world. In addition, he initiated and oversaw the growth and sale of several technology companies in the U.S. and globally.\nFedde replaces Bandura Co-Founder and CEO Suzanne Magee, who will now serve as the company’s Chief Evangelist Officer.\n“Bandura quadrupled revenue last year as organizations worldwide adopted TIGs to operationalize threat intelligence,” said Magee. “I’m extremely proud of what the team has accomplished thus far, and equally excited to work with Chris in applying his tremendous security market insight and executive experience to build on this success.”\nMore about Chris Fedde can be found here , while additional insight about the mainstream ascent of threat intelligence gateways can be found in a recent report by Gartner , the world’s leading research and advisory company.\nAbout Bandura Systems\nBandura pioneered the concept of a Threat Intelligence Gateway for the U.S. Department of Defense, and over 50 issued and pending patents later, the company continues to offer the most comprehensive, scalable and granular TIG platform on the market. Organizations worldwide use TIGs for the automation and control needed to operationalize more than a hundred million threat indicators, blocking known threats before they even reach the network firewall.
