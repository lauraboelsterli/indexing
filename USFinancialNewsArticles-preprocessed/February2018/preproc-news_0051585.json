    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aerkomm Inc. (OTCQX: AKOM), a publicly-traded holding company (the \"Company,\" or \"AKOM\" or \"Aerkomm\") whose operating subsidiary, Aircom Pacific, Inc., is developing in-flight entertainment and connectivity, or IFEC, solutions, today announced that it has appointed James J. Busuttil to its Board of Directors.\nDr. Busuttil has served as a member of our Board of Directors since December 2017. Dr. Busuttil is an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of New York State since 1983, as well as numerous U.S. Federal Trial and Appeals Courts, practicing international, financial and corporate law. Dr. Busuttil was elected as a Life Fellow of the U.K.-based Institute of Directors (IoD). Members are invited to become Fellows of the IoD based on their substantial and sustained experience and contribution to business. Fellows are required to have been a company director for at least five years and, at some point during this period, the entity must have had an annual turnover or budget that exceeds Â£10m. Dr. Busuttil has represented banks and financial institutions based in the United States and other countries in private sector financing of domestic and international projects, negotiated alternative energy project financings, handled transnational mergers and joint ventures, represented equity investors in venture capital transactions and organized investment funds. In addition, Dr. Busuttil represented the Bank Advisory Group for a major Latin American debtor nation in sovereign debt restructuring and handled a variety of private sector Latin American debt restructures. Dr. Busuttil has been a Member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) since 2007. The PCA is the oldest international tribunal in the world established by the 1907 Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. Membership of the PCA is strictly by nomination of contracting states of individuals of known competency in questions of international law, of the highest moral reputation, and disposed to accept the duties of Arbitrator. Dr. Busuttil is also a Member of the London Court of International Arbitration Users' Council. With respect to arbitration, Dr. Busuttil has been involved mainly in investment disputes. Dr. Busuttil created the University of London's Postgraduate Laws Program. Dr. Busuttil directed the University of London's Master of Laws (LL.M.), Postgraduate Diploma in Laws (PG Dip. Laws) and the Postgraduate Certificate in Laws (PG Cert. Laws) from January 2004 to January 2015. Under Dr. Busuttil's leadership, the Program grew to over 3,000 persons from more than 150 countries. Dr. Busuttil was appointed as an Honorary Professor at the Faculty of Law of University College London (UCL) in 2004. Dr. Busuttil has been a member of the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs, of the Council on Foreign Relations, and of the Executive Council of the American Society of International Law. In the course of work, Dr. Busuttil has developed experience and understanding in dealing with parties and organizations, including the private and public sectors, in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Russia, North Africa and Australia.\nAbout Aerkomm Inc.\nAerkomm Inc. is a development stage service provider of in-flight entertainment and connectivity with advanced technologies and a unique business model.
