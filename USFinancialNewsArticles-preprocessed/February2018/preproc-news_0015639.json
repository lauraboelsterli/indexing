For the fourth quarter, Navios Acquisition reported revenue of $50.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $20.0 million. For the full year of 2017, Navios Acquisition reported revenue of $227.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $107.7 million. We also declared a quarterly distribution of $0.02 per share for the fourth quarter. This dividend represents an annualized distribution of $0.08 per share and a yield of approximately 10% based on the current market price of NNA.”\nAngeliki Frangou continued, “This dividend is accompanied by a new $25.0 million stock repurchase program. We believe this program is a particularly effective and tax efficient method for returning capital to shareholders at a time when Navios Acquisition’s shares are trading below the company’s net asset value as estimated by our analysts. As fellow shareholders, we are personally affected by these actions, and thus share our belief that by so reinstituting a stock repurchase program we are progressing the best long-term interests of shareholders.“\nHIGHLIGHTS — RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nStock Repurchase Authorization\nThe Board of Directors of Navios Acquisition has authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $25.0 million of Navios Acquisition's common stock, for two years. Stock repurchases will be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made pursuant to a program adopted under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The program does not require any minimum repurchase or any specific number or amount of shares of common stock and may be suspended or reinstated at any time in Navios Acquisition's discretion and without notice. The Board of Directors will review the program periodically. Repurchases will be subject to restrictions under Navios Acquisition’s credit facilities and indenture.\nDividend of $0.02 per share of common stock\nOn January 26, 2018, the Board of Directors of Navios Acquisition declared a quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.02 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on March 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2018. The declaration and payment of any further dividends remain subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, Navios Acquisition’s cash requirements as measured by market opportunities and restrictions under its credit agreements and other debt obligations and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem advisable.\nRefinancing Credit facility\nNavios Acquisition is in advanced discussions for re-financing its credit facility of four product tankers, which matures in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. The re- financing, under the form of a leasing structure, has a term of six years, a repayment profile of 12 years and bears interest at LIBOR plus 305 bps per annum. No assurances can be provided that Navios Acquisition will successfully refinance this credit facility.\nCash inflow of $55.1 million from early repayment of loan granted to Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. (“Navios Holdings”)\nOn November 3, 2017, Navios Holdings prepaid in full the outstanding amount under its secured facility of up to $70.0 million, with a payment of $55.1 million. The prepayment amount consisted of the $50.0 million drawn under the facility and $5.1 million of accrued interest.\nTime charter coverage\nNavios Acquisition currently owns 36 vessels, of which eight are VLCCs, 26 are product tankers and two are chemical tankers.\nCurrently, Navios Acquisition had contracted 60.2% of its available days on a charter-out basis for 2018, which is expected to generate revenues of approximately $86.4 million for 2018. The average contractual net daily charter-out rate for the 46.3% of the available days that are contracted on base rate and /or on base rate with profit sharing is expected to be $14,184 for 2018.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the following results and the selected financial data presented herein, Navios Acquisition has compiled its consolidated statements of operations for the three month periods and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The decrease was mainly attributable to a: (i) decrease in the market rates during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016; and (ii) decrease in revenue by $0.7 million due to the sale of two chemical tankers in the fourth quarter of 2016. Available days of the fleet decreased to 3,225 days for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 3,343 days for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. The time charter equivalent rate, or TCE Rate, decreased to $15,299 for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, from $19,683 for the three month period ended December 31, 2016.\nNet loss for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $12.0 million net loss as compared to $18.1 million net income for the same period of 2016. The decrease was due to a: (a) $20.2 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA; (b) $9.5 million gain on sale of vessels incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016; (c) $0.5 million increase in direct vessel expenses; and (d) $0.4 million gain on debt repayment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016; partially mitigated by a $0.4 million increase in interest income.\nAdjusted EBITDA, affected by the items described in the table above, decreased by approximately $20.2 million to $20.0 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $40.1 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was mainly due to a: (a) $16.9 million decrease in revenue, as described above; (b) $4.7 million increase in time charter expenses mainly due to the accrued backstop commitment to Navios Midstream; (c) $0.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses, partially mitigated by a: (i) $0.6 million decrease in other expense, net; (ii) $0.3 million decrease in management fees, mainly due to the sale of two chemical tankers in the fourth quarter of 2016, as discussed above; (iii) $0.9 million increase in equity in net earnings of affiliated companies; and (iv) $0.1 million increase in other income (excluding the $0.4 million gain on debt repayment incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016).\nYears ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $63.0 million, or 21.7%, to $227.3 million, as compared to $290.2 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to a: (i) decrease in the market rates during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016; and (ii) decrease in revenue by $10.8 million due to the sale of one MR2 product tanker in January 2016 and two chemical tankers in the fourth quarter of 2016. Available days of the fleet decreased to 12,904 days for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 13,753 days for the year ended December 31, 2016. The TCE Rate decreased to $17,186 for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $20,742 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $78.9 million as compared to $62.9 million net income for the same period of 2016. Net loss was affected by the items described in the table above. Adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $71.5 million to $19.4 million net loss as compared to $52.1 million net income for the same period of 2016. The decrease was due to a: (a) $75.6 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA; (b) $1.4 million increase in amortization of dry dock and special survey costs included in direct vessel expenses; and (c) $0.5 million increase in interest expense and finance cost; partially mitigated by a: (i) $5.3 million increase in interest income; and (ii) $0.7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization, due to the sale of one MR product tanker and two chemical tankers in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, affected by the items described in the table above, decreased by approximately $75.6 million to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $183.3 million for the same period of 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was mainly due to a: (a) $63.0 million decrease in revenue, as described above; (b) $16.9 million increase in time charter expenses mainly due to the $16.4 million accrued backstop commitment to Navios Midstream; and (c) $3.1 million decrease in equity/ (loss) in net earnings of affiliated companies, (excluding the $59.1 million of non-cash impairment loss on equity investment in Navios Midstream), partially mitigated by a: (i) $2.3 million decrease in general and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation); (ii) $2.9 million decrease in management fees, mainly due to the sale of one MR2 product tanker in January 2016 and two chemical tankers in the fourth quarter of 2016; (iii) $1.4 million decrease in other expense; and (iv) $0.7 million decrease in direct vessel expenses (excluding amortization of dry dock and special survey costs).\nFleet Employment Profile\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators of the performance of Navios Acquisition and its core fleet for the three month periods ended and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThree month period ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n(unaudited) 2016\n(unaudited) 2017\n(unaudited) 2016\n(unaudited) FLEET DATA Available days (1) 3,225 3,343 12,904 13,753 Operating days (2) 3,183 3,328 12,843 13,716 Fleet utilization (3) 98.7 % 99.5 % 99.5 % 99.7 % Vessels operating at period end 36 36 36 36 AVERAGE DAILY RESULTS Time charter equivalent rate per day (4) $ 15,299 $ 19,683 $ 17,186 $ 20,742 Navios Acquisition believes that the important measures for analyzing trends in its results of operations consist of the following:\n(1 ) Available days: Available days for the fleet are total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Acquisition’s possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydocking or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues. (2 ) Operating days : Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues. (3 ) Fleet utilization: Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Acquisition’s vessels were available for generating revenue, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company’s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs, dry dockings or special surveys. (4 ) TCE Rate: Time charter equivalent rate per day is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during the period. The TCE Rate per day is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to present the actual daily earnings generated by vessels of various types of charter contracts for the number of available days of the fleet.

Financial Measures\nEBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and should not be used in isolation or as substitution for Navios Acquisition’s results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\nEBITDA represents net (loss)/income before interest and finance costs, before depreciation and amortization and before income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA in this document represents EBITDA excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation, gain on sale of vessels, gain/ (loss) on debt repayment and other- than- temporary- impairment loss on equity investment, as described under “Financial Highlights”. Adjusted net (loss)/ income and Adjusted (loss)/ income per share (basic) represent Net (loss)/ income and (loss)/ income per share (basic), excluding certain items as described under “Financial Highlights”. We use Adjusted EBITDA as liquidity measure and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by/ (used in) operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA in this document is calculated as follows: net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of: (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets; (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities; (iii) net interest cost; (iv) amortization of deferred finance costs and other related expenses; (v) equity in net earnings of affiliated companies, net of dividends received; (vi) payments for dry dock and special survey costs; (vii) impairment charges; (viii) gain/ loss on sale of assets; (ix) gain/ (loss) on debt repayment; and (x) stock- based compensation. Navios Acquisition believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are each the basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and present useful information to investors regarding Navios Acquisition’s ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and pay dividends. Navios Acquisition also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used: (i) by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Acquisition’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Acquisition’s performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nEXHIBIT III Vessels Type Year Built/Delivery DWT Date Owned Vessels Nave Polaris Chemical Tanker 2011 25,145 Nave Cosmos Chemical Tanker 2010 25,130 Nave Velocity MR2 Product Tanker 2015 49,999 Nave Sextans MR2 Product Tanker 2015 49,999 Nave Pyxis MR2 Product Tanker 2014 49,998 Nave Luminosity MR2 Product Tanker 2014 49,999 Nave Jupiter MR2 Product Tanker 2014 49,999 Bougainville MR2 Product Tanker 2013 50,626 Nave Alderamin MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,998 Nave Bellatrix MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,999 Nave Capella MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,995 Nave Orion MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,999 Nave Titan MR2 Product Tanker 2013 49,999 Nave Aquila MR2 Product Tanker 2012 49,991 Nave Atria MR2 Product Tanker 2012 49,992 Nave Orbit MR2 Product Tanker 2009 50,470 Nave Equator MR2 Product Tanker 2009 50,542 Nave Equinox MR2 Product Tanker 2007 50,922 Nave Pulsar MR2 Product Tanker 2007 50,922 Nave Dorado MR2 Product Tanker 2005 47,999 Nave Atropos LR1 Product Tanker 2013 74,695 Nave Rigel LR1 Product Tanker 2013 74,673 Nave Cassiopeia LR1 Product Tanker 2012 74,711 Nave Cetus LR1 Product Tanker 2012 74,581 Nave Estella LR1 Product Tanker 2012 75,000 Nave Andromeda LR1 Product Tanker 2011 75,000 Nave Ariadne LR1 Product Tanker 2007 74,671 Nave Cielo LR1 Product Tanker 2007 74,671 Nave Buena Suerte VLCC 2011 297,491 Nave Quasar VLCC 2010 297,376 Nave Synergy VLCC 2010 299,973 Nave Galactic VLCC 2009 297,168 Nave Spherical VLCC 2009 297,188 Nave Photon VLCC 2008 297,395 Nave Neutrino VLCC 2003 298,287 Nave Electron VLCC 2002 305,178\nSource:Navios Maritime Acquisition",
