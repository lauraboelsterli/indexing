The first dividend will be paid on March 21, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2018.\n\"The decision by the board to initiate a dividend represents a meaningful milestone in our history and demonstrates confidence in our strong operating performance, significant free cash flow generation and positive long-term financial outlook,\" said Boris Elisman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACCO Brands. \"The addition of quarterly dividends underscores our commitment to bring value to our shareholders. This complements continued investments in our brands and product innovation, share repurchases and acquisitions,\" he added.\nThe company also announced that its board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock.
