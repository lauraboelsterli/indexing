The exodus of ad dollars has resulted in job cuts across the sector.\nThe company, a third of which is owned by diversified investment firm Seven Group, reaffirmed its expected earnings before interest and tax for the fiscal year 2018, while raising its cost cutting target by 19 percent to A$125 million across the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years.
