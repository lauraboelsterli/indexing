EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nAdjusted Earnings\nReported diluted earnings per share were $1.98 and $3.77 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 versus $0.55 and $1.78 for the comparable 2016 periods. During the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and benefits that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (net income – Republic) and diluted earnings per share.

We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period.

Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nPurchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the adjusted free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures.

As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a dividend payable of $114.4 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2018, which was paid on January 16, 2018.\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 4.4 million shares of our stock for $287.9 million at a weighted average cost per share of $65.55.
