    "text": " 38 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Britain still wants Brexit implementation phase of around two years: source Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Britain still wants an implementation phase with the European Union of around two years, a government source said on Wednesday, saying there was no change in the government’s Brexit policy. The EU has said it wants the transition phase after Brexit to end no later than Dec. 31, 2020, which would coincide with the end of the EU’s current seven-year budget period. “The EU wants a transition of 21 months, we want a period of around 24 months,” the source said, adding that Prime Minister Theresa May has previously ruled out the implementation phase dragging on beyond the around two-year period.
