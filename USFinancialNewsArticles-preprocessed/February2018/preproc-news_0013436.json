    "text": "13 Hours Ago | 05:53 \nDiscussions on a structure for a potential tie up with plane maker Boeing are ongoing, Embraer's commercial aviation chief executive said on Wednesday. \nSpeaking to CNBC at the Singapore Airshow, John Slattery said there is no offer yet, but the company had made submissions to the securities exchange in Brazil about the discussions that are taking place between the two companies and the Brazilian government. \n\"What I can confirm is Embraer has not received an offer as yet that we can review. Right now, the team is focusing on figuring out if there is a process, a structure that might work,\" Slattery said. \nHe added that he hopes to have 'visibility' on the matter in the near to medium term, but declined to reveal the transaction value. \nNews broke earlier that Boeing was in talks with Embraer — the world's third-largest plane maker — for a 80 to 90 percent stake in   business. \nThe Brazilian government holds a so-called golden share in Embraer, giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in its controlling interest. \nSlattery said that a deal with Boeing now would make Embraer more productive. \n\"It probably would end up with Embraer being more productive in the market place, and selling more aircraft. We have the ability to broaden our reach,\"he said. Mustafa Yalcin | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images Crew members cover windows of Embraer E190-E2 during the 52nd International Paris Air Show at the Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France on June 20, 2017. \nSlattery called Embraer's E-Jet E2 — its series of medium-range twin-engine jet airliners — a \"profit hunter,\" and wants to deliver that aircraft to more airlines in Asia. \nHe touted the E2 as being cost efficient, with Embraer bringing down the costs of operating the aircraft, which burns 17 percent less fuel than the company's 190 E1. \nSlattery also described Asia as a \"big target market,\" with a third of the 150-seat market located in this region. \n\"We have 14 operators of E-Jets in the Asian region at the moment. I want to get that to at least 20 operators by 2020. This is a big target market,\" he said.",
