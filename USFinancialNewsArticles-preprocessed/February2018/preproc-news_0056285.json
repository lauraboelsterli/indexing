For me, this opportunity represents a dream come true,” said Lewin. “There is no better place and time to be helping shape the conversation about how computing will impact our world in the years to come.”\nLeveraging 30-plus years of Silicon Valley leadership experience with companies that include Microsoft, NeXT, Apple, and Sony, Lewin has brought financial, corporate, academic, and civic leaders together to advance emerging technology, digital transformation, and sustainability initiatives. His storied career mirrors the technological developments of the early personal computer era, which includes recruitments by Steve Jobs to Apple as director of Education Sales and Marketing and to NeXT as a cofounder and vice president of Sales and Marketing, to present day innovations and ventures, which includes his work in strategic engagement with venture capital and entrepreneurial communities worldwide, technical diplomacy, business development, environmental sustainability, marketing, and civic engagement as a corporate vice president of Microsoft.\nDuring his 17-year tenure at Microsoft, Lewin created groundbreaking initiatives to bring technology awareness and solutions to individuals, businesses, and organizations worldwide. He led Microsoft’s 2016 US presidential campaign technology engagement, IoT public/private partnership development, and artificial intelligence “AI for Earth” initiative, while establishing the company’s overall Civic Tech initiative.\n“Building on its success over the last 20 years, the Museum is undergoing exciting growth of its activities in software, education, and entrepreneurship,” said CHM board chair Len Shustek. “Dan’l is a well-connected industry veteran who understands how computing is changing, and we are delighted that he will be leading our expansion.”\nHaving served on over a dozen nonprofit boards, Lewin currently serves on the boards of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, UI Labs, and StartX. He is also on the Advisory Council for the Department of Politics at Princeton University. Lewin holds an AB in politics from Princeton University, where he was a War Memorial Trophy Award recipient.\nTo learn more about the Computer History Museum’s new president and chief executive officer Dan’l Lewin, read his profile, “Changing Lanes,” on the Museum’s blog .\nAbout the Computer History Museum\nThe Computer History Museum (CHM) in Mountain View, California, is a nonprofit organization with a four-decade history as the world’s leading institution exploring the history of computing and its ongoing impact on society.
