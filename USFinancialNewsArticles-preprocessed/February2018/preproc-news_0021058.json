    "text": "(Reuters) - A former U.S. Olympic swimmer accused a former coach of the national team of sexually abusing her when she was 16, joining a chorus of young athletes in gymnastics and other sports who have come forward with similar allegations involving team officials. \nAriana Kukors, who represented the United States in the 2012 Olympic Games, said Sean Hutchison, then a coach for USA Swimming’s national team, began “grooming” her for a sexual relationship when she was 13. \n“I’ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. \nHutchison could not be reached for comment. \nHis swimming club, the King Aquatic Club, did not respond to requests for comment. Kukors said she first met Hutchison at the club, near Seattle, Washington. \nInvestigators from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have executed a search warrant at Hutchison’s Seattle home, according to Kukors’ statement and media reports. The department did not respond to questions. \nAthletes have denounced U.S. Olympic officials in recent weeks as reacting too slowly to reports of sexual abuse. The criticism grew from the emotionally charged sentencing hearings for Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty to sexual abuse. \nNearly 200 women testified in televised hearings about being molested by Nassar, who was sentenced to decades in prison. Many of them also castigated sports officials as turning a blind eye. The U.S. Olympic Committee has hired a law firm to investigate. \nKukors echoed this complaint. \n“Much like the USOC knew about Larry Nassar years before his arrest and did nothing, USA Swimming had notice in 2010 that Sean Hutchison was involved in an inappropriate coach-athlete relationship with Ariana and took no actions to protect her or other swimmers,” her lawyer Robert Allard said in a statement. \nUSA Swimming said in a statement it investigated in 2010 a report that Hutchison and Kukors had a sexual relationship in breach of the organization’s code of conduct. Both denied a relationship at the time, and the case was closed. \nThe governing body said it first learned of the allegations of sexual abuse while Kukors was a minor for the first time when she went public this week. The group supported Kukors and was helping the investigation. \n“We stand by her, and all other victims, in their quest to break their silence and confront their horrific experiences,” the statement said. \nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York\n ",
