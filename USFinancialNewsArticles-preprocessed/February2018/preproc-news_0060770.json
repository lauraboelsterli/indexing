REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo “The whole modernization process will have to go on over years in Germany - and many, many other countries too. That is what we are debating.” A German defense ministry report earlier this week found that less than half of submarines, warplanes and some key weapons were ready for use. [nL8N1QH61Y] Asked about German media reports on a cyber attack launched by Russian hacker group APT28, von der Leyen declined to comment. [nB4N1N902H] The reports said the group, which had already attacked the German parliament in 2015, managed to steal data from the foreign and defense ministries in the latest hack. Germany has confirmed it is investigating a cyber attack that affected government computer networks, but said the incident had been brought under control.
