Excellent truck brokerage execution. Robust sales pipeline at Hub Group Dedicated.\nHighlights of the year\nRecord revenue of over $4 billion. Acquired Estenson Logistics, doing business as Hub Group Dedicated, on July 1 st , allowing us to expand our multimodal solutions. Record number of customer carrier of the year awards. Continued investment in our technology transformation.\nOAK BROOK, Ill., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HUBG) announced fourth quarter 2017 net income of $100 million, or diluted earnings per share of $2.99 versus fourth quarter 2016 net income of $18.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share. The fourth quarter includes a $75.2 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, decrease in income taxes resulting from our estimate of the change to our deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 caused by the reduction of the federal tax rate as part of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nRevenue for the current quarter was $1.163 billion, a record for Hub, compared with $978.6 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Hub segment revenue increased 20% and Mode segment revenue increased 11%. Operating income for the current quarter increased to $41.1 million versus $30.8 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Hub segment operating income increased 41% and Mode segment operating income increased 3%.\nRevenue for the current year was $4.0 billion, another record for Hub, compared to $3.6 billion for 2016. Hub segment revenue increased 14% and Mode segment revenue increased 8%. Operating income for the current year decreased to $96.6 million versus $123.8 million for 2016. The biggest factor driving the decrease in operating income was a $29 million decline in intermodal gross margin. During most of 2017, intermodal cost increases were much higher than customer price increases. Hub segment operating income decreased 25% and Mode segment operating income decreased 13%.\nSegment Information:\nHub • Fourth quarter 2017 Segment Revenue: $904.3 million, up 20% • Fourth quarter 2017 Segment Operating Income: $34.4 million, up 41% Hub segment revenue increased 20% to $904.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of our success in providing multi-modal solutions to our customers. This increase includes Hub Group Dedicated revenue totaling $57.8 million.\nFourth quarter intermodal revenue increased 8% to $502.7 million reflecting a 2% increase in volume and an increase in fuel revenue and freight rates. Intermodal gross margin increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in freight rates and volume.\nTruck brokerage revenue increased 22% to $159.1 million this quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. Truck brokerage handled 2% more loads while fuel, price and mix combined were up 20%. Truck brokerage gross margin increased primarily because of growth with strategic customers.\nFourth quarter Unyson Logistics revenue increased 19% to $185.4 million due primarily to growth from new customers on-boarded this year. Unyson Logistics gross margin declined primarily due to unfavorable customer mix.\nCosts and expenses increased $6.8 million to $71.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $64.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Salaries and benefits increased $1.2 million due primarily to the additional costs associated with the employees from the Hub Group Dedicated acquisition. In addition, the decrease in bonus expense was partially offset by salary and medical claim increases. General and administrative costs are $3.9 million higher because of the Hub Group Dedicated acquisition and an increase in IT costs and consultant fees. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.7 million primarily as a result of Hub Group Dedicated.\nOperating income was $34.4 million compared to $24.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nMode • Fourth quarter 2017 Segment Revenue: $285.5 million, up 11% • Fourth quarter 2017 Segment Operating Income: $6.7 million, up 3% Mode segment’s revenue increased 11% to $285.5 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Revenue consisted of $139.2 million in intermodal which was up 6%, $92.0 million in truck brokerage which was up 16% and $54.3 million in logistics which was up 20%.\nGross margin increased $0.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to an increase in logistics margin.\nOperating income was $6.7 million compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash Flow and Capitalization:\nOur capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $34.6 million, primarily for transportation equipment including tractors, containers, and trailers and technology investments. At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $28.6 million.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had total debt outstanding of $302.5 million on various debt instruments compared to $174.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in debt is primarily a result of our acquisition of Hub Group Dedicated.\n2018 and Long Term Outlook\nWe expect that our 2018 diluted earnings per share will range from $2.30 to $2.40. We estimate that our 2018 capital expenditures will range from $150 million to $170 million. We estimate our effective tax rate will be approximately 25% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n“Our goal is to continue to provide innovative, value added multimodal solutions by offering reliability, visibility and value to our customers. We will continue to invest in our people, equipment and technology to work towards this goal, while improving productivity and margins. Our 2017 revenue of $4 billion is one significant milestone toward achieving our target of $6 billion in revenue in the next five years. We intend to achieve $6 billion in revenue through organic growth initiatives and acquisitions in both our core business and new service offerings.” said Dave Yeager, Hub’s Chief Executive Officer.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nHub will hold a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 8 th , 2018, to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results.\nHosting the conference call will be Dave Yeager, Chief Executive Officer.
