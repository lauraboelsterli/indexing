    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Huntsman Cancer Foundation has elected Peter R. Huntsman as Chairman of the Board effective immediately. He replaces his father, Jon M. Huntsman, Sr., who founded Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) and was its principal benefactor. Jon M. Huntsman passed away earlier this month.\n\"While I wish the reason for this leadership change had occurred under different, and less personally sad circumstances, I am honored to be able to work with such an able Board of Directors and the dedicated professionals of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation to support the globally recognized and renowned cancer research, clinical care and education and outreach programs of HCI,\" stated Peter Huntsman.\nPeter will also continue to serve as the Foundation's CEO, a position he has held since being appointed in 2015. Susan Sheehan will continue as President and COO. Most recently, the Huntsman Cancer Foundation has led the funding effort to expand research facilities at HCI. The Primary Children's and Families' Cancer Research Center at HCI is designed to sharpen focus on childhood cancers and cancers that run in families. The total cost of the project was $173 million, including financing costs. In October 2017, the Foundation pledged an additional $120 million to HCI.\nIn all, the Huntsman Cancer Foundation enjoys the support of more than 1 million donors, all of whom seek to eradicate this disease. Thanks to generous underwriting support established by gifts from the Jon M. Huntsman family, 100% of donations made by other donors support the lifesaving work of HCI, with no amount used for administrative or fundraising costs.\nHuntsman Cancer Foundation's sole purpose is to support the mission of Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah. HCI is the official cancer center of Utah. The cancer campus includes a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital as well as two buildings dedicated to cancer research. HCI treats patients with all forms of cancer and operates several clinics that focus on patients with a family history of cancer. As the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Mountain West, HCI serves the largest geographic region in the country, drawing patients from Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, and beyond. HCI scientists have identified more genes for inherited cancers than any other center in the world, including genes responsible for breast, ovarian, colon, head, and neck cancers, along with melanoma. HCI manages the Utah Population Database, largest genetic database in the world, with information on more than 9 million people linked to genealogies, health records, and vital statistics. The institute was founded by Jon M. and Karen Huntsman .\nContact:\nSusan Sheehan\nHuntsman Cancer Foundation\n(801) 584-5807\nssheehan@huntsmanfoundation.org\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peter-r-huntsman-named-chairman-of-the-board-huntsman-cancer-foundation-300601334.html\nSOURCE Huntsman Cancer Institute",
