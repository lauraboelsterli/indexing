    "text": "MP MENASHE, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Caesarstone Ltd. (NASDAQ:CSTE), a manufacturer of high quality engineered quartz surfaces, today announced the appointment of Mr. Ophir Yakovian as the Company’s new Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Yakovian is expected to join Caesarstone in April 2018.\nRaanan Zilberman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are delighted to welcome Ophir Yakovian, an experienced finance executive, as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. We believe that Mr. Yakovian’s track record with industrial and publicly-traded companies makes him a natural fit for our business and Company culture, a strong leader to the Company’s global finance organization and a significant partner in Caesarstone’s future. On behalf of the Company, I would like to thank Yair Averbuch for his many years of service to the Company as CFO, as he was an important contributor to our global growth and the development of our market leadership position.”\nMr. Yakovian brings nearly 20 years of experience in various financial roles, most recently serving as CFO of Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI) and prior to that as CFO of Tnuva Group, Israel’s largest food manufacturer. Prior to Tnuva Group, Mr. Yakovian served as the CFO of Lumenis Ltd. (previously NASDAQ:LMNS), a global leader in the field of minimally-invasive clinical solutions. Prior to that, Mr. Yakovian served as VP Finance of Verint Systems (NASDAQ:VRNT). He holds a bachelor’s degree in economics and accounting and a master’s degree in business economics from Bar Ilan University, Israel, and is a Certified Public Accountant.\nMr. Yakovian commented, “I am excited to join Caesarstone at a time where the Company is so well-positioned in a growing and evolving industry. The team has laid a solid foundation for Caesarstone to move forward, and I am eager to be a part of those efforts and to help take the Company through its next stage of growth.”\nMr. Averbuch will remain with the Company to ensure a smooth transition.\nAbout Caesarstone\nCaesarstone manufactures high quality engineered quartz surfaces, which are used in both residential and commercial buildings as countertops, vanities, wall cladding, floors and other interior surfaces.
