Baccile, First Industrial's president and CEO. \"Our results reflect the high quality of our portfolio and the underlying fundamental strength of the industrial market. We made significant investments in additive acquisitions and replenished our development pipeline with attractive new investments that will contribute to driving long-term cash flow growth and value for shareholders.\"\nPortfolio Performance â€“ Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017\nIn service occupancy was 97.3% at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 97.2% at the end of the third quarter of 2017, and 96.0% at the end of 2016.

The facility matures on October 29, 2021, has a one-year extension option and is expandable to $1 billion, subject to certain conditions. The agreement provides for interest-only payments currently at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 110 basis points based on the Company's current leverage ratio and are subject to adjustment based on the Company's leverage or credit ratings. Refinanced two unsecured loans totaling $460 million. The first is a $200 million unsecured term loan with a maturity date of January 29, 2021. The loan features interest-only payments currently at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points, a 50 basis point improvement in the credit spread from the prior rate. The second is a $260 million unsecured term loan with a maturity date of September 11, 2022. This loan features interest-only payments currently at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points, a 40 basis point improvement in the credit spread from the prior rate. Rates on both loans are subject to adjustments based on the Company's leverage or credit ratings.\nIn the first quarter of 2018 to date, the Company:\nClosed on a private placement offering on February 15 th for $300 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 3.91%. The notes are comprised of two tranches: $150 million of 3.86% Series C Guaranteed Senior Notes with a 10-year term and $150 million of 3.96% Series D Guaranteed Senior Notes with a 12-year term.\n\"In 2017, we returned to the unsecured debt markets with the benefit of our strong balance sheet metrics and improved credit ratings,\" said Scott Musil, chief financial officer. \"We have significant capital capacity and flexibility that supports our pursuit of profitable investment opportunities, given our low leverage and ability to redeploy retained cash flow and proceeds from select asset sales.\"\nInvestment and Disposition Activities\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company:\nStarted development of First Nandina Logistics Center, a 1.4 million square-foot facility in Southern California in the Inland Empire East with an estimated total investment of $89.3 million. Commenced development of First 290 @ Guhn Road, a 126,000 square-foot facility in Houston with an estimated investment of $9.1 million. Acquired an 86,000 square-foot building in Orlando for $8.2 million and a 100,000 square-foot building in Chicago for $7.0 million. Sold 30 buildings comprising 2.8 million square feet plus one land parcel for a total of $136.9 million.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company:\nPlaced in service one development in Phoenix in the second quarter, 100% leased, totaling 618,000 square feet with an estimated total investment of $45.4 million. Acquired eight buildings totaling 1.1 million square feet for $112.0 million. Acquired seven land parcels for a total investment of $62.2 million. Sold 60 buildings totaling 4.6 million square feet and one land parcel for a total of $236.1 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2018 to date, the Company:\nCompleted a long-term lease renewal for its 1.3 million square-foot facility in Eastern Pennsylvania. Leased 100% of its First Sycamore 215 Logistics Center, a 243,000 square-foot development in Southern California. Acquired a 35,000 square-foot, 100% leased building in Seattle for $5.6 million and also acquired a development site in Dallas for $10 million which can accommodate four buildings totaling 727,000 square feet.\n\"In 2017, we used our platform to advance our portfolio management goals by further allocating capital to value-creating developments and acquisitions,\" said Johannson Yap, chief investment officer. \"This included redeploying $236 million of proceeds from targeted sales into assets with stronger long-term cash flow growth profiles.\"\nRestructuring and Related Charge\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company restructured its staffing to align its personnel with changes in its portfolio resulting from its capital allocation strategy. The severance and other costs related to the restructuring will result in a charge of approximately $0.01 per share in 2018.\nOutlook for 2018\nMr. Baccile stated, \"In 2018, our focus continues to be on driving incremental cash flow from leasing within our portfolio and our development investments. The supply and demand picture in the industrial real estate sector remains favorable, supporting further market rent growth and growth in cash rents within our portfolio. Our 2018 guidance reflects the temporary dilutive impact of approximately $0.03 per share related to 2017 sales volume that exceeded our target sales range. We are excited about the long-term potential cash flow growth from our redeployment opportunities.\"\nLow End of\nHigh End of\nGuidance for 2018\nGuidance for 2018\n(Per share/unit)\n(Per share/unit)\nNet Income Available to Common Stockholders\n0.61\n0.71\nAdd: Real Estate Depreciation/Amortization\n0.93\n0.93\nFFO (NAREIT Definition)\n$1.54\n$1.64\nPlus: Restructuring Charge\n$0.01\n$0.01\nFFO Before Restructuring Charge\n$1.55\n$1.65\nThe following assumptions were used:\nAverage quarter-end in service occupancy of 96.5% to 97.5%. Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3.5% to 5.0% for the full year. 2018 guidance includes the dilutive impact of approximately $0.03 cents per share related to 2017 property sales that exceeded the Company's targeted sales volume range. General and administrative expense of approximately $26 million to $27 million. The aforementioned restructuring charge of $0.01 per share is excluded from the general and administrative expense guidance range. Guidance includes the incremental costs expected in 2018 related to the Company's developments completed and under construction as of December 31, 2017. In total, the Company expects to capitalize $0.04 per share of interest related to these projects in 2018. Guidance reflects the issuance of $300 million of unsecured notes in the private placement at a weighted average interest rate of 3.91% discussed above and the planned payoff of $157.8 million of secured debt maturities at a weighted average interest rate of 4.50% on or about March 1, 2018. Other than the above, guidance does not include the impact of: any other future debt repurchases prior to maturity or future debt issuances, any future investments or property sales, any future NAREIT-compliant gains or losses, any future impairment gains or losses, any future gains related to the final settlement of two insurance claims for damaged facilities previously disclosed, or any future equity issuance.\nA number of factors could impact our ability to deliver results in line with our assumptions, such as interest rates, the economy, the supply and demand of industrial real estate, the availability and terms of financing to potential acquirers of real estate, the timing and yields for divestment and investment, and numerous other variables. There can be no assurance that First Industrial can achieve such results.\nConference Call\nFirst Industrial will host its quarterly conference call on Thursday, February 22, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. EST (10:00 a.m. CST).

NAREIT recommends that REITs define FFO as net income, excluding gains (or losses) from the sale of previously depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, excluding impairments from previously depreciated assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nAbout First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.\nFirst Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.

Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. We anticipate that our acquisitions of real estate in the future will generally not meet the definition of a business combination; and accordingly, transaction costs which have historically been expensed, will be capitalized as part of the basis of the real estate assets acquired. ASU 2017-01 was applied prospectively.\nb) Investors in, and analysts following, the real estate industry utilize funds from operations (\"FFO\"), net operating income (\"NOI\"), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), variously defined below, as supplemental performance measures. While we believe net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate measure, we consider FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, given their wide use by, and relevance to investors and analysts, appropriate supplemental performance measures. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. NOI provides a measure of rental operations, and does not factor in depreciation and amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to incur and service debt and to fund dividends and other cash needs. AFFO provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to fund dividends. In addition, FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples/yields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position, performance and value.\nAs used herein, we calculate FFO to be equal to net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, plus depreciation and other amortization of real estate, minus gain on sale of depreciable real estate.\nNOI is defined as our revenues, minus property expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management, utilities, insurance and other expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as NOI, minus general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs.\nAFFO is defined as adjusted EBITDA minus GAAP interest expense, minus capitalized interest and overhead, plus amortization of debt (premiums)/discounts and hedge costs, minus straight-line rental income, amortization of above (below) market leases and lease inducements, minus provision for income taxes or plus benefit for income taxes, plus restricted stock/unit amortization, minus non-incremental capital expenditures. Non-incremental capital expenditures refer to building improvements and leasing costs required to maintain current revenues plus tenant improvements amortized back to the tenant over the lease term. Excluded are first generation leasing costs, capital expenditures underwritten at acquisition and development/redevelopment costs.\nFFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, including the repayment of principal on debt and payment of dividends and distributions. FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO should not be considered as substitutes for net income available to common stockholders and participating securities (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of results of operations or cash flows (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as currently calculated by us may not be comparable to similarly titled, but variously calculated, measures of other REITs.\nIn addition, we consider cash-basis same store NOI (\"SS NOI\") to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Same store properties include all properties owned prior to January 1, 2016 and held as an in service property through the end of the current reporting period, and developments and redevelopments that were placed in service or were substantially completed for 12 months prior to January 1, 2016 (the \"Same Store Pool\"). Properties which are at least 75% occupied at acquisition are placed in service, unless we anticipate the tenants to move out in the first year of ownership. Acquisitions that are less than 75% occupied at the date of acquisition, developments and redevelopments are placed in service as they reach the earlier of a) stabilized occupancy (generally defined as 90% occupied), or b) one year subsequent to acquisition or development/redevelopment construction completion. Acquired properties with occupancy greater than 75% at acquisition, but with tenants that we anticipate will move out in the first year of ownership, will be placed in service upon the earlier of reaching 90% occupancy or twelve months after move out. We define SS NOI as NOI, less NOI of properties not in the Same Store Pool, less the impact of straight-line rent, the amortization of lease inducements, the amortization of above (below) market rent and the impact of lease termination fees. We exclude straight-line rent, amortization of lease inducements and above (below) market rent in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, acquisition costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit and expense, gains and losses on retirement of debt, mark-to-market gains and losses on interest rate protection agreements, sale of real estate, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-industrial-realty-trust-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300602357.html\nSOURCE First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.",
