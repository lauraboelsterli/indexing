    "text": "Palantir investor Ken Langone doesn't know when the company will go public, and he's not sure he ever wants them to.\n\"I don't know and frankly if I had my druthers I would wish they wouldn't,\" the Home Depot co-founder told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Wednesday.\n\"What they do, and they way they do it and their mindset on the future, I don't know if the public could accommodate that,\" he said.\nThe company — founded in 2004 by a group that includes PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel — analyzes vast amounts of data for clients like the CIA, FBI and Department of Defense.\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC public market investors would be \"positively surprised\" when the company — once valued at $20 billion — eventually discloses its financials. \nWhile some wonder about what kind of information the company would have to disclose about its sensitive government contracts if it went public, Langone said he doesn't think that would be a problem.\nLangone first invested in Palantir \"five or six years ago,\" he said. \n--CNBC's Josh Lipton contributed to this report.",
