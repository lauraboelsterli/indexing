    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 11:43 PM / Updated 3 minutes ago Stocks pummeled as inflation shadow spooks bonds Wayne Cole 5 Min Read \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares fell the most in over a year on Monday as fears of resurgent inflation battered bonds, toppled Wall Street from record highs and sparked speculation that central banks globally might be forced to tighten policy more aggressively. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS shed 1.7 percent in the largest daily drop since late 2016. \nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 ESc1 fell another 0.3 percent, an unusually sharp move for Asian hours and suggesting further losses in U.S. markets later in the session. \nDow futures 1YMc1 slipped 0.6 percent while FTSE futures FFIc1 lost 1 percent. \nAsian markets was covered in a sea of red, with every single bourse stumbling. Japan's Nikkei .N225 sank 2.6 percent, while Australia's main index lost 1.6 percent and Chinese blue chips .CSI300 slid 0.7 percent. \nInvestors were spooked by Friday’s U.S. payrolls report which showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than 8-1/2 years and fuelling inflation expectations USIL5YF5Y=R. \nFutures markets <0#FF:> reacted by pricing in the risk of three, or even more, interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve this year. \n“The earnings data fits too closely with the narrative of emerging wage pressures to be dismissed,” said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin. \n“The data will add fuel to the debate on whether the Fed is falling behind the curve. It will raise the chances of the Fed median dots shifting up to four rate hikes for 2018,” he added. \nThat would be negative for emerging markets and commodity currencies, said Ruskin. Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell sharply in the wake of the job numbers, along with a range of Asian currencies. \nIt was also a major blow to government bonds. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury paper US10YT=RR were up at a four-year peak of 2.86 percent, having jumped almost 7 basis points on Friday. \nThe 2-year yield US2YT=RR was near a nine-year top at 2.162 percent, tightening financial conditions and offering a more competitive return compared to equities. The dividend return of the Dow, for instance, was 2.13 percent. PRICED FOR PERFECTION \nWall Street had already been flashing expensive by many historical measures and sold off in reaction. \n“It has to be remembered that U.S. shares were priced for perfection at around 19 times earnings,” said Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, noting the historic average is around 15 times. \n“Still, U.S. companies have produced stellar earnings over the reporting period. So it is understandable that some ‘irrational exuberance’ would emerge.” \nWith half of the S&P 500 companies having reported, 78 percent have beaten expectations against an average 64 percent. \nChris Weston, chief market strategist at broker IG, noted the sudden spike in volatility caused some rules-based funds to automatically dump stock as their models required. \n“There is talk that volatility targeting annuity funds could have to sell a further $30 billion of stock this week and another $40 billion should realized volatility not retreat lower,” he warned. \nThe lift in U.S. yields provided some initial support to the dollar after a rocky start to the year, though it was starting to lose altitude again in Asian trade. \nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was down a fraction at 89.154 .DXY having climbed 0.6 percent on Friday for its biggest single day gain in three months. \nThe dollar backed off to 109.95 yen JPY= from an early 110.29, while the euro was barely changed at $1.2457 EUR= . \nAny rally in the U.S. dollar is considered a negative for commodities priced in the currency, with the Thomson Reuters CRB index .TRCCRB down 0.5 percent. Gold XAU= was off a touch at $1,330.47 an ounce after losing 1 percent on Friday. \nIn oil markets, U.S. crude CLc1 fell 66 cents to $64.79 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 lost 71 cents to $67.87.
