    "text": "0 COMMENTS Snap Inc. SNAP 1.05% is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Tuesday. Here are the key points to watch:\nEARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by FactSet expect Snap to post a loss of $409.4 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a loss of $169.9 million a year ago.\nREVENUE FORECAST: Snap is expected to record about $254.8 million in fourth-quarter revenue, up about 54% from the previous year, according to an analysts survey by FactSet.\nWHAT TO WATCH:\nREDESIGN EXECUTION: Snap started overhauling its Snapchat app in November to make it simpler to use, but most users still haven’t seen the new design as expected. Investors will want to know why it is taking so long for Snap to roll out the new features more widely, and what kind of early feedback it has received from users. The hope is that Snapchat will lure new users who may have thought the app was too complicated and that people will interact more with content that contains premium ads.\nUSER GROWTH: Snap is under pressure to demonstrate to investors that it can reignite its user growth, which declined to 2.9% in the third quarter from the year prior. Analysts polled by FactSet estimate user growth in the fourth quarter ticked up slightly to 3.5%, which likely won’t be enough to assuage concerns that the company needs to find new ways of drawing people to its app.\nADVERTISING SALES: Snap conceded on the third quarter’s earnings call that it is struggling with a transition from direct ad sales to an auction-based model, in which advertisers bid on the amount they are willing to spend, the same method used by Facebook and Google. To prove this model can work, Snap needs to attract more advertisers to push up the prices of the ads it can sell. “The transition to programmatic ad selling has taken longer than expected,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a research note.\nLINES OF COMMUNICATION: Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said at a conference in October that when he took Snap public, he underestimated the importance of communicating with the market. Snap so far has communicated relatively little to help investors and analysts predict Snap’s financial results, leading to a wide range of estimates for the company’s performance each quarter. Analysts will be watching to see if Snap offers more specific guidance.",
