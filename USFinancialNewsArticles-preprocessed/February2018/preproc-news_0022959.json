    "text": "MISSION VIEJO, Calif., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nThe Ensign Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:ENSG), the parent company of the Ensign™ group of skilled nursing, rehabilitative care services, home health, home care, hospice care and assisted living companies, today announced its operating results and full year 2017, reporting GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.21 for the quarter and $0.77 for the year with adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 for the quarter and $1.40 for the year (1) .\nHighlights Include :\nGAAP earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per diluted share, and adjusted earnings per share was up 33.3% over the prior year quarter to a record $0.40 per diluted share (1) ;\nConsolidated GAAP Net Income for the quarter was $11.2 million, and consolidated adjusted Net Income was $21.1 million, an increase of 35.4% over the prior year quarter (1) ;\nTransitioning skilled occupancy was 74.7%, an increase of 289 basis points over the prior year quarter and same-store occupancy was 78.7%, an increase of 109 basis points over the prior year quarter;\nTotal Transitional and Skilled Services segment income was $39.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 40.2% over the prior year quarter and an increase of 8.3% sequentially over the third quarter;\nTotal Assisted and Independent Living Services segment revenue was up 13.7% to $35.8 million and segment income was up 66.3% to $4.3 million, both over the prior year quarter; and\nTotal Home Health and Hospice Services segment revenue was up 27.5% to $39.7 million and segment income was up 27.7% to $5.8 million, both over the prior year quarter.\n(1) See \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\".\nOperating Results\n“We are proud to report that the momentum we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as we achieved our highest adjusted earnings per share in our history,” said Ensign’s President and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Christensen. He lauded the local operational and clinical leadership teams and all of their field-based and Service Center partners for continuing their relentless focus on clinical and financial performance while they continued to integrate 116 transitioning and newly acquired operations into the organization. “Even though there were some pockets that need improvement, the ramp we have been expecting in our newer operations is now materializing and making a meaningful contribution to our performance,” he added.\n“We are also pleased to report that our other lines of business quietly continue to build significant value,” Christensen stated. He noted that Bridgestone Living LLC, Ensign’s assisted living and independent living portfolio company, which consists of 51 stand-alone operations and 21 campuses in 12 states, grew its segment revenue and income by 13.7% and 66.3%, respectively, over the prior year quarter. Similarly, he noted that Cornerstone Healthcare, Inc., Ensign’s home health and hospice portfolio subsidiary, grew its segment revenue and income by 27.5% and 27.7%, respectively, over the prior year quarter. Collectively, these two business segments, along with other new healthcare businesses within the portfolio, are quickly approaching the size of Ensign when it completed its initial public offering in 2007.\nPointing to the underlying value being created in Ensign’s owned real estate, Mr. Christensen said, “We continue to methodically add value to our real estate portfolio by improving the operating results in our owned operations and by acquiring additional real estate assets. As an operationally-driven organization, we will continue to focus on solid clinical and financial performance. But we also believe it’s important to recognize the growing underlying value in our owned real estate and the flexibility that ownership gives us in the future,” he said.\nThe Company announced that management is increasing its 2018 annual earnings per share guidance to between $1.80 and $1.87 per diluted share. Mr. Christensen explained that this increase is due to the recent tax reform that reduced the Company’s effective income tax rate from 35.5% to an estimated 25% for 2018. He also noted that the Company intends on using the tax savings to strengthen its balance sheet, to fund growth and to share a portion of the savings with employees. Overall, this adjustment represents a 13.3%, or $0.22 per share, increase from the midpoint of management’s previous annual earnings guidance for 2018. “Even without the tax savings, this guidance represents a significant improvement over 2017 results. We are very excited about the coming year and look forward to continuing to drive quality healthcare outcomes and corresponding financial results,” he said.\nChief Financial Officer Suzanne Snapper reported that, “We recently completed seventeen fixed-rate HUD insured mortgages with a principal amount of $112 million, the proceeds of which were used to reduce the Company’s line of credit.” She added, “We currently have $170 million of availability on Ensign’s $450 million credit facility, which also has a built-in expansion option, and 45 unlevered real estate assets that add additional liquidity.” She also said that she expects the lease-adjusted net-debt-to-EBITDAR ratio, which was 4.2x at quarter end, to decrease in 2018 as the EBITDAR from transitioning and newly acquired operations continues to grow.\nA discussion of the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures is set forth below. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAR and adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share, net income to adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted net income, appear in the financial data portion of this release. More complete information is contained in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today and can be viewed on the company’s website at http://www.ensigngroup.net .\nQuarter Highlights\nDuring the quarter, Ensign announced that Cornerstone Healthcare, Inc., the Company’s home health and hospice portfolio subsidiary, acquired the assets of Excell Home Care and Hospice and Excell Private Care Services in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma effective November 1, 2017. With this acquisition, Cornerstone entered Oklahoma for the first time and now owns twenty home health operations, twenty-two hospice operations, and four home care operations across eleven states.\nOn December 27, 2017, the Company announced that it completed a $112 million portfolio financing with low, fixed-rate loans amortized over 30- or 35-year terms and secured by mortgages on 17 of the 65 properties owned by Ensign subsidiaries. \"These new long-term, fixed-rate borrowings represent an important pillar in our capital structure, providing us liquidity on a portion of the real estate we own during a period of historically-low interest rates,\" said Ms. Snapper. Ms. Snapper confirmed that in addition to paying down previously drawn amounts on Ensign's revolving line of credit, the proceeds of the HUD-insured debt will be used to fund acquisitions, to renovate and upgrade existing and future facilities, to cover working capital needs and for other business purposes.\nOn February 1, 2018, Ensign announced that Bridgestone Living LLC, the Company’s assisted and independent living portfolio company, acquired the real estate and operations of Cedar Hills Senior Living, a 37-unit assisted living facility in Cedar Hill, Texas, and Deer Creek Senior Living, a 37-unit assisted living facility in DeSoto, Texas. \"These two operations complement our growing number of assisted living and skilled nursing operations in the Dallas area,\" Mr. Christensen said. \"The strength of our team of local operational and clinical leaders in the Dallas market provides an excellent foundation from which we can continue to build,\" he added.\nThese additions bring Ensign's growing portfolio to 181 skilled nursing operations, 21 of which also include assisted living operations, 51 assisted and independent living operations, twenty-two hospice agencies, twenty home health agencies and four home care businesses across fifteen states. Ensign owns the real estate at 65 of its 232 healthcare facilities. Mr. Christensen reaffirmed that Ensign continues to actively seek transactions to acquire real estate and to lease both well-performing and struggling skilled nursing, assisted living and other healthcare related businesses in new and existing markets.\nEnsign paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.045 per share of its common stock, an increase of 5.9% over the prior year. This is the fifteenth consecutive year Ensign has increased its dividend, signaling the Company’s continued confidence in its operating model and its ability to return long-term value to shareholders. Ensign has been a dividend-paying company since 2002 and has increased its dividend every year since.\n2018 EPS Guidance Increase, Reaffirms Revenue Guidance\nDue to the recent tax reform that reduced the Company’s effective income tax rate from 35.5% to an estimated 25% for 2018, Management increased its annual earnings per share guidance to $1.80 to $1.87 per diluted share from $1.58 to $1.66 per diluted share. This adjustment represents a 13.3%, or $0.22 per share, increase from the midpoint of management’s previous annual earnings guidance for 2018. Management also announced that it is reaffirming its 2018 revenue guidance of $2.0 billion to $2.06 billion. Management’s guidance assumes, among other things, normalized health insurance costs, anticipated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rate increases net of provider taxes, acquisitions closed to date or anticipated to be closed in the first half of 2018 and the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard under ASC 606. It also excludes transaction-related costs and amortization costs related to intangible assets acquired, share-based compensation, costs incurred to recognize income tax credits and costs incurred for start-up operations.\nConference Call\nA live webcast will be held Friday, February 9, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time (1:00 p.m. Eastern time) to discuss Ensign’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results.

The company believes that the presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDAR, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share provides important supplemental information to management and investors to evaluate the company’s operating performance. The company believes disclosure of adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR has economic substance because the excluded revenues and expenses are infrequent in nature and are variable in nature, or do not represent current revenues or cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of these measures as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted earnings per share for other companies in the company's industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. For further information regarding why the company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, the specific manner in which management uses this measure, and some of the limitations associated with the use of this measure, please refer to the company's periodic filings Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The company’s periodic filings are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or under the \"Financial Information\" link of the Investor Relations section on Ensign’s website at http://www.ensigngroup.net .\nSource:The Ensign Group, Inc.",
