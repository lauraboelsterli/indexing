    "text": "TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:THFF) today announced results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.6 million compared to $8.3 million for the same period of 2016 and diluted net income per common share was $0.21 compared to $0.68 for the same period of 2016. These decreases were primarily driven by the revaluation of the Corporation’s deferred tax assets as a result of the passage in the fourth quarter of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) resulting in a non-cash tax expense of $6.3 million. Excluding the impact of the TCJA, adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, for the fourth quarter would have been $8.9 million.\nThe Corporation further reported net income of $29.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 versus $38.4 million for the comparable period of 2016, which included an after-tax gain on the sale of the Corporation’s insurance subsidiary of $5.8 million. Diluted net income per common share was $2.38 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 versus $3.12 for the comparable period of 2016. Return on assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was .98% compared to 1.30% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The TCJA also reduced 12-month net income by $6.3 million or $0.52 per share. Excluding the impact of the TCJA, a non-GAAP measure, full-year adjusted net income would have been $35.4 million and adjusted earnings per common share would have been $2.90.\nNorman L. Lowery, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with our 2017 performance. During 2017 we continued to experience loan growth, which is driving increased interest income. Similar to others in our industry, our fourth quarter and year end results were negatively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in late December.”\nBook value per share was $33.77 at December 31, 2017 compared to $33.92 at December 31, 2016. Shareholders’ equity was $413.6 million compared to $414.4 million on December 31, 2016. Dividends paid during 2017 totaled $2.50 per share.\nAverage total loans for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.87 billion, an increase of $44.1 million or 2.41%, versus the $1.83 billion for the comparable period in 2016. Total loans outstanding increased $67.6 million, or 3.68% to $1.90 billion as of December 31, 2017 from $1.84 billion as of December 31, 2016.\nAverage total deposits for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased $9.1 million or .37% to $2.47 billion versus $2.46 billion as of December 31, 2016. Total deposits outstanding increased $30.1 million or 1.24% to $2.46 billion from the $2.43 billion as of December 31, 2016. On a linked quarter basis, average deposits increased $58.8 million from $2.41 billion for the quarter ending September 30, 2017.\nThe company’s tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio was 12.74% at December 31, 2017, compared to 12.80% at December 31, 2016.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $1.3 million or 4.83% to $27.7 million compared to the $26.4 million reported for the same period of 2016. The net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased to 4.11% compared to the 4.04% for the same period ending December 31, 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to $939 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs were $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.2 million in the same period of 2016. The Corporation’s allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2017 was $19.9 million compared to $18.8 million as of December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 1.04% as of December 31, 2017 compared to 1.02% as of December 31, 2016.\nNonperforming loans decreased 4.4% to $21.7 million as of December 31, 2017 versus $22.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and leases was 1.14% as of December 31, 2017 versus 1.23% as of December 31, 2016.\nNon-interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $8.2 compared to $8.4 million as of December 31, 2016. On a year-over-year basis, service charges and fees on deposit accounts collected during the fourth quarter increased $406 thousand to $3.1 million.\nNon-interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $397 thousand to $21.8 million compared to $22.2 million for the same period of 2016. The Corporation’s efficiency ratio was 59.12% for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 versus 57.13% for the same period in 2016.\nFirst Financial Corporation is the holding company for First Financial Bank N.A. in Indiana and Illinois, and The Morris Plan Company of Terre Haute.\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 END OF PERIOD BALANCES Assets $ 3,000,668 $ 2,982,342 $ 2,988,527 $ 3,000,668 $ 2,988,527 Deposits $ 2,458,653 $ 2,453,411 $ 2,428,526 $ 2,458,653 $ 2,428,526 Loans, including net deferred loan costs $ 1,906,761 $ 1,866,564 $ 1,839,180 $ 1,906,761 $ 1,839,180 Allowance for Loan Losses $ 19,909 $ 19,802 $ 18,773 $ 19,909 $ 18,773 Total Equity $ 413,569 $ 443,558 $ 414,395 $ 413,569 $ 414,395 Tangible Common Equity (a) $ 377,584 $ 407,459 $ 377,931 $ 377,584 $ 377,931 AVERAGE BALANCES Total Assets $ 3,006,198 $ 2,974,616 $ 2,970,031 $ 2,984,547 $ 2,963,380 Earning Assets $ 2,797,194 $ 2,775,366 $ 2,778,369 $ 2,779,728 $ 2,748,165 Investments $ 895,401 $ 912,439 $ 923,957 $ 911,973 $ 940,490 Loans $ 1,874,766 $ 1,856,726 $ 1,830,628 $ 1,855,092 $ 1,792,609 Total Deposits $ 2,473,385 $ 2,414,561 $ 2,464,246 $ 2,442,137 $ 2,426,203 Interest-Bearing Deposits $ 2,039,993 $ 1,993,839 $ 1,895,665 $ 2,003,903 $ 1,875,226 Interest-Bearing Liabilities $ 27,357 $ 58,755 $ 35,531 $ 47,007 $ 46,556 Total Equity $ 442,418 $ 440,998 $ 405,261 $ 435,266 $ 415,032 INCOME STATEMENT DATA Net Interest Income $ 27,682 $ 27,108 $ 26,406 $ 107,857 $ 104,973 Net Interest Income Fully Tax Equivalent (b) $ 29,316 $ 28,691 $ 27,956 $ 114,175 $ 111,156 Provision for Loan Losses $ 1,474 $ 1,185 $ 939 $ 5,295 $ 3,300 Non-interest Income $ 8,236 $ 8,540 $ 8,428 $ 35,938 $ 46,931 Non-interest Expense $ 21,798 $ 22,284 $ 22,195 $ 88,747 $ 90,308 Net Income $ 2,616 $ 8,794 $ 8,344 $ 29,131 $ 38,413 PER SHARE DATA Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Common Share $ 0.21 $ 0.72 $ 0.68 $ 2.38 $ 3.12 Cash Dividends Declared Per Common Share $ 2.01 $ — $ 0.50 $ 2.51 $ 0.50 Book Value Per Common Share $ 33.77 $ 36.29 $ 33.92 $ 33.77 $ 33.92 Tangible Book Value Per Common Share (c) $ 30.83 $ 33.12 $ 30.94 $ 30.83 $ 30.94 Basic Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 12,234 12,224 12,201 12,225 12,317 (a) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts.
