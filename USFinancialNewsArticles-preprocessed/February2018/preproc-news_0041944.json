    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Andrews & Springer LLC , a boutique securities class action law firm focused on representing shareholders nationwide, is investigating potential breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Board of Directors of Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NYSE: NSM) (“Nationstar Mortgage” or the “Company”) relating to the sale of the Company to WMIH Corp. (“WMIH” formerly known as Washington Mutual, Inc.). On February 13, 2018, the two parties announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which WMIH will acquire Nationstar Mortgage in a merger worth approximately $1.9 billion. As a result of the merger, Nationstar Mortgage’s shareholders are only anticipated to receive $18.00 per share in cash or 12.7793 shares of WMIH in exchange for each share of Nationstar Mortgage.\nOur Firm's investigation so far has discovered that the process leading up to the announcement of the merger appears to have significant conflicts of interest, thus making the process and consideration unfair.\nAndrews & Springer is also investigating whether Nationstar Mortgage’s directors are breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately shop the company and maximize shareholder value. Our investigation is also looking into whether Nationstar Mortgage’s top executives were conflicted and acted in their own self-interest when approving the merger.\nIf you own shares of Nationstar Mortgage and want to receive additional information and protect your investments free of charge, please visit us at http://www.andrewsspringer.com/cases-investigations/nationstar-mortgage-class-action-investigation/ or contact Craig J.
