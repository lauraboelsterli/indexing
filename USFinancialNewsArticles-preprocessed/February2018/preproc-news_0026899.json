    "text": "February 11, 2018 / 5:17 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Rugby-No discipline, no victory, says France captain Guirado Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nFeb 11 (Reuters) - France captain Guilhem Guirado said that Les Bleus will not win a game in the Six Nations if they don’t show more discipline after a 32-26 defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday. \nFrance made a good start with wing Teddy Thomas scoring two splendid tries and led by six points at halftime, but were sanctioned numerous times after the break, Greig Laidlaw slotting home the six penalties he attempted for Scotland. \nLes Bleus lost 15-13 to Ireland in last weekend’s opener where they also paid dearly for their lack of discipline. \n“It was worse this time,” said Guirado. \n“As long as we don’t show more discipline, we won’t win a match. But to be disciplined you have to be confident.” \nFrance have not won in their last eight outings. \n“We must respect the rules otherwise we won’t make it,” added Guirado. \n“We’re always under tremendous pressure and after two defeats in a row the game against Italy will be more than welcome to bounce back.” \nFrance are fifth in the standings with two points with their next opponents Italy on zero after they also lost their first two games. \n“The championship is not over yet but we must stop losing games like this,” said Guirado. \n“We gave away too many points,” added flyhalf Lionel Beauxis.
