    "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, an increasingly prominent figure in the country's leadership herself, will be part of the North's delegation coming to South Korea for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Seoul said Wednesday.\nSouth Korea's Unification Ministry said North Korea informed it Wednesday that Kim Yo Jong, 1st vice director of the Central Committee of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, would be part of the delegation led by the country's nominal head of state Kim Yong Nam.\nNorth Korea also said the delegation will include Choe Hwi, chairman of the country's National Sports Guidance Committee, and Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North's agency that deals with inter-Korean affairs.\nSeoul previously said the delegation would arrive Friday but the statement Wednesday was the first confirmation a member of the North's ruling family would be included.\nKim Yo Jong, believed to be in her late 20s or early 30s, was promoted by her brother last year to be an alternate member of the decision-making political bureau of the ruling party's central committee, which analysts said showed that her activities are more substantive and more important than previously thought. She is believed to be one of Kim Jong Un's closest confidants. They were born to the same mother, Ko Yong Hui.\nThe war-separated rivals are cooperating for a series of conciliatory measures during the Olympics, which Seoul sees as an opportunity to ease tensions with Pyongyang following an extended period of animosity over its nuclear weapons and missiles program. Skeptics think the North is trying to use the Olympics to weakened U.S.-led sanctions and pressure against the country and buy more time to advance its nuclear weapons and missiles program.",
