    "text": "Published: Feb 26, 2018 7:03 a.m. ET Share \nRecent executive shuffle raises profile of Lake, one of Wall Street’s most senior women Getty Images In October, Lake tempered criticism Jamie Dimon had levied on the volatile digital currency bitcoin, which he’d recently called a “fraud.” Lake gave a more measured response, saying the bank is “very open minded to the potential-use cases…for digital currencies that are properly regulated.” \nBy Emily Glazer \nWhen JPMorgan Chase & Co. tried last month to clarify the question of when Chairman and Chief Executive James Dimon would step down, the firm got a lot more questions about who could fill one of the most powerful roles on Wall Street. \nOne of the most intriguing: What about Marianne Lake? \nJPMorgan’s JPM, +2.03% 48-year-old chief financial officer, Lake is one of the most senior women on Wall Street and has been on the bank’s short list of possible successors for years, people familiar with its board say. January’s announcement by the bank of executive moves makes her an even more likely contender. \nIn one respect, Lake would be a historic choice, the first female chief executive of one of the largest U.S. banks. A single mother of three young children, Lake has already become a role model for women in finance, juggling a high-profile job and family demands. \nIn her first year as CFO, 2013, Lake won praise for her handling of the fallout from the bank’s 2012 “London whale” trading loss. She is well known to investors and analysts, a fixture on the bank’s quarterly earnings calls who sometimes acts as a diplomatic foil to her outspoken boss.",
