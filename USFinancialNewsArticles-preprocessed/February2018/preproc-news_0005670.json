    "text": "SAO PAULO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Oi SA will not hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Feb. 7, the Brazilian telecoms company said in a securities filing on Friday.\nHolding the meeting would be contrary to a recent decision by the Rio de Janeiro bankruptcy court which is overseeing its bankruptcy process, it said.\nThe judge overseeing the restructuring approved Oi’s debt restructuring plan on Jan. 8 and called a proposed shareholders meeting “absolutely unnecessary”.
