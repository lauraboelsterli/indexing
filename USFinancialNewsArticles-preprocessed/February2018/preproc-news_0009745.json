    "text": "Feb 5 (Reuters) - British Columbia, Canada’s third-most populous province, said on Monday it would set up a network of government-run stores that could only sell recreational marijuana, and would not allow sales in the same stores as liquor or tobacco.\nBritish Columbia said in December that recreational pot would be sold through a combination of public and private stores, and government online sales, to buyers who are at least 19 years old.\nRecreational marijuana is on track to be legalized in Canada by July 2018. While federal legislation will regulate cannabis production, the details of who can sell or buy it has been largely left up to the country’s provinces.
