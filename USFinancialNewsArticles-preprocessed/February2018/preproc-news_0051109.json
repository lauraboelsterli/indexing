    "text": "0 COMMENTS A young startup is trying to put a new spin on ad blocking. \nThe company, Scroll , is persuading news outlets that they can make more money charging some consumers for an ad-free experience than they can make showing them ads. \nBusiness Insider, Fusion Media Group, the Atlantic, MSNBC and Slate are among the news organizations that have signed up to join Scroll, a subscription service for consumers who are willing to pay $5 a month to get rid of ads on participating publishers’ sites. \nFormer Chartbeat Chief Executive Tony Haile co-founded the startup in late 2016 after he came to believe that the growing adoption of ad blockers indicated that consumers would pay for a better news experience. He plans to launch the service later this year.\nParticipating publishers allow Scroll to serve its users an ad-free version of their websites, Mr. Haile said, with the exception of native advertising articles produced in-house on behalf of marketers. In return, publishers get a cut of the company’s subscription revenue.\nThe rise of ad-blocking software has eaten into publishers’ income at a time when digital revenue growth is already under threat from the advertising dominance of Facebook and Google. Scroll is unlikely to stop the use of ad blockers or persuade a majority of news readers to sign up, but it does offer publishers a way to appease consumers who want to avoid the intrusion of advertising while making incremental revenue .\nScroll intends to pass 70% of its subscription revenue on to publishers, Mr. Haile said. That money is divided up among news organizations according to how much individual subscribers pay attention to each publisher, with a bonus awarded to outlets that cultivate a particularly devoted following.\nIf a Scroll customer spends 10% of her time with a specific publisher, then that outlet would receive 10% of that customer’s subscription fee allocated to publishers based on attention. \nThe revenue set aside for publishers also includes a pool of bonus money for publishers that win over a loyal audience. If an organization is responsible for 20% or more of a Scroll subscriber’s attention, the organization becomes eligible for a larger share of the revenue from that subscriber.\nFor publications that have a paywall, readers will still have to pay subscription fees to that news outlet in addition to the Scroll fee.\nTo date, publishers haven't received any upfront payments for joining Scroll, Mr. Haile said.\n“We spent the first year working with publishers building and testing a model that could work in every different scenario,” Mr. Haile said. “If we truly care about a thriving free press, we have to figure out a model that works for all of those different kinds of media.”\nThe rise of ad blocking has prompted responses from publishers and tech companies alike. Last week, Google launched an ad blocker in its Chrome browser that will filter out about a dozen different varieties of digital ads deemed annoying, including pop-ups, though allowing many of its own formats to remain . Some publishers, including Forbes, Business Insider and the Atlantic have directly asked users to disable their ad blockers or pay subscription fees to access some content.\nDespite these responses, Mr. Haile believes that annoying ads will persist and news consumers will continue to look for alternatives. There are more than a dozen advertising formats that aren’t blocked by Chrome that are screened by Adblock Plus, the most popular ad-blocking software, Mr. Haile said.\nHe wouldn’t disclose the number of publishers that have joined Scroll.\nIn 2016, Scroll raised $3 million from backers including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp and German publishing conglomerate Axel Springer . Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, is also investing an undisclosed amount in the company, Scroll announced Thursday.\nMSNBC, which is among Scroll’s participating publishers at launch, is experimenting with the service to better understand whether its audience would be willing to pay for an ad-free version of its site, said Nick Ascheim, senior vice president of NBC News Digital.\n“If it turns out that this is incredibly lucrative and extremely successful, we will all cheer Scroll and be thrilled,” Mr. Ascheim said. “But we will continue to pursue advertising as vigorously as we always have.”",
