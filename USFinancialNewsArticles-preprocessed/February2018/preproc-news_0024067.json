These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our progress integrating the POPEYES ® business, as well as the brand's growth potential; expectations regarding the continued growth prospects for each of our three iconic brands; whether we have the right strategy in place to create further value for all of our stakeholders over the long run; our estimates regarding our anticipated income tax rate for 2018 and other tax matters as a result of the recently-enacted U.S. tax legislation; and our target total dividend for 2018. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from RBI's expectations are detailed in filings of RBI with the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities, such as its annual and quarterly reports and current reports on Form 8-K, and include the following: risks related to RBI's ability to successfully implement its domestic and international growth strategy; risks related to RBI's ability to compete domestically and internationally in an intensely competitive industry; risks related to the complexity of the new U.S. tax legislation and our ability to accurately interpret and predict its impact on our financial condition and results; and risks related to our ability to generate sufficient liquidity to achieve our target total dividend for 2018 and satisfy our debt service and other obligations. Other than as required under U.S. federal securities laws or Canadian securities laws, we do not assume a duty to update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or circumstances, change in expectations or otherwise.\nRESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe evaluate our restaurants and assess our business based on the following operating metrics.\nSystem-wide sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchise and company-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Comparable sales refers to the percentage change in restaurant sales in one period from the same prior year period for restaurants that have been open for thirteen months or longer for TH and BK and 65 weeks or longer for PLK. System-wide sales growth and comparable sales are measured on a constant currency basis, which means that results exclude the effect of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating prior year results at current year monthly average exchange rates. We analyze key operating metrics on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements.\nSystem-wide sales represent sales at all franchise restaurants and company-owned restaurants. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our franchise revenues include royalties based on a percentage of franchise sales.\nNet restaurant growth is presented on a percentage basis and reflects the net increase in restaurant count (openings, net of closures) over a trailing twelve month period, divided by the restaurant count at the beginning of the trailing twelve month period.\nFor 2017, PLK comparable sales, system-wide sales growth and system-wide sales are for the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and from December 26, 2016 through December 31, 2017 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Comparable sales and system-wide sales growth are calculated using the same period in the prior year (October 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015 through December 31, 2016, respectively). For 2017, PLK net restaurant growth is for the period from December 26, 2016 through December 31, 2017. PLK restaurant count is as of December 31, 2017 for the current period, and as of December 25, 2016 for the comparative period, inclusive of temporary closures. For 2016, PLK figures are shown for informational purposes only and are consistent with PLK's former fiscal calendar. Consequently, PLK results for 2017 may not be comparable to those of 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nComparable Sales by Largest Market\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTH - Canada\n0.8%\n(0.2)%\n0.2%\n2.2%\nBK - US\n5.1%\n1.8%\n2.5%\n1.0%\nPLK - US\n(2.5)%\n3.0%\n(2.2)%\n1.4%\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nSystem Restaurant Count by Largest\nMarket\n2017\n2016\nTH - Canada\n3,913\n3,801\nBK - US\n7,226\n7,156\nPLK - US\n2,212\n2,094\nRESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC.

Net losses (gains) on disposals of assets, restaurant closures, and refranchisings for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects losses in connection with refranchisings.\n(4)\nNet losses (gains) on foreign exchange is primarily related to revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.\nRESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nBelow, we define the non-GAAP financial measures, provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), and discuss the reasons why we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors. These measures do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies in our industry.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, RBI reports the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\"), Combined Total Revenues, Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Organic revenue growth and Organic Adjusted EBITDA growth. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in assessing our operating performance, as it provides them with the same tools that management uses to evaluate our performance and is responsive to questions we receive from both investors and analysts. By disclosing these non-GAAP measures, we intend to provide investors with a consistent comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings (net income or loss) before interest expense, net, (gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt, income tax (benefit) expense, and depreciation and amortization and is used by management to measure operating performance of the business.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the non-cash impact of share-based compensation and non-cash incentive compensation expense and (income) loss from equity method investments, net of cash distributions received from equity method investments, as well as other operating expenses (income), net. Other specifically identified costs associated with non-recurring projects are also excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including PLK transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Popeyes, corporate restructuring and tax advisory fees, and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Tim Hortons. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance of the business, excluding these non-cash and other specifically identified items that management believes are not relevant to management's assessment of operating performance or the performance of an acquired business. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, also represents our measure of segment income for each of our three operating segments. PLK revenues and segment income from March 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017 are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nCombined Total Revenues and Combined Adjusted EBITDA include results of PLK prior to the acquisition.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income excluding (i) franchise agreement amortization, which is a non-cash expense arising as a result of acquisition accounting that may hinder the comparability of our operating results to our industry peers, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs and debt issuance discount, a non-cash component of interest expense, and (gains) losses on early extinguishment of debt, which are non-cash charges that vary by the timing, terms and size of debt financing transactions, (iii) (income) loss from equity method investments, net of cash distributions received from equity method investments, (iv) other operating expenses (income), net, and (v) other specifically identified costs associated with non-recurring projects. Adjusted Net Income includes preferred share dividends.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the number of diluted shares of RBI during the reporting period. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are used by management to evaluate the operating performance of the business, excluding certain non-cash and other specifically identified items that management believes are not relevant to management's assessment of operating performance or the performance of an acquired business.\nRevenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA growth, on an organic basis, are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of FX movements. Management believes that organic growth is an important metric for measuring the operating performance of our business as it helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of FX movements. We calculate the impact of FX movements by translating current year results at prior year monthly average exchange rates. In addition, for organic growth comparative purposes, we are presenting PLK pre- and post-combination results, including Popeyes' pre-combination Adjusted EBITDA determined in accordance with RBI's methodology as reflected in the reconciliation table.\nRESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC.

(\"Popeyes\") on March 27, 2017. Prior to its acquisition by RBI, Popeyes operated on a fiscal period basis consisting of a 16-week first fiscal quarter and 12-week second through fourth fiscal quarters. Subsequent to its acquisition by RBI, Popeyes commenced reporting on a calendar quarter basis consistent with RBI. Q4'17 and FY'17 for PLK represents the period from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and December 26, 2016 through December 31, 2017, respectively, while Q4'16 and FY'16 for PLK represents the 12 weeks ended and 52 weeks ended December 25, 2016, respectively. Combined Total Revenues and Combined Adjusted EBITDA include results of PLK prior to the acquisition.

Cash distributions received from our equity method investments are included in segment income.\n(6)\nOn January 1, 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the tax impact of equity based compensation. As a result, our effective tax rate was reduced by 10.8% and 6.4% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and our effective adjusted tax rate was reduced by 8.2% and 4.8% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. There was no impact to our results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\n(7)\nRepresents loss on early extinguishment of debt and non-cash interest expense related to losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into interest expense in connection with interest rate swaps settled in May 2015.\n(8)\nAdjusted income tax expense includes the tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments and is calculated using our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which the costs were incurred. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the tax impacts of non-GAAP adjustments amounted to $12.1 million and $28.2 million, respectively. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the tax impacts of non-GAAP adjustments amounted to $14.1 million and $47.8 million, respectively. Adjusted income tax expense for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 also excludes the net $300.7 million benefit arising from the enactment of the Tax Act due to (i) remeasurements and (ii) taxes imposed by the Tax Act.\nSOURCE Restaurant Brands International Inc.",
