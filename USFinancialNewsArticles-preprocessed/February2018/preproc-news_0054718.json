(NASDAQ:TVTY) today announced financial results and\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenues increased by 11.5% to $139.4 million driven by growth in all three of the Company’s lines of business. This compares to revenues of $124.9 million of 2016.\nIncome from continuing operations was $8.6 million, a decrease of 28.9% from $12.1 million of 2016. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased 26.0% to $17.6 million compared to $14.0 million of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 excludes $2.6 million in pre-tax restructuring charges and $7.4 million of income tax expense related to tax reform legislation. Adjusted income from continuing operations of 2016 excludes $5.2 million of pre-tax business separation costs and restructuring charges and a $2.2 million favorable adjustment to pre-tax depreciation expense. See pages 11-14 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nIncome from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.20 compared to $0.30 of 2016, and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share grew 17.1%, to $0.41 from $0.35 of 2016. The adjusted income per diluted share of $0.41 excludes a restructuring charge of $0.04 per diluted share and a charge of $0.17 per diluted share resulting from the 2017 tax reform legislation. See pages 11-14 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding increased to 43.4 million compared with 39.8 million of 2016. The most significant factor driving the diluted share count increase was the 56% increase in the Company’s weighted average stock price compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $29.8 million, or 21.4% of revenues, which excludes $2.6 million of restructuring expenses, compared to adjusted EBITDA of 2016 of $29.1 million, or 23.3% of revenues, which excluded $5.2 million of business separation costs and restructuring charges. See pages 11-14 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nCash flow from operations was $31.6 million, and free cash flow totaled $29.7 million. Total debt was $146.0 million, and the ratio of total debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA, as calculated under the Company’s credit facility, improved to 1.0, compared with 1.9 at the end of 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $28.4 million. See pages 11-14 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nTIVITY HEALTH, INC.

We are also pleased with another strong growth year in Prime® Fitness as it continues to be our fastest growing line of business.\n“In addition to the strong operational and financial results throughout the year, 2017 also marked the 25th anniversary of SilverSneakers. Our longevity in the market stands as a testament to the power of our brand and the impact on the lives of our members. I’m incredibly proud of our results and of the effort of all our hardworking colleagues here at Tivity Health.”\nAdam Holland, Tivity Health’s Chief Financial Officer added, “During the fourth quarter, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet by paying down debt with our free cash flow. We're well positioned to drive future growth and I believe our initial 2018 outlook demonstrates the power of our business model against the backdrop of strong market demographics.”\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company initiated and completed a restructuring plan aimed at streamlining certain operations support functions. The Company incurred approximately $2.6 million of pre-tax restructuring charges during the fourth quarter and does not expect additional material charges under this plan.
