    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Differences between Britain and the European Union over what a Brexit transition period should look like are normal, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Tuesday, responding to comments from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.\n“During a negotiation you would not expect both sides to immediately agree on everything. What’s absolutely clear is that both the UK and the EU agree than an implementation period is beneficial and we’re working to reach agreement in March,” the spokesman said.\nBarnier warned London again on Tuesday that Brexit negotiations were not going well enough to guarantee that the two sides would reach a divorce deal and an agreement on post-Brexit transition in time.\nReporting by William James.
