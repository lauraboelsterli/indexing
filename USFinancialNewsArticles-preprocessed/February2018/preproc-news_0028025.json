    "text": "GAITHERSBURG, Md., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Applied Biomimetic, a leader in the convergence of polymer and protein membrane technologies, announces the opening of its new headquarters and its research facilities in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\nCEO Steen Sondergaard Nissen, commenting on the move: \"After many years of research and incubation at the University of Cincinnati facilities, we achieved a level of scale in both research and manufacturing that required us to expand. After considering many alternative geographies we decided on the vibrant technology corridor in Maryland, and the City of Gaithersburg was chosen. The city's support for our transition and their fast-tracking of the normal permitting process and overall support enabled us to move here with relative ease and speed. We look forward to contributing to the local economy, being part of the ever-broadening technology local network, and aspire to serve as a model corporate citizen.\"\nNissen added: \"We are grateful for the support provided by the University of Cincinnati over the past several years in hosting us, and providing the infrastructure and support to help us evolve our technology and people. Incubation centers such as these are vital in providing a shared services model of expensive laboratory equipment, and they help in establishing the visibility to attract technology talent.\"\nThe Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC), along with Gaithersburg and state partners, helped assist the move from Cincinnati. \"We welcome Applied Biomimetic to Montgomery County,\" said MCEDC President & CEO, David Petr. \"The company's unique combination of biotechnology and engineering has great potential to improve the water purification industry and others. Their work leverages Montgomery County's strong biotech talents while expanding our industry reach. We see a great future in Montgomery County for this growing, innovative company.\"\n\"We are so pleased that Applied Biomimetic recognized Montgomery County's advantages for both research and development and manufacturing,\" noted Montgomery County Executive Ike Leggett.\n\"Attracting and maintaining innovative biotechnology companies strengthens our community and adds to its vibrancy,\" said Jud Ashman, Mayor of the City of Gaithersburg. \"We look forward to welcoming Applied Biomimetic to Gaithersburg and witnessing its future growth.\"\nRecalling Applied Biomimetics' Danish roots, Jacob Vind, Danish Consul General & Head of the Danish Water Technology Alliance added: \"At the Danish Trade Council we are working closely with Applied Biomimetic through our Water Technology Alliance in the US. We are happy to see our partners succeed, grow and expand their businesses, not only in Denmark but also here in the US. I'm proud that Danish companies are creating thousands of jobs all over the US and excited to see Applied Biomimetic contribute to those numbers.\"\nAll inquiries and communications should now be directed to the new address:\n942 Clopper Road\nGaithersburg, Maryland 20878\nUSA\nPhone +1 240-292-1129\ninfo@appliedbiomimetic.com\nAbout Applied Biomimetic A/S:\nApplied Biomimetic is a leader in the convergence of polymer and protein membrane technology. We have developed a high-performance membrane platform for water, life science, enzyme, food, and dairy separation applications. Applied Biomimetic holds global patents for the concept of embedding proteins in a proprietary polymeric membrane structure.\nOur core technology is based on new chemistry and manufacturing methods to achieve highly permeable membrane material with narrow molecular size exclusion cut-off. By adding an active protein layer, the membranes will separate constituents at the ion level. We specialize in block copolymer synthesis and lamellar phases self-assembly. We are also recognized as a leader in the expression, purification, and production scale-up of porins from biological sources as well as synthesis of various types of polymeric amphiphiles.\nWe foresee a number of new innovative applications for our technology platform that may be established at a later stage, e.g. new delivery mechanisms for pharmaceuticals, new coatings for contact lenses, and more effective products for the cosmetics industry.\nwww.appliedbiomimetic.com\nAbout MCEDC\nThe Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC) is the official public-private organization representing Montgomery County, Md. The organization was created in 2016 to help businesses start, grow, and relocate in Montgomery County, Maryland, by helping them gain access to top talent, business and market intelligence and prime locations.
