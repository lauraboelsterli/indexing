    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 5:29 AM / Updated 35 minutes ago India's top court cancels iron ore mining permits in Goa state: TV Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court has quashed all iron ore mining permits in Goa state, one of the country’s top producing areas for the steel raw material, local television channels reported on Wednesday. \nMining in the state, known for its low-quality iron ore, will stop after March 15 and new licenses will need to be given, the court said. Activists have been campaigning for a ban on iron ore mining in the state on environmental grounds. \nCourt action against illegal mining shut the industry in Goa for more than two years from 2012. Goa had exported about 50 million tonnes of iron ore a year before the ban was imposed. \nThe latest ban is a blow for companies such as Vedanta Resources that have mines in the state. \nMost of Goa’s iron ore is exported to China as Indian steel companies do not have the technology to use them.
