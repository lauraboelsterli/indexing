    "text": "STOCKHOLM, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Swedish home prices rose 3.4 percent month on month in seasonally strong January, after four months with falling prices, the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) showed on Wednesday.\nOn an annual basis, they were however down 2.2 percent, with apartment prices down 6.1 percent and single-family home prices up 0.3 percent.\nProperty prices in the country have boomed over the past two decades, leaving households among Europeâ€™s most indebted. Authorities, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund have warned debt levels are a serious threat to the Swedish economy.\nHowever, prices fell in the last few months of 2017 amid a surge in building and tougher mortgage rules.\nThe HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends.
