    "text": "Top News \nSelloffs Continue \nIndexes across much of Asia and Europe were down on Monday morning’s trading, following earlier European and U.S. declines on Friday. The Nikkei closed down 2.5%, in its biggest fall since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. Chinese equities held firm, though. Meanwhile, stocks also tumbled in Germany after coalition-building talks missed a deadline. Wall Street Journal . \nSamsung Heir Freed \nSamsung Vice Chair Lee Jae-yong is out of prison, after his corruption sentence was reduced from five years to two-and-a-half years with a four-year probation. The scandal that led to the sentence also brought down South Korean President Park Geun-hye; Lee was convicted of receiving favors after paying money to her and her advisor, Choi Soon-sil. Fortune \nDemocratic Memo Vote \nThe House Intelligence Committee is expected to vote Monday on whether to release the Democrats’ own classified memo, which purportedly serves as a rebuttal to the Republican memo released late last week. The committee previously voted not to release the Democratic memo, but some Republicans on the committee have apparently had a change of heart. New York Times \nWeak Tax Clawback \nThe British government’s attempt to crack down on offshore tax evasion is only yielding £349 million ($492 million) a year, rather than the promised £1 billion. The opposition Labour Party, which requested the figures under freedom of information, said they showed the government’s “utter failure” in ensuring wealthy people and large corporations pay as much tax as they should. Guardian Around the Water Cooler \nExpatriate Tax Bills \nExpatriate Americans and green card holders who own more than 10% of a “controlled foreign corporation” will reportedly be hit by the repatriation clause in the U.S. tax reform. “The problem is, the way the law is worded treats every American citizen and green card holder in the world [operating through a foreign corporation] the same as Google,” said tax attorney Monte Silver. Financial Times \nDodge’s MLK Controversy \nSome people are not happy about Dodge’s decision to co-opt a Martin Luther King Jr. speech for a Super Bowl ad selling Ram trucks. Given King’s opposition to the Vietnam War and the military spending it entailed, it was a little odd to hear his voice used approvingly behind shots of the U.S. military—though these were just a few of many images in the ad. The King Center was certainly not amused. Fortune \nEuropean Sports’ #MeToo Moment \nThe worlds of Formula One, cycling, and darts have a long tradition of using pretty, scantily-clad women as window-dressing on the sidelines and podiums. Now, following pushback from broadcasters and event sponsors, that tradition is starting to fade, and progressive activists are delighted that women are no longer being treated as objects. Bloomberg \nBerlin Wall \nThe Berlin Wall has now been down for longer than it stood. The division between the city’s communist east and capitalist west fell 28 years, two months and 28 days ago. However, according to Deutsche Welle’s Marcel Fürstenau, many East Germans still feel like second-class citizens in the united Germany. DW \nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer .
