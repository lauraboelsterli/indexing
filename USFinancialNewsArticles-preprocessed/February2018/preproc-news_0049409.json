(NASDAQ:NRIM) today announced that the Board of Directors increased its regular quarterly cash dividend 9% to $0.24 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 16, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2018.\n“We continue to generate good profitability, which sustains our ability to steadily increase cash dividends,” said Joe Schierhorn, President and CEO. At the stock price of $33.60 per share at the close of the market on February 15, 2018, the current dividend equates to a yield of 2.86% on an annualized basis.\nOn January 29, 2018, Northrim reported net income of $13.2 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to $14.4 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, in 2016.
