    "text": "ST. GEORGE, Utah, Feb. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SkyWest, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKYW) (\"SkyWest\") today reported financial and operating results for Q4 2017, including net income of $290 million, or $5.46 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $270 million, or $5.22 loss per diluted share for Q4 2016. Excluding special items in both periods, adjusted net income was $43 million, or $0.81 per diluted share for Q4 2017, compared to adjusted net income of $29 million, or $0.54 per diluted share for Q4 2016. 1 Q4 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.81 did not include a $247 million after-tax benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability that was included in our GAAP results for the quarter.\nSkyWest reported net income of $429 million, or $8.08 per diluted share for the 2017 year, compared to a net loss of $162 million, or $3.14 loss per diluted share for the 2016 year. Excluding special items in both periods, adjusted net income was $182 million, or $3.43 per diluted share for the 2017 year, compared to adjusted net income of $143 million, or $2.73 per diluted share for the 2016 year. 2\nThe improvement in net income from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017, excluding special items, was primarily due to SkyWest's continued fleet transition over the last year, including the addition of 21 new E175 aircraft and the removal of aircraft operating under unprofitable or less profitable flying agreements, including 65 50-seat jet aircraft and 13 CRJ700/CRJ900 aircraft.\nCommenting on the results, Chip Childs, Chief Executive Officer of SkyWest, said, \"Our 2017 results reflect solid execution of our plan by our world-class professionals. Healthy year-over-year improvements came from disciplined investment, risk reduction and strong operating performance. Our execution of these clear objectives continues to drive results and positive momentum into 2018 and beyond.\"\nQ4 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $797 million in Q4 2017, up from $758 million in Q4 2016. The increase in revenue included the net impact of adding 21 new E175 aircraft since Q4 2016, partially offset by the removal of 78 unprofitable or less profitable aircraft over the same period. Additionally, SkyWest took delivery of 19 E175 aircraft throughout Q4 2016, which had only a partial quarter impact on 2016 revenue for comparability purposes to 2017.\nOperating expenses were $704 million in Q4 2017, down from $1.16 billion in Q4 2016. The Q4 2016 operating expenses included $473 million in special charges related to our 50-seat fleet and early lease returns. 3 Excluding the Q4 2016 special charges, the Q4 2017 operating expenses were up $14 million from Q4 2016 primarily due to higher fuel costs and an increase in engine maintenance costs as an increasing percentage of our fleet are under long term power-by-the-hour maintenance agreements.\nThe enactment of the TCJA resulted in $247 million income tax benefit from the revaluation of SkyWest's net deferred tax liabilities during Q4 2017. SkyWest anticipates an effective tax rate for 2018 to generally range between 24% and 25%, excluding the impact of any discrete tax items.\nQ4 2017 Operational Update\nSkyWest Airlines, Inc. (\"SkyWest Airlines\") took delivery of three new E175 aircraft during the quarter. The following summarizes the anticipated delivery dates for the remaining 12 E175 aircraft to be placed under contract with Alaska Airlines (\"Alaska\") and 30 E175 SC aircraft to be placed under contract with Delta Air Lines (\"Delta\"):\nScheduled E175/E175 SC Aircraft Deliveries\nIn-service\nDec 31, 2017\nQ1 2018\nQ2 2018\nQ3 2018\nQ4 2018\nAnticipated\nin-service\nby end of 2018\nTotal E175/ E175 SCs:\n107\n5\n16\n14\n7\n149\nExpressJet Airlines, Inc. (\"ExpressJet\") continued the previously announced wind down of its flying agreement with Delta during the quarter. At the end of 2017, ExpressJet had 16 CRJ900s and 33 CRJ700s remaining in service under the Delta agreement. ExpressJet anticipates returning 19 leased aircraft to Delta ratably over the next several quarters (16 CRJ900s and three CRJ700s). ExpressJet also anticipates removing the remaining 30 CRJ700s from service with Delta starting in April 2018. ExpressJet has reached a previously announced agreement to place eight CRJ700s under a flying contract with American Airlines (\"American\") and is pursuing alternative opportunities for the remaining 22 CRJ700s.\nOperating Performance:\nFlight completion rates at SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet for Q4 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\nSkyWest Airlines\nExpressJet\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nAdjusted Completion *\n99.9%\n99.9%\n99.9%\n99.8%\nRaw Completion\n98.8%\n98.2%\n98.9%\n98.4%\n* Adjusted Completion excludes weather cancellations. Raw Completion includes weather cancellations.\nQ4 2017 Capital and Liquidity\nSkyWest had $685 million in cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2017, up $120 million from December 31, 2016 and up $10 million from September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, SkyWest used $15 million in cash toward the purchase of three E175 aircraft. SkyWest also used $10 million to repurchase stock in Q4 2017 under its $100 million share repurchase program, of which $80 million remains authorized.\nTotal debt was up slightly during the fourth quarter of 2017, with scheduled principal payments largely offsetting the debt issued for new aircraft during the quarter. In Q4 2017, excluding the three E175s purchased, SkyWest used $47 million for other capital investments, including spare engines and aircraft parts.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures\nAlthough SkyWest's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), SkyWest management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of SkyWest's ongoing operations and may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. The following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial statements for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Readers should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that may affect SkyWest's net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies.\nReconciliation to Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share (unaudited)\n(Dollars in thousands, except per diluted share)\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017\nPre-tax\nincome\nIncome tax\nbenefit (expense)\nNet income\nNet income per\nDiluted Share\nGAAP income\n$ 68,238\n$ 221,690\n$ 289,928\n$ 5.46\nQ4 2017 adjustments (1)\n-\n(246,845)\n(246,845)\nAdjusted income\n$ 68,238\n$ (25,155)\n$ 43,083\n$ 0.81\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017\nPre-tax\nincome\nIncome tax\nbenefit (expense)\nNet income\nNet income per\nDiluted Share\nGAAP income\n$ 288,183\n$ 140,724\n$ 428,907\n$ 8.08\n2017 year adjustments (1)\n-\n(246,845)\n(246,845)\nAdjusted income\n$ 288,183\n$ (106,121)\n$ 182,062\n$ 3.43\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016\nPre-tax\nincome (loss)\nIncome tax\nbenefit (expense)\nNet income\n(loss)\nNet income (loss) per\nDiluted Share\nGAAP income (loss)\n$ (426,222)\n$ 155,977\n$ (270,245)\n$ (5.22)\nQ4 2016 adjustments (2)\n465,649\n(171,047)\n294,602\nQ4 2016 adjustments (3)\n6,878\n(2,526)\n4,352\nAdjusted income (4)\n$ 46,305\n$ (17,596)\n$ 28,709\n$ 0.54\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016\nPre-tax\nincome (loss)\nIncome tax\nbenefit (expense)\nNet income\n(loss)\nNet income (loss) per\nDiluted Share\nGAAP income (loss)\n$ (248,812)\n$ 87,226\n$ (161,586)\n$ (3.14)\n2016 year adjustments (2)\n465,649\n(171,047)\n294,602\n2016 year adjustments (5)\n16,101\n(6,023)\n10,078\nAdjusted income (4)\n$ 232,938\n$ (89,844)\n$ 143,094\n$ 2.73\nThese adjustments allow investors to better understand and analyze our recurring core performance in the periods presented.\n(1)\nAdjusts for tax benefit resulting from the TCJA enacted during Q4 2017 that resulted in a revaluation of SkyWest's deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n(2)\nAdjusts for a non-cash impairment charge on 50-seat aircraft and related long-lived assets and spare aircraft parts net of a $90 million early settlement of residual value guarantees with Bombardier received in Q4 2016.\n(3)\nAdjusts for early lease return charges on four CRJ700s.\n(4)\nPro forma diluted shares outstanding for Non-GAAP net income were 52,806,000 and 52,369,000 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\n(5)\nAdjusts for early lease return charges on eight CRJ700s.\nAbout SkyWest\nBased in St. George, Utah, SkyWest, Inc. is the holding company for two scheduled passenger airline operations and an aircraft leasing company with more than 17,000 employees.

Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about SkyWest's future financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations, estimates, intentions and outlook, and other statements that are not historical facts.

Readers should note that many factors could affect the future operating and financial results of SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet, and could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in set forth in this release. These factors include, but are not limited to, the prospects of entering into agreements with existing or other carriers to fly new aircraft, ongoing negotiations between SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet and their major partners regarding their contractual obligations, uncertainties regarding operation of new aircraft, the ability to attract and retain qualified pilots, the impact of regulatory issues such as pilot rest rules and qualification requirements, and the ability to obtain aircraft financing.\nActual operational and financial results of SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet will likely also vary, and may vary materially, from those anticipated, estimated, projected or expected for a number of other reasons, including, in addition to those identified above: the challenges and costs of integrating operations and realizing anticipated synergies and other benefits from the acquisition of ExpressJet; the challenges of competing successfully in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry; developments associated with fluctuations in the economy and the demand for air travel; the financial stability of SkyWest's major partners and any potential impact of their financial condition on the operations of SkyWest, SkyWest Airlines, or ExpressJet; fluctuations in flight schedules, which are determined by the major partners for whom SkyWest's operating airlines conduct flight operations; variations in market and economic conditions; significant aircraft lease and debt commitments; residual aircraft values and related impairment charges; labor relations and costs; the impact of global instability; rapidly fluctuating fuel costs, and potential fuel shortages; the impact of weather-related or other natural disasters on air travel and airline costs; aircraft deliveries; the ability to attract and retain qualified pilots and other unanticipated factors.
