(TSX:GSY), (“ goeasy ” or the “ Company ”), a leading full-service provider of goods and alternative financial services that provides everyday Canadians with a chance for a better tomorrow, today, announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also announced a 25% increase in its annual dividend from $0.72 to $0.90 per share.\nResults for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $108.6 million, an increase of 18.9% from $91.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The growth was driven by the expansion of easyfinancial and the related growth of its consumer loans receivable portfolio which reached $526.5 million by quarter's end, up 42.1% from December 31, 2016.\nDuring the quarter, the Company generated record levels of loan originations and loan book growth on the back of its second largest quarter ever of net customer gain. Loan originations in the quarter reached a record $176.4 million, an increase of 50.1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The record growth of the loan book in the quarter was $53.5 million compared to $26.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 99.5%. The strong growth was fueled by the increased penetration of risk adjusted rate loans to more credit worthy borrowers, the Company’s expansion into Quebec and the introduction of the Company’s new secured loan product. Additionally, strong growth in the quarter was supported by improved performance of the company’s digital marketing efforts and an increased investment in advertising, which increased by $2.0 million or 48%.\nOperating income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 was $24.5 million, an increase of $7.3 million or 42.4% when compared to operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter, which included an $8.2 million before tax charge associated with the refinancing completed on November 1, 2017, was $5.4 million. Excluding this charge, adjusted net income was $11.4 million, up $3.1 million or 36.6% from the net income of $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.79 per share, an increase of $0.19 or 31.7% from diluted earnings per share of $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“The fourth quarter rounded out a record year for our Company which resulted in financial success and the accomplishment of many of our strategic goals,” said David Ingram, goeasy ’s President . “Consumer demand remains elevated and our product suite is clearly matching the right size of loan with the right interest rate as our overall credit performance continues to improve. I am particularly pleased that during the quarter we saw an improvement in charge-off rates from 15.8% to 12.8%.”\nOther highlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 include:\neasyfinancial\nRevenue increased by 33.2% to $74.6 million from $56.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Delinquency rates on the final Saturday of the quarter improved to 5.3% from 5.8% on the final Saturday of 2016. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 38.4% from 34.9% in the comparable period of 2016. Cash generated from easyfinancial customer payments was $127.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $94.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. easyfinancial now has the highest consumer awareness in Canada for non-prime installment lending.\neasyhome\nSame store revenue increased 0.1%.

Operating margin was 22.5% for the quarter, up from 18.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company’s normalized return on equity was 20.1% in the current quarter, up from 17.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year Results\nFor the full year, goeasy recorded revenues of $405.2 million, up 16.6% compared with $347.5 million in 2016.\nOperating income for 2017 was $87.4 million, net income was $36.1 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.56. The 2017 results included an $8.2 million before tax charge associated with the refinancing completed on November 1, 2017. The 2016 results included a $3.0 million gain on the sale of an investment and $6.4 million in transaction advisory costs that were not routine and non-recurring. Excluding these items, adjusted net income for 2017 was $42.2 million compared with $33.2 million in 2016, an increase of $9.0 million or 27.2%; and adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2017 was $2.97 compared with $2.38 in 2016, an increase of $0.59 or 24.8%.\nIn addition to the strong financial performance during 2017, the Company also made significant progress on its strategic initiatives:\neasyfinancial expanded into the province of Quebec. At year end, the Quebec loan portfolio exceeded $23 million, significantly ahead of initial expectations. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, the Company introduced its easyfinancial unsecured loan product into almost 100 of its easyhome leasing stores. During the fourth quarter of 2017, easyfinancial launched a new secured lending product to qualifying borrowers who own and reside within their home and who are looking for lower cost forms of financing. Also during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed a recapitalization of the Company’s balance sheet. The new debt structure provided by the North American capital markets and a group of national and international banks provides goeasy with a capital structure to fund its growth for the foreseeable future.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nTotal assets were $749.6 million as at December 31, 2017, an increase of 49.0% from $503.1 million as at December 31, 2016 and driven by the $156.0 million growth in the gross consumer loans receivable portfolio.\nAs at December 31, 2017, the Company had $109.4 million in cash on hand and an additional $110.0 million from committed facilities available to support future growth.\nThe Company believes that its cash and committed facilities, coupled with the cash flows provided by operations, will be sufficient to fund the planned growth through to the end of 2018 and into 2019.\nOutlook\ngoeasy ’s strategic focus continues to be driven by the following strategic imperatives:\nEnhance its product offering Evolve its delivery channels Execute with efficiency and effectiveness Deliver a best-in-class customer experience\nThe Company has previously provided 3 year targets for 2018 through 2020 that is:\n2018 2019 2020 New easyfinancial locations 20 - 30\nopenings 10 - 20\nopenings 10 - 20\nOpenings Gross consumer loans receivable portfolio at year end $700 - $750\nmillion $875 - $950\nmillion $1.0 - $1.1\nbillion easyfinancial total revenue yield 54% - 56% 49% - 51% 46% - 48% Net charge-offs as a percentage of average gross consumer loans receivable 12% - 14% 11% - 13% 10% - 12% easyfinancial operating margin 38% - 40% 40%+ 40%+ Total revenue growth 16% - 18% 14% - 16% 10% - 12% Return on Equity 18% - 20% 20%+ 20%+ The achievement of these targets by the Company, however, is predicated on a number of factors, including the pace of expansion of easyfinancial.\n\"The significant progress made by goeasy over the past few years has positioned the Company to be the leading non-prime lender for everyday Canadians. Since 2001 on a normalized basis we have achieved compound annual growth rates of 12% for revenue and 29% for earnings per share. We remain unwavering in our commitment to provide our customers with the opportunity to achieve better financial outcomes and the ability to graduate towards prime credit,” said Mr. Ingram. “We are better prepared than ever before to capture a greater share of the $165 billion non-prime consumer credit market. The previously announced debt financing provides us with both sufficient capital to fund our growth over the next several quarters and a long-term structure that will enable further access to debt capital as required”. Mr. Ingram concluded, “My thanks to our entire team who continue to work tirelessly to meet and exceed the needs of our customers who are underserved by traditional financial organizations. It is clear now more than ever, that goeasy is well organized for continued success.”\nDividend Increase\nBased on its 2017 earnings and the Company’s confidence in its continued growth and access to capital going forward, the Board of Directors has approved an increase to the annual dividend from $0.72 per share to $0.90 per share, an increase of 25%. As such, the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share payable on April 13, 2018 to the holders of common shares of record as at the close of business on March 29, 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAll figures reported above with respect to outlook are targets established by the Company and are subject to change as plans and business conditions vary.
