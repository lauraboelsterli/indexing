    "text": "FRANKFURT, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Shares in Instone Real Estate Group opened at 21.50 euros in their debut on the Frankfurt stock exchange on Thursday, unchanged from the issue price.\nInstoneâ€™s market debut is the second listing in Germany this year following drugmaker Dermapharm, which fell sharply on its first day of trading last week following a slump in U.S. and Asian markets triggered by fears of higher U.S. interest rates.\nInstone stock had been offered to institutional investors at a price range of 21.50 euros to 25.50 euros but was priced at the bottom of the range on Tuesday, and the volume of the offering was reduced.
