Feb 18, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Sang-Hwa Lee (KOR) celebrates winning silver and Nao Kodaira (JPN) celebrates winning gold in the women's speed skating 500m during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Gangneung Ice Arena. Mandatory Credit: Mark Hoffman-USA TODAY Sports Japan erupted in joy, flooding social media with 1.1 million tweets using the hashtag #Hanyu-kun - an affectionate diminutive - within 90 minutes of his win. Abe also phoned Hanyu on Saturday to offer his personal congratulations. “I was quite impressed by your concentration, capable of achieving your best under such pressure,” Abe told him during the phone call reported by TV Tokyo. Kodaira followed Hanyu by setting an Olympic record of 36.94 seconds in the women’s 500m on Sunday. She also became the first female speed skater from Japan to win an Olympic title in an individual event. Reporting by Olivier Fabre, writing by Karishma Singh, editing by Darren Schuettler",
