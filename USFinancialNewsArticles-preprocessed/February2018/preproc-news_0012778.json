    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp said on Tuesday it expects to record an estimated pre-tax impairment of $429 million at its Pascua-Lama project in South America in the fourth quarter due to reclassifying its gold reserves.\nBarrick, the worldâ€™s biggest gold miner by output, also said it had formed a working group with Shandong Gold to study a potential partnership at Pascua-Lama, which straddles the border of Chile and Argentina.
