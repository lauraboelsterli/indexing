    "text": "HARRISON, NY, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One Step Vending Corp. (OTC PINK: KOSK), a holdings company operating in the convenience, vending, and micro markets space, is pleased to announce its new strategic direction of growing aggressively through acquisition.\n“The Company has been successfully deploying markets and developing its proprietary technologies, and there is an opportunity to purchase operators that have a significant footprint of stores, that are looking to exit entirely or partially in order to achieve further growth,” stated Dan Garfinkel, CEO of One Step Vending.\nThe Company believes that the opportunities in the marketplace are changing rapidly, and future success will depend on technology, bringing the right product mix, as well as having the scale of a significant footprint in the market. Management believes that it has a good product mix, and will add new product to that mix. Management also believes that it has a great technological foundation. Therefore, adding locations in the current market environment makes sense.\nMany operators in the industry are seeking ways to enhance revenue, and a partial sale to One Step Vending can achieve that. By growing the product offering, One Step Vending can double the revenue of a specific location. These growing revenues can offset the acquisition costs in the very near term, creating a win-win for the operator and One Step Vending.\nThe Company looks forward to delivering reports on their acquisitions in the near future.\nFollow us on social media:\nhttps://twitter.com/OneStepVend\nhttps://www.facebook.com/onestepvending/\nAbout One Step Vending Corporation\nOne Step Vending Corp. is a holding company focused on the acquisition of market-changing and disruptive business models.
