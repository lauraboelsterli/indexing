We also achieved several important milestones. CSWC closed its first public offering since its initial IPO in 1961, raising $57.5 million at 5.95% in Baby Bonds with a five-year maturity of December 2022. This transaction was substantially oversubscribed and our execution, at the time, had the tightest spread to applicable treasury among BDC baby bond issuers over the prior few years. We also amended, extended and upsized our ING-led credit facility during the quarter. We increased the facility by $65 million to $180 million from eight lenders, while reducing our spread and extending the maturity to the end of 2021. These transactions provide our company the necessary capital to reach our target leverage, providing the potential to substantially increase our net investment income and dividends to our shareholders.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year Portfolio and Investment Activities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated five new investments and two follow-on investments totaling $71.1 million. New investment transactions which occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 are summarized as follows:\nAmware Fulfillment LLC, $1.1 million add-on to 1 st Lien Senior Secured Debt: Amware provides logistics fulfillment services for business-to-consumer, business-to-business, and multi-channel verticals.\nElite SEM, Inc., $5.4 million add-on to 1 st Lien Senior Secured Debt, $0.1 million add-on to preferred stock: Elite SEM is a performance digital media agency.\nDelphi Intermediate Healthco, LLC, $7.5 million 1 st Lien Senior Secured Debt: Delphi Health is a behavioral health company specializing in providing chemical dependent and addiction treatment services to adults.\nLGM Pharma, $10 million 1 st Lien Senior Secured Debt, $1.1 million common stock, $3 million Revolver: LGM Pharma is a value-added distributor of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the pharmaceutical and biotech markets.\nClickbooth.com, LLC, $17.5 million 1 st Lien Senior Secured Debt, $2 million Revolver: Clickbooth.com is a performance-based digital marketing network that connects advertisers with publishers who promote their products primarily on a cost-per-action basis.\nCapital Pawn Holdings, LLC, $12.9 million 1 st Lien Senior Secured Debt: Capital Pawn owns and operates a network of pawn shops in the southeastern United States.\nResearch Now Group, Inc., $10.5 million 2 nd Lien Senior Secured Debt: Research Now is a leader in data collection through online and mobile surveys using proprietary consumer and business panels.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company received full prepayments on three investments totaling $21.1 million.

Interest income grew by $0.3 million over the prior quarter, driven by net portfolio growth.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, total operating expenses (excluding interest expense) were $3.4 million, compared to $3.5 million in the prior quarter. The decrease in operating expenses was due to a reduction in general and administrative expenses of $0.5 million offset by an increase in cash and share-based compensation of $0.4 million.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, total interest expense was $1.3 million, compared to $0.9 million in the prior quarter. The increase in interest expense was due to an $8.9 million increase in average debt outstanding on the revolving credit facility during the quarter, as well as the addition of the December 2022 Notes.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, total pre-tax net investment income was $4.3 million, compared to $4.1 million in the prior quarter.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.4 million, primarily due to the tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Capital Southwest recorded total realized and unrealized gains on investments of $5.6 million, compared to $4.7 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by strong portfolio company performance. The net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $10.2 million for the quarter, compared to $8.6 million in the prior quarter.\nThe Company’s net asset value, or NAV, at December 31, 2017 was $18.44 per share, compared to $18.26 at September 30, 2017. The increase in NAV from the prior quarter is primarily due to an increase in net realized and unrealized gains in the current quarter.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, Capital Southwest had unrestricted cash and money market balances of approximately $20.5 million.\nIn November 2017, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to its credit facility. The Amendment (1) increased the total borrowing capacity under the credit facility to $180 million, (2) increased the credit facility’s accordion feature to allow for an increase in total commitments of up to $250 million, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings to LIBOR plus 3.00%, with a step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% at the time the Company’s net worth exceeds $325 million, (4) reduced unused commitment fees to 0.50% to 1.0% per annum based on utilization, and (5) extended the revolving period that ended August 30, 2019 through November 16, 2020. Additionally, the final maturity of the credit facility was extended from August 30, 2020 to November 16, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, Capital Southwest had $35.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. Regulatory leverage at the end of the quarter was 0.3 to 1.\nIn December 2017, the Company issued $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”). The total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes was $55.8 million. The Notes mature on December 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company’s option on or after December 15, 2019. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.95% per year, payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018.\nAdditionally, I-45 SLF has total commitments outstanding of $165 million from a group of four bank lenders in its Deutsche Bank led credit facility, which is scheduled to mature in July 2022. As of December 31, 2017, I-45 SLF had $134 million in borrowings outstanding under its credit facility.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn January 25, 2016, Capital Southwest announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of its common stock at prices significantly below the Company’s net asset value per share as reported in its most recent financial statements. The Board authorized the plan because it believes that the Company’s common stock may be undervalued from time to time due to market volatility. As of December 31, 2017, no shares had been purchased under the plan.\nThird Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call and Webcast\nCapital Southwest has scheduled a conference call on Tuesday, February 6, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter 2018 financial results.
