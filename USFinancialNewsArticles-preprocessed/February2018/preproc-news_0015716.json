Third quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP operating income of $13.7 million, up 32.9% sequentially, and non-GAAP operating income of $26.0 million, up 31.5% sequentially. Third quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP diluted EPS was ($0.38), inclusive of an impact from U.S. tax reform of ($0.68). Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.47, up 34.3% sequentially and 27.0% year-over-year. Generated $24.3 million of cash flow from operating activities during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing 9.2% of revenue. Successful Polaris delisting process results in increasing ownership to at least 93% for a cash outlay of approximately $145 million.\nWESTBOROUGH, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtusa Corporation (NASDAQ GS:VRTU), a global business consulting and IT outsourcing company that accelerates business outcomes for its clients, today reported consolidated financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2018, ended December 31, 2017.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Consolidated Financial Results\nRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $263.8 million, an increase of 6.3% sequentially and 21.5% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, (1) third quarter revenue increased 6.1% sequentially and 19.9% year-over-year.\nVirtusa reported GAAP income from operations of $13.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $10.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $6.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGAAP net loss available to common shareholders for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was ($11.1) million, or ($0.38) per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and $4.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a tax expense of $19.8 million, or ($0.68) per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax expense of $14.6 million and a tax expense for re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax asset of $5.2 million.\nNon GAAP Results :\nNon-GAAP income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and acquisition related charges, was $26.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $19.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and $16.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income available to common shareholders, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition related charges, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, the tax impact of the aforementioned items, and charges related to the Tax Act for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $14.6 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $10.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and $11.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with $303.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments (2) inclusive of $25.0 million drawn down from the existing revolving credit facility to fund the Polaris delisting offer. Cash flow from operations was $24.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nPolaris Delisting and New Credit Facility\nOn February 5, 2018, Virtusa Consulting Services Private Ltd. (\"Virtusa India\"), a subsidiary of the Company, closed its delisting offer to all public shareholders of Polaris Consulting & Services Ltd. (\"Polaris\") in accordance with the provisions of the SEBI Delisting Regulations, which resulted in a discovered price of INR 480 per share. On February 8, 2018, Virtusa India accepted the discovered price of INR 480 per share (the “Exit Price”) which will be offered to all Polaris public shareholders. Upon settlement by Virtusa India of an amount of approximately $145 million, exclusive of transaction and closing costs, for the Polaris shares tendered during the delisting process at the Exit Price, the shareholding of Virtusa India shall increase from approximately 74% to at least 93% of the share capital of Polaris. Upon closing of the transaction and receipt of final approvals from the stock exchanges on which Polaris is listed, the common shares of Polaris will be delisted from all public exchanges on which the Polaris shares are traded. The public shareholders of Polaris who are yet to tender their shares to Virtusa India may offer their shares for sale to Virtusa India at the Exit Price for a period of one year following the date of the delisting from all stock exchanges on which Polaris' common shares are listed.\nIn support of the transaction, on February 6, 2018, Virtusa entered into a $450.0 million credit agreement with a syndicated bank group jointly lead by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, which replaces Virtusa’s existing $300.0 million credit agreement. The new credit agreement provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, a $180.0 million term loan facility, and a $70.0 million delayed-draw term loan. Virtusa drew down $180.0 million on the new term loan and $55.0 million on the new revolving credit facility to repay in full the prior credit facility and fund the Polaris delisting transaction, including transaction related fees and expenses. Interest under this new credit facility accrues at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 3.0%, subject to step-downs based on the Company’s ratio of debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense (“EBITDA”). The Company intends to enter into an interest rate swap agreement to minimize interest rate exposure. The Credit Agreement includes maximum debt to EBITDA and minimum fixed charge coverage covenants. The term of the Credit Agreement is five years, ending February 6, 2023.\nManagement Commentary\nKris Canekeratne, Virtusa’s Chairman and CEO, stated, “Virtusa’s competitive advantage lies in our deeply grounded and unique ability to deliver large scale digital transformation combined with legacy IT platform rationalization, cost reduction and effort compression. As digital engineers, we understand how to bridge the tasks and deliver end-to-end digital programs that yield tangible results for our clients. Our strong third quarter and year-to-date results are proof positive that our strategy is working and our advantage is real. In consequence, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate above-industry growth.”\nRanjan Kalia, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We are pleased to deliver another quarter of strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin improvement, as well as robust operating cash flow. We expect this momentum to carry over into our fiscal fourth quarter, and have raised the midpoint of our FY 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Additionally, we are very pleased to be able to successfully close the Polaris delisting process, which will be accretive to our stockholders. ”\nFinancial Outlook\nVirtusa management provided the following current financial guidance:\nFourth quarter fiscal 2018 revenue is expected to be in the range of $274.0 to $280.0 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.27, exclusive of any changes to provisional amounts related to the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.57. Fiscal year 2018 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,013.3 to $1,019.3 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.12 (3) , exclusive of any changes to provisional amounts related to the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.65 (4) . Virtusa anticipates incurring a restructuring charge of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 as it completes its previously announced resource optimization initiatives, which began in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This charge is reflected in the GAAP EPS guidance, and not included in the non-GAAP EPS guidance.\nIn accordance with US GAAP, Virtusa will be applying the if-converted method to its convertible preferred shares when reporting its fiscal year 2018 results. The if-converted method is used to calculate the share impact of convertible securities. Under this method, only when the convertible securities are considered dilutive are they then included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding in reported results and full year guidance.\nThird quarter GAAP loss per share was calculated by including the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares in net income available to common stockholders and excluding the impact of the convertible preferred shares from the weighted average shares. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was calculated by excluding the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares from net income available to common stockholders and including the impact of the convertible preferred shares in the weighted average shares outstanding as these shares were dilutive on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS guidance was calculated under the assumption that these convertible securities will be anti-dilutive in the fiscal fourth quarter 2018. Thus, in determining full fiscal year 2018 GAAP EPS guidance, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are deducted from net income available to common stockholders and the convertible preferred shares have been excluded from weighted average shares outstanding. In determining Non-GAAP EPS guidance for full fiscal year 2018, dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares are deducted from net income available to common stockholders and the convertible preferred shares have been excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. For the remaining fiscal quarters of 2018, Non-GAAP EPS guidance was determined by excluding the impact of dividends and accretion on the convertible preferred shares from net income available to common stockholders and including the impact of the convertible preferred shares in the weighted average shares outstanding as shares were dilutive for these quarters.\nThe Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 diluted GAAP EPS estimates are based on average share counts of approximately 30.4 million and 30.1 million, respectively, (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). The Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 diluted non-GAAP EPS estimates are based on average share counts of approximately 33.4 million and 32.4 million, respectively, (assuming no further exercises of stock-based awards). GAAP and non-GAAP average share counts assume a stock price of $45.12, which was derived from the average closing price of the Company’s stock over the five trading days ended on February 2, 2018. Deviations from this stock price may cause actual diluted EPS to vary based on share dilution from Virtusa’s stock-based awards.\nConference Call and Webcast\nVirtusa will host a conference call today, February 8, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s third quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, current financial guidance, and other corporate developments.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with Virtusa’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nVirtusa believes the following financial measures will provide additional insights to measure the operational performance of the business.\nVirtusa presents constant currency revenue growth rates to provide insights into, and a framework for assessing, how Virtusa's revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations (see footnote 1). Virtusa presents a reconciliation of its cash and cash equivalents to total cash, cash equivalents, short term and long term investments which Virtusa believes provides insight into its cash position and overall liquidity (see footnote 2). Virtusa also presents the following consolidated statements of income (loss) measures that exclude, when applicable, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, the tax impact of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries and the impact from the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation (“Tax Act”) to provide further insights into the comparison of Virtusa’s operating results among the periods: Non-GAAP income from operations: income from operations, as reported on Virtusa’s consolidated statements of income, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges. Non-GAAP operating margin: non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of reported revenues. Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders: net income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders, as reported on our consolidated statements of income (loss), excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, the tax impact of the above items, the tax impact of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and the impact from the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: diluted earnings (loss) per share, as reported on Virtusa’s consolidated statements of income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders, excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, restructuring charges, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, the tax impact of the above items, the per share tax impact of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and the per share impact from the Tax Act. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is also subject to dilutive and anti-dilutive requirements of the if-converted method related to our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock that could result in a difference between GAAP to non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure:\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP income from operations $ 13,663 $ 6,458 $ 30,012 $ 8,147 Add: Stock-based compensation expense 9,118 4,748 20,048 17,023 Add: Acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges (a) 3,227 5,116 9,087 11,787 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 26,008 $ 16,322 $ 59,147 $ 36,957 GAAP operating margin 5.2 % 3.0 % 4.1 % 1.3 % Effect of above adjustments to income from operations 4.7 % 4.5 % 3.9 % 4.6 % Non-GAAP operating margin 9.9 % 7.5 % 8.0 % 5.9 % GAAP net income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders $ (11,142 ) $ 4,435 $ (4,504 ) $ 1,393 Add: Stock-based compensation expense 9,118 4,748 20,048 17,023 Add: Acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges (a) 3,227 5,116 9,087 11,787 Add: Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses (b) (2,576 ) 1,252 (1,019 ) 2,802 Add: Impact from Tax Act (h) 19,815 - 19,815 - Tax adjustments (c) (3,210 ) (4,198 ) (9,798 ) (7,397 ) Noncontrolling interest, net of taxes (d) (647 ) (319 ) (1,326 ) (875 ) Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders $ 14,585 $ 11,034 $ 32,303 $ 24,733 GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share (f) $ (0.38 ) $ 0.15 $ (0.15 ) $ 0.05 Effect of stock-based compensation expense (g) 0.28 0.16 0.63 0.56 Effect of acquisition-related charges and restructuring charges (a) (g) 0.10 0.17 0.28 0.39 Effect of foreign currency transaction (gains) losses (b) (g) (0.08 ) 0.04 (0.03 ) 0.09 Effect of tax impact from Tax Act (g) (h) 0.60 - 0.62 - Effect of tax adjustments (c) (g) (0.10 ) (0.14 ) (0.31 ) (0.24 ) Effect of noncontrolling interest (d) (g) (0.02 ) (0.01 ) (0.04 ) (0.03 ) Effect on dividend on Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (f) (g) 0.03 - 0.07 - Effect of change in dilutive shares for non-GAAP (f) 0.04 - 0.01 - Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (e) (g) $ 0.47 $ 0.37 $ 1.08 $ 0.82 (a) Acquisition-related charges include, when applicable, amortization of purchased intangibles, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs including integration expenses consisting of outside professional and consulting services and direct and incremental travel costs.

(d) Noncontrolling interest represents the minority shareholders interest of Polaris (e) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is subject to rounding (f) During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average shares outstanding of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of 3,000,000 and 2,637,363, respectively, were excluded from the calculations of GAAP diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive using the if-converted method.\nThe following table provides the non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders and non-GAAP dilutive weighted average shares outstanding using if-converted method to calculate the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Nine Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders $ 14,585 $ 11,034 $ 32,303 $ 24,733 Add: Dividends and accretion on Series A Convertible Preferred Stock $ 1,087 $ - $ 2,175 $ - Non-GAAP net income available to Virtusa common stockholders and\nassumed conversion\n$ 15,672 $ 11,034 $ 34,478 $ 24,733 GAAP dilutive weighted average shares outstanding 29,295,730 30,151,590 29,387,977 30,129,378 Add: Dilutive effect of employee stock options and unvested restricted\nstock awards and restricted stock units\n709,961 - 637,830 - Add: Series A Convertible Preferred Stock as converted 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 - Non-GAAP dilutive weighted average shares outstanding 33,005,691 30,151,590 32,025,807 30,129,378 (g) To the extent the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is dilutive using the if-converted method, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is included in the weighted average shares outstanding to determine non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. (h) The U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a tax expense of $19.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, comprised of a provisional repatriation tax expense of $14.6 million and a provisional net deferred tax expense of $5.2 million. The adjustment to GAAP net income (loss) available to Virtusa common stockholders only includes these provisional impacts. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. Footnotes\n(1) To determine sequential revenue change in constant currency for the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue from entities reporting in U.K. Pounds (GBP), Euros, and Swedish Krona (SEK) were converted into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the three months ended September 30, 2017, rather than the actual exchange rate in effect for the three months ended December 31, 2017. To determine year-over-year revenue change in constant currency for the Company's third quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue from entities reporting in U.K. Pounds (GBP), Euros, and Swedish Krona (SEK) were converted into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the three months ended December 31, 2016, rather than the actual exchange rate in effect for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The average exchange rates for the three months ended December 31, 2016, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2017 are presented in the following table:\nAverage U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2017 GBP 1.24 1.31 1.33 Euro 1.08 1.18 1.18 SEK 0.11 0.12 0.12 (2) The Company considers the total measure of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments to be an important indicator of the Company's overall liquidity. All of the Company's investments are classified as available-for-sale, including the Company's long-term investments which consist of fixed income securities, including government agency bonds and municipal and corporate bonds, which meet the credit rating and diversification requirements of the Company's investment policy as approved by the Company's audit committee and board of directors.\n(3) In accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (EPS), we excluded potential dilutive common shares from our third quarter EPS computations due to the anti-dilutive impact that these shares would have had due to the net loss for this period. However, as we are forecasting to be in a net income position for the full fiscal year 2018, we included these potential dilutive common shares in our EPS computation for full fiscal year 2018. Therefore, fiscal year 2018 forecasted US GAAP EPS will not equal the sum of the Company’s 2018 quarterly EPS computations.\n(4) Earnings per share amounts for each quarter may not necessarily total to the yearly earnings per share due to the weighting of shares outstanding on a quarterly and year to date basis.\n(5) On March 3, 2016 Virtusa acquired a majority interest in Polaris. In accordance with US GAAP, Polaris financial results for the quarter ending December 31, 2017 and assets and liabilities as of that date have been consolidated in full into Virtusa’s financial statements. Net assets attributable to ownership in Polaris by minority shareholders (Non-controlling Interest) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $95.2 million at December 31, 2017. Profit attributable to minority shareholders (Non-controlling Interest) in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $2.1 million on a GAAP basis and $2.8 million on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter ending December 31, 2017.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding, the benefits of Virtusa’s organizational changes, management's forecast of financial performance, the growth of our business and management's plans, objectives, and strategies.
