View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221005823/en/\n(Photo: Business Wire)\nThis prestigious award recognizes Department of Defense (DoD) civilian and military organizations, groups, or teams who have demonstrated exemplary innovation and best practices in their approach to program management, demonstrated innovation and technical excellence in the acquisition of products and services to achieve more cost-effective acquisition outcomes for the Warfighter and the taxpayer.\nAWP is the first Agile contract where NGA pays a fixed price for development capacity (e.g. Scrum Teams) rather than pre-determined deliverables or labor hours. This contracting model allows the government flexibility to adjust its purchased capacity based on its backlog and available funding while prioritizing those features that are most important to enhancing customers’ user experience. This unique fixed price Agile model emphasizes the importance of the relationship between government and contractor where all aspects of planning, execution, and delivery are fully transparent and communications are strong between both parties. The successful software deliveries to date and the realized cost savings to the government in executing this model, make it an ideal option moving forward for NGA, the Intelligence Community, and Federal government when purchasing Agile development services.\n“The award demonstrates our commitment to innovation, and a true partnership between our government customer and Octo. This type of collaboration can generate lasting results that bolster not only agency goals, but enhance our national security,” said Mehul Sanghani, Octo’s CEO.\nAbout Octo Consulting Group\nOcto is an industry-leading, award-winning provider of technology and modernization services for the Federal government. Octo specializes in providing agile software development, user experience design, and cloud engineering services that address the government’s most pressing missions and modernization challenges.\nOcto is one of only 11 private companies in the United States to have been appraised at CMMI® Level 4 for Software Development Maturity (CMMI-DEV). Additionally, Octo maintains ISO 9001, ISO 20000, and ISO 27001 certifications and is one of only seven government contractors that is a Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe ® ) Gold Partner: an industry-accepted framework for developing software applications using Agile development principles.\nHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, Octo has additional offices in Alexandria, Virginia and Columbia, Maryland.
