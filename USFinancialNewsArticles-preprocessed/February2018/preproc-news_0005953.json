    "text": "Statewide Commission Welcomes Commissioner\nSACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First 5 California, also known as the California Children and Families Commission, welcomes Monica Fitzgerald, associate professor of women's history, civic-learning, and democratic engagement at Saint Mary’s College of California (SMC).\nProfessor Fitzgerald is the newest Senate appointee to the statewide commission charged with overseeing issues related to children ages 0 to 5 years and their families.\n“We are pleased to welcome Professor Fitzgerald as she joins us in our continuing effort to improve the lives of California’s children and families,” said Camille Maben, Executive Director of First 5 California. “Professor Fitzgerald will bring a unique lens and expertise to our work on the gender equity crisis of child care vacuums and inadequate family leave,” added Ms. Maben.\nProfessor Fitzgerald is Director of the Justice, Community, and Leadership Program at SMC and is active in women’s issues, women in politics, and the women’s movement. Ms. Fitzgerald teaches courses on social justice, U.S. history, and gender studies, and also studies second-wave feminism.\n“I am excited for the opportunity to serve the families of California,” said Professor Fitzgerald. “I have spent my entire adult life working on policies that will improve the lives of women, children, and families. The commission will be a vehicle to bring these policy ideas to reality.”\nProfessor Fitzgerald was appointed to fill the position previously occupied by Joyce Iseri and will be sworn in at the April Commission meeting.\nFirst 5 California was established in 1998 when voters passed Proposition 10, which taxes tobacco products to fund services for children ages 0 to 5 and their families. First 5 California programs and resources are designed to educate and support teachers, parents, and caregivers in the critical role they play during a child's first five years – to help California kids receive the best possible start in life and thrive.
