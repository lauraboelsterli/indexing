Fourth quarter 2017 value-added sales grew 25% to a record $181.2 million, from prior-year value-added sales of $145.1 million. Operating profit for the fourth quarter 2017 was $13.9 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted operating profit improved 89% to $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $7.2 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 net loss of ($0.41) per share, diluted, due primarily to the impact of U.S. tax reform, compared to earnings of $0.33 per share in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings were up 82% at $0.51 per share, diluted, from $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company is providing full-year 2018 earnings guidance of $1.95 to $2.10 per share, diluted.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nNet sales for fourth quarter 2017 were $308.7 million, compared to $234.3 million for the prior year. Value-added sales grew 25% to a record $181.2 million in the quarter, compared to $145.1 million for the prior year. Growth in value-added sales was driven by a 17% increase in the base business, plus the acquisition of Heraeus’ high-performance target materials business (HTB) which contributed $11.6 million. Base business growth was driven by new product sales and improved end market demand. New product sales reached a record $31.0 million in the quarter, up 20% compared to the prior year.\nOperating profit for fourth quarter 2017 totaled $13.9 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. Excluding non-recurring items, fourth quarter adjusted operating profit improved 89% to $13.6 million from $7.2 million in 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 net loss was $8.2 million, or ($0.41) per share, diluted, and was driven by $21.6 million of income tax expense primarily related to U.S. tax reform, and compares to net income of $6.8 million in the prior year. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017, which exclude non-recurring charges related primarily to new tax legislation, the gain on sale of the Fukaya, Japan service center, and CEO transition costs, were $0.51 per share, diluted, up over 80% compared to $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter 2016.\nFULL-YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nFor the full-year 2017, net sales were $1.1 billion compared to $969.2 million for 2016. Value-added sales were a record $677.7 million, compared to $599.9 million for the prior year. Year-over-year growth of 13% in value-added sales is attributable to new product sales growth, strength in end markets and the HTB acquisition.\nNet income for 2017 was $11.5 million or $0.56 per share, diluted, as compared to $25.7 million or $1.27 per share in the prior year. Excluding special items, net income for 2017 was $35.2 million, or $1.72 per share, diluted, as compared to $26.6 million, or $1.32 per share, for the prior year.\nJugal Vijayvargiya, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased with our strong finish to the year. Fourth quarter results represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both value-added sales and profits. We have momentum going into 2018, and expect to consistently deliver profitable growth as we execute on our growth strategy. As a result, we are forecasting full-year 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.95 to $2.10 per diluted share.”\nBUSINESS SEGMENT FOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nAdvanced Materials\nAdvanced Materials’ net sales for fourth quarter 2017 were $161.2 million, versus $108.3 million in the prior year. Value-added sales increased 42% to $58.3 million, versus $41.2 million in the prior year. HTB acquisition contributed $11.6 million of value-added sales, while the base business growth of 13% was led by strength in the consumer electronics end market. Operating profit increased 44% to $7.9 million, compared to $5.5 million in the prior year.\nPerformance Alloys and Composites\nNet sales for Performance Alloys and Composites were $119.0 million compared to $95.5 million in the prior year. Value-added sales were a record $101.0 million in the fourth quarter versus $83.2 million in the prior year. The 21% year-over-year improvement in value-added sales was primarily driven by new product sales growth and end market demand, particularly in the consumer electronics, defense, and commercial aerospace markets.\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.5 million compared to $0.5 million in the prior year. Excluding the gain on sale and related closure costs associated with exiting the Fukaya, Japan service center, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $8.2 million, versus $3.1 million in the prior year. The significant year-over-year profit increase of $5.1 million or 165% was led by performance improvements across the business, new product sales growth, and an improved product mix.\nPrecision Coatings\nPrecision Coatings’ net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $28.5 million versus prior-year sales of $30.5 million. Value-added sales were $22.9 million, a 3% increase compared to $22.2 million for the same period of 2016. Operating profit increased 28% to $2.3 million, or 10% of value-added sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $1.8 million in the prior year.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company delivered favorable full-year 2017 financial results on both top and bottom line, led by performance improvements across the business, record new product sales, and improved end market demand. We expect this performance to continue and are providing 2018 full-year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.95 to $2.10 per share, diluted, which represents a year-over-year increase of 13 to 22 percent.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS GUIDANCE\nIt is not possible for the Company to identify the amount or significance of future adjustments associated with potential insurance and litigation claims, legacy environmental costs, acquisition and integration costs, certain income tax items, or other non-routine costs that the Company adjusts in the presentation of adjusted earnings guidance. These items are dependent on future events that are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, the Company is unable to reconcile without unreasonable effort the forecasted range of adjusted earnings guidance for the full year to a comparable GAAP range. However, items excluded from the Company's adjusted earnings guidance include the historical adjustments noted in Attachments 4 and 5 to this press release.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nMaterion Corporation will host an investor conference call with analysts at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, February 15, 2018.

gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper is passed through to customers and, therefore, the trends and comparisons of net sales are affected by movements in the market price of these metals. Internally, management also reviews net sales on a value-added basis. Value-added sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that deducts the value of the pass-through metals sold from net sales. Value-added sales allows management to assess the impact of differences in net sales between periods or segments and analyze the resulting margins and profitability without the distortion of the movements in pass-through metal prices. The dollar amount of gross margin and operating profit is not affected by the value-added sales calculation. The Company sells other metals and materials that are not considered direct pass throughs, and these costs are not deducted from net sales to calculate value-added sales.\nThe Company’s pricing policy is to pass the cost of these metals on to customers in order to mitigate the impact of price volatility on the Company’s results from operations. Value-added information is being presented since changes in metal prices may not directly impact profitability. It is the Company’s intent to allow users of the financial statements to review sales with and without the impact of the pass-through metals.\nAttachment 5\nMaterion Corporation and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Profitability Fourth Quarter Ended Year Ended (Millions except per share amounts) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 GAAP as Reported Net Sales $ 308.7 $ 234.3 $ 1,139.5 $ 969.2 Operating profit 13.9 3.6 38.6 27.1 Net income (loss) (8.2 ) 6.8 11.5 25.7 EPS - Diluted $ (0.41 ) $ 0.33 $ 0.56 $ 1.27 Operating Profit Special Items Cost reductions $ (1.3 ) $ 2.6 $ 0.7 $ 2.6 Legacy legal & environmental costs 0.3 — 0.5 1.4 CEO transition 0.7 — 4.1 — Acquisition costs — 1.0 2.1 3.9 Total operating profit special items $ (0.3 ) $ 3.6 $ 7.4 $ 7.9 Operating Profit Special Items - net of tax $ (0.2 ) $ 2.3 $ 4.8 $ 5.1 Tax Special Item $ 18.9 $ (3.3 ) $ 18.9 $ (4.2 ) Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Profitability Value-added (VA) sales $ 181.2 $ 145.1 $ 677.7 $ 599.9 Operating profit 13.6 7.2 46.0 35.0 Operating profit % of VA 7.5 % 5.0 % 6.8 % 5.8 % Net income 10.5 5.8 35.2 26.6 EPS - Diluted $ 0.51 $ 0.28 $ 1.72 $ 1.32 In addition to presenting financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains financial measures, including operating profit, segment operating profit, net income, and earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis. As detailed in the above reconciliation and Attachment 4, we have adjusted the results for certain special items such as CEO transition costs, cost reduction initiatives (i.e., asset impairment charges and severance), legacy environmental costs, merger and acquisition costs, and certain income tax items from the applicable GAAP financial measure.
