This marks the 10 th consecutive quarter of growth. Earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share were $0.08 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.49 in the same quarter of the prior year. Results were reduced by approximately $0.40 per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share due to tax charges primarily related to U.S. tax legislation enacted during the quarter. Total revenues increased 7.4 percent, which consisted of organic revenue growth of 3.2 percent and an increase of 4.2 percent due to foreign currency translation. Earnings per diluted Class A Common Share guidance for the full year ending July 31, 2018 was increased to a range of $1.90 to $2.00, exclusive of tax charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. tax legislation.\nMILWAUKEE, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brady Corporation (NYSE:BRC) (“Brady” or “Company”), a world leader in identification solutions, today reported its financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nQuarter Ended January 31, 2018 Financial Results:\nEarnings before income taxes increased 20.4 percent, finishing at $35.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $29.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNet earnings for the quarter ended January 31, 2018, were $4.3 million compared to $25.3 million in the same quarter last year. During the quarter ended January 31, 2018, net earnings were reduced by $21.1 million due to income tax charges primarily related to the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The prior year quarter ended January 31, 2017 was impacted by a cash repatriation which resulted in a lower than normal income tax rate.\nEarnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share were $0.08 for the quarter ended January 31, 2018, compared to $0.49 in the same quarter last year. Income tax expense in the prior year quarter ended January 31, 2017 was impacted by a cash repatriation which increased earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share by approximately $0.09, whereas the impact on income tax expense for the quarter ended January 31, 2018 from tax charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. tax legislation was a reduction in earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share of approximately $0.40.\nSales for the quarter ended January 31, 2018 increased 7.4 percent to $287.8 million compared to $268.0 million in the same quarter last year. By segment, sales increased 8.1 percent in Identification Solutions and 5.6 percent in Workplace Safety, which consisted of organic sales growth of 4.7 percent in Identification Solutions and an organic sales decline of 0.5 percent in Workplace Safety.\nSix-Month Period Ended January 31, 2018 Financial Results:\nEarnings before income taxes increased 16.1 percent, finishing at $69.8 million for the six-month period ended January 31, 2018, compared to $60.1 million for the six-month period ended January 31, 2017.\nNet earnings for the six-month period ended January 31, 2018 were $30.1 million compared to $47.9 million for the six-month period ended January 31, 2017. During the six-month period ended January 31, 2018, net earnings were reduced by $21.1 million due to tax charges primarily related to the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The prior year six-month period ended January 31, 2017 was impacted by a cash repatriation which resulted in a lower than normal income tax rate.\nEarnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share were $0.57 for the six-month period ended January 31, 2018, compared to $0.93 in the same six-month period last year. Income tax expense in the prior year six-month period ended January 31, 2017 was impacted by a cash repatriation which increased earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share by approximately $0.09, whereas the impact on income tax expense for the six-month period ended January 31, 2018 from tax charges primarily related to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation was a reduction of approximately $0.40 of earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share.\nSales for the six-month period ended January 31, 2018 increased 5.4 percent to $577.9 million compared to $548.2 million in the same six-month period last year. By segment, sales increased 6.1 percent in Identification Solutions and 3.7 percent in Workplace Safety, which consisted of organic sales growth of 3.8 percent in Identification Solutions and an organic sales decline of 1.0 percent in Workplace Safety.\nCommentary:\n“Our investment in the development of innovative, high-quality products is paying off as we generated more than three percent organic sales growth this quarter, which was driven by our Identification Solutions business. This marks our tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year pre-tax earnings improvement, which was a direct result of our focus on driving organic growth while achieving sustainable efficiency gains throughout our SG&A structure,” said Brady’s President and Chief Executive Officer, J. Michael Nauman. “We expect to continue this positive organic sales trend as we gain momentum in our research and development processes and through the execution of our strategy in our Workplace Safety business. Our focus is consistent and remains on the long-term by taking actions today that we believe will result in organic sales growth and profit improvements into the future.”\n“Organic sales growth and our continued focus on efficiency opportunities throughout SG&A were the drivers of our profit improvement this quarter,” said Brady’s Chief Financial Officer, Aaron Pearce. “We used our cash generation to return funds to our shareholders and to repay debt. We repaid $27.9 million in debt during the quarter and finished in a net cash position of $44.1 million as of January 31, 2018. Our balance sheet continues to provide significant flexibility for investments in growth opportunities to drive long-term value for our shareholders.”\nFiscal 2018 Guidance:\nThe Company is increasing its full year fiscal 2018 earnings per diluted Class A Nonvoting Common Share guidance from its previous range of $1.85 to $1.95 to a range of $1.90 to $2.00, exclusive of tax charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Included in this guidance is low-single digit organic sales growth, depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $26 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $20 million during the year ending July 31, 2018. The Company expects its full-year income tax rate, exclusive of charges primarily related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, to range from approximately 27 percent to 29 percent. This guidance is based upon foreign exchange rates as of January 31, 2018.\nA webcast regarding Brady’s fiscal 2018 second quarter financial results will be available at www.bradycorp.com beginning at 9:30 a.m. Central Time today.\nBrady Corporation is an international manufacturer and marketer of complete solutions that identify and protect people, products and places.

For Brady, uncertainties arise from: our ability to compete effectively or to successfully execute our strategy; Brady’s ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands; difficulties in protecting our websites, networks, and systems against security breaches; decreased demand for our products; Brady’s ability to retain large customers; extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities; Brady’s ability to execute facility consolidations and maintain acceptable operational service metrics; litigation, including product liability claims; risks associated with the loss of key employees; divestitures and contingent liabilities from divestitures; Brady’s ability to properly identify, integrate, and grow acquired companies; foreign currency fluctuations; the impact of the Tax Reform Act and any other changes in tax legislation and tax rates; potential write-offs of Brady’s substantial intangible assets; differing interests of voting and non-voting shareholders; Brady’s ability to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements; numerous other matters of national, regional and global scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive, and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited to, those factors listed in the “Risk Factors” section within Item 1A of Part I of Brady’s Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2017.\nThese uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in its forward-looking statements.
