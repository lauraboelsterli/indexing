    "text": "Commitment to television news production or digital news as a career. Solid writing skills. Demonstrated ability to work successfully in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment. Proven leadership skills. \nHow to Apply \nPlease send your answers to the below questions, resume and cover letter to: In terms of diverse life experiences, what separates you from the rest of the candidates applying to the program? Identify an issue that was recently covered in the news and explain why you think it was (or was not) newsworthy. Write about an experience, place or person that triggered your interest in journalism. Media outlets have long been described as having a responsibility to the public. What does this responsibility mean to you and can this responsibility be abused? Compare and contrast the differences between digital and broadcast storytelling. What are the benefits and drawbacks of each format? Identify a societal issue that seldom attracts the attention of the news media. How would you cover this issue as a journalist? Which journalism associations, if any, are you affiliated with? Which professional publications (e.g. trade magazines), if any, do you subscribe to? Please describe your perspective on how recent domestic or global economic, or business news events have been covered by one or more broadcast or cable news outlets. Will you now, or in the future, need sponsorship from an employer in order to obtain, extend or renew your authorization to work in the U.S.? Please indicate which languages you are conversationally fluent. \nApplications will be accepted starting January 23, 2018 and will close on March 30, 2018 at 5 pm ET. \nWhat Happens Next \nDue to the high volume of applications we receive, we regret that we will only be able to respond to those students in whom we have interest. If you are contacted for an interview, in most cases, you will speak with someone on the CNBC hiring team, take a writing test and be brought in for in-person interviews. \nSalary \nWe offer a competitive salary, great on-campus perks and the professional advantages of an environment that supports your development and recognizes your achievements. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. ",
