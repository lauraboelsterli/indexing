The insurer posted a 2017 net profit of 6.21 billion euros ($7.62 billion), while analysts had on average forecast net profit of 5.97 billion euros in a Reuters poll. The company proposed a 2017 dividend of 1.26 euros a share, up 9 percent and corresponding to a payout ratio of 49 percent. The dividend topped analysts estimates of 1.20 euros. “Health was our fastest growing business in 2017,” AXA said in a statement, adding that the company had for the first time crossed a 6 billion euros mark in underlying earnings. They were up 6 percent at 6.002 billion euros. Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva and Matthieu ProtardEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta",
