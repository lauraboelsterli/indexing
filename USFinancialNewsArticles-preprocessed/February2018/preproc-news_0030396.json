    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Martha A. Q. Curley, PhD, RN, FAAN, a professor in Nursing Science at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Nursing, has been appointed the Ruth M. Colket Endowed Chair in Pediatric Nursing at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).\nThe CHOP Research Institute recently completed a comprehensive research strategy plan to reaffirm CHOP as a world leader in a new era of pediatric research and innovation aimed at solving the most challenging problems in child health.\n\"We are pleased to appoint Dr. Curley to her new role, which will help to foster interdisciplinary and inter-institutional research in child health across CHOP and Penn Nursing\" said Paula Agosto, RN, MHA, Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at CHOP.\nDr. Curley's research, funded by NHLBI, NINR and NICHD, has focused on nurse-implemented interventions in pediatric care. Over several decades, her studies have illuminated relationship-based care when partnering with parents of critically ill children, supported parent presence during invasive procedures and resuscitation, and informed the practice of caring for critically ill pediatric patients with acute respiratory failure. She has also led the development and dissemination of core metrics in the field of pediatrics, such as the State Behavioral Scale (SBS), the Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WAT-1), individualized numeric rating scale (INRS) and the Braden QD scale. Dr. Curley is also a member of the National Academy of Medicine and a fellow in the American Academy of Nursing.\nAbout Children's Hospital of Philadelphia: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was founded in 1855 as the nation's first pediatric hospital. Through its long-standing commitment to providing exceptional patient care, training new generations of pediatric healthcare professionals, and pioneering major research initiatives, Children's Hospital has fostered many discoveries that have benefited children worldwide. Its pediatric research program is among the largest in the country. In addition, its unique family-centered care and public service programs have brought the 546-bed hospital recognition as a leading advocate for children and adolescents.
