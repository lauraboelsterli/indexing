    "text": "(Reuters) - A beloved assistant football coach who acted as a human shield to save others was among the 17 people killed in South Florida when a gunman opened fire this week in the second-deadliest shooting ever at a public school in the United States.\nThe suspect, a reputed gun lover who had been expelled from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, was charged on Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, a day after the massacre.\nFollowing are profiles of some of the victims, whose names were not officially released but whose loved ones posted memorials on social media:\nAARON FEIS, 37, COACH Altruism and courage are what drove Feis, an assistant football coach, to give his life to save others, the local sheriff and others said.\n“The kids in this community loved him, they adored him ... He was killed tragically, inhumanely, he did it protecting others,” Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told a news conference.\nIn a tweet, the high school football team said Feis, who was married with a baby daughter, “selflessly shielded students from the shooter when he was shot. He died a hero.”\nSCOTT BEIGEL, 35, SOCIAL SCIENCE TEACHER A favorite teacher known for his selflessness, Beigel was seen trying to lock his classroom door to protect his students when he was killed, pupil Kelsey Friend told local media. She texted her mother as Beigel lay bleeding, “My teacher’s on the ground!” her mother told local media.\nBeigel also served as a staff member at Camp Starlight, a predominately Jewish summer camp in Starlight, Pennsylvania, which said in a Facebook post that he was a “beloved friend and hero.”\nCHRIS HIXON, 49, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR Like his father before him, Hixon was a wrestling coach who inspired all of the school’s athletic teams to give their best, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper. As a result, under Hixon’s leadership, the Eagle’s baseball team won a state and national championship in 2016. Hixon, who had children of his own, was married.\nALYSSA AL HADEFF, 15, STUDENT Al Hadeff was a dual athlete in track and soccer, her grandmother told Miami television station. Parkland Soccer Club said on Facebook that she was a “loved and well respected member of our club” who would be “greatly missed.”\nStudent Nicholas Dworet, a victim of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, appears in a photo from social media received February 15, 2018. Social media/Handout via REUTERS JAIME GUTTENBERG, STUDENT Guttenberg, a freshman who was a talented dancer, was a graceful as a gazelle while delighting her dance teachers with an impish sense of humor, according to Facebook posts. “Dance in Heaven beautiful girl,” posted mentor Michelle McGrath Gerlick.\nMARTIN DUQUE, 14, STUDENT Brotherly love seemed to infuse the life of Martin Duque, who local media described as a freshman whose older brother Miguel graduated from Douglas High last year.\nAlongside an Instagram photograph of the brothers embracing in a handshake, Quote: : ”Words can not describe my pain ... I love brother Martin you’ll be missed buddy.”\nGINA ROSE MONTALTO, 14, STUDENT The school’s Color Guard was made that much brighter when 14-year-old Montalto joined the squad, her instructors said on social media. “She was a smart, loving, caring and strong girl who brightened any room she entered,” her mother said on Facebook.\nJOAQUIN OLIVER, 17, STUDENT The Venezuela-born senior had a strong appreciation for music and sports, according to the trail of social media posts he left behind. A new U.S. citizen, the extroverted Oliver often joked around but also was very caring, friends told The Daily Beast.\nMEADOW POLLACK, 18, STUDENT The excitement of college loomed for Pollack, a senior who planned to attend Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, her father told the Palm Beach Post.\nFamily grounded her, she said on Facebook. “Nothing makes me happier than my grandma and her smile,” read one of her posts.\nCARMEN SCHENTRUP, STUDENT An outstanding student, Schentrup distinguished herself in her senior year as a 2018 National Merit Scholar semifinalist.\nNICHOLAS DWORET, 17, STUDENT Dworet, a star athlete, loved swimming. His talent and skills landed him a swimming scholarship to the University of Indianapolis, according to a tweet from @ggreenwald.\nReporting by Max Lockie and Barbara Goldberg in New York; Editing by Tom Brown and Jonathan Oatis\n ",
