Five people were rescued. \nThe cause of Wednesday nightâ€™s fire in the city of Sapporo, on the island of Hokkaido, was still being investigated and victims were still being identified, police said. \nPublic broadcaster NHK coverage of the fire showed flames engulfing the three-storey building surrounded by piles of snow. Aerial footage from Thursday morning showed the blackened, smokey remains of the building. \nThree of the survivors were being treated at hospital but their condition was not life-threatening, police said.

Renters paid 36,000 yen ($330) a month, it said. \nJapan is a rapidly ageing society. Over 35 million Japanese people were 65 or older last year, or 27.8 percent of the total population, up from 21.5 percent a decade ago, government data showed.
