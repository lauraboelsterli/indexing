Fourth quarter 2017 reported EPS of ($0.87) per diluted share compared to $1.16 per diluted share for the comparable prior year quarter, which includes a provisional one-time non-cash charge of $153 million, or ($2.01) per adjusted 1 diluted share, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Adjusted 2 earnings per adjusted 1 diluted share of $1.29 increased 29% compared to $1.00 per diluted share for the comparable prior year quarter. Reiterates FY 2018 volume point guidance range of 2% to 6% growth as well as reported and adjusted 2 diluted EPS guidance of $3.82 to $4.22 and $4.60 to $5.00. Announces new executive organization structure.\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF) reports results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“After a year of transition, we returned to net sales growth in the fourth quarter as expected, and we anticipate stronger net sales growth for the full year in 2018,” said Rich Goudis, CEO of Herbalife. “This growth is due to the determination and hard work of our talented independent distributors and employees around the globe who are continuously looking for ways to fulfill our purpose to make the world healthier and happier.”\nThe Company reported fourth quarter 2017 volume points of 1.3 billion, which represents a decline of 1.8%, compared to the prior year period, in line with the pre-announcement issued on January 8, 2018. Reported fourth quarter 2017 net sales of $1.1 billion increased 4.6%, while constant currency net sales increased 3.4%, both compared to the same period in 2016.\nOn a reported basis, fourth quarter 2017 net loss was $63.4 million, or ($0.87) per diluted share, which includes a provisional charge of $153.3 million, or ($2.01) per adjusted 1 diluted share, related to the Tax Act, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $99.4 million, or $1.16 per diluted share. The provisional charge related to the Tax Act is subject to continued evaluation and adjustment in future periods as additional information becomes available and further analysis is completed.\nAdjusted 2 earnings for the fourth quarter 2017 were $1.29 per adjusted 1 diluted share compared to $1.00 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull year 2017 worldwide volume points of 5.4 billion declined 3.6% compared to full year 2016. Reported full year 2017 net sales of $4.4 billion decreased 1.4%, while constant currency net sales decreased 1.1%, both compared to full year 2016.\nOn a reported basis, full year 2017 net income was $213.9 million, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared to net income of $260.0 million, or $3.02 per diluted share for 2016.\nAdjusted 2 earnings for 2017 were $4.86 per diluted share compared to $4.85 per diluted share for 2016. Due to the negative impact of currency, full year 2017 reported diluted EPS and adjusted 2 diluted EPS were each negatively impacted by $0.23.\nSince the approval by the Company’s Board of Directors in February 2017 of the share repurchase program, a total of approximately 11.7 million shares were repurchased, including approximately 400,000 shares repurchased from November 2, 2017 through February 21, 2018.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company is reiterating its volume point guidance range of 2% to 6% growth as well as its 2018 reported and adjusted 2 diluted EPS guidance of $3.82 to $4.22 and $4.60 to $5.00.\nFurthermore, Herbalife announces, consistent with the Company’s succession strategy, a new executive organization structure effective May 1, 2018.\nThe Company’s president, Des Walsh, will transition to the new role of executive vice-chairman where his 14 years of experience at the Company will primarily be used in growing the business and developing and maintaining strong relationships with the Company’s distributor leaders around the world.\nConcurrently with Mr. Walsh’s transition to his new role, two Company veterans will each be promoted to serve as co-president of the Company, each with separate but complementary responsibilities for leading the Company forward.\nJohn DeSimone, currently chief financial officer, will assume the role of co-president and chief strategic officer where he will manage the Company’s regional leadership, who have responsibility for growing the Company’s nutrition business and driving performance in more than 90 countries around the globe. These will be new duties for Mr. DeSimone who will continue to manage the Company’s financial planning and investor relations operations.\nChief health and nutrition officer, Dr. John Agwunobi, will continue in his role leading the Company’s nutrition and fitness training and medical and consumer affairs. As co-president and chief health and nutrition officer, Dr. Agwunobi will expand his responsibilities to concentrate on enhancing the distributor and customer experience. This new position will work intimately with our distributors and customers, ensuring that the Company is continuously innovating in the areas of corporate sales, technology, marketing and product development.\nAs part of this new organization structure, current senior vice president and principal accounting officer, Bosco Chiu, having served close to 25 years at the Company, will be promoted to executive vice president and chief financial officer. In addition, current acting general counsel Richard Werber will assume the new role of chief legal officer while current senior vice president, deputy general counsel and chief compliance officer Henry Wang will be promoted to executive vice president and general counsel.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal 2017 Key Metrics 3\nRegional Volume Point Metrics\nVolume Points (Mil) Volume Points (Mil) Region 4Q '17 Yr/Yr % Chg FY '17 Yr/Yr % Chg North America 250.8 -7.3% 1,099.0 -12.0% Asia Pacific 273.8 0.2% 1,089.2 1.2% EMEA 271.8 4.5% 1,088.5 3.7% Mexico 207.7 -8.4% 875.4 -4.8% South & Central America 153.0 -6.6% 593.9 -10.4% China 149.7 9.6% 633.4 1.4% Worldwide Total 1,306.8 -1.8% 5,379.4 -3.6% Regional Net Sales and Foreign Exchange (“FX”) Impact\nReported Net Sales Growth/Decline Growth/Decline Region 4Q '17 (mil) including FX excluding FX North America $ 192.2 -4.9% -5.0% Asia Pacific $ 229.7 1.7% -0.2% EMEA $ 220.3 12.0% 5.4% Mexico $ 108.0 3.1% -1.3% South & Central America $ 125.2 3.5% 17.0% China $ 217.9 11.9% 8.4% Worldwide Total $ 1,093.3 4.6% 3.4% Reported Net Sales Growth/Decline Growth/Decline Region FY '17 (mil) including FX excluding FX North America $ 840.2 -12.1% -12.1% Asia Pacific $ 915.9 0.3% -0.9% EMEA $ 868.7 6.5% 4.2% Mexico $ 442.7 -0.9% 0.5% South & Central America $ 474.3 -2.9% 0.4% China $ 885.9 2.0% 4.0% Worldwide Total $ 4,427.7 -1.4% -1.1% Outlook\nBased on current business trends the Company’s first quarter 2018 and full year 2018 guidance are as follows:\nThree Months Ending Twelve Months Ending March 31, 2018 December 31, 2018 Low\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nVolume Point Growth vs 2017 (7.0%) (3.0%) 2.0% 6.0% Net Sales Growth vs 2017 (1.0%) 3.0% 5.5% 9.5% Diluted EPS (a) $0.70 $0.90 $3.82 $4.22 Adjusted Diluted EPS (a) (b) $0.90 $1.10 $4.60 $5.00 Cap Ex ($ millions) $30.0 $40.0 $115.0 $155.0 Effective Tax Rate (a) 30.0% 35.0% 30.0% 35.0% Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (a) (b) 27.0% 32.0% 27.0% 32.0% (a) Excludes any future potential ongoing tax effects from the exercise of equity awards that could impact the Company's tax rate due to the updated stock compensation accounting standard, any future contingent value rights revaluation, any impact of potential Venezuela currency devaluations, benefits from future potential China grants, as well as any impact of the China Growth and Impact Investment Fund.

The Company’s definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner as the Company does and should not be viewed in isolation from nor as alternatives to net income or diluted EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income, presented and reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, to net income adjusted for certain items:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 (in millions) Net (loss) income, as reported $ (63.4 ) $ 99.4 $ 213.9 $ 260.0 Expenses incurred responding to attacks on the company's business model (1) (2) 0.8 1.4 5.0 12.1 Expenses related to regulatory inquiries (1) (2) 3.7 2.4 13.7 16.3 Expenses incurred for the recovery of re-audit expenses (1) (2) - 0.1 - 3.6 Non-cash interest expense and amortization of non-cash issuance costs (1) (2) (3) 12.2 11.5 47.7 45.1 China grant income (1) (2) (7.3 ) (5.1 ) (50.8 ) (34.2 ) FTC Consent Order implementation (1) (2) (4) 1.0 5.4 17.7 10.7 Regulatory settlements (1) (2) - - - 203.0 Arbitration award related to the re-audit (1) (2)\n- (29.7 ) - (29.7 ) Contingent value rights revaluation (1) (2)\n(0.4 ) - (0.4 ) - Income tax adjustments for above items (1) (2)\n(1.2 ) 0.5 2.6 (69.4 ) Provisional Tax Act impact (5) 153.3 - 153.3 - Net income, as adjusted (6)\n$ 98.6 $ 85.9 $ 402.6 $ 417.4 The following table is a reconciliation of diluted shares outstanding, presented and reported in accordance with GAAP, to diluted shares outstanding, adjusted for the impact of outstanding equity awards. Outstanding equity awards were excluded from the number of reported diluted outstanding shares for the fourth quarter of 2017 because the Company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 and their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. However, because the company’s adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017, as calculated in the table above, was positive, inclusion of outstanding equity awards would not be anti-dilutive. Therefore, the company has adjusted the diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2017 to include equity awards as set forth below so the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS is not overstated for the fourth quarter of 2017 and such number is comparable to adjusted diluted EPS for the prior year period.\nThree Months Ended 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 (in millions) Diluted shares outstanding, as reported 72.9 86.0 Potential dilutive effect of outstanding equity grants 3.4 - Diluted shares outstanding, as adjusted 76.3 86.0 The following is a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share, presented and reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, to diluted earnings per share adjusted for certain items.\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 (per share) Diluted (loss) earnings per share, as reported $ (0.87 ) $ 1.16 $ 2.58 $ 3.02 Impact of adjusted shares outstanding 0.04 - - - Diluted (loss) earnings per share using adjusted diluted shares outstanding $ (0.83 ) $ 1.16 $ 2.58 $ 3.02 Expenses incurred responding to attacks on the company's business model (1) (2) 0.01 0.02 0.06 0.14 Expenses related to regulatory inquiries (1) (2) 0.05 0.03 0.17 0.19 Expenses incurred for the recovery of re-audit expenses (1) (2) - - - 0.04 Non-cash interest expense and amortization of non-cash issuance costs (1) (2) (3) 0.16 0.13 0.58 0.52 China grant income (1) (2) (0.10 ) (0.06 ) (0.61 ) (0.40 ) FTC Consent Order implementation (1) (2) (4) 0.01 0.06 0.21 0.12 Regulatory settlements (1) (2) - - - 2.36 Arbitration award related to the re-audit (1) (2)\n- (0.35 ) - (0.34 ) Contingent value rights revaluation (1) (2)\n(0.01 ) - - - Income tax adjustments for above items (1) (2)\n(0.02 ) 0.01 0.03 (0.80 ) Provisional Tax Act Impact (5) 2.01 - 1.85 - Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (6) $ 1.29 $ 1.00 $ 4.86 $ 4.85 (1) Based on interim income tax reporting rules, these expenses are not considered discrete items. As a result, the Company's full year effective tax rate is impacted by these items. When applying the full year effective tax rate to year-to-date income, the Company's year-to-date tax provision recorded with respect to these non-GAAP adjustments is different from the forecasted full-year tax provision impact of these items. As a consequence, adjustments to the year-to-date and quarterly tax impacts will be recorded as the adjusted full year effective tax rate is applied to income in subsequent periods. Additionally, adjustments to items unrelated to these non-GAAP adjustments may have an effect on the income tax impact of these non-GAAP adjustments in subsequent periods.\n(2) Excludes tax (benefit)/expense as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 (in millions) Expenses incurred responding to attacks on the company's business model (0.3 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (1.2 ) $ (3.0 ) Expenses related to regulatory inquiries (1.3 ) (0.2 ) (4.7 ) (5.5 ) Expenses incurred for the recovery of re-audit expenses - - (1.0 ) Non-cash interest expense and amortization of non-cash issuance costs (1.1 ) (1.8 ) - - China grant income 2.0 1.4 14.6 9.8 FTC Consent Order Implementation (0.4 ) (1.4 ) (6.0 ) (3.6 ) Regulatory settlements - (1.3 ) - (70.0 ) Arbitration award related to the re-audit - 3.9 - 3.9 Contingent Value Rights revaluation - - - Total income tax adjustments (6) $ (1.2 ) $ 0.5 $ 2.6 $ (69.4 ) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 (per share) Expenses incurred responding to attacks on the company's business model $ - $ - $ (0.01 ) $ (0.03 ) Expenses related to regulatory inquiries (0.02 ) - (0.06 ) (0.06 ) Expenses incurred for the recovery of re-audit expenses - - - (0.01 ) Non-cash interest expense and amortization of non-cash issuance costs (0.01 ) (0.02 ) - - China grant income 0.03 0.02 0.18 0.11 FTC Consent Order Implementation (0.01 ) (0.02 ) (0.07 ) (0.04 ) Regulatory settlements - (0.02 ) - (0.81 ) Arbitration award related to the re-audit - 0.05 - 0.05 Total income tax adjustments (6) $ (0.02 ) $ 0.01 $ 0.03 $ (0.80 ) (3) Relates to non-cash expense on our convertible notes and prepaid forward share repurchase contract.
