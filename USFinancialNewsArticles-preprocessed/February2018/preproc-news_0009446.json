    "text": "February 3, 2018 / 5:11 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago American Marino says team of rivals brings out her best Rory Carroll 3 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - American snowboarding phenomenon Julia Marino is not worried that her team mates will be among her most formidable rivals when she battles for gold in Pyeongchang this month as she also knows they will provide her with the most enthusiastic support. \nThe U.S. women’s snowboarding team, which includes Sochi gold medallist Jamie Anderson and 17-year-old prodigy Hailey Langland, has a big opportunity to become the first female team to sweep a Winter Olympic podium and could even do it in two disciplines -- slopestyle and big air. \nIf that happens, Marino said that would be a testament to the tightly-knit team’s ability to bring out the best in each another. \n“Competing with those other ladies is what drives me to do well,” the 20-year-old Connecticut native told Reuters this week. “When you see your friend kicking butt, you want to step up your game and do it too.” \nShe said the fact that they were individual athletes brought together under the banner of Team USA gave them unity but also a useful autonomy. \n“We are individual athletes working for an individual goal but sometimes I think we’re more team-like than actual team sports because of how much we support each other,” she added. \n“On a team athletes may say: ‘This is how we should do things’ and people don’t agree. But here everyone is here for the same reason, which is to have a blast,” she said.
