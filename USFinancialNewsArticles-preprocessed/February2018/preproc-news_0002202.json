    "text": "DULUTH, Ga., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE: ABG), one of the largest automotive retail and service companies in the U.S., reported net income for the fourth quarter 2017 of $42.5 million ($2.03 per diluted share) compared to $67.1 million ($3.08 per diluted share) in the prior year quarter. It also reported adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter 2017 of $37.8 million ($1.81 per diluted share) compared to $34.0 million ($1.56 per diluted share) in the prior year quarter, a 16% increase in adjusted earnings per share.\nNet income for the fourth quarter 2017 was adjusted for a $5.1 million pre-tax loss for franchise rights impairments ($0.15 per diluted share) and a $7.9 million benefit ($0.37 per diluted share) related to adjustments to deferred tax balances as a result of recent changes to the tax law. Net income for the fourth quarter 2016 was adjusted for a $45.5 million pre-tax gain on divestitures ($1.30 per diluted share); $6.6 million pre-tax legal settlements benefit ($0.19 per diluted share); $0.5 million pre-tax real estate related impairment charges ($0.01 per diluted share); and $0.9 million benefit from discrete tax items ($0.04 per diluted share).\nAs a result of recent changes to the tax law, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% in 2018, which is down from our prior guidance of approximately 38%.\n\"We closed out 2017 with a strong performance delivering 16% adjusted EPS growth in the quarter,\" said David Hult, Asbury's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"During 2017, in a declining SAAR environment, we expanded our dealership footprint, returned approximately $35 million of capital to our shareholders, maintained our industry leading operating margins, and grew adjusted EPS 6%. This performance is a direct result of our team's hard work, dedication, and commitment to continuous improvement. Going forward, we will continue to execute our two-part strategy: drive operational excellence and deploy capital to its highest returns.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational Summary\nSame store (a non-GAAP measure):\nTotal revenue flat; gross profit increased 2% New vehicle revenue increased 2%; gross profit decreased 3% Used vehicle retail revenue decreased 6%; gross profit decreased 10% Finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased 6% Parts and service revenue increased 3%; gross profit increased 2%\nTotal store:\nSG&A as a percentage of gross profit decreased 200 basis points to 67.3% Adjusted income from operations (a non-GAAP measure) as a percentage of revenue was 4.7% Adjusted diluted EPS (a non-GAAP measure) increased 16%\nAcquisition Update:\nIn January 2018, we acquired a Honda franchise in Indianapolis, Indiana\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported net income of $139.1 million ($6.62 per diluted share) compared to $167.2 million ($7.40 per diluted share) in the prior year period.

These measures include \"Adjusted leverage ratio,\" \"Adjusted income from operations,\" \"Adjusted net income,\" \" Adjusted operating margins,\" and \"Adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\").\" Further, management assesses the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance at our existing locations. Same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures considered and evaluated by management are reviewed in conjunction with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. In their evaluation of results from time to time, management excludes items that do not arise directly from core operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. Because these non-core, unusual or non-recurring charges and gains materially affect Asbury's financial condition or results in the specific period in which they are recognized, management also evaluates, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions based on, the related non-GAAP measures excluding such items. In addition to using such non-GAAP measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management believes that such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and a better indication of expected future trends. Management discloses these non-GAAP measures, and the related reconciliations, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer-term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess operating performance.\nThe following tables provide reconciliations for our non-GAAP metrics:\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\n(Dollars in millions)\nAdjusted leverage ratio:\nLong-term debt (including current portion)\n$\n875.5\n$\n915.7\nCalculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(\"EBITDA\"):\nNet Income\n$\n139.1\n$\n163.7\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization\n32.1\n31.7\nIncome tax expense\n70.0\n97.8\nSwap and other interest expense\n55.9\n55.8\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(\"EBITDA\")\n$\n297.1\n$\n349.0\nNon-core items - (income) expense:\nFranchise rights impairment\n$\n5.1\n$\n—\nReal estate-related charges\n2.9\n3.4\nInvestment income\n(0.8)\n(0.8)\nLegal settlements\n(0.9)\n(7.5)\nGain on divestitures\n—\n(45.5)\nTotal non-core items\n6.3\n(50.4)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n303.4\n$\n298.6\nAdjusted leverage ratio\n2.9\n3.1\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n(In millions, except per share data)\nAdjusted income from operations:\nIncome from operations\n$\n74.1\n$\n80.1\nFranchise Right Impairment\n5.1\n—\nReal estate-related charges\n—\n0.5\nLegal settlements\n—\n(6.6)\nAdjusted income from operations\n$\n79.2\n$\n74.0\nAdjusted net income:\nNet income\n$\n42.5\n$\n67.1\nNon-core items - (income) expense:\nFranchise rights impairment\n5.1\n—\nLegal settlements\n—\n(6.6)\nReal estate-related charges\n—\n0.5\nGain on divestitures\n—\n(45.5)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense on non-core items above\n(1.9)\n19.4\nDiscrete Tax Items\n(7.9)\n(0.9)\nTotal non-core items\n(4.7)\n(33.1)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n37.8\n$\n34.0\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS):\nDiluted EPS\n$\n2.03\n$\n3.08\nTotal non-core items\n(0.22)\n(1.52)\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n1.81\n$\n1.56\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n20.9\n21.8\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n(In millions, except per share data)\nAdjusted income from operations:\nIncome from operations\n$\n287.7\n$\n297.8\nFranchise Right Impairment\n5.1\n—\nReal estate-related charges\n2.9\n5.7\nInvestment income\n(0.8)\n—\nLegal settlements\n(0.9)\n(6.6)\nAdjusted income from operations\n$\n294.0\n$\n296.9\nAdjusted net income:\nNet income\n$\n139.1\n$\n167.2\nNon-core items - (income) expense:\nFranchise rights impairment\n5.1\n—\nReal estate-related charges\n2.9\n5.7\nInvestment income\n(0.8)\n—\nLegal settlements\n(0.9)\n(6.6)\nGain on Divestitures\n—\n(45.5)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense on non-core items above\n(2.4)\n17.4\nDiscrete Tax Items\n(7.9)\n(0.9)\nTotal non-core items\n(4.0)\n(29.9)\nAdjusted net income\n$\n135.1\n$\n137.3\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS):\nDiluted EPS\n$\n6.62\n$\n7.40\nTotal non-core items\n(0.19)\n(1.32)\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$\n6.43\n$\n6.08\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n21.0\n22.6\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asbury-automotive-group-announces-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial-results-300593840.html\nSOURCE Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.",
