Carlos Curbelo, at right, speaks on Capitol Hill in October. \nBy David Harrison Janet Hook \nWASHINGTON — Some congressional Republicans said Sunday they could support some gun-safety bills, after coming under pressure from students who survived a mass shooting at a Florida high school last week. \nThe lawmakers couldn’t say when, or if, GOP House and Senate leaders would put legislation on the floor, an indication of the high hurdles facing gun-related legislation. Democrats said they didn’t expect any action would be taken in Congress this year. \nSpeaking on the Sunday morning news shows, several Republican lawmakers said they would support expanded background checks or a ban on bump stocks, devices that allow a shooter to fire more rapidly. Efforts to ban the devices, which enable a semiautomatic rifle to mimic a fully automatic weapon, gained steam after a shooter used them in an October attack in Las Vegas that killed 58 people. More than four months later, Congress has yet to take up the matter. It is unclear whether the latest shooting, which left 17 people dead, will change that dynamic. \nRep. Carlos Curbelo (R., Fla.) said Sunday he saw a new willingness among some of his Republican colleagues to act. Curbelo, whose South Florida district is near the site of last Wednesday’s shooting, introduced a bill banning bump stocks last October after the Nevada tragedy. He also backed another measure expanding background checks for gun buyers.",
