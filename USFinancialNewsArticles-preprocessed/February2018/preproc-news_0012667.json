    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lumere, the leading provider of data-driven analytics, evidence and expert guidance to help health systems reduce unnecessary clinical variation and costs, today announced the appointment of John Cherf, MD, MPH, MBA, as the company’s first-ever chief medical officer (CMO).\nA practicing orthopedic surgeon with over 20 years of clinical and healthcare leadership experience, Dr. Cherf has published in numerous peer review journals, speaks internationally and has served as an advisor and consultant to several orthopedic and healthcare businesses and organizations, including the FDA. He will play a vital role in shaping Lumere’s solutions and services focusing on drug and device selection and utilization.\n\"We're excited about the combination of clinical and change management experience that Dr. Cherf brings to our team,\" said Lumere CEO Hani Elias, JD, MPH. \"He is an experienced clinical leader who understands the unique needs and concerns of physicians and can share that understanding with our clients. Because Dr. Cherf continues to practice, he brings practical experience as well as a keen awareness of the state of healthcare and the wide range of available drugs and devices.\"\nIn his role as CMO, Dr. Cherf will oversee Lumere’s Physician Advisory Council, which provides practical, field-based insights to support the firm’s data-driven solutions. “I see tremendous opportunity within healthcare to use clinical evidence to drive better performance, both financially and clinically,” he said. “Lumere’s data-driven approach to decision making is grounded in evidence rather than subjective experiences. That resonates with physicians I speak to and opens new doors to cross-departmental collaboration. The foundation that Lumere has developed has the opportunity to drive transformational change.”\nDr. Cherf also continues his private practice and serves as the chief of orthopedics for Chicago-based Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center. He previously served as the chief medical officer for Pinpoint Care, chairman of OrthoCentrix Solutions, and the president of OrthoIndex. He attended the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine for his MD where he also obtained a Masters’ in Public Health (MPH). He received his Masters’ of Business Administration (MBA) from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.\nAbout Lumere\nLumere is at the forefront of clinical decision making for drugs and devices, offering evidence-based solutions and services for all providers that improve care and reduce cost across the patient journey.
