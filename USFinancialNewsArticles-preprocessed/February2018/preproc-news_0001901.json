    "text": "Lenovo Group Ltd. took a $400 million charge following the U.S. tax overhaul, pushing it to a net loss in the third quarter and missing analyst expectations as its mobile unit continued to struggle.\nThe Chinese PC-maker said Thursday that its third-quarter net loss was $289 million, compared with a net profit of $98 million a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting a profit for the period, which ended in December. A poll by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast a net profit of $128 million.\n ",
