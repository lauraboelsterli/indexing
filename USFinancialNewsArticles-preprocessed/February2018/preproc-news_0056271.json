    "text": "  Telia eyes M&A as it focuses on core Nordic markets   BARCELONA (Reuters) - Nordic telecoms operator Telia hopes to complete a planned exit from its Eurasian businesses this year and is interested in acquisitions in its core markets, Chair of the Board Marie Ehrling told Reuters. Telia announced a strategic pullout in 2015 after former management became embroiled in a bribery scandal in Uzbekistan. The company turned the page last year with U.S. and European settlements costing $966 million. Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Olof Swahnberg and Helena Sonderpalm",
