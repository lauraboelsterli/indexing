    "text": "February 17, 2018 / 3:00 PM / a few seconds ago Ice Hockey: Russians shut out U.S. men 4-0 Dan Burns 2 Min Read GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Ilya Kovalchuk and Nikolai Prokhorkin each scored twice to earn the Olympic Athletes from Russia a 4-0 win over the U.S. men’s ice hockey team on Saturday and claim top spot in their preliminary round group. Kovalchuk’s two goals came 29 seconds apart on either side of the second intermission. The former NHL all star’s first came with one second remaining in the second period and he got his second inside the first 30 seconds of the third, rifling a shot over U.S. goaltender Ryan Zapolski’s left shoulder and into the top of the net. Slideshow (4 Images) Prokhorkin opened the scoring in the first period for the Russians, redirecting a hard feed from Sergei Mozyakin as he was crossing in front of the U.S. goal. His second came early in the second. It was a physical game from the moment the puck dropped, with the Russians, pound for pound a bigger team, levelling a hit on an American each time a U.S. player touched the puck. They set their sights repeatedly on the biggest American player, Jordan Greenway, and he found himself in more than one extended shoving match with a Russian. It is a rivalry that has held outsized importance ever since a group of American college students toppled the mighty Soviet team at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid. In six Olympic meetings since then, including Saturday’s victory, the Russians hold the series lead, winning four times, losing once and tying once. Reporting By Dan Burns; editing by Clare Lovell",
