    "text": "  7:10 a.m. ET Share \nBy Maria Armental \nRe/Max Holdings Inc.’s co-founder David Liniger and another top executive violated company policy over a series of undisclosed gifts, including a $2.4 million personal loan, the company said Thursday. \nLiniger was also found to have violated policies related to workplace conduct, the company said without elaborating. \nA company spokeswoman wouldn’t comment on whether Liniger and Adam Contos, who has been since promoted to chief executive, had been disciplined or faced any sanctions. \nLiniger declined to comment, while Contos couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. \nThe internal investigation focused on a series of gifts from Liniger and his wife, who remain controlling shareholders, to Contos, at the time chief operating officer, and others whom the company hasn’t identified.",
