    "text": "TORONTO, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Russel Metals Inc. (RUS - TSX) today announced financial results for the 2017 fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31\nYear Ended\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues\n$ 825\n$ 654\n$ 3,296\n$ 2,579\nEBIT 1\n$ 47\n$ 45\n$ 206\n$ 119\nNet Income\n$ 28\n$ 23\n$ 124\n$ 63\nEarnings per Share\n$ 0.45\n$ 0.37\n$ 2.00\n$ 1.02\nFree Cash Flow Per Share 1\n$ 0.48\n$ 0.15\n$ 2.92\n$ 1.25\nDividends paid per common share\n$ 0.38\n$ 0.38\n$ 1.52\n$ 1.52\nAll amounts are reported in millions of Canadian dollars except per share, which is in Canadian dollars\n1 EBIT and Free Cash Flow per Share are non-GAAP measures. EBIT represents earnings before interest, finance expense and taxes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported net income of $124 million or $2.00 per share on revenues of $3.3 billion. These results compare to 2016 revenues of $2.6 billion and net income of $63 million or $1.02 per share, which included a gain in the 2016 fourth quarter of $28 million or $0.27 per share on the sale of properties. Fourth quarter net income was $28 million or $0.45 per share on revenues of $825 million. These results compare to net income of $23 million or $0.37 per share in the 2016 fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter revenues of $418 million in our metals service center segment were 27% higher than the 2016 fourth quarter due to the acquisition of Color Steels and stronger demand and higher selling prices. Same store tons shipped increased 13% and same store selling price per ton increased by 9% over the 2016 comparable quarter. Gross margin was 19.3% compared to 20.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Our metals service center operating profits in the 2017 fourth quarter were $16 million compared to $7 million in the 2016 fourth quarter due to stronger activity and operating efficiencies.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues in our energy products segment increased 24% to $300 million compared to the 2016 fourth quarter due to stronger demand and higher selling prices in all of our energy products operations. Gross margin percentage of 21.3% in the 2017 fourth quarter improved significantly compared to 13.8% in the 2016 fourth quarter due to higher demand and selling prices. Operating profits were $28 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $5 million in the same quarter last year.\nRevenues in our steel distributors segment in the 2017 fourth quarter of $104 million were 32% higher than the 2016 fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 14.9% compared to 16.1% in the same period in 2016 due to the higher cost of inventory. Operating profits in the fourth quarter approximated that of the same quarter last year as stronger revenues were offset by lower gross margins.\nMr. John G Reid, President and COO commented \"We have simplified the capital structure and improved our operating efficiencies since the last downturn and we are very encouraged that our earnings are as strong as they were in 2014 when revenues are not yet fully recovered. Our service center and steel distribution operations turned in another solid performance for the quarter as strong activity offset the usual seasonal demand decrease. Demand for our energy product operations continued at a healthy level. Improved selling prices and previously implemented operating efficiencies led to stellar results for all of our energy operations.\"\nMr. Reid continued, \"The acquisition of Color Steels has gone well and the new operation was immediately accretive. We are continuing to evaluate growth opportunities and systematically increase our value-added equipment across North America. In the first quarter to date we have seen a modest demand increase in a rising steel price environment.\"\nThe Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per common share payable March 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2018.\nThe Company will be holding an Investor Conference Call on Thursday, February 15, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET to review its 2017 fourth quarter results.
