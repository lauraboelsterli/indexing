Additional terms of the deal are not being disclosed.\n\"The acquisition of Giosis' Japan business significantly expands eBay's footprint in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world. Building on the strength of the Qoo10.jp platform, we will be able to offer Japanese consumers more inventory from around the world,\" said Devin Wenig, President and CEO of eBay Inc. \"With the Qoo10.jp platform, we also will be able to serve a new and growing user base as well as broaden our presence in a dynamic, underpenetrated market with strong e-commerce potential and high mobile adoption.\"\neBay made an initial investment in Giosis Pte.
