(NASDAQ:TTD), a provider of a global technology platform for buyers of advertising, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017.\n“The fourth quarter was outstanding for the Trade Desk and a capstone to a terrific 2017. For the year, we surpassed $1.55 billion in gross spend on our platform, grew revenue 52% to more than $308 million and generated over $95 million of adjusted EBITDA,” said Founder and CEO of The Trade Desk, Jeff Green. “Our mission has always been to change the way advertising is bought on our software platform and 2017 marked a year of great strides toward that goal. Exiting the year, we had more of the largest brands in the world spending on our platform than ever before as they recognize we are the only purely independent platform buying media at scale, objectively, across digital channels and devices. We also invested more into technology and product development than we ever have before to help drive our next stage of growth in the coming years. We expect 2018 to be another record year for the company as we continue to see great momentum in the adoption of programmatic advertising on our platform worldwide.”\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights:\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters and fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Results Revenue $ 102.6 $ 72.4 $ 308.2 $ 202.9 Increase in revenue year over year 42% 70% 52% 78% Net Income $ 16.8 $ 10.3 $ 50.8 $ 20.5 Diluted EPS(1) $ 0.38 $ 0.24 $ 1.15 $ (1.46 ) Non-GAAP Results Adjusted EBITDA $ 39.5 $ 28.6 $ 95.5 $ 65.2 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 38% 39% 31% 32% Non-GAAP Net Income(1) $ 24.2 $ 14.2 $ 70.4 $ 35.3 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS(1) $ 0.54 $ 0.33 $ 1.60 $ 0.89 (1) Attributable to common stockholders-diluted Fourth Quarter and 2017 Business Highlights Include:\nContinued Share Gain: 2017 gross spend on the platform was over $1.55 billion, a 51% increase from a year ago.

Auto-Optimization enhanced by our team of data scientists so customers see even better performance when they choose to let the algorithm optimize to their campaign goals. New data partnerships giving our customers access to user-declared age and gender data from premium third-party providers. First-to-market in-app viewability measurement capabilities to enhance transparency and aid in inventory discovery.

Everything that is reported can be optimized in the platform to maximize performance. Enhancements to the user experience with Private Marketplace Troubleshooting tools in the UI, which exposes common reasons why PMP deals are excluded from bidding, previously only available via a custom report. Integration with Placed and Oracle that allows customers to easily measure how their digital advertising drives in-store foot traffic and in-store purchase. A major new native video release that included functionality such as hosted native creative workflow that supports video upload, completion rate metrics, and creative safeguards.

The Trade Desk continues to lead the industry in offering some of the most “brand safe” and “premium inventory” through its platform. A commitment to the IAB Tech Lab’s Ads.txt initiative, the new open standard and technical specification for increasing transparency across the digital programmatic ecosystem. Cross-Device Expansion : On October 24, 2017, The Trade Desk acquired certain assets of Adbrain Ltd. Combined with existing deterministic cross-device data sets, Adbrain’s technology gives The Trade Desk a proprietary device graph to match a user’s identity across different devices, driving better results for marketers and the best possible ad experience for consumers.\nGlobal Footprint Expansion : In 2017, The Trade Desk broadened its coverage with the opening of offices in Paris, France; Madrid, Spain; Shanghai, China in addition to Seattle and Bellevue, Washington. Best Places to Work: The Trade Desk ranked as one of the best places to work for on Glassdoor’s Best Software Companies to Work for in 2018 list and debuted at #11 on Fortune’s 2017 Best Medium-Sized Workplaces list for 2017.\nFull Year 2018 and First Quarter Outlook:\nMr. Green added: “We exited 2017 with strong momentum with more customers and more spend on more channels than ever before and 2018 is off to a strong start. For 2018, we expect gross spend on our platform to be at least $2.1 billion and revenue to be at least $403 million. In the year ahead, we are launching an enhanced user experience on our platform based on data visualization and we are unveiling robust media planning tools that will leverage our data to model optimum campaigns. In addition, we are making incremental investments of $15-20 million in high opportunity areas such as mobile, Connected TV, global expansion, and creating a safer programmatic environment. As a result, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $117 million or about 29% of revenue. Our focus is on gaining share and revenue growth as this will ultimately maximize profitability over the long-term.“\nThe Trade Desk is providing its financial targets for the fiscal year 2018 and first quarter of 2018. The Company’s financial targets are as follows:\nFull Year 2018\nTotal gross spend of at least $2.1 billion Revenue of at least $403 million Adjusted EBITDA of $117 million or about 29% of revenue\nFirst Quarter 2018:\nRevenue of $73 million Adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million\nReconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of our stock-based compensation expense that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. We expect the variability of the above charges could have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIncluded within this press release are non-GAAP financial measures that supplement the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of The Trade Desk, Inc. (the Company) prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust the Company's actual results prepared under GAAP by excluding charges for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense, secondary offering costs and changes in fair value of preferred stock warrant liabilities. A tax rate on the tax-deductible portion of the stock-based compensation expense approximating 40% has been used in the computation of non-GAAP Net loss and non-GAAP diluted EPS attributed to common stockholders. Since the other excluded charges are non-taxable, a tax effect for those charges was not included. Also included in these non-GAAP financial measures are adjustments to diluted earnings per share amounts, as applicable, to reflect the conversion upon the Company’s IPO of all then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into one third of one share of common stock using the as-if-converted method, as of January 1, 2016, or the date of issuance, if later. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company's management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company's operational trends, financial performance, and cash generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for or superior to corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Results Webcast and Conference Call Details\nWhen: February 22, 2018 at 2:00 P.M.

These statements relate to expectations concerning matters that (a) are not historical facts, (b) predict or forecast future events or results, or (c) embody assumptions that may prove to have been inaccurate, including statements relating to the industry and market trends, and the Company’s financial targets such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. When words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “will”, “outlook” or similar expressions are used, the Company is making forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot give readers any assurance that such expectations will prove correct.

The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company.
