    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Fitbit Inc. (FIT) on Monday reported a loss of $45.5 million in its fourth quarter.\nOn a per-share basis, the San Francisco-based company said it had a loss of 19 cents. Losses, adjusted for stock option expense and pretax expenses, came to 2 cents per share.\nThe results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was breakeven on a per-share basis.\nThe wearable device maker posted revenue of $570.8 million in the period, which also fell short of Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $587 million.\nFor the year, the company reported that its loss widened to $277.2 million, or $1.19 per share. Revenue was reported as $1.62 billion.\nFor the current quarter ending in April, Fitbit expects its results to range from a loss of 21 cents per share to a loss of 18 cents per share.\nThe company said it expects revenue in the range of $240 million to $255 million for the fiscal first quarter.\nFitbit shares have decreased 3 percent since the beginning of the year. In the final minutes of trading on Monday, shares hit $5.54, a decline of almost 10 percent in the last 12 months.\nThis story was generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
