(“NAEP” or “the Company”) (TSX:NOA) (NYSE:NOA) today announced results ended December 31, 2017.\nMartin Ferron, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated, “Although the weather could have been kinder to us, we were pleased to achieve a strong end to a solidly profitable year, in which we grew revenue and EBITDA by 37% and 24% respectively, above 2016 levels.”\nAdditionally Mr. Ferron commented, “Currently we are flat out busy on three oil sands mines, one coal mine and a copper mine, with a larger than usual rental fleet needed to satisfy increased customer requirements. Based on bidding levels, we expect another robust year for earthworks, supplemented by heightened demand for seasonal heavy construction work. In this healthy operating environment, we have added confidence in meeting our financial growth targets for 2018.”\nThe Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP). Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts discussed are in Canadian dollars. Please see the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for the 2017, for further detail on the matters discussed in this release.\nHighlights of the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $82.0 million, compared to $62.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 31.8%. Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter was $17.2 million, compared to $13.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, an improvement of 27.4%. On October 31, 2017 the Company announced a change to the Board of Director and Management structure. Martin R.

A reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBIT, EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\nResults for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenue was $82.0 million, up from $62.2 million in the same period last year. The increase in revenue was a result of an earlier ramp up of the Company’s expanded winter work programs at the Mildred Lake and Millennium mines coupled with the award of an early-works heavy civil construction project at the Kearl mine. Contributing to the stronger results in the quarter was mine support services activity at the Fording River coal mine in southeast British Columbia, the start of a three year mine support services contract at the Highland Valley copper mine in central British Columbia and the wrap-up of a site development project by the Dene North Site Services partnership at the Aurora mine. The Company’s ability to take on these stronger volumes was aided by the expansion of its heavy haul fleet capacity with the investment in growth capital earlier in the year, as the Company acquired certain used heavy equipment pieces from a competitor exiting the large earthworks marketplace and it further leveraged its prior year capital investment in equipment technology that expanded the haul capacity of certain of its existing heavy haul trucks.\nThis increased activity in the quarter more than offset a reduction, compared to the previous period, in heavy civil construction work at the Mildred Lake and Aurora mines, lower mine support volumes at the Kearl mine and the completion of a site development project at the Red Chris copper mine in northern British Columbia.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, gross profit was $12.0 million or 14.6% of revenue, up from a gross profit of $6.4 million or 10.3% of revenue during the same period last year. The higher gross profit in the current period was driven by the higher volume of activity in the quarter coupled with improved productivity on the Company’s winter works programs at the Mildred Lake and Millennium mines with the earlier onset of winter conditions, compared to last year. Equipment costs as a percent of revenue were consistent between the two periods, despite the expansion of active project sites, which included a large heavy equipment fleet located at the Fording River coal mine, the mobilization of an equipment fleet to the Highland Valley copper mine and the demobilization of the equipment fleet from the Red Chris copper mine.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, depreciation was $11.9 million, or 14.4% of revenue, down from $12.7 million, or 20.4% of revenue in the same period last year. The current period decrease in depreciation as a percent of revenue is starting to reflect the benefits the Company is realizing from its recent program of securing quality used equipment at discounted prices from sellers looking to exit the market place, while also leveraging its strong maintenance expertise and programs to extend the expected lives of the current fleet.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, operating income was $4.5 million, compared to operating loss of $1.2 million during the same period last year. G&A expense (excluding stock-based compensation expense) was $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, up from $5.0 million in the same period last year, reflecting the timing of accruals for short-term incentive plan costs recorded in the quarter, compared to the previous year.\nStock-based compensation expense decreased $1.1 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the effect of the previous year's more significant upward movement in share price and its effect on the carrying value of the liability classified award plans.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net income was $2.5 million (basic income per share of $0.10 and diluted income per share of $0.09), compared to a net loss of $0.5 million (basic and diluted loss per share of $0.02) during the same period last year. The previous period's net loss included $1.4 million in other income generated from the sale of other current assets.\nTotal interest expense was $2.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, up from $1.1 million in the same period last year. The Company recorded $0.6 million, in interest during the three months ended December 31, 2017 on its March 31, 2017 issued $40.0 million Convertible Debentures. Interest on the Company’s credit facilities during the three months ended December 31, 2017 remained comparable to the corresponding prior year period. Interest on capital lease obligations of $0.7 million during the three months December 31, 2017, was slightly higher than corresponding prior year period. The higher expense in the current period was primarily due to an increase in the Company’s assets under capital lease during the year.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded no current income tax expense and a deferred income tax expense of $0.1 million, providing a total income tax expense of $0.1 million. This compares to a combined income tax benefit of $0.4 million recorded for the same period last year.\nIncome tax as a percentage of taxable income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 differs from the statutory rates of 27.0% primarily due to temporary differences resulting from the non-taxable portion of capital gains and permanent differences resulting from stock-based compensation. Income tax as a percentage of taxable income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 differs from the statutory rate of 27.0% primarily due to temporary differences resulting from the non-taxable portion of capital gains and permanent differences resulting from stock-based compensation and book to filing differences.\nOutlook\nThe Company has just completed the first year of a three year organic growth plan that is targeting a minimum of a 15% compound growth in revenue and EBITDA over that three year period. The Company’s strategy to achieve that growth is to:\nBuild production related recurring services volumes in the Company’s core oil sands market, together with the addition of value creating services. Expand the Company’s market coverage to include other resource mines (e.g. coal, copper, gold, diamonds etc.) and infrastructure related projects that involve major earthworks.\nDespite the very adverse impact of a severe plant fire at one of the Company’s busiest work sites in 2017, the Company actually achieved 37% and 24% growth in revenue and EBITDA respectively, for the full year. The Company is also on track to achieve its growth objectives for 2018 and 2019, with this very positive outlook supported by:\nThe successful renewal of all of the Company’s oil sands long-term services agreements such that the Company is not faced with a contract expiration until late 2020; The Company’s customers continuing to use economies of scale in production to dramatically lower oil sands operating costs per barrel. On this theme the Company is currently executing two large earthworks jobs for the winter season with volumes expected to be roughly 10% higher than last year. The combined value of the work could exceed $90.0 million and will likely continue to benefit all of the first quarter of 2018; The new Fort Hills oil sands mine is anticipated to provide a direct benefit in terms of incremental demand for the Company’s services and an indirect benefit from the overall tightening of heavy equipment supply. A good line of sight to meaningful heavy construction activity for the summer season of 2018, after a four year hiatus, due to the deep cyclical downturn in the oil industry; Continuation of earthworks at the Fording River coal mine, as the Company builds a strong relationship with an important new customer. Depending on how coal prices hold up, the Company expects to remain on the work site well into the first half of 2018; The award of a minimum three year site support contract at the Highland Valley copper mine. Revenue, which started in the fourth quarter, was modest at first, but it is expected to increase over the work duration; The availability of several bidding opportunities for further natural resource related contracts, both in Canada and the USA. The Company expects to build on its bidding success of 2017, with further awards in 2018 and 2019. Further success at pre-qualifying to bid for major infrastructure projects. In late 2017 the Company was chosen (three from seven), as part of a strong international consortium, to bid for a significant gravel road construction job in the Northwest Territories; and Good progress with leveraging the Company’s core equipment maintenance competence into work for third parties. The Company already has jobs for two customers in its Edmonton maintenance facility and it believes that this initiative could have a discernible impact on the Company’s 2018 results. Beyond that the Company hopes to be up and running in a new, purpose designed and built, state of the art maintenance facility, which will be capable of handling the largest of its customers’ equipment assets. Eventually, this external maintenance business could provide more than $30.0 million in annual revenue stream for the Company.\nOverall the Company is very encouraged by this bright outlook and are even more confident about meeting its growth targets, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss the Company’s financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 tomorrow, Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 9:00am Eastern time.\nThe call can be accessed by dialing:\nToll free: 1-866-521-4909\nInternational: 1-647-427-2311\nA replay will be available through March 14, 2018, by dialing:\nToll Free: 1-800-585-8367\nInternational: 1-416-621-4642\nConference ID: 4096139\nThe live and archived webcast can be accessed at:\nhttp://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=1586939&s=1&k=EC54DF30004EAB3396BE71A56B24550D\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the Canadian regulatory authorities as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measures. In this release, non-GAAP financial measures are used, such as “gross profit”, “gross profit margin”, “EBIT”, “EBITDA”, “Consolidated EBITDA”, and “Adjusted EBITDA”.\n“Gross profit” is defined as revenue less: project costs, equipment costs, and depreciation.\nThe Company believes that gross profit is a meaningful measure of the business as it portrays results before general and administrative overheads costs, amortization of intangible assets and the gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and assets held for sale. Management reviews gross profit to determine the profitability of operating activities, including equipment ownership charges and to determine whether resources, plant and equipment are being allocated effectively.\nThe Company will often identify a relevant financial metric as a percentage of revenue and refer to this as a margin for that financial metric. “Margin” is defined as the financial number as a percent of total reported revenue. Examples where NAEP uses this reference and related calculation are in relation to “gross profit margin”, “operating income margin”, “net income (loss) margin”, “EBIT margin”, “Consolidated EBITDA margin” or “Adjusted EBITDA margin”.\nNAEP believes that presenting relevant financial metrics as a percentage of revenue is a meaningful measure of its business as it provides the performance of the financial metric in the context of the performance of revenue. Management reviews margins as part of its financial metrics to assess the relative performance of its results.\n\"EBIT\" is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes.\n\"EBITDA\" is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\"Consolidated EBITDA\" is defined as EBITDA, excluding the effects of unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss, realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments, non-cash (equity classified) stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, gain or loss on disposal of assets held for sale and certain other non-cash items included in the calculation of net income (loss).\nThe Company believes that Consolidated EBITDA is a meaningful measure of business performance because it excludes interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and the effect of certain gains and losses and certain non-cash items that are not directly related to the operating performance of the Company’s business. Management reviews Consolidated EBITDA to determine whether property, plant and equipment are being allocated efficiently. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure as it excludes the financial statement impact of changes in the carrying value of the liability classified award plans as a result of movement of our share price.\nAs EBIT, EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures, the Company’s computations of EBIT, EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the industry. EBIT, EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income or net income as measures of operating performance or cash flows and have important limitations as analytical tools and should not substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under US GAAP. A reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBIT, EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 2,450 $ (497 ) $ 5,264 $ (445 ) Adjustments: Interest expense, net 1,989 1,136 6,943 5,784 Income tax expense (benefit) 71 (444 ) 1,204 (49 ) EBIT $ 4,510 $ 195 $ 13,411 $ 5,290 Adjustments: Depreciation 11,854 12,701 44,735 40,794 Amortization of intangible assets 114 137 918 1,688 EBITDA $ 16,478 $ 13,033 $ 59,064 $ 47,772 Adjustments: (Gain) loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment (54 ) (292 ) 189 (116 ) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets held for sale 59 (20 ) (166 ) (374 ) Equity classified stock-based compensation expense 755 783 2,925 2,791 Consolidated EBITDA $ 17,238 $ 13,504 $ 62,012 $ 50,073 Adjustments: Liability classified stock-based compensation expense 862 1,970 1,070 3,239 Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,100 $ 15,474 $ 63,082 $ 53,312 Forward-Looking Information\nThe information provided in this release contains .
