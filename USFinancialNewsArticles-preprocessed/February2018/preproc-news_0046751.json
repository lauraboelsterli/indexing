    "text": " 03 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Airbus exec says progress on a320neo, hints at A350 output rise Reuters Staff 1 Min Read TOULOUSE, France, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Airbus said it was making good progress in resolving Pratt & Whitney engine snags that are holding up some A320neo narrowbody deliveries, and gave a fresh signal it is considering raising output of its larger A350 wide-body jet. Programmes Chief Didier Evrard told reporters on Tuesday that the supply chain could cope with more than 10 A350 deliveries a month, the current target Airbus aims to reach by the year-end. He was speaking on the sidelines of the inaugural delivery of the largest version of the jet, the A350-1000, to launch customer Qatar Airways.
