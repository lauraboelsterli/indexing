    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean trade representatives have made a strong complaint to the United States about the “unfairness” of its safeguard measures against imported washing machines and solar panels, the Asian nation’s trade minister said on Thursday.\nLast week, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a steep tariff on imported washing machines and solar panels in a move to protect American manufacturers, sparking criticism from China and South Korea.\nSouth Korea and the United States began talks in January to revise a two-way trade pact that took effect in 2012, as Trump has been vocal about scrapping the deal to tackle trade imbalances, particularly with U.S. automakers.\nSouth Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong said the talks were far from complete, but both sides were hopeful of wrapping up the negotiations.\n“We had heated negotiations... We have still long way to go,” Kim told reporters in Seoul after an hours-long second round of talks on the pact.\n“The U.S. is keen on automobiles in light of reducing its trade deficit with South Korea.”\nThe United States is South Korea’s second-biggest trading partner after China.\nNegotiators from both countries divided into groups to discuss specific subjects such as anti-dumping and safeguard issues, the auto sector’s market access and tariffs and investor-state dispute settlement, Kim added.\nIn response to the U.S. tariffs, South Korea’s trade ministry has vowed to “actively respond to U.S. trade protectionism,” including making a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Writing by Jane Chung; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ",
