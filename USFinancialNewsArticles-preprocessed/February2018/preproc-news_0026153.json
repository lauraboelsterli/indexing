    "text": " 30 PM / Updated 3 minutes ago Icahn, Deason criticize Xerox's proposed deal with Fujifilm Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason strongly criticized the company’s plan to sell itself to Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ), saying the transaction “dramatically undervalues Xerox and disproportionately favors Fuji.” \n\"We urge you – our fellow shareholders – do not let Fuji steal this company from us,\" Icahn and Deason said in an open letter. ( bit.ly/2skuvYM ) \nIcahn and Deason – respectively the No. 1 and No. 3 Xerox shareholders with a combined stake of over 15 percent – in January pushed the company to explore strategic options. \nOn Jan. 31, Fujifilm said it was set to take over Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal and combine it into their existing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. \nXerox could not immediately be reached for comment.
