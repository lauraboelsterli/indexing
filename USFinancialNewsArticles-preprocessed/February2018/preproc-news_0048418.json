    "text": "58 COMMENTS A prominent white nationalist sued Twitter Inc. for kicking him off the social network, the latest in a spate of legal attacks by members of the far-right claiming tech companies discriminate against their viewpoints and challenging the idea that they operate neutral platforms.\nThe suit by Jared Taylor, filed Tuesday in state Superior Court in San Francisco, argues that Twitter violated California law protecting free speech in public spaces when it banned Mr. Taylor in December. Twitter told Mr. Taylor by email that it did so under a rule in its user agreement that bars accounts affiliated with organizations that promote violence, according to the suit. Mr. Taylor says he neither advocated violence nor was affiliated with such groups.\nTwitter didn’t respond to requests for comment. It added the rule cited in Mr. Taylor’s suit in December as part of a broader effort to reduce “hateful and abusive” content.\nMr. Taylor’s suit follows others by right-wing groups and individuals in recent months claiming they were treated unfairly by tech companies, including Twitter and YouTube, an arm of Alphabet Inc.’s Google. The cases highlight the challenge the companies face in trying to prevent bullying and other abusive content while avoiding the perception that they censor unpopular opinions.\nIn January, Charles Johnson, an investor and conservative activist, sued Twitter in state Superior Court in Fresno, Calif., for banning him, claiming it was inconsistent in applying its rules. Twitter kicked off Mr. Johnson in 2015 after he sent a tweet offering to “take out” civil-rights activist DeRay Mckesson. Mr. Johnson says he was referring to investigating Mr. Mckesson.\nIn October, Prager University, a nonprofit that produces short videos from conservative perspectives, sued YouTube and its parent, Google, in federal court, claiming the tech giant illegally censored some of its content as part of a wider effort to silence conservative voices.\nThose cases are pending.\nIn September, Gab AI Inc., a social-media startup popular with far-right activists, sued Google in federal court over its app’s removal from the Google Play store, claiming Google was stifling nascent competition. Google said the claim was baseless and that it removed Gab’s app for failing to moderate user content encouraging violence and hate.\nGab AI dropped its case in October, saying it would resubmit its app to Google’s store and focus on lobbying Congress for action against “monopolized tech giants.”\nTwitter and Google, along with Facebook Inc., also have come under pressure in recent years from users who say they don’t do enough to prevent disturbing content including threats against other users, revenge porn and hate speech.\nIn response, they have broadened rules preventing certain kinds of hate speech, particularly that targeting other users.\nTwitter’s rules say it believes in freedom of expression “but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up.”\nThe companies also now are navigating new European rules that require them to proactively remove hate speech on their sites.\n“These are hard issues,” said Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor, who advises tech companies, including Twitter, on how to protect against abuse without impeding free speech. “Coming to a global consensus on these issues is not impossible, but it’s going to be challenging.”\nNoah Peters, the Washington-based attorney representing Mr. Taylor, said his suit doesn’t take issue with Twitter’s need to kick off users who harass others, but he says Mr. Taylor didn’t harass users on Twitter.\nMr. Peters pointed to what he says is precedent in California that privately owned spaces can constitute public forums, and arguing that because Twitter is a public forum, it can’t discriminate against certain views. The California public-space ruling hasn’t previously been applied to the internet, Mr. Peters said.\n“What we’re talking about is power—who has the power to shape the debate,” Mr. Peters said. “Is this going to be a thing where Twitter gets to determine who wins the debate?”",
