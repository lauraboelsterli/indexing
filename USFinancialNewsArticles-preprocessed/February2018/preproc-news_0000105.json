    "text": "PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., Feb. 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACETO Corporation (NASDAQ:ACET), an international company engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals, announced today financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 versus Second Quarter Fiscal 2017\nNet sales of $171.2 million versus $125.6 million, a 36.4% increase Gross profit of $34.0 million versus $30.8 million, a 10.3% increase Net loss of $13.9 million versus net loss of $0.6 million Net loss includes $13.9 million of additional income tax expense associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) Diluted EPS loss of $0.39 versus loss of $0.02 Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income of $7.6 million versus $7.3 million, a 4.7% increase Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS of $0.22 versus $0.24, an 8.3% decrease\nManagement Commentary\n“Our second fiscal quarter results reflect primarily the persistence of generic industry headwinds marked by greater competitive intensity and the impact from customer consolidations. Even as sales benefited from the addition of Citron and Lucid products, pricing pressures on our more mature Rising products and softer than expected contributions from new product launches caused a contraction in Human Health’s gross margin,” said William C. Kennally, III, Chief Executive Officer of ACETO. “Notwithstanding these pricing pressures, a 35% increase in Human Health gross profit more than offset gross profit declines reported by our Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals segments.\n“As we look to the second half of fiscal 2018, our operating assumption is the generic industry headwinds will not ease in the near term and we now have greater clarity on the impact of harmonization from customer consolidations. Adverse market conditions are impacting the sales, profitability and market share of certain Rising products to a greater degree than anticipated and a number of API projects which were scheduled to be monetized in the second half of the year have been discontinued. As a result of these factors, although we remain on track to launch 15-20 generic products this year, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year sales and profitability and now expect our overall results for the second half of the year to be only modestly better than the first half,” added Mr Kennally.\n“Our healthy balance sheet and solid operating cash generation support our ability to weather the generics industry storm. At the same time, we continue to focus on optimizing Rising’s commercialized portfolio of products and pipeline of projects to improve profitability in the future; we’re advancing operational initiatives designed to enhance efficiencies; and, identifying ways to take costs out of the system. We continue to expect to have our new warehouse facility fully functional and our new ERP system implemented by the end of the year, at which point we will realize the full syngergy value of $4 million on an annualized basis. With an integrated platform in place at Rising and a healthy flow of products to be launched, we firmly believe we are taking the right steps to ensure ACETO is properly positioned to improve the company’s growth rate and profitability,” concluded Mr. Kennally.\nPlease see fiscal 2018 guidance provided within this press release after the financial review.\nSecond Quarter Financial Review\nNet sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $171.2 million, an increase of 36.4% from $125.6 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Total Company gross profit was $34.0 million, an increase of 10.3%, compared to $30.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the second quarter was 19.8% compared to 24.5% in the prior year period.\nHuman Health segment sales were $103.5 million, an increase of 91.7%, compared to $54.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This quarter included $58.7 million in sales from the acquisition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Gross profit for the Human Health segment was $22.9 million, an increase of 35.3%, compared to $16.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting the addition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Gross margin for the second quarter was 22.1%, compared to 31.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was due to the addition of relatively lower gross margin from the Citron and Lucid products and to the decline of gross profit for other Rising products.\nPharmaceutical Ingredients segment sales were $33.6 million, a decrease of 8.7%, compared to $36.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The segment’s sales decrease was driven by lower sales of both domestic and international APIs. Gross profit in the quarter was $4.4 million, a 22.6% decrease compared to $5.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the second quarter was 13.0%, compared to 15.4% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit and margin was driven by lower sales of domestic and international APIs and a less favorable product mix of international API sales.\nPerformance Chemicals segment sales were $34.1 million, a decrease of 1.8% compared to $34.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as higher sales of specialty chemicals largely offset of lowers sales agricultural protection products. Gross profit was $6.7 million, a decrease of 18.7%, compared to $8.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was 19.6% for the second quarter, compared to 23.7% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profit on agricultural protection products, while the decrease in gross margin was largely due to a less favorable product mix of specialty chemical products.\nTotal selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.1 million, unchanged versus the same period last year, with $5.4 million in the current quarter attributable to amortization expense associated with the purchase of intangible assets related to the Citron and Lucid product purchase. SG&A for the prior year’s period included $7.2 million of transaction costs related to the product purchase agreement. As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the second quarter of 2018 declined to 16.4% compared to 22.4% in the prior year’s period. Research and Development expenses in the second quarter totaled $2.1 million compared to $1.3 million in the prior year period. The majority of R&D expenses are milestone based and fluctuate quarterly.\nOperating income totaled $3.8 million, an increase of 171.7% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The TCJA, signed into law on December 22, 2017, impacted second fiscal quarter results in two ways. First, the Company recorded an additional income tax expense of $13.9 million, comprised of $3.2 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, $5.8 million related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and $4.9 million related to deferred tax liabilities for local tax authorities. Second, the Company’s effective domestic tax rate declined from 38.0% to 31.5% for the first half of the fiscal year, resulting in a tax benefit of $0.06 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Net loss was $13.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017. Included in the net loss was an additional income tax expense of $13.9 million or $0.39 per share related to the TCJA impact. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $7.6 million in the second quarter, compared to $7.3 million in the prior period, a 4.7% increase. Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share were $0.22, compared to $0.24 in the year ago second quarter, an 8.3% decrease.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nFor the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, at current exchange rates, ACETO is providing financial guidance as follows:\nTotal revenues to increase approximately 10% to 15%; Reported diluted GAAP loss per share between $(0.22) and $(0.32); Diluted Non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.05.\nThe Company's fiscal 2018 financial guidance is based in part on the following assumptions:\nGeneric industry headwinds continued in our second fiscal quarter and we are expecting annual price erosion in the low double digits percentage; Reported diluted GAAP loss per share includes an additional tax expense of $0.39 related to the TCJA R&D expense of approximately $9.0 million; and, Total generic product launches of 15 to 20.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the operating and financial results at 9:00 a.m. ET on Friday, February 2, 2018.
