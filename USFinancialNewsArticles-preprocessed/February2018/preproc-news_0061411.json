But unlike many of the survivors of the massacre, the 16-year-old sees a nascent, student-led campaign for tighter gun controls as a threat to her rights under the U.S. Constitution .\nWorld\nA scan obtained by Reuters shows an authentic Brazilian passport issued to North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un.

Xi has fractured what remains of global models and understanding of the incentives and functioning of Chinese politics, transformed China into something more unambiguously dictatorial, and opened up a new and potentially dangerous fissure in Chinese elite politics. The implications are enormous.\"” Business\nEU antitrust regulators are set to approve with conditions German drug and crop chemical maker Bayer’s $62.5 billion bid for world No. 1 seed company Monsanto, two people familiar with the matter said today .\nAmazon has agreed to buy video doorbell maker Ring , the companies said today, in what analysts see as a growing bet on delivering packages inside of shoppers’ homes and on home security.\nFor years, General Motors resisted calls from South Korean officials to cut interest rates it was charging on nearly $3 billion in loans to its loss-making South Korean unit, according to three sources and documents seen by Reuters .\nFormula 1 is launching a new TV streaming product that it says will put fans in control of their race viewing experience, letting them watch from their favorite driver’s perspective or tracking battles for position.
