    "text": "NUREMBERG, Germany, Feb. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- To further support SUSE's rapid innovation, industry engagement and expanding portfolio of open source enterprise solutions, Brent Schroeder is joining the SUSE Office of the CTO in the new position of CTO Americas. He will report to Chief Technology Officer Thomas Di Giacomo and help SUSE® identify, evaluate and lead in relevant technology trends to meet increasing global demand for open source software-defined infrastructure and application delivery solutions.\nSchroeder was most recently executive director and senior distinguished engineer of the Office of the CTO at Quest Software (formerly Dell Software Group). Prior to that, he led the Dell Office of the CTO for the Enterprise Software organization.\n\"Brent is a strategic technology executive who brings many years of expertise, insight and experience to SUSE,\" Di Giacomo said. \"As the growth and momentum of our business continues, we require even deeper engagement with a broader spectrum of industry partners, customers and open source communities.
