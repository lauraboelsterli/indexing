    "text": "OAK BROOK, Ill., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Federal Signal Corporation (NYSE:FSS), a leader in environmental and safety solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nQ4 orders of $303 million, up $137 million, or 83% from last year, including organic growth of $84 million, or 51% Q4 net sales of $248 million, up $72 million, or 41% compared to last year GAAP EPS of $0.48 per share for the quarter, up 140% from last year, and $1.00 for the year, up 56% Includes benefits from tax reform and impact of non-cash pension settlement charge Adjusted EPS of $0.24 per share for the quarter, up 50% from last year, and $0.85 for the year, up 23% 2018 Adjusted EPS outlook of $1.10 to $1.20\nConsolidated net sales for the fourth quarter were $247.6 million, up 41% versus the same quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter income from continuing operations was $29.3 million, equal to $0.48 per diluted share, up 142% compared to $12.1 million, or $0.20 per share, in the prior-year quarter. The Company also reported adjusted net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of $14.4 million, equal to $0.24 per diluted share, up 48% compared to $9.7 million, or $0.16 per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $898.5 million, up 27% compared to the prior year. Income from continuing operations for the year was $60.5 million, equal to $1.00 per diluted share, up 54% compared to $39.4 million, or $0.64 per share, in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the year was $51.1 million, equal to $0.85 per diluted share, up 22% compared to $42.0 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the prior year.\nThe Company is reporting adjusted results to facilitate comparisons of underlying performance on a year-over-year basis. In the current quarter, such adjustments exclude a one-time, non-cash net tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"2017 Tax Act\") and a non-cash pension settlement charge. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures is provided at the conclusion of this news release.\nFourth Quarter Results Exceed Expectations, Contributing to Significant Improvement in Full-Year Results\n\"We had an outstanding finish to a strong year, with fourth quarter results that exceeded expectations,\" said Jennifer L. Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"I am particularly pleased with our execution against the strategic initiatives we have put in place over the last two years, and with the performance of our acquisitions. Both have contributed to a significant improvement in sales, orders and backlog.\"\nConsolidated fourth quarter orders were $302.7 million, an increase of $137.4 million, or 83%, compared to the prior-year quarter, and included organic order growth of approximately $84.2 million, or 51%, primarily represented by higher orders for street sweepers, vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners and refuse vehicles within our Environmental Solutions Group (\"ESG\"), and improved orders within our Safety and Security Systems Group (\"SSG\"). Consolidated backlog at December 31, 2017 was $257.5 million, up $120.5 million, or 88%, compared to last year.\nConsolidated fourth quarter sales were $247.6 million, an increase of $71.5 million, or 41%, compared to the prior-year quarter, and included organic growth of approximately $27.4 million, or 16%, mainly due to improved sales of vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners and street sweepers within ESG.\nConsolidated fourth quarter operating income was $14.9 million, up $1.1 million, or 8%, compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by a $9.7 million increase within ESG, partially offset by a $6.1 million non-cash pension settlement charge and higher expenses associated with hearing loss litigation.\nConsolidated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\") for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $32.0 million, up $11.0 million, or 52%, compared to the prior-year quarter, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.9% compared to 11.9% last year. ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $11.9 million, or 74%, to $28.0 million, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.6%, up from 13.2% last year. SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $10.0 million, compared to $10.2 million last year, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.0%, compared to 18.7% last year.\nImpact of the 2017 Tax Act\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $20.0 million, or $0.33 per diluted share (on a GAAP basis), representing the estimated impact of corporate income tax changes resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. The components of the net tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 are summarized as follows ($ in millions):\nRemeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities\n$\n23.0\nValuation allowance impacts\n(3.0)\nTotal estimated net tax benefit\n$\n20.0\nThe ultimate impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and actions that the Company may take.\nThe Company expects that its effective tax rate in 2018 will be in the range of 26% to 27%, based on its current interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act.\nStrong Q4 Cash Flow Supports Additional Debt Pay Down\nNet cash of $21.4 million was provided by continuing operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $9.6 million in the prior-year quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled $73.5 million, an increase of $46.8 million compared to the prior year. At December 31, 2017, total debt was $278 million, total cash and cash equivalents were $38 million and the Company had $106 million of availability for borrowings under its credit facility.\n\"Our balance sheet and liquidity remain healthy,\" said Sherman. \"Since we closed the TBEI transaction at the beginning of June, our strong cash flow has facilitated a reduction in debt of almost $34 million, lowering our debt leverage ratio at the end of 2017 to 2.2 times adjusted EBITDA, which is down from 2.7 times adjusted EBITDA at the completion of the acquisition.\"\nThe Company funded dividends of $4.2 million during the fourth quarter, bringing the totals for the year to $16.8 million, and the Board of Directors also recently declared a $0.07 per share dividend that will be payable in the first quarter of 2018.\nOutlook\n\"We entered 2018 with strong order momentum contributing to a healthy backlog. In addition, we are seeing positive economic indicators across many of our end markets,\" Sherman continued. \"While we expect to realize significant benefits from tax reform, we are committed to utilizing some of those savings to accelerate our longer-term growth initiatives, such as developing new products and enhancing our sales channels. We currently expect that the reduction in the corporate tax rate, net of these planned investments, will benefit our 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We are anticipating meaningful year-over-year improvement in the first quarter, although seasonal effects typically result in our first quarter earnings being lower than subsequent quarters. For the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share * to be between $1.10 and $1.20, which would represent a year-over-year improvement of between 29% and 41%\".\n* Adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") is a non-GAAP measure, which includes certain adjustments to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS. In 2017, we made adjustments to exclude the impact of restructuring activity, executive severance costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects, pension settlement charges, hearing loss settlement charges and special tax items, where applicable. Should any similar items occur in 2018, we would expect to exclude them from the determination of adjusted EPS. However, because of the underlying uncertainty in quantifying amounts which may not yet be known, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EPS outlook to the most applicable GAAP measure is excluded based on the unreasonable efforts exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B).\nCONFERENCE CALL\nFederal Signal will host its fourth quarter conference call on Wednesday, February 28, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

respectively. The increase was primarily driven by a $6.1 million pension settlement charge, a $0.3 million increase in acquisition and integration-related expenses, increased legal expenses associated with hearing loss litigation and higher employee incentive compensation costs.\nCorporate operating expenses were $32.3 million and $23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase of $8.9 million was primarily driven by a $6.1 million pension settlement charge, a $0.8 million increase in acquisition and integration-related expenses associated with the TBEI acquisition, the recognition of $0.7 million in executive severance costs, increased legal expenses associated with hearing loss litigation and higher employee incentive compensation costs, partially offset by lower pension expenses.\nSEC REGULATION G NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\nThe financial measures presented below are unaudited and are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided this supplemental information to investors, analysts, and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of operating results, to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments shown in the reconciliations below, and to provide an additional measure of performance which management considers in operating the business.\nAdjusted net income and earnings per share from continuing operations (\"EPS\"):\nThe Company believes that modifying its 2017 and 2016 net income and diluted EPS provides additional measures which are representative of the Company's underlying performance and improve the comparability of results between reporting periods. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, adjustments were made to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS to exclude the impact of restructuring activity, executive severance costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects, pension settlement charges, hearing loss settlement charges and debt settlement charges, where applicable. In addition, during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, adjustments were made to reported GAAP income tax expense to exclude certain special tax items, which include the Company's preliminary estimate of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n29.3\n$\n12.1\n$\n60.5\n$\n39.4\nAdd:\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(16.9)\n1.2\n0.5\n17.4\nIncome before income taxes\n12.4\n13.3\n61.0\n56.8\nAdd:\nRestructuring\n0.1\n0.1\n0.6\n1.7\nExecutive severance costs\n—\n—\n0.7\n—\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.5\n0.2\n2.7\n1.4\nPurchase accounting effects (a)\n0.5\n0.9\n4.8\n3.9\nPension settlement charges\n6.1\n—\n6.1\n—\nHearing loss settlement charges\n1.5\n—\n1.5\n—\nDebt settlement charges\n—\n—\n—\n0.3\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n$\n21.1\n$\n14.5\n$\n77.4\n$\n64.1\nAdjusted income tax expense (b) (c)\n(6.7)\n(4.8)\n(26.3)\n(22.1)\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations\n$\n14.4\n$\n9.7\n$\n51.1\n$\n42.0\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars per diluted share)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEPS, as reported\n$\n0.48\n$\n0.20\n$\n1.00\n$\n0.64\nAdd:\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(0.28)\n0.02\n0.01\n0.29\nIncome before income taxes\n0.20\n0.22\n1.01\n0.93\nAdd:\nRestructuring\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.03\nExecutive severance costs\n—\n—\n0.01\n—\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.01\n0.00\n0.04\n0.02\nPurchase accounting effects (a)\n0.01\n0.02\n0.08\n0.06\nPension settlement charges\n0.10\n—\n0.10\n—\nHearing loss settlement charges\n0.03\n—\n0.03\n—\nDebt settlement charges\n—\n—\n—\n0.01\nAdjusted income before income taxes\n$\n0.35\n$\n0.24\n$\n1.28\n$\n1.05\nAdjusted income tax expense (b) (c)\n(0.11)\n(0.08)\n(0.43)\n(0.36)\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.16\n$\n0.85\n$\n0.69\n(a)\nPurchase accounting effects relate to adjustments to exclude the step-up in the valuation of equipment acquired in connection with current and prior-year acquisitions that was sold subsequent to the acquisition dates in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as well as to exclude the depreciation of the step-up in the valuation of the rental fleet acquired in the JJE transaction.\n(b)\nAdjusted income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 excludes a $20.0 million net tax benefit, representing the Company's preliminary estimate of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, and a $0.8 million benefit from changes in state deferred tax valuation allowance. Adjusted income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 also excludes $0.6 million of tax expense associated with a change in the enacted state tax rate in Illinois. Adjusted income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 also excludes the tax effects of restructuring activity, executive severance costs, acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects, hearing loss settlement charges and pension settlement charges, where applicable.\n(c)\nAdjusted income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 excludes a $2.2 million net benefit resulting from changes in deferred tax valuation allowances in Canada and the U.K. Adjusted income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 also excludes the tax effects of restructuring activity, acquisition and integration-related expenses, purchase accounting effects and debt settlement charges, where applicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nThe Company uses adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net sales (\"adjusted EBITDA margin\"), at both the consolidated and segment level, as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. We believe that investors use versions of these metrics in a similar manner. For these reasons, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, at both the consolidated and segment level, are meaningful metrics to investors in evaluating the Company's underlying financial performance.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of income from continuing operations, interest expense, pension settlement charges, hearing loss settlement charges, debt settlement charges, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, executive severance costs, purchase accounting effects, other income/expense, income tax (benefit) expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of income from continuing operations, interest expense, pension settlement charges, hearing loss settlement charges, debt settlement charges, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, executive severance costs, purchase accounting effects, other income/expense, income tax (benefit) expense, and depreciation and amortization expense divided by net sales for the applicable period(s).\nSegment adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of segment operating income, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, purchase accounting effects and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of segment operating income, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, purchase accounting effects and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable, divided by net sales for the applicable period(s). Segment operating income includes all revenues, costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved. In determining segment income, neither corporate nor interest expenses are included. Segment depreciation and amortization expense relates to those assets, both tangible and intangible, that are utilized by the respective segment.\nOther companies may use different methods to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.\nConsolidated\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles income from continuing operations to consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nIncome from continuing operations\n29.3\n12.1\n60.5\n39.4\nAdd:\nInterest expense\n2.7\n0.5\n7.3\n1.9\nPension settlement charges\n6.1\n—\n6.1\n—\nHearing loss settlement charges\n1.5\n—\n1.5\n—\nDebt settlement charges\n—\n—\n—\n0.3\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.5\n0.2\n2.7\n1.4\nRestructuring\n0.1\n0.1\n0.6\n1.7\nExecutive severance costs\n—\n—\n0.7\n—\nPurchase accounting effects *\n0.2\n0.8\n4.4\n3.6\nOther (income) expense, net\n(0.2)\n—\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(16.9)\n1.2\n0.5\n17.4\nDepreciation and amortization\n8.7\n6.1\n30.0\n19.1\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA\n$\n32.0\n$\n21.0\n$\n113.1\n$\n83.5\nNet sales\n$\n247.6\n$\n176.1\n$\n898.5\n$\n707.9\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA margin\n12.9\n%\n11.9\n%\n12.6\n%\n11.8\n%\n* Excludes purchase accounting expense effects included within depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively\nEnvironmental Solutions Group\nThe following table summarizes the Environmental Solutions Group's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles operating income to adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nOperating income\n$\n19.9\n$\n10.2\n$\n72.4\n$\n54.1\nAdd:\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n0.3\n0.2\n1.0\n0.5\nPurchase accounting effects *\n0.2\n0.8\n4.4\n3.6\nDepreciation and amortization\n7.6\n4.9\n25.7\n14.5\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n28.0\n$\n16.1\n$\n103.5\n$\n72.7\nNet sales\n$\n192.0\n$\n121.6\n$\n692.6\n$\n490.7\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n14.6\n%\n13.2\n%\n14.9\n%\n14.8\n%\n* Excludes purchase accounting expense effects included within depreciation and amortization of $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively\nSafety and Security Systems Group\nThe following table summarizes the Safety and Security Systems Group's adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles operating income to adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nOperating income\n$\n8.9\n$\n9.0\n$\n27.0\n$\n27.0\nAdd:\nRestructuring\n0.1\n0.1\n0.6\n1.7\nDepreciation and amortization\n1.0\n1.1\n4.1\n4.4\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n10.0\n$\n10.2\n$\n31.7\n$\n33.1\nNet sales\n$\n55.6\n$\n54.5\n$\n205.9\n$\n217.2\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n18.0\n%\n18.7\n%\n15.4\n%\n15.2\n%\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/federal-signal-reports-outstanding-fourth-quarter-with-83-order-growth-and-142-improvement-in-net-income-300605483.html\nSOURCE Federal Signal Corporation",
