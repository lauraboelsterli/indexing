    "text": "26 COMMENTS Democratic governors from four northeastern states joined forces Thursday to restrict the movement of illegal guns between their states and share information about residents who have been banned from owning firearms.\nA memorandum of understanding signed by the governors of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island creates a task force of law-enforcement members from the four states who will analyze and share information on guns purchased outside of the region that were involved in crimes in the hopes of intercepting people suspected of illegally bringing guns across the four states’ borders.\nThe agreement also allows their law enforcement agencies to share information from their mental health registries, which aren’t included in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\nThree Decades of School Shootings New York’s database, for example, lists more than 70,000 people who are prohibited from possessing firearms because mental health professionals have diagnosed them as likely to hurt themselves or others.\n“All of our states are already ahead of the federal government when it comes to laws on this issue,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a joint conference call between the governors. “Change comes when people demand change.”\nNew York and Connecticut strengthened gun-control measures after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 26, and New Jersey and Rhode Island also have strict firearm laws. But the states’ four governors said they can better protect the region as a whole by sharing information and more closely cooperating between law enforcement agencies.\n“We can’t wait for the federal government to act,” Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said. “The states that have done something and want to do more are coming together.”\nRelated Video In an emotional meeting at the White House on Wednesday, students, parents, and administrators affected by school shootings offered pleas for change to President Trump. Photo: Getty Many of the guns used in crimes that occur in Connecticut were purchased out of state, Mr. Malloy said.\nThe four states all have centralized crime and intelligence databases that were expanded after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, so sharing the information isn’t difficult from a technological standpoint, said Mr. Cuomo’s chief counsel, Alphonso David.\nThe steps follow last week’s shooting at a Florida high school that killed 17 and sparked calls for new measures to protect schools. President Donald Trump has proposed allowing teachers to have guns on campus, raising the legal age to 21 for ownership of certain guns and banning “bump stock” firearm accessories.\nJeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University who studies gun policies, said even background checks that include mental health information wouldn’t prevent all mass shootings because many people who are prone to violence don’t fall into the categories that would merit inclusion on these registries.\n“I do believe that we certainly need better enforcement of anti-trafficking laws, and anything these states can do to work together on that is good,” Mr. Swanson said.\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who has moved to strengthen gun control measures blocked by his Republican predecessor, said the cross-state coalition is an important effort in the face of “complete and utter inaction in Congress.”\nRelated Coverage Parkland Students Protest in Tallahassee, Raising Political Pressure for Tougher Gun Laws Trump, at White House Forum, Signals Support for Arming School Staff Florida, A Big Death-Penalty State, Weighs What to Do About School Shooting Trump Takes Step to Ban ‘Bump Stocks’ FBI Probes Tip-Line Operations After Missed Florida-Shooting Warning Gun Rights Expand Amid Shootings Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com",
