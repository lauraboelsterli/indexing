Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, predictions, forecasts, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “could,” “may,” “predict,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expect,” “intend” or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for our future business and financial performance. All forward looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future results, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. You are, therefore, cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Further, any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, operating results, business strategy and financial needs. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. For more information regarding these risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional risks that we face, you should review the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the offering and those incorporated by reference therein, including those risks described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and in subsequent reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the SEC.\nSource:NMI Holdings Inc",
