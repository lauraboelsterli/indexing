    "text": " 47 PM / Updated 2 minutes ago General Electric's workforce grew 6 percent last year: SEC filing Reuters Staff 1 Min Read NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) added 18,000 thousand employees to its worldwide workforce last year, a 6.1 percent increase that comes as the company is trying to cut costs to shore up its profits, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. The Boston-based conglomerate said it had 313,000 employees at year-end, including 106,000 in the United States, and that it can repatriate approximately $10 billion of non-U.S. cash without incremental federal income tax because of recent U.S. tax law changes. GE posted nearly a $10 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2017. Reporting by Alwyn Scott, Shravanth V and Karina Dsouza; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",
