(NYSE: FBHS), an industry-leading home and security products company, today announced fourth quarter 2017 results from continuing operations and provided its 2018 annual outlook for sales and earnings per share.\n“In the fourth quarter our teams drove strong sales growth. Sales momentum built month-to-month throughout the quarter as we overcame a soft October due to storms, and again delivered strong operating margin across all segments,” said Chris Klein, chief executive officer, Fortune Brands. “In the full year 2017, we executed well against our strategy of profitable growth and achieved solid results that continue to reflect healthy consumer demand for our home and security products, despite continued trade labor constraints that can act as a governor on growth. With our consistently solid execution, we are well-positioned for continued strong performance in 2018 as the housing market continues its elongated recovery.”\nFourth Quarter 2017\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, sales were $1.4 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per share were $0.83, compared to $0.67 in the prior-year quarter. EPS before charges/gains were $0.80, compared to $0.71 the same quarter last year. Operating income was $163.0 million, compared to $166.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating income before charges/gains was $186.6 million, compared to $172.8 million the same quarter last year, up 8 percent.\nFor each segment in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the prior-year quarter:\nPlumbing sales increased 10 percent and 9 percent organically driven by strong point-of-sale performance across channels, and share gains in China. Segment operating margin before charges/gains was 20.8 percent. Cabinet sales increased 4 percent led by low double digit growth of in-stock cabinets and vanities, and high single digit growth in builder direct. Segment operating margin before charges/gains was 10.7 percent. Door sales were up 6 percent driven by growth in both the wholesale and retail channels, and operating margin before charges/gains was 14.5 percent, an increase of 120 basis points. Security sales increased 4 percent, driven by strong U.S. retail, safety and international sales. Operating margin before charges/gains was 15.0 percent.\nFull Year 2017\nFor the full year 2017, sales were $5.3 billion, an increase of 6 percent over 2016. Earnings per share were $3.05 compared to $2.61 in the prior year, and EPS before charges/gains were $3.08 versus $2.75 last year, an increase of 12 percent.\n“In 2017 we continued to execute our strategy of disciplined, profitable growth as we increased earnings per share 12 percent. Our sales grew 6 percent and our operating margin before charges/gains increased to 13.7 percent, demonstrating that we continue to execute well in a market that is recovering gradually. Overall, we are driving profitable growth across a great portfolio of businesses,” said Klein.\n“In addition to growing our earnings, we continued to deploy capital in value-creating ways as we bought back $215 million of our shares, spent approximately $140 million on two plumbing acquisitions, and increased our quarterly dividend for the 5th consecutive year. Our balance sheet remained strong during 2017,” said Patrick Hallinan, chief financial officer, Fortune Brands. “As of December 31, 2017, cash was $323 million and debt was $1.5 billion, resulting in net debt to EBITDA of 1.4 times and giving us substantial flexibility to continue to create incremental shareholder value. Additionally, free cash flow was $464 million.”\nAnnual Outlook for 2018\nThe Company’s 2018 annual outlook is based on a U.S. home products market growth assumption of 5 to 7 percent and an assumption of 5 to 6 percent growth for our total global market. The Company expects full-year 2018 sales growth in the range of 6 to 7 percent.\nThe Company expects EPS before charges/gains to be in the range of $3.54 to $3.66, the midpoint of which is 17 percent higher than last year, including the positive impact of a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate.\n“We are excited about the new tax legislation. The one-time adjustments we had to make in 2017 were nominal and positive overall, and going forward the impact should be significantly favorable. We estimate our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 24 and 26 percent,” said Klein. “As a large U.S. manufacturer, with a large majority of our sales and employees based in the U.S., we are a clear winner as a result of this change and are better positioned than we were just six weeks ago. We look forward to leveraging our improved position to sell even more products in the most exciting housing market in the world.”\n“Entering 2018 our annual outlook again calls for strong performance based on improved earnings; a continued focus on disciplined, profitable growth; and the financial flexibility we have to drive incremental growth,” continued Klein. “Although we continue to drive sales and profit growth, I believe we have only begun to test our full value creation potential in this housing market. Additionally, tax reform is a significant positive that will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses, and deploy additional capital to drive long-term shareholder value. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to leverage our structural competitive advantages and drive profitable growth well into the future.”\nAbout Fortune Brands\nFortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

Reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS guidance cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to gains and losses associated with our defined benefit plans and restructuring and other charges, which are excluded from the diluted EPS before charges/gains.

Such costs may include inventory obsolescence provisions, trade receivables allowances from exiting product lines, accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of facilities, and gains or losses on the sale of previously closed facilities. In addition, other charges include acquisition related inventory step-up expense of $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $3.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 in our Plumbing Segment, $ 1.6 million of compensation expense related to deferred purchase price considerations payable to certain former Victoria + Albert shareholders contingent on their employment through October 2018 and $0.7 million of transaction related U.K. stamp duty resulting from our acquisition of Victoria + Albert.\n(4) Represents actuarial gains or losses associated with our defined benefit plans. Actuarial gains or losses in a period represent the difference between actual and actuarially assumed experience, principally related to liability discount rates and plan asset returns, as well as other actuarial assumptions including compensation rates, turnover rates, and health care cost trend rates. The Company recognizes actuarial gains or losses immediately in operating income to the extent they cumulatively exceed a “corridor.” The corridor is equal to the greater of 10% of the fair value of plan assets or 10% of a plan’s projected benefit obligation. Actuarial gains or losses are determined at required remeasurement dates which occur at least annually in the fourth quarter. Remeasurements due to plan amendments and settlements may also occur in interim periods during the year. Our operating income before charges/gains reflects our expected rate of return on pension plan assets which in a given period may materially differ from our actual return on plan assets. Our liability discount rates and plan asset returns are based upon difficult to predict fluctuations in global bond and equity markets that are not directly related to the Company’s business. We believe that the exclusion of actuarial gains or losses from operating income before charges/gains provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of the business from period to period that may be considered in conjunction with our operating income as measured on a GAAP basis. We present this supplemental information because such actuarial gains or losses may create volatility in our operating income that does not necessarily have an immediate corresponding impact on operating cash flow or the actual compensation and benefits provided to our employees. The table below sets forth additional supplemental information on the Company’s historical actual and expected rate of return on plan assets, as well as discount rates used to value its defined benefit obligations:\n($ In millions) Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 %\n$\n%\n$\nActual return on plan assets 16.3% $83.2 10.0% $46.6 Expected return on plan assets 6.4% 37.3 6.6% 37.2 Discount rate at December 31: Pension benefits 3.8% 4.3% Postretirement benefits 3.4% 3.4% (a) (b) For definitions of Non-GAAP measures, see Definitions of Terms page\nFORTUNE BRANDS HOME & SECURITY, INC.
