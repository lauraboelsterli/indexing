    "text": "Guard Frank Howard scored a game-high 18 points -- 12 of them in the second half -- and Syracuse used a 9-2 run midway through the second half to break a 43-43 tie and assume the lead for good in a 62-55 victory over cold-shooting Miami Saturday in Coral Gables.\nForward Oshae Brissett added 16 for the Orange (18-9, 7-7 ACC).\nGuard Chris Lykes scored 14 points to lead the Hurricanes (18-8, 7-6), who shot just 33.9 percent in suffering their first three-game losing streak of the season.\nBoth teams got off to cold starts with the Orange starting the game 1-of-6 from the field, the Hurricanes 1-of-8. That left the Orange with a 4-2 lead after over four minutes in.\nSyracuse finally began finding the range and pulled out to a 16-9 lead with just over 11 minutes played as Miami continued to struggle from the field, making only one of its next five shots.\nBut then the Orange reverted to their cold-shooting ways and the Hurricanes fought back to take their first lead since an early 8-7 lead to take a 21-20 on guard Lonnie Walker’s driving bank shot at the 2:14 mark.\nThey ended the first 20 minutes deadlocked at 25 as both teams blew opportunities for leads. Miami turned the ball over with 5.1 seconds left when the arrow on tie-up favored the Orange, but guard Tyus Battle’s running jumper was short at the buzzer.\nWalker opened the second half with a 3-pointer to give Miami a quick 28-25 lead, but the Hurricanes missed their next five shots while the Orange went on an 13-0 run, making all six of their attempts, for a 10-point bulge less than five minutes into the period.\nThey stretched that to 40-28 before Miami scored again on Lyke’s 3-pointer to ignite a comeback that resulted in a 43-43 tie with 9:34 left in the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
