    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LINN Energy, Inc. (OTCQB:LNGG) (“LINN” or the “Company”) announces financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and also provides guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018.\nThe Company highlights the following:\nStrong balance sheet with no debt, forecast excess cash of ~$405 million at the end of the first quarter 2018 Repurchased ~5.9 million shares for ~$206 million as part of the ongoing $400 million share repurchase program Returned capital to shareholders through a successful $325 million tender offer for ~6.8 million shares Announced strategic plan to separate into three standalone companies during 2018 Formed Roan Resources LLC (“Roan”) and hired a best in class executive management team that has taken over operations as of first quarter 2018 Blue Mountain Midstream LLC (“Blue Mountain”) continues construction of the Chisholm Trail Cryogenic Plant which is on track to be commissioned during the second quarter of 2018\n“We have made tremendous progress this past year toward our goal of maximizing value for our shareholders. Through our successful divestiture program of almost $2.0 billion, we have extinguished all our debt, executed on our share repurchase program and recently completed a sizable tender offer to return capital to our shareholders. At the same time we performed exceptionally well operationally, having consistently met or exceeded guidance each of the past four quarters. This year, we plan to further enhance value by implementing our plan to separate into three unique public companies and believe this separation will unlock the inherent value of each as they focus on the growth and development of their high quality assets,” said Mark E. Ellis, LINN’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\nKey Financial Results (1) Fourth Quarter Full Year $ in millions 2017 2016 2017 (2) 2016 Average daily production (MMcfe/d) 505 748 637 796 Oil, natural gas and NGL sales $ 180 $ 256 $ 898 $ 874 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 86 $ (262) $ 2,750 $ (367) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes $ 0.2 $ (572) $ 82 $ (1,805) Net income (loss) $ 86 $ (834) $ 2,833 $ (2,172) Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) (3) $ 75 $ 113 $ 394 $ 710 LINN Adjusted EBITDAX for Roan (a non-GAAP financial measure) (4) $ 22 N/A $ 27 N/A Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 73 $ (20) $ 235 $ 831 Oil and natural gas capital $ 31 $ 61 $ 239 $ 127 Total capital $ 61 $ 74 $ 344 $ 172\n(1) All amounts reflect continuing operations with the exception of net income (loss). (2) All amounts reflect the combined results of the ten months ended December 31, 2017 (successor) and the two months ended February 28, 2017 (predecessor).

See Schedule 1 below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX. (4) Represents the Adjusted EBITDAX for LINN’s 50% equity interest in Roan for the period from September 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. See Schedule 1 below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX. Strong Balance Sheet\nFrom its successful divestiture program in 2017, the Company extinguished all outstanding debt. The Company currently has no borrowings outstanding under its $425 million revolving credit facility and there is approximately $378 million available borrowing capacity including outstanding letters of credit. Pending the closing of previously announced asset sales, the Company forecasts to have approximately $405 million of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nSuccessful Tender Offer\nThe Board continues to focus on returning capital to its shareholders and on January 22, 2018, the Company completed its tender offer to purchase for cash up to 6,770,833 shares of its Class A common stock (the “shares”) at a price of $48.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $325 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the offer. Approximately 78.1 million shares were properly tendered, which represented more than 93% of the outstanding shares. The shares acquired represented approximately 8.1% of the Company’s outstanding shares and since the offer was oversubscribed, the number of shares that LINN purchased from each tendering shareholder was pro-rated. The pro-ration factor for the shares was approximately 8.7% and payment for the shares purchased was made on or about January 25, 2018.\nContinuation of Share Repurchase Plan\nOn October 4, 2017, the Company’s Board authorized an increase to its share repurchase program up to a total of $400 million of the Company’s outstanding shares. During the period from June 2017 through December 2017, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 5,690,192 shares at an average price of $34.85 per share for a total cost of approximately $198 million. The share repurchase program continued following the termination of the tender offer. As of February 21, 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 206,839 shares at an average price of $38.96 per share for a total cost of approximately $8 million and approximately $194 million remained on the current $400 million repurchase authorization.\nStrategic Plan to Separate into Three Companies\nIn December 2017, the Company announced its intention to separate LINN Energy into three standalone companies during 2018. The proposed separation will further maximize shareholder value by giving shareholders focused exposure to three unique companies as outlined below. The Company is continuing to evaluate the structure and potential tax consequences of any such separation.\nRoan Resources LLC. A pure play high growth company focused in the prolific Merge/SCOOP/STACK play. LINN Energy, Inc., which currently trades on the OTCQB market under the ticker LNGG, will serve as a holding company solely for the existing 50 percent equity interest of Roan and would prepare to up list on either the NYSE or NASDAQ in 2018. Blue Mountain Midstream LLC. A rapidly expanding and highly economic midstream business centered in the core of the Merge. The Board continues to evaluate all options which include, among other things, hiring a separate management team, establishing an independent capital structure, pursuing additional third party acreage dedication, exploring potential strategic alternatives and/or a separate public listing independent from LNGG. The Chisholm Trail Midstream business in the Merge is expected to be the primary asset for Blue Mountain at separation. “NewCo”. The Company expects to form a new public company comprised of the following assets: Hugoton, Michigan/Illinois, Arkoma, NW STACK, East Texas and North Louisiana. “NewCo” is expected to be unlevered and generate significant free cash flow with a strategic focus on developing its growth oriented assets and returning capital to shareholders.\nRoan Resources\nRoan Resources LLC is a newly formed company focused on the accelerated development of approximately 150,000 net acres in the prolific Merge/SCOOP/STACK play of Oklahoma. Roan currently has 6 drilling rigs and 2 completion crews active in the Merge. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Roan completed 19 wells that are now on production, and Roan currently has 5 drilled but uncompleted wells (DUC’s) with approximately 8 miles of uncompleted lateral length.\nRoan’s daily net production increased to approximately 40,800 BOE/d at the end of January 2018. Activity continues to increase in the Merge area where more than 190 new permits have been filed over the past five months and there are currently 32 active drilling rigs. Roan plans to focus on improving the technical execution of its development program during 2018, specifically as it relates to geosteering and completion design. Recent well results have shown initial success at this strategy, where gross three stream peak IP-30 rates have averaged approximately 1,870 BOE/d (73% liquids) when normalized to 10,000 ft lateral lengths.\nAdditional information on Roan can be found in the supplemental presentation located on LINN’s website: http://ir.linnenergy.com/presentations.cfm\nBlue Mountain Midstream\nIn July 2017, Blue Mountain entered into a definitive agreement to construct a highly efficient, state-of-the-art 250 MMcf/d cryogenic gas processing system to expand its existing Chisholm Trail midstream business (“Chisholm Trail”) located in the heart of the prolific liquids-rich Merge/SCOOP/STACK play. Construction is on schedule and the new cryogenic plant is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of 2018. In December 2017, the Company reached an agreement with a third party to increase the total acreage dedicated to Chisholm Trail to more than 80,000 net acres. Blue Mountain continues to pursue additional third-party dedications to accelerate the timeline to reach full capacity and further expand in the future.\nNW STACK\nThe Company has a significant acreage position in the NW STACK with positive offset horizontal results in the Osage and Meramec with recent IP-30 rates of more than 1,000 BOE/d. In 2018, LINN is planning to participate in non-operated activity and is actively evaluating potential drilling plans and strategies to core up its acreage along with assessing additional midstream opportunities. Activity continues to increase in the NW STACK where more than 132 new permits have been filed over the past five months and there are currently 33 active drilling rigs.\nNorth Louisiana and East Texas Development\nIn North Louisiana, the Company drilled two operated horizontal wells last year in Ruston to test the Lower and Upper Red formations. The Lower Red test resulted in a choke managed 24-hr IP rate of approximately 12.7 MMcf/d and a peak IP-30 rate of 11 MMcf/d. The Upper Red test resulted in a choke managed 24-hr IP rate of approximately 20.4 MMcf/d a peak IP-30 rate of 19.4 MMcf/d. In 2018, the Company plans to primarily focus on participating in non-operated activity on its acreage and depending on commodity prices may pursue operated drilling activity.\nIn East Texas, the Company drilled two operated horizontal wells last year targeting the Bossier and Cotton Valley Lime formation. The wells resulted in 24-hr IP rates of approximately 13.5 MMcf/d and 10.2 MMcfe/d while being closely choke managed. The Company plans to drill additional wells in 2018 to further delineate its operated acreage and to maximize returns.\nProved Reserves Update\nProved reserves at December 31, 2017, were approximately 1,968 Bcfe, of which approximately 70% were natural gas, 22% were natural gas liquids and 8% were oil. Approximately 97% were classified as proved developed, with a total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately $1.05 billion. PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure) was approximately $1.3 billion with exclusion of income taxes and the inclusion of helium. See Schedule 2 below for a reconciliation of PV-10.\nProved Reserves Table Total Continuing Operations (Bcfe) Proved reserves at December 31, 2016 3,350 Revisions of previous estimates (78) Sales of minerals in place (1,213) Extensions and discoveries 142 Production (233) Proved reserves at December 31, 2017 1,968\nFourth Quarter Actuals versus Revised Guidance Q4 Actuals Revised\nQ4 Guidance Net Production (MMcfe/d) 505 496 – 512 Natural gas (MMcf/d) 321 315 – 325 Oil (Bbls/d) 13,000 12,800 – 13,200 NGL (Bbls/d) 17,600 17,300 – 17,900 Other revenues, net (in thousands) (1) $ 9,647 $ 9,000 - $ 10,000 Operating Costs (in thousands) $ 89,200 $ 87,000 – $ 93,000 Lease operating expenses $ 51,487 $ 50,000 – $ 54,000 Transportation expenses $ 27,476 $ 27,000 – $ 28,000 Taxes, other than income taxes $ 10,237 $ 10,000 – $ 11,000 General and administrative expenses (2) $ 27,235 $ 26,000 – $ 28,000 Targets (Mid-Point) (in thousands) Adjusted EBITDAX (3) $ 74,791 N/A Interest expense $ 387 $ 0 Oil and natural gas capital $ 31,420 $ 29,000 – $ 33,000 Total capital $ 61,426 $ 55,000 – $ 65,000 Weighted Average NYMEX Differentials Natural gas (MMBtu) ($ 0.35) ($ 0.37) – ($ 0.33) Oil (Bbl) ($ 1.92) ($ 1.65) – ($ 1.45) NGL price as a % of NYMEX oil price 43% 42% – 44%\n(1) Includes other revenues and margin on marketing activities (2) As included in operating cash flow and excludes share-based compensation expenses (3) Adjusted EBITDAX not provided in the previously announced revised guidance First Quarter and Full Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company has approved a 2018 capital budget of $134 million that includes $34 million of oil and natural gas capital, $98 million of plant and pipeline capital and $2 million of administrative capital.

titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a measure used by Company management to evaluate the Company’s operational performance and for comparisons to the Company’s industry peers. Management also believes this information may be useful to investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the Company’s financial results.\nThe following presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDAX:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\n2016\n2017 (1)\n2016\n(in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 85,737 $ (834,237 ) $ 2,832,728 $ (2,171,856 ) Plus (less): (Income) loss from discontinued operations (150 ) 572,372 (82,447 ) 1,804,513 Interest expense 387 25,394 29,086 184,870 Income tax expense 229,491 8,250 388,776 11,194 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 32,153 79,734 180,866 342,614 Exploration costs 2,100 1,335 3,230 4,080 EBITDAX 349,718 (147,152 ) 3,352,239 175,415 Plus (less): Impairment of long-lived assets ― ― ― 165,044 Noncash (gains) losses on oil and natural gas derivatives 12,880 94,023 (90,863 ) 668,273 Noncash settlements on derivatives (2) ― ― ― 34,335 Accrued settlements on oil derivative contracts related to current production period (3) (2,975 ) (389 ) (1,775 ) (73,743 ) Share-based compensation expenses 15,409 19,704 91,540 44,218 Write-off of deferred financing fees ― 60 2,975 1,462 Earnings from equity method investments (9,135 ) (188 ) (11,997 ) (699 ) (Gains) losses on sale of assets and other, net (4) (291,410 ) 1,064 (626,139 ) 7,113 Reorganization items, net (5) 304 145,838 (2,322,338 ) (311,599 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 74,791 $ 112,960 $ 393,642 $ 709,819 In addition, the Company reported the following other items:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 (1) 2016 (in thousands)\nPrepetition restructuring costs included in general and administrative expenses (6) $ ― $ ― $ ― $ 19,567 Premiums paid for put options that settled during the period (7) ― ― ― (58,246 )\n(1) All amounts reflect the combined results of the ten months ended December 31, 2017 (successor) and the two months ended February 28, 2017 (predecessor). (2) Represent derivative settlements that were paid directly by the counterparties to the lenders under the predecessor’s credit facility, and as such were not included on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows. (3) Represent amounts related to oil derivative contracts that settled during the respective period (contract terms had expired) but cash had not been received as of the end of the period. (4) Primarily represent gains or losses on the sale of assets and gains or losses on inventory valuation. (5) ﻿Represent costs and income directly associated with the Company’s filing for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since the petition date, and also include adjustments to reflect the carrying value of certain liabilities subject to compromise at their estimated allowed claim amounts, as such adjustments are determined.\n(6) Represent restructuring costs incurred by the Company prior to its filing for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which are included in general and administrative expenses.

The Company’s calculation of PV-10 herein differs from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC in that it is calculated before income taxes and including the impact of helium, rather than after income taxes and not including the impact of helium, using the average price during the 12-month period, determined as an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month. The Company’s calculation of PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nThe following presents a reconciliation of standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to the Company’s calculation of PV-10 at December 31, 2017 (in millions):\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (1) $ 1,045 Plus: Difference due to exclusion of federal income taxes 155 Plus: Difference due to the inclusion of helium 146 PV-10 $ 1,346\n(1) Estimated using the average price during the 12-month period, determined as an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, which were $51.34 per Bbl and $2.98 per MMBtu.\nSource:LINN Energy, LLC",
