    "text": "Brendan Perlini scored two goals, including the winner, just 19 seconds apart, and rookie Clayton Keller provided a goal and three assists as the Arizona Coyotes beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-2 on Thursday night in Glendale, Ariz.\nPerlini’s two tallies came early in the second period as the Coyotes, who rank last overall in the 31-team National Hockey League, won their second consecutive game. The Canadiens, a long shot to make the playoffs, took their second loss in two nights.\nTobias Rieder and Josh Archibald also scored for the Coyotes, while Oliver Ekman-Larsson furnished three assists.\nBrendan Gallager and Daniel Carr scored for the Canadiens.\nThe Coyotes scored on their two power plays while the Canadiens went 1-for-3 in man-advantage situations.\nCoyotes goaltender Aanti Raanta posted his 11th win of the season while stopping 34 shots as the Canadiens outshot Arizona 36-21.\nHabs goaltender Carey Price took his first loss in 10 career games against the Coyotes, recording 16 saves.\nThe Coyotes swept their two-game season series with Montreal after also beating the Canadiens in Canada in November.\nThe Canadiens entered the game looking for a better result after being shut out one night earlier -- for the eighth time this season -- during a visit to Colorado. However, Keller put the Coyotes on the scoreboard first during a power play 13:56 into the game, deflecting Ekman-Larsson’s shot past Price.\nPerlini put the Coyotes ahead 3-0 with his two quick goals 1:16 into the second period, when defensive miscues hurt the Habs. His first goal came on a slap shot at the 57-second mark as he wired home Keller’s pass from the corner. With the crowd still buzzing, Perlini beat Price on a breakaway after taking a lead pass from Ekman-Larsson.\nGallagher’s power-play goal reduced Arizona’s lead to 3-1 at 5:46 of the third period. Less than two minutes later, Carr pulled the Canadiens within a goal on a wrist shot. However, the Coyotes snuffed the comeback threat with goals by Rieder, on the power play at 10:46, and Archibald at 16:01.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
