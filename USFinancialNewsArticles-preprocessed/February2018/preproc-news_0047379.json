Mr. Mattacchione has informed us that he has accepted a position as Chief Financial Officer of private-equity backed CDMO company Albany Molecular Research, Inc., commencing in April 2018.\nMr. Mattacchione's resignation is not the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Company, or any matter relating to the Company's accounting practices or financial statements.\nMr. Mattacchione is expected to continue in his role as Bruker's Chief Financial Officer until his departure from the Company, and he will work during the next few weeks to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities. Bruker intends to initiate a search for Mr. Mattacchione's permanent successor. Moreover, Bruker expects to appoint an interim Chief Financial Officer within weeks.\nBruker today also announced the appointment of Gerald N.
