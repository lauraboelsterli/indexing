We delivered on our annual guidance objectives while nearly doubling the size of the Company, integrating a new operating area in the Delaware Basin and building out the infrastructure and team to accommodate our increased activity levels and production growth in 2018. We continue to see impressive well results in both our Midland and Delaware Basin assets and this increased well productivity enabled us to meet the mid-point of our production guidance despite completing twenty fewer horizontal wells than we originally budgeted.\n\"We are well positioned for strong returns in 2018 as we continue to increase our capital efficiency levels and accelerate the completion of our drilled but uncompleted wells carried over from last year's drilling program. We also expect to generate cash flow in excess of our development spending by the fourth quarter of 2018 while growing production 35% at the mid-point of our guidance.\"\nOperational Results\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Production data: Oil (MBbls) 4,078 2,337 14,445 7,790 Natural gas (MMcf) 4,210 2,278 15,126 7,188 NGLs (MBbls) 957 576 3,202 1,685 Total (MBoe) 5,737 3,293 20,168 10,673 Average net daily production (Boe/d) 62,359 35,793 55,255 29,161 Average prices before effects of hedges (1) (2): Oil (per Bbl) $ 53.50 $ 47.23 $ 48.79 $ 41.28 Natural gas (per Mcf) 2.21 2.24 2.39 1.94 NGLs (per Bbl) 22.50 12.94 19.57 10.87 Total (per Boe) $ 43.41 $ 37.33 $ 39.85 $ 33.15 Average realized prices after effects of hedges (1) (2): Oil (per Bbl) $ 51.35 $ 46.20 $ 47.75 $ 41.06 Natural gas (per Mcf) 2.27 2.24 2.43 1.94 NGLs (per Bbl) 22.50 12.94 19.57 10.87 Total (per Boe) $ 41.92 $ 36.60 $ 39.12 $ 32.99 Average costs (per Boe): Lease operating expenses (excluding gathering and transportation) $ 5.25 $ 4.41 $ 5.13 $ 4.93 Gathering and transportation 0.89 0.57 0.96 0.48 Production and ad valorem taxes 2.79 2.01 2.43 2.03 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 13.45 15.94 13.87 18.21 General and administrative - recurring cash component 1.19 2.11 1.50 2.10 General and administrative - recurring stock comp (3) 0.77 0.98 0.85 1.23 General and administrative - non-recurring stock comp (4) — — — 0.06 (1) Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of our cash payments/receipts on the Company's commodity derivative transactions.

At a $50 average oil price, the Company expects to generate cash flow in excess of development spending by the fourth quarter and exit the year at less than 2.0x Net Debt / LTM EBITDAX.\nThe Company is running seven operated rigs currently, and with an expected rig addition in April, will target four rigs running in each basin going forward. RSP is currently running three completion crews, two full-time and one spot crew, and expects to add a third full-time crew in May to replace the spot crew. With 19 wells completed in the first two months of 2018, RSP is off to a strong start towards its guided range of 100-120 operated completions for the full year 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s guidance for 2018.\n2018 Guidance Completions\nOperated Gross Horizontal Completions 100 - 120 Operated Average Working Interest 89% Midland Basin Average Lateral Length ~8,100' Delaware Basin Average Lateral Length ~6,300' Production\nAverage Daily Production (Boe/d) 72,000 - 78,000 % Oil 70% - 72% % Natural Gas 12% - 14% % NGLs 15% - 17% Development Capital Expenditures ($ in MM)\nDrilling and Completion (D&C) $725 - $785 Infrastructure, Capitalized Workovers & Other $90 - $110 Total Development Capital Expenditures $815 - $895 % Midland Basin 45% - 55% % Delaware Basin 45% - 55% % Non-Operated 8% - 10% Income Statement ($/Boe)\nLease operating expenses (including workovers) $5.00 - $5.50 Gathering and transportation $0.90 - $1.20 Exploration expenses $0.10 - $0.20 General and administrative - cash component $1.25 - $1.75 General and administrative - recurring stock comp $0.75 - $0.95 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization ($/Boe) $12.50 - $14.50 Production and ad valorem taxes (% of oil and gas revenues) 6.0% - 8.0% Conference Call\nRSP will host a conference call for investors at 9:00 AM Central Time on Wednesday, February 28, 2017, to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as oil and gas revenues including net cash receipts (payments) on settled derivative instruments and premiums paid on put options that settled during the period, less lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, and expenses excluding stock based compensation. Adjusted Net Income deducts from Adjusted EBITDAX depreciation, depletion, and amortization, accretion on asset retirement obligations, exploration expenses, interest expense, stock-based compensation, acquisition costs and adjusted income tax expense.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are useful because they allow the Company to more effectively evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within the Company's industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income are significant components in understanding and assessing the Company’s financial performance, such as Company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company's computations of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Net Income to the GAAP financial measure of net income.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDAX\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income (loss) $ 140,786 $ 21,326 $ 1,381 $ 232,136 $ (24,851 ) Interest expense 22,174 21,553 13,683 82,459 52,724 Income tax expense (benefit) (153,450 ) 3,678 (1,464 ) (117,628 ) (18,706 ) Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 77,159 73,408 52,484 279,711 194,360 Asset retirement obligation accretion 151 151 118 605 472 Exploration expenses 825 1,497 265 7,771 1,093 Acquisition costs 42 30 6,374 4,525 6,374 Impairments of oil and natural gas properties 52,935 705 579 59,077 4,901 Loss on derivative instruments 46,968 21,626 17,538 39,279 23,760 Net settled derivative Instruments (8,566 ) (2,567 ) (2,398 ) (14,661 ) (1,732 ) Stock-based compensation 4,422 4,361 3,215 17,150 13,764 Other income, net (1,021 ) (1,106 ) (1,246 ) (3,436 ) (1,833 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 182,425 $ 144,662 $ 90,529 $ 586,988 $ 250,326 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (in thousands) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net income (loss) $ 140,786 $ 21,326 $ 1,381 $ 232,136 $ (24,851 ) Acquisition Costs 42 30 6,374 4,525 6,374 Impairments of oil and natural gas properties 52,935 705 579 59,077 4,901 Loss on derivative instruments 46,968 21,626 17,538 39,279 23,760 Net settled derivative Instruments (8,566 ) (2,567 ) (2,398 ) (14,661 ) (1,732 ) Stock-based compensation - non recurring — — — — 682 Other income, net (1,021 ) (1,106 ) (1,246 ) (3,436 ) (1,833 ) Adjustment to income taxes for above items (181,022 ) (11,827 ) (8,833 ) (188,352 ) (14,659 ) Adjusted Net Income (Loss) $ 50,122 $ 28,187 $ 13,395 $ 128,568 $ (7,358 )\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180227006591/en/\nRSP Permian, Inc.\nScott McNeill, 214-252-2700\nChief Financial Officer\nor\nAlyssa Stephens, 214-252-2764\nDirector, Investor Relations\nor\nInvestor Relations, 214-252-2790\nIR@rsppermian.com\nSource: RSP Permian, Inc.",
