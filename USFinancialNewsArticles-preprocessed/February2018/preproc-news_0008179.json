    "text": "BURQIN, West Bank (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian teenager during an arrest raid in the village of Burqin in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian health officials said on Saturday.\nA Reuters witness said about 200 Palestinians were throwing stones at Israeli military vehicles when a shot was heard, adding that a wounded person was then carried to a car.\nIsrael’s military, which said it was checking the report, said its forces had been searching in Burqin for suspects involved in the fatal drive-by shooting of an Israeli rabbi from a nearby settlement on Jan. 9.\nIsraeli forces in the adjacent city of Jenin last month shot and killed a Palestinian gunman whom they suspected of involvement in the rabbi’s shooting.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said the teenager killed on Saturday was 19 years old, while the hospital in Jenin where he was taken said he had been shot in the head.\nThe Israeli military said rioting had broken out while troops were apprehending several suspects connected with the shooting of the rabbi and troops had responded with non-fatal “riot dispersal means”.\nTensions in the region have risen since U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December, since when at least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli have been killed.\nTrump’s reversal of decades of U.S. policy enraged Palestinians, who want to create an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nIsrael captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its eternal, indivisible capital. It pulled out of Gaza in 2005.\nU.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. A bid by Trump’s administration to restart negotiations has shown no real signs of progress.\nReporting by Ali Sawafta; Additional reporting by Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem; editing by Alexander Smith\n ",
