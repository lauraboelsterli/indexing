It would also make way for Albertsons to go public following a more than a decade-long ownership by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, according to WSJ.\nRite Aid and Albertsons did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRite Aid, which sells prescription drugs, has been struggling with eroding profits in its pharmacy business as increases in branded drug prices have slowed while reimbursement pressures for generics has intensified.\nRite Aid has regulatory approval to sell 1,932 stories to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc for $4.38 billion. Under the deal, Rite Aid has the option of joining Walgreensâ€™ group purchasing agreement to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices.
