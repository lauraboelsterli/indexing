    "text": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish utility Fortum ( FORTUM.HE ) fell short of gaining majority control in Germany’s Uniper ( UN01.DE ) with its 8.05 billion euro ($10.0 billion) takeover offer, it said on Wednesday.\nFortum was offered just 0.47 percent of Uniper shares in the tender that expired last week, on top of a 46.65 percent stake that it negotiated separately with E.ON ( EONGn.DE ).\n“We are satisfied with the shareholding we have received, which will, when the transaction is finalised, make Fortum the largest shareholder in Uniper,” Fortum CEO Pekka Lundmark said in a statement.\n“Our priority now is to establish the foundation for such cooperation through talks with Uniper.”\nUniper had fought against the bid, saying it was hostile and too low and that the combination would make little sense given Uniper’s heavy exposure to gas- and coal-fired power plants, compared with Fortum’s focus on clean technologies.\n“We are strengthened by the trust placed in us by our shareholders, who overwhelmingly followed our recommendation and did not accept the takeover offer,” Uniper Chief Executive Klaus Schaefer said in a statement.\n“This shows us that the capital market continues to believe in our strategy and our long-term competitiveness as an independent company.”\nA spokesman for Fortum declined to comment on whether the company would seek to buy more shares.\nFortum has said it was mainly interested in E.ON’s stake and launched the full bid only due to German takeover rules.\nHowever, sources told Reuters last year that Fortum was mainly interested in Uniper’s hydropower and nuclear power assets, and hoped to restructure other parts of the company. Fortum has denied such plans.\nThe offer is still subject to competition and regulatory approvals and Fortum expects to finalize the transaction in mid-2018.\n($1 = 0.8081 euros)\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell; Additional reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ",
