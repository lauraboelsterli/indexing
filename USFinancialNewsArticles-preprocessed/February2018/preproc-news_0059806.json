The $2.15 billion suit revives the heated debate over consolidation in the global parcel industry that culminated in FedEx’s Corp’s purchase of TNT in 2016. The WSJ’s WSJ’s Natalia Drozdiak writes that deal only happened after the European Commission formally blocked the UPS-TNT deal three years earlier over concerns the overnight-parcel-delivery market would effectively become a duopoly between the combined company and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG DPSGY 0.24% . The European Union’s second-highest court last year overturned the decision on the basis of procedural missteps by the regulator. UPS is now seeking compensation from the commission for a decision the company says prevented it from “materializing the benefits associated with that proposed transaction.”\nA dispute over a marine container terminal in East Africa highlights growing international commercial and geopolitical concerns in the region. The nation of Djibouti seized the port facility run by DP World, and the WSJ’s Nikhil Lohade and Matina Stevis-Gridneff report the action marks a dramatic step in the tiny country’s moves to take stronger control of a strategically important site where the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden meet . DP World, which owns a third of the Doraleh Container Terminal, is fighting the seizure, but some now expect Djibouti’s government, which owns the rest of the site, to strike a deal with Chinese investors. China interests already have a foothold in the region: China Merchant Holding Co. backed a $600 million Djibouti marine terminal that opened last year. The tussle reflects the rising importance of the Horn of Africa, which sits along busy seaborne trade lanes and has gained greater significance as major powers seek strategic outposts in the region.\nWool is the new hot commodity in apparel and supply chains are struggling to catch up. A trend that kicked off when wool sneakers from startup Allbirds Inc. became popular in Silicon Valley is spreading, and big brands like Adidas and Under Armour are jumping on board, raising global demand for merino wool, the fine product named for a breed of sheep. The demand is also driving up prices for the fiber, the WSJ’s Lucy Craymer reports, while providing a lesson in how sourcing operations built around agriculture and natural materials can’t easily turn supplies up and down to follow annual trends. The sheep population in Australia and New Zealand, the world’s largest wool exporters, is near a 100-year low after farmers shifted to dairy or higher-yielding crops after prices of wool collapsed in the 1990s. One apparel maker says it may take seven years of breeding to get sheep producing even on farms that already produce the fine merino wool.\nECONOMY & TRADE The Port of Djibouti. Photo: Bloomberg News American mining companies are getting the lift they’ve long been waiting for, but it’s not coming from new U.S. demand. American companies are shipping far more coal to Europe and Asia, bulking up international supply lines and helping stop a yearslong decline in the number of U.S. mining jobs. Exports of U.S. thermal coal used by utilities more than doubled last year to 42 million tons, the WSJ’s Kris Maher reports, more than offsetting a steep drop in coal used at U.S. power plants as U.S. energy business moves toward natural gas. The export opportunities come from a tightening of global supply, attractive pricing in Western Europe and greater coal use in developing countries like India. The U.S. Midwest looks to be benefitting the most as miners push volumes by river barge to export sites on the Gulf of Mexico, while ports on the East Coast are often congested and groups block coal export upgrades on the West Coast.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We are in the difficult place in the pipeline, because the growers have increased the price because the market has increased demand. But our buyers do not want us to increase the price. ’\n—Ercole Botto, chief executive of Italian textile manufacturer Reda, on wool markets.\nNumber of the Day 16% Year-over-year decline in average container shipping price from Shanghai to Los Angeles last week, according to Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.\nIN OTHER NEWS International trade flows rose 4.5% in 2017 , the fastest pace since 2011.
