    "text": "February 26, 2018 / 9:04 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago Russia vetoes Western effort to call out Iran over Yemen at U.N Reuters Staff 1 Min Read UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia on Monday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have called out Iran for failing to prevent its weapons from falling into the hands of Yemenâ€™s Houthi group. However, the 15-member Council unanimously adopted a rival, Russian-proposed resolution that did not mention Iran and that extended a targeted sanctions regime related to the civil war in Yemen.
