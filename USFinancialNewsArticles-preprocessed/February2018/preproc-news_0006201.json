It is not easy to keep up this kind of performance because we are going to play every three or four days,” the Argentine told reporters. \n“We need to rest before we play against Liverpool - a very good team, in my opinion one of the best in England.” \nMourinho was left fuming at the mistakes which led to Eriksen’s early goal. \n“(Conceding) after kickoff it is ridiculous. It is especially ridiculous because the players watched this before when we analysed the opponents,” the Portuguese said. \n“Four mistakes after 15 seconds and then you are losing 1-0 against a good team.” \nThe win put Tottenham, in fifth, two points behind Liverpool and Chelsea as second-placed United slipped 15 points behind leaders Manchester City.
