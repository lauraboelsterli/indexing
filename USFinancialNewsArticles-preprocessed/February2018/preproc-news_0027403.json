    "text": "February 10, 2018 / 6:38 PM / Updated 21 minutes ago North Korea says unable to pay U.N. dues, blames sanctions Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea is unable to pay its share of the 2018 U.N. budgets because of international sanctions on its foreign exchange bank and has asked a senior U.N. official for help, the country’s U.N. mission said in a statement. \nNorth Korea’s U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam met with U.N. management chief Jan Beagle on Friday to ask the world body to help secure a bank transaction channel so Pyongyang could pay the nearly $184,000 it says it owes for 2018. \nU.N. member states are required to pay assessed contributions to the world body’s regular and peacekeeping budgets, as well as a budget for international tribunals. \nU.S. and U.N. sanctions on the Foreign Trade Bank, North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank, were preventing the country ”from honouring its obligation as a U.N. member state by hindering even normal activities such as payment of the U.N. contribution,” the North Korean mission said in a statement late on Friday. \n”It also shows how cruel and uncivilized the sanctions are,” it said. \nIf it is unable to make payment “it is crystal clear” the blame lies with the United States and “its followers,” the statement said. \nThe United States sanctioned the Foreign Trade Bank in 2013, while the U.N. Security Council blacklisted the bank last August. \nThe 15-member U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that Washington would soon announce tough new economic sanctions on North Korea. \nAccording to the U.N. Charter, countries in arrears in an amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for two preceding years can lose their vote in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. The General Assembly can grant an exception if a country can show that conditions beyond its control contributed to the inability to pay. \nThe U.N. website said that as of Jan. 28 there 12 countries in arrears of more than two years. Apart from its 2018 dues, North Korea said it is up to date with its payments. Writing by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Bill Trott",
