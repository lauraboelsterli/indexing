    "text": "LOGISTICAL QUESTIONS \nHow will you blend your finances? \n\"Once you're engaged, there are more logistical questions to tackle,\" Holeman tells CNBC Make It. \"Do you want to have a joint bank account , or do you want to keep them separate? How are we going to save for each other's goals if our incomes are different? How do we actually reach those goals?\" \nIn terms of merging bank accounts, if you both work and have similar incomes, Holeman says the need for having a joint account isn't as high: \"You're probably both used to managing your finances separately and you each have money flowing in and out of your account. Plus, technology has made it a lot easier to maintain separate accounts, but still work together as a team — apps like Venmo and tools like Mint.com allow you to aggregate your accounts and see everything.\" \nA joint account makes more sense when only one spouse works, Holeman says, since there isn't a steady flow of money into the other's checking account. \nOther questions you'll want to discuss when it comes to merging your finances include: How much do we want to spend on the wedding? Can we afford a home ? If so, how much home can we afford? \nFinally, you'll want to cover your assets and liabilities: What savings accounts, such as a 401(k) or Roth IRA, are in your name? Do you have any debt ? How much and how are you going to attack it? show chapters 11:41 AM ET Mon, 13 Feb 2017 | 00:55 \nHow will you spend and save? \nFiguring out how much you want to set aside each month will help you achieve your big picture financial goals. However, Holeman doesn't recommend creating a highly-detailed budget with your partner: \"Often, couples will sit down and try to work out a budget, and they'll start to argue about each little piece of the budget, like clothes or food or vacations. Different people have difference preferences.\" \nAs a solution, he endorses backwards budgeting : Set your goals, make sure that you're saving enough to reach them, and don't worry about the day-to-day expenses. \"As long as you know how much you need to be saving and you're saving enough each month, who really cares where the rest of the money goes?\" says Holeman. \nHe also recommends using goals-based rewards: \"Break your savings up into smaller chunks — specific goals, like an emergency fund. Set a target number and then figure how much you need to set aside each month to reach that target. Once you hit your goal, take the next month and instead of saving that certain amount of money, do something fun with it. It keeps you motivated, it's a good way to work together as a team, and it keeps it fresh.\" ",
