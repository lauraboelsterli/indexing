    "text": "February 3, 2018 / 3:01 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Man City held at Burnley after late Gudmundsson equaliser Simon Evans 3 Min Read \nBURNLEY, England (Reuters) - Premier League leaders Manchester City paid the price for missed chances as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Burnley on Saturday with Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s 82nd minute equaliser earning the hosts a share of the points. \nCity had dominated possession throughout most of the game, which they strolled through for large spells, but after taking the lead with a beautiful strike from Brazilian Danilo in the 22nd minute, they failed to press home their advantage. \nRaheem Sterling produced one of the misses of the season – somehow putting the ball wide just one metre out from the empty goal and Burnley made the most of that let-off. \nCity extended their lead to 16 points over second-placed rivals Manchester United, who were hosting Huddesfield Town later on Saturday. City now have 69 points from 26 games. \nCity manager Pep Guardiola, without the injured David Silva, Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus, named only six substitutes including club record signing Aymeric Laporte, signed for a club record 57 million pounds last week. \nIn an attacking line-up, Burnley boss Sean Dyche gave winger Aaron Lennon his first start since joining from Everton. \nCity went ahead when a short corner was worked to Danilo and, enjoying plenty of space, the Brazilian unleashed an unstoppable drive from outside the area.
