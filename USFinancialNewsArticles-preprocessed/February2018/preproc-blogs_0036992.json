I detested it the moment it was raised,\" Munger said Wednesday at the annual meeting for Daily Journal Corp. in Los Angeles. \"It's just disgusting. Bitcoin is noxious poison.\"\nMunger said the government of China, which is \"stepping on it\" pretty hard, is right, and the U.S. government, which is more lax on Bitcoin, is wrong.\n",
