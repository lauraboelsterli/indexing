    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp is anticipating demand for an additional 400 F-16 fighter jets globally over the next decade, a senior executive at the U.S. defense contractor said on Wednesday.\nRandall Howard, who leads F-16 business development at Lockheed Martin, made the comments on the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow.\n“As I look today across Central Europe, across the Mediterranean, across the Middle East, across South America, across Southeast Asia…If you add all of these countries up and India as well, I can see an additional 400 plus aircraft in the next six, eight to 10 years,” he said.\n“I’ve not said this before, I’ve said 200 over five-seven (years) but what I’ve seen in the last three years, there’s been a tremendous uptick in interest in the F-16.”\nReporting by Brenda GohEditing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ",
