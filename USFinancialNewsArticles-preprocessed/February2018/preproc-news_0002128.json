    "text": "FRANKFURT, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Daimler has spent a low triple-digit million euro amount to prepare a new corporate structure under which three business entities will get their own management responsibility, its finance chief said.\nThe truck and car maker is conducting due diligence to evaluate the economic, tax-related and organisational effects of the planned new structure, Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber told journalists at Daimlerâ€™s annual news conference on Thursday.\nUnder the new structure, Mercedes-Benz cars and vans will operate separately from Mercedes-Benz trucks and buses and Daimler Financial Services, he said.\nDaimler has no plans to divest a major business, Uebber said.
