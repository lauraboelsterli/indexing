    "text": "February 2, 2018 / 6:39 PM / in 23 minutes Italy's ruling PD promises help for families in election manifesto Alessandro Bianchi 4 Min Read \nBOLOGNA, Italy (Reuters) - Italy’s ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD), trailing in opinion polls ahead of a March 4 ballot, said on Friday it would help families, boost pensions and introduce a minimum wage if it won re-election. \nFormer prime minister Matteo Renzi accused his rivals of making unrealistic promises as he unveiled the PD’s 100-point election manifesto, which was strongly pro-Europe and included pledges to cut Italy’s debt mountain and boost growth. \n“We propose 100 small steps forward for Italy, 100 small, concrete measures, achievable goals,” Renzi said in the northern city of Bologna in a hall packed with party bigwigs. \nOpinion polls predict that a center-right alliance that includes Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party will win next month’s vote, with a combined score of around 37 percent -- not enough to control parliament. \nThe anti-establishment 5-Star Movement looks set to emerge as the largest single party, on around 28 percent. The PD is seen on around 23 percent, paying the price for internal schisms and the slow pace of economic recovery. \nThe center-right is promising to introduce a flat-tax of just 23 percent for individuals and companies if it wins, while the 5-Star says it will introduce a “universal wage” of up to 780 euros ($973) a month to alleviate growing poverty. \nRenzi said such measures were unsustainable. “It seems that the political debate is not focused on real issues. We, instead, have put pragmatism at center stage,” he said. PRO-EUROPEAN \nAmongst the PD’s flagship proposals was a pledge to give families 400 euros a month per infant for three years to help with childcare costs and allow tax deductions of 240 euros per child until they turned 18.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi \nIt also vowed to cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from 24 percent and drop social security contributions on wages to 29 percent from 33 percent. A minimum wage would be introduced, it said, without giving details. \nThe PD additionally promised to set the minimum pension at 750 euros after at least 20 years of contributions, from around 500 euros at present. Forza Italia is promising to hike the minimum pension to 1,000 euros. \nThe PD did not say how it would pay for its various proposals, but said it expected economic output would rise to 2 percent a year against some 1.5 percent at present, suggesting it was betting on an increase in overall tax revenues.
