    "text": "Ron Hainsey scored the winner with 1:24 left in the game and the Toronto Maple Leafs extended their home win streak to nine games with a 4-3 victory over the Boston Bruins at the Air Canada Centre on Saturday night.\nToronto has also won 14 of its past 17 games and is surging as the playoffs near. Nazem Kadri had two power-play goals and Mitch Marner also scored for the Maple Leafs, who outshot the Bruins 36-23.\nThe Maple Leafs scored twice on three power-play opportunities and dictated the tempo for much of the game.\nBrad Marchand had two goals for the Bruins, who are 2-2-0 during a five-game road trip. They are 17-3-2 in their past 21 games on the road. Boston has gone 0-for-12 on the power play during this road trip. The Bruins play at Buffalo on Sunday before returning home.\nDefenseman Nick Holden, who was obtained in a trade with the New York Rangers on Tuesday, was a scratch but could see action in the next game.\nMarchand and Marner traded goals just over a minute apart early in the first period. The Maple Leafs took a 2-1 lead when Kadri scored on a power play with 9:30 left. Marchand continued to outclass Torontoâ€™s defense and tied the game with 4:58 remaining.\nThe Bruins took the lead 3-2 on a goal by Jake DeBrusk just 1:55 into the second period. Kadri answered for the Maple Leafs with his second goal and tied the game 3-3 with less than a minute remaining in the second.\nToronto center Auston Matthews, who leads the team with 28 goals and 50 points, was scratched and is listed as day-to-day with a shoulder injury. Matthews went to the bench late in the 4-3 shootout win over the New York Islanders on Thursday night. Matthews missed 10 previous games this season with a back injury and a concussion.\nThe Maple Leafs are 7-4 without him in the lineup.\nToronto won for the third time in four meetings with the Bruins this season.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
