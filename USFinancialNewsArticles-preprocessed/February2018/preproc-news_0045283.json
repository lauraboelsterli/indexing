The indictment against Alex Van der Zwaan also accuses him of deleting or otherwise not producing emails sought by the Special Counsel’s office, which is investigating possible ties between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. Both Gates and Manafort, who worked on Trump’s presidential campaign, have been charged in the probe. Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Jonathan Landay",
