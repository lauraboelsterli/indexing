    "text": "GREAT NECK, N.Y., Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BRT Apartments Corp. (NYSE:BRT) today announced the completion of the sale of The Fountains Apartments, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and the redeployment of a portion of the sales proceeds into the purchase of The Avenue Apartments, a 522-unit value-add property located in Ocoee, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. The company anticipates the investment of the remainder of the sales proceeds by the end of February.\nJeffrey A. Gould, Chief Executive Officer of BRT Apartments commented, “We are pleased with our recent transaction activity as it demonstrates our ability to recycle capital efficiently into our target markets. These transactions were facilitated by leveraging our existing relationships and engaging with partners with whom BRT has a proven track record.\" \"The Avenue Apartments is an excellent addition to our portfolio: the property is located in a metro area that features diverse economic drivers and strong job and population growth; core characteristics BRT looks for when making new investments,” concluded Mr. Gould.\nOn February 5, 2018, the company sold The Fountains Apartments, a 542-unit property located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, for $97.2 million and a gain of approximately $41.8 million. BRT’s share of this gain, after giving effect to non-controlling interests of approximately $20.5 million, will be approximately $ 21.3 million.\nOn February 7, 2018, the Company acquired, through a joint venture in which it has a 50% equity interest, The Avenue Apartments, a 522-unit multi-family property located in Ocoee, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, for $71.3 million, including $53.1 million of mortgage debt obtained in connection with the acquisition. The mortgage debt matures in 2028, carries an interest rate of 3.90%, is interest only for seven years, and thereafter amortizes over 30 years. BRT contributed $12.4 million of equity from the sales proceeds of the Fountains towards this acquisition.\nThe Avenue Apartments, a value-add opportunity, is ten minutes from downtown Orlando and is proximate to a number of major retailers as well as prominent employers including Disney, Universal Studios and the Florida Hospital. The Orlando MSA has a growing population, an expanding presence in the telecommunications, bio-tech and life science industries, and is among the top ten highest projected job growth areas in the U.S. over the next three years. This dynamic employment environment coupled with BRT’s planned unit upgrades will allow the company to position the property for enhanced revenue growth. Contemplated improvements include upgraded exteriors, kitchens, baths and flooring.\nForward Looking Statements:\nCertain information contained herein is forward looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
