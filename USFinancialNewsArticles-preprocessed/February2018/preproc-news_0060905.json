    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - A resolution accepted unanimously by the U.N. Security Council for a 30-day ceasefire across Syria will not impact Turkeyâ€™s offensive against Kurdish fighters in Afrin, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Sunday.\nThe U.N. resolution on Saturday followed seven straight days of bombing by pro-government forces of the rebel enclave of eastern Ghouta, in one of the bloodiest offensives of the war. Turkey earlier welcomed the resolution.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
