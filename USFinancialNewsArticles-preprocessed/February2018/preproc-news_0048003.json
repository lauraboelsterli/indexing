(BMV:ELEKTRA)* (Latibex:XEKT), Latin America’s leading specialty retailer and financial services company and the largest non-bank provider of cash advance services in the United States, reported today financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017.\nConsolidated fourth quarter results\nConsolidated revenue was Ps.27,087 million in the period, 15% above the Ps.23,508 million for the same quarter of previous year. Costs and operating expenses were Ps.22,803 million, compared to Ps.19,620 million for the same period of 2016.\nAs a result, Grupo Elektra reported EBITDA of Ps.4,284 million, 10% higher than the Ps.3,887 million of the previous year’s quarter; EBITDA margin was 16% this period.\nOperating profit grew 15% to Ps.3,677 million during the quarter, from Ps.3,207 million in same period of 2016.\nThe company reported net income of Ps.902 million, compared to net income of Ps.2,924 million a year ago.\n4Q 2016 4Q 2017 Change Ps. % Consolidated revenue $23,508 $ 27,087 $ 3,580 15 % EBITDA $3,887 $ 4,284 $ 397 10 % Operating profit $3,207\n$3,677\n$471\n15%\nNet result $2,924 $902 $(2,022) -69% Net result per share $12.53 $ 3.90 $ (8.63 ) -69 % Figures in millions of pesos\nEBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Elektra* outstanding shares were 233.3 million and as of December 31, 2017, were 231.3 million.\nRevenue\nConsolidated revenue increased 15%, as a result of 17% and 13% growth in both financial revenues and commercial sales, respectively.\nThe increase in commercial division sales ̶ to Ps.11,119 million compared to Ps.9,801 million last year ̶ reflects strategies that focus on generating optimum value propositions for the customers, through lines of merchandise that best meet their needs, with world-class service and under the most competitive market conditions.\nIn the lasts quarters, these strategies have an additional boost with the launch of a new, larger store format, which includes a greater selection of goods and services to satisfy a growing number of families. In October, Grupo Elektra also launched its omnichannel strategy, with its online store www.elektra.com.mx , through which hundreds of thousands of products are sold, at unparalleled prices, from any device and at all times, and further strengthens the company's business operations.\nThe increase in financial revenue ̶ to Ps.15,968 million from Ps.13,706 million from the previous year ̶ reflects mainly a 21% growth in revenue of Banco Azteca Mexico.\nCosts and expenses\nConsolidated costs for the quarter increased 28% to Ps.11,965 million, from Ps.9,320 million in the previous year, as a result of a 17% increase in commercial costs, in line with the increase in commercial revenue, and 56% growth in financial cost. The increase in the financial cost results from the creation of loan-loss provisions and higher interest payments, in line with higher market interest rates, as well as increased deposits at Banco Azteca.\nSales, administration and promotion expenses increased 5% to Ps.10,838 million, as a result of higher operation and maintenance costs. Expenses grew slower than consolidated revenue, reflecting strong strategies that drive the company's operating efficiency.\nEBITDA and net result\nEBITDA grew 10% to Ps.4,284 million this quarter. Operating income increased 15% to Ps.3,677 million, from Ps.3,207 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nThe most significant variations below EBITDA were the following:\nA growth of Ps.427 million in foreign exchange gains, mainly due to a higher net asset position in dollars, compared to the previous year —resulting from the prepayment of US$230 million of dollar-denominated bonds in the period.\nA negative variation of Ps.2,852 million in other financial results —which reflects a 15% reduction this quarter in the market value of the underlying assets of financial instruments held by the company, and that does not imply cash flow— in comparison with a 5% increase a year ago. Congruent with this, the negative variation in this item was partially offset by a decrease in the provision of taxes.\nAn increase of Ps.485 million in loss from the result of subsidiaries, derived from the recognition of the company's participation in CASA.\nAn increase of Ps.896 million in the impairment account of intangible assets due to the obsolescence recognition of certain system developments at Advance America this year, compared to income due to partial reversal of the deterioration of brands and licenses registered the previous year.\nGrupo Elektra reported net income of Ps.902 million, compared to net income of Ps.2,924 million a year ago.\nUnconsolidated balance sheet\nA proforma exercise of the balance sheet of Grupo Elektra is presented, which allows visualizing the non-consolidated financial situation, excluding the net assets of the financial business, whose investment is valued in this case under the equity method.\nThis presentation shows the debt of the company —without considering the immediate and term deposits of Banco Azteca, which do not constitute debt with cost for Grupo Elektra.\nThis provides greater clarity about the situation of the different businesses that make up the company, and will allow participants in the financial markets to make estimates of the value of the company, considering only the relevant debt for such calculations.\nCongruent with that, debt with cost was Ps.13,464 million at the end of 2017, 18% below the Ps.16,410 million of the previous year. The balance of cash and cash equivalents was Ps.15,574 million; as a result, the net cash balance excluding the amount of debt with cost at the end of 2017 was favorable at Ps.2,110 million.\nAs previously announced, in the period, senior notes for US$230 million due in 2018 were prepaid; through such amortization, the company eliminated dollar-denominated bonds. The transaction reflects the firm strategy of Grupo Elektra to further strengthen its solid capital structure.\nThe company's equity increased 19% to Ps.70,217 million, while the total liabilities decreased 4% to Ps.37,452 million. The ratio of stockholders' equity to total liabilities is 1.9 times.\nAs of Dec.\nAs of Dec.

Consolidated delinquency rate was 4.7% at the end of the period, compared to 3.4% in the previous year.\nThe gross portfolio of Banco Azteca Mexico grew 13% to Ps.76,740 million, from Ps.67,743 million a year ago.\nThe delinquency rate for the bank at the end of the quarter was 4.2%, from 2.6% for the previous year. Past-due loan portfolio is reserved 2.2 times, which reflects a past-due portfolio of Ps.3,238 million, in comparison to allowance for credit risks of Ps.7,230 million in balance, as of December 31, 2017.\nThe average term of the credit portfolio for principal credit lines – consumer, personal loans and Tarjeta Azteca – was 63 weeks at the end of the fourth quarter.\nGrupo Elektra consolidated deposits were Ps.109,373 million, 4% higher than the Ps.105,124 million a year ago. Deposits of Banco Azteca Mexico were Ps.108,654 million, 7% higher than the Ps.101,718 million a year ago.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the estimated capitalization index of Banco Azteca Mexico was 16.7%.\nInfrastructure\nGrupo Elektra currently has 7,139 points of contact, compared to 7,396 units a year ago. The reduction is a result of strategies to focus on maximizing profitability of such units.\nThese strategies involve replacing contact points with the most profitable formats. During the year, this resulted in 56 new Elektra stores at strategic points across Mexico, with greater exhibition area, which increase the offer of products and services, and thereby maximize customer shopping experiences.\nThe company has 4,440 points of contact in Mexico, 2,048 in the United States, and 651 in Central and South America. The extensive distribution network allows the company to maintain close contact with clients, granting superior market positioning in the countries where it operates.\nTwelve month results\nTotal consolidated revenue in 2017 grew 17% to Ps.94,979 million, from Ps.81,242 million for 2016, boosted by 18% and 15% growth in both financial and commercial businesses, respectively.\nEBITDA was Ps.16,754 million, 20% higher than the Ps.13,988 million for the same period a year ago; the EBITDA margin for 2017 was 18%, one percentage point above the prior year. Operating profit grew 26% to Ps.14,437 million during the period.\nThe company reported net income of Ps.15,228 million, compared to Ps.5,334 million a year ago, mainly due an appreciation this period in the market value of underlying financial instruments that the company holds, which doesn’t imply cash flow, compared to depreciation the prior year.\n2016 2017 Change Ps. % Consolidated revenue $81,242 $ 94,979 $ 13,738 17 % EBITDA $13,988 $ 16,754 $ 2,766 20 % Operating profit $11,422 $14,437 $3,015 26% Net result $5,334 $15,398 $10,064 ---- Net result per share $22.86 $ 66.57 $ 43.71 ---- Figures in millions of pesos\nEBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.\nAs of December 31, 2016, Elektra* outstanding shares were 233.3 million and as of December 31, 2017, were 231.3 million.\nCompany Profile:\nGrupo Elektra is Latin America’s leading financial services company and specialty retailer and the largest non-bank provider of cash advance services in the United States.
