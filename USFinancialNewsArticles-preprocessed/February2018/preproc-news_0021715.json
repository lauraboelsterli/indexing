These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio, but do not include the effect of the Company’s funding cost hedges. Effective duration Quote: s for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc.\nFinancing, Leverage and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding repurchase obligations of approximately $3,533.8 million with a net weighted average borrowing rate of 1.54%. These agreements were collateralized by RMBS with a fair value, including accrued interest, of approximately $3,726.5 million and cash pledged to counterparties of approximately $25.3 million. The Company’s leverage ratio at December 31, 2017 was 7.7 to 1. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity was approximately $246.6 million, consisting of unpledged RMBS and cash and cash equivalents. To enhance our liquidity even further, we may pledge more of our structured RMBS as part of a repurchase agreement funding, but retain the cash in lieu of acquiring additional assets. In this way we can, at a modest cost, retain higher levels of cash on hand and decrease the likelihood we will have to sell assets in a distressed market in order to raise cash. Below is a list of our outstanding borrowings under repurchase obligations at December 31, 2017.\n($ in thousands) Weighted Weighted Total Average Average Outstanding % of Borrowing Amount Maturity Counterparty Balances Total Rate at Risk (1) in Days J.P.

The Company has not elected hedging treatment under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in order to align the accounting treatment of its derivative instruments with the treatment of its portfolio assets under the fair value option election. As such, all gains or losses on these instruments are reflected in earnings for all periods presented. At December 31, 2017, such instruments were comprised of Eurodollar and Treasury note (“T-Note”) futures contracts and interest rate swap agreements.\nThe table below presents information related to the Company’s Eurodollar and T-Note futures contracts at December 31, 2017.\n($ in thousands) Average Weighted Weighted Contract Average Average Notional Entry Effective Open Expiration Year Amount Rate Rate Equity (1) Eurodollar Futures Contracts (Short Positions) 2018 $ 1,212,500 1.86% 1.98% $ 1,418 2019 1,350,000 2.11% 2.27% 2,152 2020 987,500 2.59% 2.36% (2,360 ) Total / Weighted Average $ 1,183,333 2.16% 2.20% $ 1,210 Treasury Note Futures Contracts (Short Positions) (2) March 2018 10-year T-Note futures (Mar 2018 - March 2028 Hedge Period) $ 140,000 2.23% 2.33% $ 755 (1) Open equity represents the cumulative gains (losses) recorded on open futures positions from inception.\n(2) T-Note futures contracts were valued at a price of $124.05 at December 31, 2017.

At December 31, 2017, the Company's stockholders' equity was $462.2 million with 53,061,904 shares of common stock outstanding.\nStock Offerings\nOn August 2, 2017, we entered into another equity distribution agreement (the “August 2017 Equity Distribution Agreement”) with two sales agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $125,000,000 of shares of our common stock in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings and privately negotiated transactions. Through December 31, 2017, we issued a total of 7,746,052 shares under the August 2017 Equity Distribution Agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of $76.0 million, and net proceeds of approximately $74.7 million, net of commissions and fees.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn July 29, 2015, the Board of Directors passed a resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. As part of the stock repurchase program, shares may be purchased in open market transactions, including through block purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Open market repurchases will be made in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 10b-18, which sets certain restrictions on the method, timing, price and volume of open market stock repurchases. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company in its discretion and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at the Company’s discretion without prior notice. Through December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 1,216,243 shares under the stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $10.8 million, including commissions and fees, for a weighted average price of $8.92 per share. On February 8, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase program for up to an additional 4,522,822 shares of the Company’s common stock, which results in a total authorization under the repurchase program for up to 5,306,579 shares, or approximately 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock. This repurchase program has no termination date. There were no shares purchased under this program during 2017.\nManagement Commentary\nCommenting on the fourth quarter, Robert E. Cauley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The fourth quarter of 2017 marked a reversal of the trend in place for the first nine months of the year. The shifts that occurred were numerous. Perhaps the most significant from a long-term perspective was the surprise success the Trump administration had in passing a substantive tax package – The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”). The significance of the Act was two-fold. On the one hand, its passage ended the Trump administration’s string of legislative failures, and on the other, we believe the legislation should be stimulative for the economy – at least for the first five years after passage and before certain provisions are reduced or eliminated. The effect of the passage of the Act was reinforced by strong economic data that bolstered the “risk on” sentiment in the markets. The equity markets continued to set new record high closes almost daily, while other risk assets, such as commodities and investment grade and sub-investment grade debt, continued to perform very well.\n“A second significant event that impacted the markets during the fourth quarter actually occurred late in the third quarter. Following the September 2017 meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”), chair Yellen stated the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”) viewed recent soft inflation data as owing to transitory factors and that they remained confident that inflation would trend towards their 2% target level over the medium term. This acknowledgement by the Fed that they would look past soft inflation data in the near term, and continue to remove accommodation, forced the market to reprice expectations for additional interest rate hikes. Just prior to the September 2017 meeting, the market was pricing in an approximately 50% chance of one hike by the Fed over the next 12 months. In contrast, the Fed’s most recent “dot plot” implies three interest rate hikes in 2018. By January 2018, the market was pricing over 2.5 hikes in 2018, and the gap that existed in August and early September 2017 had essentially been closed. Further, the yield on the 10-year U.S. T-Note reached 2.406% by December 29, 2017, and surpassed 2.8% in early February 2018. These are significant movements from August 2017 when the 10-year U.S. T-Note was threatening to break below 2%. Combined, these two events drove the yield curve flatter, with the January 29, 2018 yield spread between the 5-year U.S. T-Note and 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond at the lowest level since late 2007.\n“The mortgage market was impacted by these events in a positive way. The strong “risk on” tone of the markets continued to drive spreads available in the various investment grade and sub-investment grade markets tighter. By comparison, Agency RMBS spreads appeared relatively attractive and continued to tighten over the course of the fourth quarter. In early January 2018, the spread of the 30-year, fixed rate conventional mortgage to the 10-year U.S. T-Note hit its tightest level since early 2013. This spread has since widened as longer-term rates continue to inch higher, as extension fears entered the market. Extension refers to the phenomenon by which the weighted average life of a mortgage cash flow extends as prepayment activity slows due to higher prevailing mortgage rates available to borrowers. Going forward, the balance between the volume of mortgage supply – generally a function of the level of available mortgage rates and prepayment levels - and the effect of reduced purchases by the Fed will be critical for Agency RMBS performance.\n“The flattening of the yield curve impacted the performance of the portfolio negatively as higher coupon mortgages, in our case 30-year, fixed rate 4% and 4.5% coupon securities, materially underperformed both lower coupon fixed rate securities and their hedges. The portfolio was positioned defensively throughout 2017, with a high coupon, fixed rate bias. Our greatest exposure during 2017 was an acceleration in prepayment activity brought about by a significant rally in interest rates. To some extent this occurred particularly during the third quarter, but otherwise interest rate levels at the end of 2017 were around where they started back in January 2017. In spite of our defensive positioning of the portfolio for 2017, we generated an economic return of approximately 2.9%, consisting of $1.68 of dividends offset, by $1.39 in book value decline.\n“With the changes to the level of rates, the slope of the yield curve, the outlook for the economy and Fed activity all changing materially in the fourth quarter and into 2018, we have and expect to continue to reposition both the portfolio and our hedge positions. During the fourth quarter of 2017 we repositioned our hedges as the curve flattened, initiating the process just as the 10-year U.S. Treasury threatened to break below 2.0%. With the prospect that robust economic activity and persistent rate increases by the Fed may continue for some time, we expect to position our portfolio and hedges defensively. This applies to the extent of leverage we will employ as well.”\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nAn earnings conference call and live audio webcast will be hosted Friday, February 9, 2018, at 10:00 AM ET.
