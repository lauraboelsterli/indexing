A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measure is presented in the financial tables below under the heading, \"GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\"\nServiceSource believes non-GAAP financial information provided in this release can assist investors in understanding and assessing its on-going core operations and prospects for the future and provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing ServiceSource's financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP gross profit consists of gross profit plus adjustments to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and amortization of internally-developed software.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) consists of net income (loss) plus stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets, amortization of internally-developed software, restructuring and other related costs, litigation reserve, gain on sale of cost basis equity investment, impairment loss on cost basis equity investment, non-cash interest expense and applying an income tax rate of 40% on non-GAAP adjustments as well as the impact of normalizing the effective income tax rate. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to vary depending on the number of new grants issued, changes in the Company's stock price, stock market volatility, expected option lives and risk-free interest rates, all of which are difficult to estimate.\nEBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense and other income/(expense), and income tax benefit (expense). Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA plus non-cash stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other related costs, litigation reserve, gain on sale of cost basis equity investment and impairment loss on cost basis equity investment. ServiceSource uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance because it assists the Company in comparing performance on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of the Company's capital structure from operating results.\nThese non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nServiceSource International, Inc.

Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of revenue and operating expenses, stock-based compensation consists of expenses for stock options, awards and purchase rights under our stock purchase plan. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures because some investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance as it is a non-cash expense.\n(B) Amortization of internally-developed software. Included in our GAAP presentation of cost of revenue and operating expenses, amortization of internally-developed software reflects non-cash expense for certain software purchases and software developed or obtained for internal use. We exclude these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because we believe they are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(C) Amortization of purchased intangibles. Included in our GAAP presentation of gross margin and operating expenses is amortization of purchased intangible assets. We believe amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names and customer relationships, are items arising from pre-acquisition activities and therefore are properly determined at the time of an acquisition. Although these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.\n(D) Restructuring and other. Included in our GAAP presentation, we incurred expenses related to our restructuring effort to better align our cost structure with current revenue levels. Restructuring and other expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards, employees' severance payments, related employee benefits, related legal fees, asset impairment charges and charges related to leases and other contract termination costs. These are one-time in nature costs that are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(E) Litigation reserve. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probably that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for contingencies. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company accrued a $1.5 million reserve relating to our potential liability for currently pending disputes. These reserves are non-recurring in nature charges that are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(F) Gain on sale of cost basis equity investment and Impairment loss on cost basis equity investment. In 2013 we made an equity investment in a private company for $4.5 million. Based on unfavorable growth trends and declining financial performance of this private company, the Company determined that its investment was fully impaired and recorded a $4.5 million impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold this investment for $2.1 million in cash and recorded the proceeds as a gain.\n(G) Non-cash interest expense. Under GAAP, we are required to separately account for liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the $150 million convertible senior notes that were issued in August 2013. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize effective interest expense on our convertible senior notes which includes interest cost related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and the contractual 1.5% interest rate of the note. The difference between the effective interest expense and the contractual interest expense is excluded from our assessment of our operating performance because we believe that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. We believe that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors a view of our core operating performance.\n(H) Income tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments as well as the impact of normalizing the effective income tax rate. This adjusts (i) the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP items A, B, C, D, E, F and G noted above on our non-GAAP net loss; (ii) the income tax rate to a normalized effective tax rate of 40%; and (iii) non-GAAP earnings per share based on a fully-diluted share count.\nServiceSource International, Inc.
