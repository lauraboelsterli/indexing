Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: kit.rees.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net ANGLO AMERICAN, DIA AMONG MOST-SHORTED STOCKS SET TO REPORT (1231 GMT) Talking of earnings, looking at an IHS Markit report of firms which have been shorted the most ahead of earnings a couple of names such as Anglo American, Vallourec, DIA and Ingenico stand out. IHS Markit's analysts say the short interest in Anglo American is due mainly to an arbitrage trade opportunity after Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal issued bonds to fund his 20 percent stake in Anglo American via his family trust Volcan Holdings. Here's IHS Markit's list of the most-shorted European stocks which are due to report this week: (Kit Rees) A Q4 EARNINGS SURPRISE: EUROPE LEAPFROGS THE U.S. (1048 GMT) European equities may be dipping today but earnings forecasts have seen another big upwards revision, bringing the fourth-quarter growth rate expected for the STOXX 600 to 16.9 percent, leapfrogging the 15 percent rise seen for the S&P 500. The forecasts from Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio are likely to keep investors upbeat about prospects for European equity markets, as they attempt to stabilise following a turbulent start of the month on jitters over volatility and rising global rates. And there is more: the number of European companies beating earnings expectations has also risen to 53.4 percent, remaining above the 50 percent \"beat\" of a typical quarter, but still lagging the 76 percent beat scored by the S&P 500. In this second snapshot you can see how Europe's tech sector has delivered an impressive 84 percent earnings beat rate, followed by the 70 percent beat for the energy sector. The laggards are telecoms and utilities with just 25 percent. (Danilo Masoni) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPE DIPS (0841 GMT) As indicated by stocks futures, European shares have opened lower, with falls among more defensive-type stocks, and rising U.S. bond yields are weighing on sentiment. A well-received earnings update for Lloyds -- which included a share buyback of up to 1 billion pounds -- is helping to prop up banking stocks. Telecoms are the one sector seeing meaningful gains and Orange revealed some much needed good news on top-line growth. Shares in AA have plunged more than 28 percent after the company cut its dividend and said \"While the dividend cut to 2p frees up some cash, risk reward is too negatively skewed on 'show me later' profits,\" Jefferies analysts said about AA's strategy update. We've got the flash PMI for the Euro zone coming up at 0900 GMT so we'll be watching that along with UK employment data due 0930 GMT. Here's your market snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT WE'RE WATCHING AHEAD OF THE OPEN (0752 GMT) European shares are set for a slight pullback this morning with stocks futures trading around 0.2 percent lower, though judging by this week’s trading so far, we could well see a push higher later in the session. Earnings dominate the agenda again. While figures from bank Lloyds missed estimates, investors could cheer its 1 billion-pound share buyback, with the shares seen rising as much as 3 percent. Better times for Orange, which reported its first sales growth in France since 2009, could buoy the telecom sector. AA shares are expected to tumble after the roadside recovery firm said it planned to pay lower dividends. (Kit Rees) EUROPEAN HEADLINES: MORNING ROUND-UP (0738 GMT) Lloyds bank profit rises to record $7.4 billion, but misses estimates Orange's annual sales in France grow for first time since 2009 Glencore says full-year results 'best ever' Temenos agrees 1.4 bln pounds deal to buy British software house Fidessa France's Atos reports organic growth in-line with expectations Maersk Energy sees uptick in offshore oil drilling, profit still squeezed OMV's operating profit benefits from higher crude prices Telefonica Deutschland sees steady 2018, plans dividend increases Volkswagen, German union IG Metall reach wage agreement AA to pay lower dividends AccorHotels' increase in 2017 profits beats expectations Deutsche Boerse posts rise in net profit despite weak markets Eramet eyes expansion in electric vehicle metals UK's Metro Bank reports first annual profit MTU Aero eyes further profit rise in 2018, subject to A320neo FirstGroup sees earnings \"slightly\" lower hit by weather, competition BRIEF-Wolters Kluwer FY adjusted net profit beats Reuters poll BRIEF-UK builder Barratt's half-year pre-tax profit rises 6.8 percent BRIEF-Hotel Chocolat first half revenue and profit up 15 pct​ (Tom Pfeiffer) EUROPEAN STOCKS FUTURES OPEN LOWER (0711 GMT) European share futures have opened slightly lower, pointing to a weaker session in which metals and energy stocks are set to weigh. We could see a repeat of yesterday, when European stocks gradually warmed up from a weak start to end the session higher. Here's your futures snapshot: (Kit Rees)",
