    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - As temperatures plummeted in Paris, models took to a covered walkway under a lit-up Eiffel tower to show off some very short hemlines from Saint Laurentâ€™s collection for next autumn and winter.\nSpectators and models were shielded from the worst of the freezing weather at the Paris Fashion Week event on Tuesday.\nBut the styles, by house designer Anthony Vaccarello, featured plenty of bare legs, as mini black leather shorts were paired with sleek jackets and sheer tops for a chic, rock-and-roll look.\nSlideshow (12 Images) Thigh-grazing dresses in an array of flowery patterns, some with structured shoulders and billowing sleeves, closed the catwalk show. Elsewhere, shaggy coats and longer gowns made an appearance, including some with spectacular curved necklines.\nMen donned capes and leather jackets; others wore close-cut suits, in black or deep blue velvet, and echoed the sexy, party feel of the collection with sparkling jackets.\nThe French label - named after its founder Yves Saint Laurent and owned by luxury conglomerate Kering - unveiled its collection on the first full day of Paris Fashion Week, which runs until March 6.\nOther stalwarts of the French fashion calendar, including LVMH couture house Dior, are also showcasing their latest looks.
