    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. (Nasdaq:MPAA) today reported results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter and nine-months -- reflecting slower than expected sales due to unusually soft demand in the industry and customer inventory reduction programs, with more robust sales activity in the current fourth quarter.\nNet sales for the fiscal 2018 third quarter were $100.1 million compared with $112.6 million for the same period a year earlier. The company’s sales and profit performance for the prior fiscal third quarter reflects the benefits of recognizing a $9.3 million revenue pick-up due to a change in estimate for stock adjustment returns. Additional details are included in the attached financial tables. Despite market-share increases, the company’s sales for the quarter were soft due to lower orders and customer inventory reduction initiatives, as noted above, both of which now appear to be reversing.\nAll results labeled as “adjusted” in this press release are non-GAAP measures as discussed more fully below under the heading “ Use of Non-GAAP Measures .”\nAdjusted net sales for the fiscal 2018 third quarter were $103.4 million compared with $112.9 million a year earlier.\nNet loss for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $6.8 million, or $0.36 loss per share, compared with net income of $11.1 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, a year ago. The net loss includes a $6.3 million, or $0.33 per share, non-cash book tax charge and a separate transition tax charge of approximately $545,000, or $0.03 per share, payable over eight years, both of which relate to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”).\nAdjusted net income for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $6.7 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared with $11.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the same period a year earlier.\nGross profit for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $22.5 million compared with $32.4 million a year earlier. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was 22.5 percent compared with 28.7 percent a year earlier – primarily reflecting the impact of customer allowances related to new business, as well as higher returns as a percentage of sales, lower overhead absorption, and product mix.\nAdjusted gross profit for the fiscal 2018 third quarter was $28.8 million compared with $33.9 million a year ago. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of adjusted net sales for the three months was 27.9 percent compared with 30.1 percent a year earlier. The current quarter adjusted gross profit as a percentage of adjusted net sales was impacted by higher returns as a percentage of adjusted sales, lower overhead absorption, and product mix.\nNet sales for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period were $307.0 million compared with $306.8 million a year earlier. As noted above, the company’s sales and profit performance for the prior year period reflects the benefits of recognizing a $9.3 million revenue pick-up due to a change in estimate for stock adjustment returns.\nAdjusted net sales for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period were $312.7 million compared with $319.1 million last year.\nNet income for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $7.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with $27.8 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017. Net income includes a $6.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, non-cash book tax charge and a separate transition tax charge of approximately $545,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, payable over eight years, both of which relate to the recently enacted Tax Reform Act.\nAdjusted net income for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $24.7 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with $34.3 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017.\nGross profit for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $75.5 million compared with $83.4 million a year earlier. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was 24.6 percent compared with 27.2 percent a year earlier – reflecting the impact of customer allowances and return accruals related to new business, higher returns as a percentage of sales and lower overhead absorption.\nAdjusted gross profit for the fiscal 2018 nine-month period was $88.3 million compared with $98.7 million a year ago. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of adjusted net sales for the nine months was 28.2 percent compared with 30.9 percent a year earlier. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of adjusted net sales for the current nine-month period was impacted by higher returns as a percentage of adjusted sales and lower overhead absorption.\n“We were disappointed in our results for the quarter, especially since we continued to gain market share across all of our product lines. While we incurred additional expenses related to new business wins, we did not realize the full benefit of the associated revenues during the quarter. This was due to various factors, including reduced customer orders, which industry observers attribute to mild weather which seems to have reversed in our current fourth quarter. In addition, the business was impacted by customer inventory reduction initiatives. As a result, we were negatively impacted by under-absorption of overhead costs. We are now pleased to see a return to positive momentum in the marketplace. We expect the colder winter conditions across the majority of the country to further increase demand.\n“Ongoing positive strategic initiatives supported by organic growth, product line expansion and complementary acquisition opportunities lead me to reconfirm our near-and long-term optimism for growth within the $125 billion aftermarket hard parts industry,” said Selwyn Joffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Motorcar Parts of America.\nSeparately, he said the board of directors last week increased the company’s share repurchase program authorization to $20,000,000 from $15,000,000 of its common stock, with current availability of approximately $13 million.\nJoffe noted the company recently added a new 410,000 square-foot facility to support current and new growth.\nUPDATED FISCAL 2018 SALES GUIDANCE\nDue to the factors impacting the fiscal third quarter noted above, Motorcar Parts of America now believes revenues for its fiscal 2018 ending March 31 should be between $434 million and $440 million, with sales momentum improving in the current fiscal fourth quarter, as discussed above.\nIMPACT OF TAX REFORM ACT\nThe company has preliminarily evaluated its net income tax expense as a result of the recently enacted Tax Reform Act which reduces its federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, among other factors. The company estimates its effective tax rate commencing in fiscal 2019 will be reduced to approximately 25 percent.\nThe company’s deferred tax assets were provisionally reduced by a non-cash charge of approximately $6.3 million based on current estimates, as explained below. In addition, transition taxes of approximately $545,000 were provisionally recorded as of December 31, 2017, as explained below.\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense as changes in tax laws are enacted.\nTransition taxes are one-time expenses for deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign income.\nThe company’s fiscal 2018 third quarter results were impacted by $0.36 per diluted share as a result of the Tax Reform Act. A prorated federal corporate income tax rate of 31.5% will apply for the company’s full 2018 fiscal year. The full impact of the Tax Reform Act will be effective in the fiscal year commencing April 1, 2018.\nThese tax charges represent provisional amounts based on the company’s current best estimates. Any future adjustments recorded to the provisional amounts will be included as an adjustment to tax expense as they are identified. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the company’s current interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and may change as the company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance and completes its analysis.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis press release includes the following non-GAAP measures - adjusted net sales, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net sales, net income (loss), EBITDA, income from operations, gross profit or gross profit margin as a measure of financial performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provide useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, these non-GAAP measures have significant limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted net sales, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin to their corresponding GAAP measures, see the financial tables included in this press release. Also, refer to our Form 8-K to which this release is attached, and other filings we make with the SEC, for further information regarding these adjustments.\nTeleconference and Web Cast\nSelwyn Joffe, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and David Lee, chief financial officer, will host an investor conference call today at 6:00 a.m. Pacific time to discuss the company’s financial results and operations.\nThe call will be open to all interested investors either through a live audio Web broadcast at www.motorcarparts.com or live by calling (877)-776-4016 (domestic) or (973)-638-3231 (international).
