    "text": "Gothamist Gothamist on Friday celebrates its comeback. \nGothamist is being resuscitated nearly four months after it was abruptly shuttered by its owner, billionaire TD Ameritrade AMTD, +1.41% founder Joe Ricketts. \nThe assets of Gothamist, DCist and LAist were purchased by a group of three public radio stations in a joint deal, the organizations announced Friday. Two anonymous donors helped finance the purchase, though financial terms weren’t disclosed. \nDNAinfo, a network of hyperlocal news sites that had been part of the same company, isn’t being relaunched as part of the acquisition. \nIn stories and statements posted to their websites, public radio stations WNYC in New York, KPCC in Los Angeles, and WAMU in Washington, D.C., each pledged to revive Gothamist, LAist and DCist, respectively. The sites had covered culture, arts and other happenings in their communities for years.",
