The move is part of Simplus’ vision as a leading CPQ service provider that delivers customer success through Quote: -to-cash solutions tailored to maximize the user experience.\n“Simplus and CirrusOne have long shared the same dedication to raising the industry bar, so my team and I are absolutely thrilled to combine forces to further accelerate progress in the CPQ space,” said Ryan Westwood , Simplus CEO. “We’re especially excited to inherit greater technical depth and domain expertise, as well as CirrusOne’s exceptional operating principles.”\nSimplus , founded in 2014 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, has now completed five consultancy acquisitions since Q4 2016.

Having the ability to combine our collective wisdom and experience toward achieving this goal is a primary driver in our decision to merge with Simplus.”\nGodard Abel , former CEO of BigMachines and SteelBrick, now Salesforce CPQ, also commented on the acquisition: “With this acquisition, Simplus is further strengthening its team and creating a preeminent Quote: -to-cash consultancy in the Salesforce ecosystem.
