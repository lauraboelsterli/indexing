    "text": "(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc ( ABBV.N ) said on Thursday its board had approved a $10 billion stock repurchase program, and the drugmaker also increased its quarterly dividend, as it reaped the benefits of U.S. tax law changes. \nThe Chicago-based companyâ€™s shares were up nearly 1 percent at $114.04 in mid-afternoon trading. \nAbbVie, which forecast an adjusted effective 2018 tax rate of 9 percent last month, joins other companies such as Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) and Boeing ( BA.N ) in announcing share buybacks and dividend raise. \nThe largest U.S. tax overhaul in 30 years includes cuts to corporate tax rates and delivers a windfall to major U.S. companies. \nAbbVie said it was raising its quarterly dividend to 96 cents per share from 71 cents. \nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ",
