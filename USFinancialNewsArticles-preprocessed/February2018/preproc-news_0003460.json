    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 9:19 PM / Updated an hour ago Seedorf poised to coach Deportivo - reports Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBARCELONA (Reuters) - Deportivo La Coruna are poised to appoint former AC Milan and Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf as their coach, Spanish media reported on Sunday. \nThe Dutchman, who previously managed Milan and Chinese side Shenzhen, will take over as the teamâ€™s third coach this season after Cristobal Parralo, who was sacked on Sunday, and Pepe Mel. \nDepor, 18th in La Liga and three points from safety, were crushed 5-0 by Real Sociedad on Friday and have not won in seven league games. \nSeedorf won the Champions League five times as a player along with five league titles in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. \nThe 41-year-old has taken charge of only 36 games as a coach, with Depor turning to him after first-choice Martin Lasarte reportedly rejected their offer.
