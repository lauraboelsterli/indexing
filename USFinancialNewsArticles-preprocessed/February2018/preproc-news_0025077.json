    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bonti, a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company, today announced the appointment of Dr. Jacob Chacko to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Dr. Chacko has served as the Chief Financial Officer of Ignyta, Inc. (NASDAQ: RXDX) since May 2014. At Ignyta, he leads multiple functions, including Finance, Accounting, Investor Relations, Communications, Facility Operations, and IT, and has helped lead over $500 million in capital raises. He was part of the management team that helped guide the company through the successful acquisition by Roche in December 2017. He is succeeding director David Ramsay, who has been a long-standing director of Bonti since 2015 and is making a planned transition from the Board to the company management as Chief Financial Officer, as announced previously.\n“It is a pleasure to welcome Jacob as a member of our Board of Directors,” said Jonathan Lim, M.D., Chairman and co-founder of Bonti. “His deep experience building, growing and financing organizations will be invaluable as we continue to rapidly advance our clinical-stage pipeline and prepare for the next stage of Bonti’s development, on the back of topline data from our pain (LANTERN-1) program in the coming months.” He added, “We would also like to thank David Ramsay for his years of service on Bonti's Board, helping guide us during our initial years of growth to a Phase 2 stage company, with multiple programs ongoing simultaneously.\"\n“I am delighted to join Bonti’s board at this exciting inflection point for the company,\" said Dr. Chacko. “The experience of the Bonti management team in the neurotoxin field along with a steadily advancing clinical pipeline positions the company well for future success. I look forward to working closely with the board and management team in advancing Bonti’s novel treatment paradigms to address unmet therapeutic and medical aesthetic needs of millions of patients.”\nPrior to Ignyta, Dr. Chacko was an investor at TPG Capital, a global private investment firm with approximately $75 billion of assets under management, where he helped lead teams that successfully completed acquisitions having an aggregate value of over $10 billion. He served on the boards of directors of RentPath and EnvisionRx, was an advisor to the audit committee of Par Pharmaceutical and was a board observer to IMS Health and Quintiles Transnational. Dr. Chacko currently serves as the Chairperson of the Western Regional Selection Committee for the Marshall Scholarship.\nAbout Bonti\nBonti, based in Newport Beach, California, is a rapidly emerging biotechnology company founded by world class neurotoxin and biologics experts with proven prior success at Allergan and Halozyme.
