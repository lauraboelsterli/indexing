    "text": "February 13, 2018 / 8:29 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Macron slams EU parliament politics as 'incoherent', wants to redraw the map Reuters Staff 1 Min Read PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday criticised a decision by European Union lawmakers to reject a proposal for transnational lists of candidates for the European Parliament, calling for the map of EU political parties to be redrawn. “There are inside these political parties incoherences that block us,” Macron told a question and answer session with the Elysee palace press corps. “I think Europe would be better off democratically with a redrawing of the political map,” he said, adding that he would come up with a new initiative to regroup “progressives” and “reformists” together in EU elections next year.
