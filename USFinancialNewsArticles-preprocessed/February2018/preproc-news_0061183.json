    "text": "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: DY) announced today its results for the second quarter and six month period ended January 27, 2018. The Company also affirmed its financial guidance for the 2019 fiscal year ending January 26, 2019 and outlook for the quarter ending April 28, 2018 that was previously provided by the Company on February 12, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Results Summary\nContract revenues of $655.1 million for the quarter ended January 27, 2018, compared to $701.1 million for the quarter ended January 28, 2017. Contract revenues for the quarter ended January 27, 2018 decreased 10.6% on an organic basis after excluding $19.6 million of contract revenues from storm restoration services in the current period and $8.4 million of contract revenues from an acquired business that was not owned during the prior year quarter.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $59.6 million, or 9.1% of contract revenues, for the quarter ended January 27, 2018, compared to $86.2 million, or 12.3% of contract revenues, for the quarter ended January 28, 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $40.1 million, or $1.24 per common share diluted, for the quarter ended January 27, 2018, compared to net income of $23.7 million, or $0.74 per common share diluted, for the quarter ended January 28, 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $3.8 million, or $0.12 per Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Share, for the quarter ended January 27, 2018, compared to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income of $26.4 million, or $0.82 per common share diluted, for the quarter ended January 28, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the quarter ended January 27, 2018 excludes approximately $32.2 million of income tax benefit resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform\"), primarily due to the re-measurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities at a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the quarter ended January 27, 2018 also excludes approximately $6.9 million of income tax benefit for the tax effects of the vesting and exercise of share-based awards. In addition, Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the quarters ended January 27, 2018 and January 28, 2017 excludes $4.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of pre-tax interest expense incurred for non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Company's 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021 (the \"Notes\"). Shares used in computing Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share for the quarter ended January 27, 2018 exclude the GAAP dilutive effect of approximately 0.4 million weighted shares from the Notes, as the Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of additional shares up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43 per share.\nSix Month Results Summary\nContract revenues of $1.411 billion for the six months ended January 27, 2018, compared to $1.500 billion for the six months ended January 28, 2017. Contract revenues for the six months ended January 27, 2018 decreased 9.4% on an organic basis after excluding $35.1 million of contract revenues from storm restoration services in the current period and $17.0 million of contract revenues from an acquired business that was not owned during the prior year period.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $157.2 million, or 11.1% of contract revenues, for the six months ended January 27, 2018, compared to $215.4 million, or 14.4% of contract revenues, for the six months ended January 28, 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $68.8 million, or $2.15 per common share diluted, for the six months ended January 27, 2018, compared to net income of $74.7 million, or $2.32 per common share diluted, for the six months ended January 28, 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $35.4 million, or $1.11 per Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Share, for the six months ended January 27, 2018, compared to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income of $80.2 million or $2.49 per common share diluted, for the six months ended January 28, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the six months ended January 27, 2018 excludes approximately $32.2 million of income tax benefit resulting from Tax Reform, primarily due to the re-measurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities at a lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the six months ended January 27, 2018 also excludes approximately $6.9 million of income tax benefit for the tax effects of the vesting and exercise of share-based awards. In addition, Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income for the six months ended January 27, 2018 and January 28, 2017 excludes $9.2 million and $8.7 million, respectively, of pre-tax interest expense incurred for non-cash amortization of the debt discount associated with the Notes. Shares used in computing Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share for the six months ended January 27, 2018 exclude the GAAP dilutive effect of approximately 0.2 million weighted shares from the Notes, as the Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of additional shares up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43 per share.\nFiscal Year Change\nAs previously announced, the Company changed its fiscal year end from the last Saturday in July to the last Saturday in January. As a result, fiscal 2019 commenced on January 28, 2018.\nOutlook\nFor the 2019 fiscal year ending January 26, 2019 and for the quarter ending April 28, 2018 (first quarter of fiscal 2019), the Company currently expects the following:\nFiscal 2019\nQuarter Ending\nApril 28, 2018\n(Q1-19)\nContract revenues\n$3.30 - $3.50 billion\n$720 - $750 million\nDiluted Earnings per Common Share - GAAP (a)\n$4.78 - $5.70\n$0.52 - $0.67\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share (a)\n$5.22 - $6.14\n$0.63 - $0.78\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA % of revenue\n13.6% - 14.1%\n10.7% - 11.1%\n(a) Based on a preliminary analysis of the impact of Tax Reform, the Company currently expects that the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be within a range of 27.0% to 27.5% before the tax effects of the settlement of share-based awards. Earnings per Common Share outlook calculations are based on effective tax rate of 27.3%.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In quarterly results releases, trend schedules, conference calls, slide presentations, and webcasts, the Company may use or discuss Non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In the Company's quarterly results releases, trend schedules, conference calls, slide presentations, and webcasts, it may use or discuss Non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that the presentation of certain Non-GAAP financial measures in these materials provides information that is useful to investors because it allows for a more direct comparison of the Company's performance for the period reported with the Company's performance in prior periods. The Company cautions that Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results. Management defines the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this release as follows:\nNon-GAAP Organic Contract Revenues - contract revenues from businesses that are included for the entire period in both the current and prior year periods, excluding contract revenues from storm restoration services. Non-GAAP Organic Contract Revenue growth (decline) is calculated as the percentage change in Non-GAAP Organic Contract Revenues over those of the comparable prior year period. Management believes organic growth (decline) is a helpful measure for comparing the Company's revenue performance with prior periods.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA - net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale of fixed assets, stock-based compensation expense, and certain non-recurring items. Management believes Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is a helpful measure for comparing the Company's operating performance with prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies with different capital structures or tax rates.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income - GAAP net income before non-cash amortization of the debt discount and the related tax impact, certain tax impacts resulting from vesting and exercise of share-based awards, certain tax impacts of Tax Reform, and certain non-recurring items.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share and Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares - Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income divided by Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding. The Company has a note hedge in effect to offset the economic dilution of additional shares from the Notes up to an average quarterly share price of $130.43. The measure of Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted shares used in computing Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share excludes dilution from the Notes. Management believes that the calculation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted shares to reflect the note hedge will be useful to investors because it provides insight into the offsetting economic effect of the hedge against potential conversion of the Notes.\nManagement excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share:\nNon-cash amortization of the debt discount - The Company's Notes were allocated between debt and equity components. The difference between the principal amount and the carrying amount of the liability component of the Notes represents a debt discount. The debt discount is being amortized over the term of the Notes but does not result in periodic cash interest payments. The Company has excluded the non-cash amortization of the debt discount from its Non-GAAP financial measures because it believes it is useful to analyze the component of interest expense for the Notes that will be paid in cash. The exclusion of the non-cash amortization from the Company's Non-GAAP financial measures provides management with a consistent measure for assessing financial results.\nTax impact from Tax Reform - During the quarter and six months ended January 27, 2018, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $32.2 million resulting from Tax Reform, primarily due to a reduction of net deferred tax liabilities. The Company has excluded this impact because it is a significant change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and because the Company believes it is not indicative of the Company's underlying results or ongoing operations.\nTax impact of excess tax benefits as a result of ASU 2016-09 - ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2016-09\") became effective for the Company July 30, 2017, the first day of the 2018 transition period, and changed the treatment of windfalls (or shortfalls) arising from the vesting and exercise of share-based awards. Prior to ASU 2016-09, these amounts were recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these amounts are now captured in the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company excluded the impact of approximately $6.9 million of excess tax benefits during the quarter and six months ended January 27, 2018 from its provision for income taxes in its Non-GAAP measures as this amount may vary significantly from period to period and excluding this amount from the Company's Non-GAAP financial measures provides management with a more consistent measure for assessing financial results.\nTax impact of adjusted results - The tax impact of adjusted results reflects the Company's effective tax rate used for financial planning for the applicable period.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dycom-industries-inc-announces-results-for-the-second-quarter-and-six-month-period-ended-january-27-2018-and-affirms-guidance-for-fiscal-2019-300605639.html\nSOURCE Dycom Industries, Inc.",
