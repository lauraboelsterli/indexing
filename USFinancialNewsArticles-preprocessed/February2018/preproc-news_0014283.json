I feel good. Part of it depends on the Democrats. This is a bipartisan bill. It’s going to need bipartisan support,” Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “We are going to deliver our share of support. I feel very good about Republicans. Our members who are focused on the military are very happy where we landed on that.” (Reporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)",
