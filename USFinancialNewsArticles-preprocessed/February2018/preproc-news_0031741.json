Ask a Swiss skier.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Videos of athletes hanging onto an escalator and using a trolley as a makeshift bobsleigh have gone viral since they were uploaded to the Swiss ski team's Instagram account ( bit.ly/2nY2SQF ).\nIn one video, a team member hangs onto the wrong side of the escalator as it climbs upward.\n“After 20 years I still couldn’t figure out how these things work! Am I doing it right?”, skier Fabian Bösch said in a caption posted with the video.\nReporting by Reuters Television, editing by Darren Schuettler\n ",
