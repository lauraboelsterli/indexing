    "text": "PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - French insurance broker SFAM bought 11 percent of French consumer electronics chain FNAC Darty for 335 million euros ($415 million), it said on Tuesday, becoming the second-biggest shareholder after German retailer Ceconomy.\nSFAM said in a statement the share purchase was a long-term investment and could be increased depending on market opportunities, although it added it did not intend to take control of the group.\nGermanyâ€™s Ceconomy bought just under 25 percent of the French retailer last year, marking its entry into France just weeks after it was spun off from Metro.
