The finance ministry pointed a finger at the Reserve Bank of India for failing to pick up the fraud, which took place at a single branch of PNB in Mumbai, according to local media.\nThe government has written a letter to the RBI, India's central bank, saying the failure to detect the fraud raised questions about its \"efficacy of supervision to detect and check systemic failure\", financial news provider NewsRise and other local media reported.\n\"Either the framework designed by RBI to prevent and detect such frauds is inadequate or RBI is unable to ensure its effective implementation,\" they quoted the letter as saying.\nThe RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, which was a holiday in Mumbai. A finance ministry spokesman declined comment.\nRajeev Kumar, the top government bureaucrat overseeing banks, told Reuters in New Delhi the finance ministry had written to the country's banks to take effective steps to avoid a repeat of a PNB-like fraud. Kumar declined to comment if the government had written to the RBI.\nThe three bank officials arrested on Monday were Bechhu Tiwari, a chief manager in charge of the foreign exchange department; Yashwant Joshi, a manager in the same department; and Praful Sawant, another bank officer, according to a source at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The executives were not immediately available for comments.\nPolice have also issued look out-notices for Nirav Modi and for Mehul Choksi, who heads jewellery retailer Gitanjali Gems Ltd and other companies, both of whom are overseas.\nOne of Modi's employees was arrested over the weekend and on Monday CBI agents carried out another search of the bank branch to gather evidence, the CBI source said.\nModi, who counts Hollywood stars such as Kate Winslet and Dakota Johnson among his clients, has not commented on the allegations. Police have said he and his family left India before PNB filed a complaint on the alleged fraud.\nChoksi has also not commented, and police have said he also left India last month.\nPNB SHARES PLUNGE\nPNB shares slid for a fourth straight day on Monday, closing 7.2 percent lower. The sell-off has wiped out about $1.7 billion, or more than a quarter of the bank's market value, since it disclosed the fraud last Wednesday.\nShares of Choksi's Gitanjali Gems fell 9.9 percent after its chief financial officer and company secretary resigned on Monday.\nIn a letter shared with stock exchanges, the company secretary, Pankhuri Warange, said she was resigning because of the company's lack of disclosure despite her advice to be forthcoming.\n\"I have advised the management on the required disclosures to be made. There is however no consensus in my opinion on the disclosures to be made and that of the management, and in these circumstances, my conscience doesn't permit me to continue with my position,\" she wrote.\nWarange did not disclose additional details.\nThe other executive, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare cited his wife's health as the reason for his resignation, according to a Gitanjali filing to stock exchanges.\nA representative for Gitanjali, which last week denied Choksi's involvement in the alleged fraud, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.\nBANKS HIT\nOther bank stocks with exposure to the suspect transactions, which PNB says began in 2011, also fell.\nUCO Bank, another state-run lender that has said it had nearly $412 million in exposure to the fraudulent transactions carried out at PNB, closed 5.3 percent down.\nAmong other lenders which have said they had exposure to the transactions, Union Bank of India fell 7.4 percent and State Bank of India closed down 1.2 percent.\nIncluding direct loans given to companies of Modi and Choksi, Indian banks may be liable for more than $3 billion, according to an internal tax department note seen by Reuters .\nA finance ministry spokesman however said on Monday the tax department had not submitted any formal note on the investigation yet.\n\"There are many internal investigations going on, there is no note that the department has submitted,\" the spokesman said, responding to the Reuters story.\nIn another case, the CBI registered a case against pen maker Rotomac Global and officials of various banks in connection with an alleged scam to siphon off bank loans worth 29.19 billion rupees ($454.4 million).\n($1 = 64.2400 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy and Aditya Kalra, additional reporting by Manoj Kumar and Rajendra Jadhav, writing by Devidutta Tripathy and Rafael Nam, editing by Sanjeev Miglani, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Larry King)",
