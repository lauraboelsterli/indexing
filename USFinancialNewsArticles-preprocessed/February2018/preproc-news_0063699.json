    "text": "LANHAM, Md., Feb. 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- 2U, Inc. (Nasdaq: TWOU), today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenue was $86.7 million, an increase of 51% from $57.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income was $0.5 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to net loss of $(2.2) million, or $(0.05) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income was $7.9 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 million, compared to $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nRevenue was $286.8 million, an increase of 39% from $205.9 million in 2016. Net loss was $(29.4) million, or $(0.60) per share, compared to $(20.7) million, or $(0.44) per share, in 2016. Adjusted net loss was $(4.3) million, or $(0.09) per share, compared to $(4.9) million, or $(0.10) per share, in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.4 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2016.\n\"A decade into our journey, 2U is now at the forefront of the digital transformation in higher education and the strength of our business performance and the high-quality student outcomes in our partner programs prove it,\" CEO and Co-Founder Christopher \"Chip\" Paucek said. \"The positive momentum in our GetSmarter short course business combined with the organic growth in our graduate program business produced strong fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results and sets us up nicely for 2018.\"\nRecent Developments\nToday, 2U is announcing the signing of its first International Graduate Program: an MBA with University College London (\"UCL\"). This is the first online MBA offered by the UCL School of Management. The first cohort is expected to launch in 2019, subject to applicable internal approvals.\n\"The MBA@UCL is the first international graduate program in the history of 2U and a monumental step forward in the company's evolution,\" Paucek said. \"This school has innovation in its DNA. The school's long-term vision centers on its goal of creating disruptive research and entrepreneurial leaders for the complex, interconnected world of the future. Now with our partnership, we are helping UCL extend that mission across the globe.\"\nUC Berkeley is the first graduate program client that has signed to offer short courses. UC Berkeley School of Information will offer a range of technology-focused online short courses.\n2U appointed two new board members to our Board of Directors: Valerie Jarrett, former Senior Advisor to President Obama, joined the board in December and Greg Peters, Chief Product Officer of Netflix, will be joining the board on March 15, 2018.\n2U entered into a global, multi-year, exclusive partnership to enhance the future of work and learning with WeWork , a company that provides co-working space and other services to more than 175,000 members in 207 locations across the globe. The multi-dimensional deal includes:\nA perpetual license of Flatiron School's, a wholly owned subsidiary of WeWork Companies, Inc. (\"WeWork\"), Learn.co technology to 2U; Access to any WeWork location around the globe for students enrolled in 2U-powered graduate programs; $5 million in scholarships over three years offered by 2U exclusively to WeWork members and employees in 2U-powered graduate programs; and A commitment by 2U and WeWork to develop a Future of Learning and Work center in a WeWork location in 2019.\nFinancial Outlook\nBased on information available as of today, 2U is issuing the following guidance for first quarter and full-year of 2018. This guidance assumes foreign exchange rates as including a U.S. Dollar/South African Rand rate of 12.39.\n1Q 2018\nFY 2018\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue\n$91.1 - $91.6\n$397.7 - $402.7\nNet loss\n$(14.9) - $(14.5)\n$(45.0) - $(42.8)\nNet loss per share\n$(0.28) - ($0.27)\n$(0.84) - $(0.80)\nAdjusted net loss\n$(7.3) - $(6.9)\n$(7.7) - $(5.6)\nAdjusted net loss per share\n$(0.14) - $(0.13)\n$(0.14) - $(0.10)\nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, basic\n52.8\n53.5\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss)\n$(2.3) - $(1.9)\n$15.0 - $17.3\nStock-based compensation expense\n$6.2 - $6.3\n$31.6 - $32.1\n2U expects that of 2018 revenue, approximately 54% should be recognized in the second half of the year. Of second half 2018 revenue, we now expect that approximately 49% will be recognized in the third quarter. Further, we expect to experience meaningful margin variability between periods driven by revenue growth combined with cost seasonality. For full-year 2018, we expect this margin variability to be distributed between the first half and the second half of the year as follows:\nnet loss margin of between (19.8)% and (19.1)% for the first half of the year and between (4.1)% and (3.4)% for the second half of the year; adjusted net loss margin of between (10.2)% and (9.7)% for the first half of the year and adjusted net income margin of between 5.2% and 5.7% for the second half of the year; and adjusted EBITDA (loss) margin of between (4.5)% and (3.9)% for the first half of the year and adjusted EBITDA margin of between 10.9% and 11.3% for the second half of the year.\nNote that cost seasonality in the second and fourth quarters typically reduces margins in the first half of each year and improves margins in the second half of each year, so second-half margins should not be viewed as being a run rate for the first half of the following year.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income or net loss, as applicable, before net interest income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency gains or losses, acquisition-related gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense. Some or all of these items may not be applicable in any given reporting period. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\nWe define adjusted net income (loss) as net income or net loss, as applicable, before foreign currency gains or losses, acquisition-related gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted net income (loss) per share is calculated as adjusted net income (loss) divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for periods which result in adjusted net income, and basic weighted-average shares outstanding for periods which result in an adjusted net loss.\nThe principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. These non-GAAP measures are key metrics Company management uses to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. These measures also provide useful information to investors and analysts relating to 2U's financial condition and results of operations. These financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nFor more information on 2U's non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of such measures to the nearest GAAP measures, see the reconciliation tables on the last page of this press release under the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\" 2U urges investors to review these reconciliations and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.\nConference Call Information\nWhat:\n2U, Inc.'s fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results conference call\nWhen:\nMonday, February 26, 2018\nTime:\n5 p.m. ET\nLive Call:\n(877) 359-9508\nWebcast:\ninvestor.2U.com\nAbout 2U, Inc.

Profitability Margin by Launch Cohort\n(unaudited)\nThe following table presents Graduate Program Segment profitability by launch cohort as a percentage of the applicable launch cohort revenue, or Graduate Program Segment profitability margin, for the year ended December 31, 2017. We provide segment profitability information in connection with our segment financial reporting. Graduate program launch cohorts are grouped by the length of time since program launch, as of December 31, 2017. Because we incur graduate program marketing and sales expenses prior to generating the revenue related to those expenses, graduate programs typically show losses for several years prior to reaching profitability. Our measure of Graduate Program Segment profitability margin by launch cohort applies our measure of Graduate Program Segment profitability margin on a launch cohort basis.
