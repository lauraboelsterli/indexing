    "text": "2 COMMENTS Living Biblically’ stars Jay R. Ferguson as Chip Curry and Ian Gomez as Father Gene. Photo: CBS Patrick Walsh begins his day with a slap in the face from social media.\n“Every morning, when I go on to Twitter and search the show,” he said, “I’m traumatized by the things people are saying. And they haven’t even seen it!”\nGiven the state of the union—and the title of his new CBS sitcom—Mr. Walsh isn’t that surprised. “Living Biblically,” set to premiere on Monday, stars Jay R. Ferguson as New York film critic and lapsed Catholic Chip Curry, who, after a friend’s sudden death, decides to live his life strictly according to the Bible. His friends are bewildered, a priest laughs in his face, and his atheist wife, Leslie (played by Lindsey Kraft ), exhibits the patience of a saint.\nJay R. Ferguson (‘The Real O’Neals,’ ‘Mad Men’) stars in ‘Living Biblically.’ Photo: CBS For Mr. Walsh, one of the executive producers, part of the motivation for the show is that he doesn’t see religion in much of mainstream culture. “Eighty-four percent of the world aligns itself with some sort of religion, and I never hear religion discussed by anyone,” he said. “I just thought, could we make a big, friendly, respectful comedy about religion? That was the goal and, hopefully, we succeeded.”\nThe misadventures of Mr. Ferguson’s character are likely to raise the question: How do you live biblically? \n“You can’t do it!” said the Rev. Gregory Goethals, who with Rabbi Joshua Hoffman served as a script consultant on the show. “I think that was one of the first things I said to the writers. And you see it in the show: The priest and rabbi, right away, say, ‘Good luck, but it’s going to be harder than you think.’ ”\nRabbi Hoffman agreed, though he used the words “virtually impossible.”\n“The truth is, Chip’s a guy who is really throwing himself 100% into something he doesn’t fully understand,” said Mr. Walsh. “And that is pointed out to him at every turn.”\nAs Mr. Ferguson put it, “his cluelessness is where we get a lot of our jokes.”\nHis character is advised by a two-man “God Squad” played by Ian Gomez as Father Gene and David Krumholtz as Rabbi Gil, who typically meet him at a bar as the episode is winding down. The script consultants said the writers have been responsive to the issues they raise.\nIan Gomez, Mr. Ferguson and David Krumholtz at the bar on ‘Living Biblically.’ Photo: CBS “There was one episode where there was a reference to McDonald’s , ” said Rabbi Hoffman, “and the way it was written, the rabbi expressed a preference for pork ribs. I suggested that they might want to take a look at that again.” The correction was made.\nMr. Walsh, whose credits as a producer include “Two Broke Girls,” also on CBS, and HBO’s “Crashing,” adapted his new show from author A.J. Jacobs’s “The Year of Living Biblically.” Although the book had a Jewish slant, Mr. Walsh made Chip Catholic, because it was what he knew.\n“I was looking for a show to write and was bored, to be honest, by a lot of stuff I was being presented,” he said. “A guy moves back in with his parents—that’s 50% of television comedy; the rest is dating, etc. So they gave me the book, and I was intrigued by the subject. I was raised very religious, and I just loved the way the book kind of lampooned religion at times, but was always very respectful.”\nMr. Walsh also knew he needed a diverse room of writers, and some experts, which he found close by: Father Goethals, who is the president of Loyola High School in Los Angeles, is also the brother-in-law of “Living Biblically” director Andy Ackerman. One of the show’s producers is a member of Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, Calif., Rabbi Hoffman’s synagogue. \nBoth were recruited to vet the scripts and defuse any inadvertent theological land mines, such as when Father Goethals advised against Father Gene telling a Kardashian joke, and for him loosening his collar when “off duty.” \nThat the portrayals of the clerics, as well as Mr. Ferguson’s character, are funny but dignified comes as a relief to the Rev. James Martin, an editor at the Jesuit magazine America who has consulted on Martin Scorsese’s films “Silence” and “The Irishman.”\n“Normally when you see a priest, brother or sister on screen, you can be sure they’re going to fall into one of several annoying stereotypes,” Father Martin said. “Any portrayal of someone in the priesthood or a religious order that is nuanced, complex and sympathetic is a welcome surprise.”",
