    "text": "8 COMMENTS JAKARTA, Indonesia—Indonesia police said they had confiscated a luxury yacht, Equanimity, which is controlled by the Malaysian financier who the U.S. Justice Department alleges in lawsuits directed a $4.5 billion fraud that involved siphoning money from 1Malaysian Development Bhd.\nThe Justice Department has moved to seize assets since 2016 that it alleges the financier, Jho Low, and others bought with money taken from 1MDB.\nRelated Coverage\nJPMorgan Rebuked by Swiss Regulator Over Dealings With 1MDB (Dec. 21) The Secret Money Behind ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ (April 1, 2016) How $1 Billion Made Its Way to the Prime Minister (Sept. 1, 2016) The FBI asked Indonesian police to impound the yacht in connection with the 1MDB probe, said Agung Setya Imam Effendi, director of economic and special crimes at Indonesia’s criminal-investigation bureau.\nMr. Agung said 34 people, all foreigners described as crew members, were on the yacht when it was confiscated off the island of Bali on Wednesday. He said he didn’t know Mr. Low’s whereabouts.\nA spokesperson for Mr. Low said in a written statement that the case was “completely without foundation’’ and that “rather than reflecting on the deeply flawed and politically motivated allegations, the DoJ is continuing with its pattern of global over-reach—all based on entirely unsupported claims of wrongdoing.’’\nIndonesian police said they received a request from the FBI on Feb. 21 to search for the boat, along with evidence of money laundering linked to it. They found the vessel three days later off the coast of Lombok, a large island east of Bali, Mr. Agung said.\nHe said FBI personnel didn’t board the boat but were on the ground in Bali to assist police. The boat is now anchored off Bali, Mr. Agung said.\nThe Justice Department has filed a series of civil lawsuits in California, aiming to seize the assets, which include the Equanimity, a Bombardier jet, mansions and royalties from the film “The Wolf of Wall Street .”\n​Since mid-2016, the U.S. Justice Department has moved to seize assets that it alleges financier Jho Low and others bought with money taken from 1MDB.

Mr. Agung said the yacht had been in Indonesian waters for some time, sailing to Papua in the far east and the Maluku islands before heading to Bali.\nIt isn’t clear whether the FBI made similar requests to Thai authorities to seize the yacht.\nThe 1MDB fund has denied any money is missing and said it would cooperate with any lawful investigation. Multiple investigations in Malaysia into 1MDB closed without finding wrongdoing.",
