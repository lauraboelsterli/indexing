    "text": "First Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Net Income up 59% on Operating Income Increase of 23% and Net Sales Increase of 18%\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla. & MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI.A) (NYSE:HEI) today reported that net income increased 59% to a record $65.2 million, or 60 cents per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $40.9 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating income increased 23% to $79.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $64.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company's consolidated operating margin improved to 19.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from 18.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the United States (U.S.) government enacted significant changes to existing tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. The Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was 4.7%, down from 26.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income was favorably impacted by approximately $16.5 million, or 15 cents per diluted earnings per share, as a result of the lower federal tax rate and is inclusive of approximately $11.9 million, or 11 cents per diluted earnings per share, as a result of one-time tax benefits principally due to the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities.\nAll share and per share information has been adjusted retrospectively to reflect 5-for-4 stock splits distributed by the Company in April 2017 and January 2018.\nNet sales increased 18% to $404.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $343.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nConsolidated Results\nLaurans A. Mendelson, HEICO’s Chairman and CEO, commented on the Company's first quarter results stating, \"We are pleased to report strong first quarter year-over-year increases in net sales and operating income within both our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group. These results principally reflect the excellent performance of our well-managed and profitable fiscal 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, as well as consolidated organic growth of 5%.\nOur total debt to shareholders' equity ratio decreased to 50.3% as of January 31, 2018, down from 54.0% as of October 31, 2017. Our net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) of $603.3 million as of January 31, 2018 to shareholders’ equity ratio decreased to 45.4% as of January 31, 2018, down from 49.8% as of October 31, 2017. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.54x as of January 31, 2018 compared to 1.67x as of October 31, 2017. During fiscal 2018, we have successfully completed two acquisitions and we have completed five acquisitions over the past year. We have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2023 and plan to utilize our financial flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns.\nCash flow provided by operating activities remained strong, totaling $45.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We continue to forecast record cash flow from operations for fiscal 2018.\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we anticipate continued net sales growth within the Flight Support Group's commercial aviation and defense product lines. We also anticipate growth within the Electronic Technologies Group, principally driven by demand for the majority of our products. During the remainder of fiscal 2018, we will continue our commitments to developing new products and services, further market penetration, and an aggressive acquisition strategy, while maintaining our financial strength and flexibility.\nBased on our current economic visibility, we are increasing our estimated consolidated fiscal 2018 year-over-year growth in net sales to 12% - 14% and in net income to 30% - 32%, up from prior growth estimates in net sales and net income of 10% - 12%. The increased net income guidance reflects the impact of a lower federal income tax rate and the continued improvements in our consolidated operating results. Additionally, we now anticipate our consolidated operating margin to approximate 20% - 21%, up from our prior estimate of 20%, and cash flow from operations to approximate $310 million, up from our prior estimate of $290 million. Further, we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to approximate $75 million and capital expenditures to approximate $50 million. These estimates include our recent acquisition of Sensor Technology Engineering, Inc., but exclude additional acquired businesses, if any.\"\nFlight Support Group\nEric A. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, commented on the Flight Support Group's first quarter results stating, \"Our year-over-year net sales and operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was driven by recent acquisitions and continued organic growth within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines.\nThe Flight Support Group's net sales increased 15% to $254.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $220.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase is attributable to the impact from our recent profitable acquisitions as well as 4% organic growth. The organic growth in the Flight Support Group mainly reflects higher demand and new product offerings within our aftermarket replacement parts, as well as repair and overhaul parts and services product lines, partially offset by lower demand for certain defense components within our specialty products product line. Excluding the net sales decrease in our specialty products product line, the Flight Support Group experienced 6% organic growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, principally in our aftermarket replacement parts product line.\nThe Flight Support Group's operating income increased 11% to $45.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $41.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense and an increase in intangible asset amortization expense mainly resulting from the fiscal 2017 acquisitions.\nThe Flight Support Group's operating margin was 18.0% and 18.7% in the first quarters of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned higher performance-based compensation expense and increase in intangible asset amortization expense.\nWith respect to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we continue to estimate full year net sales growth of approximately 10% over the prior year and the full year Flight Support Group operating margin to approximate 18.0% - 18.5%. Further, we continue to estimate that approximately half our fiscal 2018 net sales growth will be generated organically. These estimates exclude additional acquired businesses, if any.”\nElectronic Technologies Group\nVictor H. Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO’s Electronic Technologies Group, commented on the Electronic Technologies Group's first quarter results stating, \"Our strong performance was driven principally by the impact of recent acquisitions, as well as continued favorable organic growth.\nThe Electronic Technologies Group's net sales increased 23% to $155.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $126.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase resulted from the contribution by our profitable fiscal 2017 and 2018 acquisitions, as well as 6% organic growth, principally from increased demand for our space and defense products.\nThe Electronic Technologies Group's operating income increased 49% to $43.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from $29.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin impact mainly attributed to higher net sales and a more favorable product mix for certain defense products.\nThe Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin improved to 27.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, up from 23.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase is principally attributed to the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin.\nWith respect to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we now estimate full year net sales growth of approximately 15% - 17% over the prior year, up from the prior estimate of 12%, and anticipate the full year Electronic Technologies Group's operating margin to approximate 27% - 28%, up from the prior estimate of 27%. Further, we estimate the Electronic Technologies Group’s organic net sales growth rate to be in the mid- to high-single digits. These estimates include the recently announced acquisition of Sensor Technology Engineering, Inc., but exclude additional acquired businesses, if any.”\n(NOTE: HEICO has two classes of common stock traded on the NYSE.
