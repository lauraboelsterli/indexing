    "text": "MONROE, Mich., Feb. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- La-Z-Boy Incorporated (NYSE:LZB) today reported its operating results for the fiscal 2018 third quarter ended January 27, 2018.\nConsolidated sales increased 6.1% to $413.6 million; Same-store written sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ® network increased 2.6%; Cash flow from operations was $40.0 million; The company returned $21.1 million to shareholders through dividends and share purchases; and Earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.25, including a $0.20 per share net charge related to tax reform and a $0.06 per share charge related to a previously announced legal settlement.\nSales for the fiscal 2018 third quarter were $413.6 million, up 6.1% compared with the prior year’s third quarter. Operating margin was 8.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 versus 8.6% in the fiscal 2017 third quarter. The fiscal 2018 third quarter’s operating margin was reduced by 1.0% as a result of the charge for the previously announced settlement of a lawsuit regarding certain power products.\nThe company reported net income attributable to La-Z-Boy Incorporated of $12.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, which included a $0.20 per share net charge related to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (tax reform) and a $0.06 per share charge related to the previously announced legal settlement, versus $23.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share in the fiscal 2017 third quarter.\nSales in the company’s upholstery segment increased 6.0% to $321.0 million and the operating margin declined to 9.9% from 11.8% in last year’s third quarter. The charge for the settlement of a lawsuit regarding certain power products reduced operating margin in the segment by 1.3% in the fiscal 2018 third quarter. In the casegoods segment, sales increased 17.0% to $27.2 million and the operating margin increased to 10.3% from 6.8%. Sales in the retail segment increased 3.0% to $125.8 million for the third quarter and the segment’s operating margin increased to 5.6% from 5.2% in the prior-year period. On the core base of 138 stores included in last year’s third quarter, delivered sales declined 1.1% versus the prior-year quarter.\nKurt L. Darrow, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of La-Z-Boy, said, “We experienced positive sales momentum for the quarter and, in addition to posting a 6.1% increase, each of our business segments operated at a high level during the period. Additionally, the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ® store network posted its fourth consecutive quarterly written same-store sales increase. The company also generated strong cash flow from operations enabling us to make the necessary strategic investments to grow our business in the dynamic marketplace and return value to shareholders.”\nDarrow added, “In our upholstery segment, we are very pleased with the performance of our new duo ™ product line which, thus far, is exceeding our expectations in the short time it has been on retail floors and is a testament to the innovative spirit that is the hallmark of our brand. During the period, ongoing inflationary pressures for raw materials impacted the upholstery segment’s operating margin in November and December until our price increase became effective on delivered orders in January. For the fourth quarter, raw material prices are not anticipated to be a drag on our margin as the full benefit of the price increase will be in effect on all sales.”\nDarrow said, “Our casegoods business continues on an upward trajectory, with increased sales and earnings performance as the group expands floor space with retailers. New, on-trend product collections are resonating with consumers and our supply chain is providing excellent service to customers with quick shipping on our best-selling groups. In our retail segment, we opened one new La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ® store during the quarter and acquired one store in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as part of our store build-out strategy. For the quarter, the retail segment’s operating margin improved, resulting from an increase in the average ticket primarily driven by increased design services and custom orders.”\nDarrow continued, “With a strong brand, a vast distribution system, including the vibrant and growing La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries ® store network, a best-in-class global supply chain and a healthy balance sheet to support new initiatives, La-Z-Boy is pursuing a dual growth strategy to drive organic growth with our core consumer while attracting a new and younger consumer through our multi-faceted e-commerce approach. We are optimistic about the many opportunities that exist through our comprehensive strategy and look forward to growing our business with a new consumer group that exhibits different buying characteristics than the core La-Z-Boy consumer. La-Z-Boy will continue to evolve as we make strategic investments to drive growth and profitability in an ever-changing environment.”\nFISCAL 2018 PROJECTED* STORE ACTIVITY\nTotal FY17 New Closed Acquired Total FY18 Remodel Relocation Company-owned 143 6 (4) 1 146 - - Dealer-owned 204 4 (3) (1) 204 7 4 Total 347 10 (7) - 350 7 4 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOur results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a $0.20 per share net charge related to tax reform, or $9.5 million. This included a $9.8 million charge for the provisional re-measurement of certain deferred taxes and related amounts, a provisional $1.9 million of income tax expense for the estimated effects of the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and a benefit of $2.2 million primarily related to the lower blended federal tax rate. Based on our current interpretation of the tax reform legislation, we made reasonable estimates to record provisional adjustments during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Since we are still accumulating and processing data to finalize the underlying calculations and expect regulators to issue further guidance, among other things, we believe our estimates may change. We will continue to refine such amounts within the measurement period allowed, which is not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nDuring the quarter, the company generated $40.0 million in cash from operating activities. La-Z-Boy ended the quarter with $135.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $35.4 million in investments to enhance returns on cash, and $2.4 million in restricted cash. During the quarter, the company had $7.8 million in capital expenditures, paid $5.7 million in dividends, and spent $15.4 million purchasing 0.5 million shares of stock in the open market under its existing authorized share purchase program, leaving 7.0 million shares of purchase availability in the program.\nConference Call\nLa-Z-Boy will hold a conference call with the investment community on Wednesday, February 21, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. eastern time.
