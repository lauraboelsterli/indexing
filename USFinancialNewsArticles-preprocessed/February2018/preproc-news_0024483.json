    "text": "LAWRENCE, Mass., Boston Therapeutics, Inc. (Boston Therapeutics) announces the acquisition of CureDM Group Holdings, LLC (CureDM), adding a Phase 2-ready drug to their portfolio. The CureDM islet-growing peptide, HIP2B, has demonstrated clinical efficacy for type 2 diabetes by improving first phase insulin release, increasing fasting insulin levels and insulin secretion rates. Boston Therapeutics is committed to development of treatments that impact endogenous glucose regulation. This bold move to acquire the worldwide exclusive rights to commercialize HIP2B, alongside current product offerings, is a key part of the long term plan to alleviate the health, economic and quality of life burden of diabetes.\nCureDM members contributed their membership interests for restricted shares of Boston Therapeutics to place their compound into the Boston Therapeutics portfolio of other technologies targeted for treatment of metabolic diseases (diabetes) and related complications. Terms include milestones and addition of a CureDM designated board member to the board of Boston Therapeutics.\n“We are establishing our company and its alliance partners in Asia as one that is changing the way diabetes is treated,” says Carl W. Rausch, CEO of Boston Therapeutics. He elaborates that, “Instead of a disease which you have to self-medicate for the rest of your life, we believe diabetes is a disease that can be either reversed or may be prevented entirely if you are pre-diabetic. The HIP2B peptide is a game changing compound that will fit strategically into our portfolio.” CEO of CureDM, Loraine V. Upham, notes, “We are very excited to be joining forces with Boston Therapeutics and look forward to leveraging the many synergies that exist between us to advance all products to partnering and worldwide commercialization.”\nRecent reporting from the American Diabetes Association celebrates strides in 2017 in diabetes management and improved outcomes that include better accessibility to continuous glucose monitors. This technology is key to enabling patients to self-monitor their response to their patient centric treatments like BTI320 and HIP2B. Management believes both treatments have the potential to change the way prediabetes and diabetes are managed and this may work independently or synergistically to improve long-term outcomes.\nAbout Boston Therapeutics, Inc. www.bostonti.com\nBoston Therapeutics, headquartered in Lawrence, MA (OTCQB:BTHE) is an innovator in design, development and commercialization of compounds, such as investigational BTI-320, to treat diabetes and diabetes related complications. SUGARDOWN is a registered trademark of Boston Therapeutics, Inc.\nAbout CureDM Group Holdings, LLC, www.CureDM.com\nCureDM Group Holdings, LLC, headquartered in Wilmington, DE with an office in Albuquerque, NM, was established in 2010 to execute clinical development of the novel peptide therapeutic, HIP2B, for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nForward Looking Statement\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements.
