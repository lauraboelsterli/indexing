(“Isle”) for the four months ended April 30, 2017, the day before ERI acquired Isle on May 1, 2017. ERI reports its financial results on a calendar fiscal year. Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Isle, Isle's fiscal year typically ended on the last Sunday in April. Isle's fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 52-week years, which commenced on April 25, 2016 and April 27, 2015, respectively. Such figures were prepared by the Company to reflect Isle’s unaudited consolidated historical net revenues, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for periods corresponding to ERI's fiscal quarterly calendar. Such figures are based on the unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company's auditors and do not conform to GAAP. (2) Total figures for 2016 and 2017 include combined results of operations for Isle and ERI for periods preceding the date that ERI acquired Isle. Such presentation does not conform with GAAP or the Securities and Exchange Commission rules for pro forma presentation; however, we believe that the additional financial information will be helpful to investors in comparing current results with results of prior periods. This is non-GAAP data and should not be considered a substitute for data prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should be viewed in addition to the results of operations reported by the Company. (3) Figures are for Isle for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Such figures were prepared by the Company to reflect Isles' unaudited consolidated historical net revenues, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for periods corresponding to ERI's fiscal quarterly calendar. Such figures are based on the unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company's auditors and do not conform to GAAP. (4) Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measurement and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because the Company believes it is a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry. See “Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures” below for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss), which the Company believes is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. “Eldorado’s record fourth quarter results marked the conclusion of another active and productive year of growth for the Company in which we extended our success in expanding margins and growing financial results. Notably, the fourth quarter growth was broad based and reflects a continuation of the strong operating momentum we have generated since last May’s accretive acquisition of Isle of Capri,” said Gary Carano, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eldorado. “Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.3% to $91.1 million on essentially flat revenue reflecting a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.3%. Overall 14 of our 20 properties grew Adjusted EBITDA in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period, and for the full year 16 of our properties saw Adjusted EBITDA rise, which helped drive an 8.7% year-over-year increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to $407.2 million despite a modest net revenue decline.\n“We see a pathway toward meaningful additional margin expansion as we focus our operating strategies on practices that emphasize generating profitable revenue across the portfolio. Although we already surpassed our targeted $35 million of annual synergies from the Isle of Capri transaction, we are still in the early stages of rationalizing marketing and promotional spend across the enterprise and optimizing the acquired food and beverage operations. Isle of Capri Lake Charles is an example of one property that offers significant opportunity for improvement following the termination of the sale agreement for the property in the fourth quarter. We have identified significant cost reductions at the property based on our analysis of the operations of properties within our portfolio that have a similar revenue and competitive market profile. By deploying best practices across the portfolio, we also expect to generate further improvements in our legacy property operations.\n“We continue to move forward with return-focused investments that improve our guests’ experiences and elevate our properties overall competitiveness in their markets. The comprehensive facility improvement program under way at our Reno Tri-Properties continues to drive higher visitation. To date, we have completed upgrades to nearly 1,000 hotel rooms and suites, updated food and beverage operations across the facilities with eight new or redesigned restaurants, cafes or bars now open, created new public spaces in all three properties and opened a new poker room and sports book. We believe that our spending in winter 2016 helped drive extremely strong results at the Reno Tri-Properties throughout the second half of the year. As a result of these strong returns, we have decided to accelerate additional investment in the Reno Tri-Properties in 2018, as we expect to spend $37.5 million of project capex in 2018 for further facility upgrades. We are similarly embarking on upgrades to the room product at our two Black Hawk properties beginning in late 2018 as we seek to capitalize on the strong economy of the Denver market.\n“We entered 2018 with significant momentum and a comprehensive set of operating initiatives that will help us continue to grow our financial results. We believe that there are still many opportunities for Eldorado to build on our leading regional gaming platform which will help us further enhance shareholder value.”\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAt December 31, 2017, Eldorado had $134.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 million in restricted cash. Outstanding indebtedness at December 31, 2017 totaled $2.2 billion, with no amounts outstanding on the Company’s revolving credit facility. Gross capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the full year totaled $30.3 million and $83.5 million, respectively.\n“We continue to improve our marketing and customer acquisition efficiencies and to lower costs across our entire property portfolio,” said Tom Reeg, President and Chief Financial Officer. “The 2017 fourth quarter results include a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $112.4 million resulting from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, our annual free cash flow is expected to benefit from more than $40 million in lower cash taxes over the next two years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act treatment of capital investment incentivizes us to bring high return growth projects online sooner and as a result, we expect full year capital expenditures of approximately $150 million, with approximately 50% allocated to project capex and 50% for maintenance capex.”\nSummary of 2017 Fourth Quarter Region Results\nWest Region (Reno Tri-Properties, Isle Casino Hotel Black Hawk and Lady Luck Casino Black Hawk)\nNet revenue for the West Region properties for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately 6.6% to $111.7 million compared to $104.8 million in the prior-year period, while operating income rose to $15.8 million from $12.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.7% to $24.1 million reflecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.5% compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $19.6 million on an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7% in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased year over year at the Reno Tri-Properties and at both Isle Black Hawk and Lady Luck Black Hawk with the combined Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Black Hawk properties exceeding 30% for the second consecutive quarter.\nMidwest Region (Isle Casino Waterloo, Isle Casino Bettendorf, Isle of Capri Casino Boonville, Isle Casino Cape Girardeau, Lady Luck Casino Caruthersville and Isle of Capri Casino Kansas City)\nNet revenue for the Midwest Region properties for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately 1.4% to $97.4 million compared to $98.8 million in the prior-year period, while operating income rose to $22.4 million from $18.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose approximately 6.8% to $30.5 million as the Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment rose 240 basis points to 31.4%. Adjusted EBITDA increased year over year at five of the six Midwest Region properties. Adjusted EBITDA for the Midwest Region in the prior-year period was $28.6 million reflecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.9%.\nSouth Region (Isle Casino Racing Pompano Park, Eldorado Shreveport, Isle of Capri Casino Lula, Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg and Isle of Capri Lake Charles)\nNet revenue for the South Region properties for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 declined approximately 7.4% to $109.0 million compared to $117.7 million in the prior-year period. Operating loss was $(28.5) million compared to operating income of $14.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The operating loss for the South Region in the fourth quarter of 2017 includes total impairment charges of $38.0 million, including impairment charges of $13.2 million for Isle of Capri Lake Charles; $24.5 million for Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg; and $0.3 million for Isle of Capri Casino Lula. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.8% to $23.3 million as the Adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment rose 340 basis points to 21.4%. Adjusted EBITDA for the South Region in the prior-year period was $21.2 million reflecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.0%. The South Region’s results include contributions from Isle of Capri Lake Charles for both periods and reflect a nearly 75% year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the property. Isle of Capri Lake Charles had previously been classified as discontinued operations and as assets held for sale. In November 2017, Eldorado terminated the sale agreement for the property as the proposed buyer did not obtain required gaming approvals prior to the termination date. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Eldorado retained the proposed buyer’s $20.0 million deposit, which is included in Corporate and Other operating income (loss).\nEast Region (Presque Isle Downs and Casino, Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin, Eldorado Scioto Downs Racino and Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort)\nNet revenue for the East Region properties for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately 1.9% to $110.1 million compared to $108.0 million in the prior-year period, while operating income grew to $13.6 million from $8.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the East Region rose 11.7% to $20.3 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $18.2 million in the prior-year period as the East Region’s Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 160 basis points to 18.5%. Eldorado Scioto Downs generated Adjusted EBITDA growth for the twelfth consecutive quarter and Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack & Resort grew Adjusted EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter following the implementation of initiatives to improve amenities and right-size operating expenses to match current visitation and revenue volumes.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA (defined below), a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding the Company’s ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, transaction expenses, S-1 expenses, severance expense, income related to the termination of the Lake Charles sale, costs associated with the terminated Lake Charles sale, impairment charges, equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, and other regulatory gaming assessments, including the impact of the change in regulatory reporting requirements, to the extent that such items existed in the periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”), is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.\nFourth Quarter Conference Call\nEldorado will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today. Senior management will discuss the financial results and host a question and answer session. The dial in number for the audio conference call is 719/325-4879, conference ID 8151361 (domestic and international callers). Participants can also access a live webcast of the call through the “Events & Presentations” section of Eldorado’s website at http://www.eldoradoresorts.com/ and a replay of the webcast will be archived on the site for 90 days following the live event.\nAbout Eldorado Resorts, Inc.\nEldorado Resorts is a leading casino entertainment company that owns and operates twenty properties in ten states, including Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

The Company reports its financial results on a calendar fiscal year. Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Isle, Isle’s fiscal year typically ended on the last Sunday in April. Isle’s fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 52-week years, which commenced on April 25, 2016 and April 27, 2015, respectively. Such figures were prepared by the Company to reflect Isle’s unaudited consolidated historical net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for periods corresponding to the Company’s fiscal quarterly calendar. Such figures are based on the unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors and do not conform to GAAP. (2) Total figures for 2016 and 2017 include combined results of operations for Isle and the Company for periods preceding the date that the Company acquired Isle. Such presentation does not conform with GAAP or the Securities and Exchange Commission rules for pro forma presentation; however, we believe that the additional financial information will be helpful to investors in comparing current results with results of prior periods. This is non-GAAP data and should not be considered a substitute for data prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should be viewed in addition to the results of operations reported by the Company. (3) Figures are for Isle for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Such figures were prepared by the Company to reflect Isle’s unaudited consolidated historical net revenues, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for periods corresponding to the Company’s fiscal quarterly calendar. Such figures are based on the unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors and do not conform to GAAP. (4) Effective January 1, 2016, the Ohio Lottery Commission enacted a regulatory change which resulted in the establishment of a $1.0 million progressive slot liability and a corresponding decrease in net slot win during the first quarter of 2016. The changes are non-cash and related primarily to prior years. The net non-cash impact to Adjusted EBITDA was $0.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. (5) Transaction expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 represent costs related to the Isle Acquisition. Transaction expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 represent costs related to the Isle and Reno Acquisitions. (6) Other is comprised of severance expense, income totaling $20.0 million related to the termination of the Lake Charles sale, costs totaling $2.8 million associated with the termination of the Lake Charles sale, $38.0 million in impairment charges, (gain) loss on sale or disposal of property and equipment, equity in income of unconsolidated affiliate and other regulatory gaming assessments, including the item listed in footnote (4) above.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180222006345/en/\nEldorado Resorts, Inc.\nThomas Reeg, 775-328-0112\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\ninvestorrelations@eldoradoresorts.com\nor\nJCIR\nJoseph N.
