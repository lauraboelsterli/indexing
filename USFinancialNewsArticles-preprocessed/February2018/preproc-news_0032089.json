Please note that as a result of the completion of the LatAm split-off, the information included in this release represents our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.\nCEO Mike Fries stated , \"We ended 2017 on a high note, as we delivered our best rebased revenue growth of the year in Q4, along with 4.5% rebased 2 OCF 3 growth for the full year and $1.6 billion of Adjusted Free Cash Flow 4 . These results were driven by solid performances in Germany and the U.K., together with continued cost efficiencies from our Liberty GO program.\"\n\"Virgin Media, our largest operation, steadily improved throughout 2017 and posted 5% rebased OCF growth in Q4, its best performance of the year. We successfully executed the price increase last November and continued rolling out cutting-edge products like our WiFi Connect and V6 set-top boxes, which we will continue to aggressively deploy in 2018. Early last year, we overhauled Project Lightning and subsequently reported progressively improved new build totals, including the delivery of nearly 160,000 premises in Q4 2017, a quarterly record.\nIn Switzerland, Q4 and full-year OCF results were impacted by costs associated with the launch of MySports, our new sports channel that is available exclusively to cable customers. This investment has transformed UPC Switzerland into the premier provider of televised athletic events, featuring access to Swiss ice hockey and Bundesliga matches. We expect that our OCF results in this market will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters, as we continue to invest in MySports.\"\n\"Our balance sheet remains in great shape with an average long-term debt tenor 9 of nearly eight years, a fully-swapped borrowing cost of 4.2% and substantial liquidity 10 of $5 billion. We recently announced a stock repurchase plan of $2 billion for 2018 which, when completed, will push our total buybacks since 2005 above $20 billion.\nOn the M&A front, a couple transactions have highlighted our continued focus on shareholder value creation. At the end of the year we completed the split-off of our Latin American business, which created two attractive, asset-backed securities. In December, we announced the sale of UPC Austria to T-Mobile Austria at an ~11x EV/OCF exit multiple, highlighting the strategic value of our networks in a rapidly converging world.\nLooking ahead, in 2018 we expect to deliver around 5% rebased OCF growth, Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $1.6 billion and P&E additions of $5.1 billion, including $1.2 billion 8 of spend for new build and upgrade for the full year. These investments, which underpin our customer-centric focus, leave us well placed to deliver long-term sustainable growth.”\nFull-Year 2017 Highlights 2018 Guidance Targets •\nNEW PREMISES BUILT OVER 1.1 MM •\nREBASED OCF GROWTH ~5% 7 •\nB2B 5 REVENUE GROWTH 2 +12%\n•\nADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW $1.6BN 8 •\nORGANIC RGU 6 ADDITIONS 760,000 •\nP&E ADDITIONS OF $5.1 BN 8 About Liberty Global\nLiberty Global (NASDAQ: LBTYA, LBTYB and LBTYK) is the world’s largest international TV and broadband company, with operations in 12 European countries under the consumer brands Virgin Media, Unitymedia, Telenet and UPC.

On the fixed product side, all three products showed year-over-year declines U.K./Ireland: Q4 RGU additions of 8,000 were lower than the prior year, as improved performance in new build areas was offset by reduced growth in our existing footprint, reflecting our structured approach to promotions. As a result, broadband net additions of 25,000, were down year-over-year, while our RGU performance improved across video and fixed-telephony Belgium: RGU attrition of 12,000 in Q4, consistent with prior 2017 quarters, was primarily due to intensified competition. However, our converged quad-play package additions continued to grow, as we gained nearly 39,000 new \"WIGO\" subscribers during Q4 Germany: Reported 55,000 RGU additions in Q4, which was below our Q4 2016 result. The prior-year period was boosted by a successful \"high-speed weeks\" promotion, which offered higher discounts on our core double and triple-play bundles. Additionally, video attrition of 37,000 RGUs was driven by a large MDU contract disconnect Switzerland/Austria: Lost 19,000 RGUs in Q4, compared to a Q4 2016 gain of 25,000, which was largely due to the launch of Connect&Play. The performance was largely due to losses of 29,000 video and 2,000 broadband subscribers, partially offset by 12,000 telephony RGU additions CEE: Delivered 117,000 RGU additions in Q4, largely in-line with the prior-year period Next-Generation Video Penetration (including Horizon TV, Horizon-Lite, TiVo, Virgin TV V6 and Yelo TV): Added 210,000 subscribers to our advanced platforms in Q4 and reached 7.7 million or 43% of our total cable video base (excluding DTH) by the end of the year WiFi Connect Box: Deployments of our latest WiFi Connect box increased by more than 1 million in Q4, ending the quarter with an installed base of over 6.4 million or 43% of broadband subscribers across Europe Mobile: Added 95,000 mobile subscribers in Q4, as 119,000 postpaid additions were partially offset by continued attrition in our low-ARPU prepaid base Belgium added 51,000 new mobile subscribers during Q4, a strong year-over-year improvement. This was driven by the continued success of our converged \"WIGO\" offers and a competitive BASE 14 postpaid proposition UK/Ireland added 63,000 postpaid mobile subscribers in Q4, 10x higher than the prior-year result, driven by exceptionally strong take-up of innovative 36-month Freestyle contracts. Total mobile net additions increased by 33,000 in the quarter as postpaid growth was partially offset by low-ARPU prepaid losses. The penetration of 4G at Virgin Media increased to 55% at the end of Q4 Switzerland/Austria gained 18,000 mobile subscribers in Q4, as our Swiss offerings (including free EU roaming since June) continue to gain traction. Also announced a new MVNO contract with Swisscom with subscriber transition by early 2019\nRevenue Highlights\nThe following table presents (i) revenue of each of our consolidated reportable segments for the comparative periods and (ii) the percentage change from period to period on both a reported and rebased basis:\nThree months ended Increase/(decrease) Year ended Increase/(decrease) December 31, December 31, Revenue 2017 2016 % Rebased % 2017 2016 % Rebased % in millions, except % amounts U.K./Ireland $ 1,711.1 $ 1,523.2 12.3 4.4 $ 6,398.7 $ 6,508.8 (1.7 ) 2.1 Belgium 758.8 680.2 11.6 0.9 2,865.3 2,691.1 6.5 1.2 Germany 716.8 639.7 12.1 2.5 2,705.4 2,539.7 6.5 4.3 Switzerland/Austria 451.2 435.9 3.5 0.4 1,766.0 1,755.6 0.6 (0.3 ) Central and Eastern Europe 317.1 273.8 15.8 4.6 1,183.6 1,088.4 8.7 5.2 The Netherlands — 660.4 (100.0 ) N.M.\n— 2,690.8 (100.0 ) N.M.

These results included: A reduction in cable subscription revenue of $12 million for the full-year 2017 period resulting from a change in U.K. regulations governing payment handling fees that we charge our customers The favorable $7 million YTD impact due to the release of unclaimed customer credits in Switzerland A reduction in channel carriage fee revenue primarily related to the June 2017 discontinuation of our analog video service in Germany, which resulted in revenue decreases of $7 million in Q4 and $18 million in the full-year 2017 period The favorable $6 million impact in the full-year 2017 period for the expected recovery of VAT paid in prior periods with respect to copyright fees in Belgium, which benefited revenue in H1 2017 Our B2B business (including SOHO and non-subscription revenue) reported rebased revenue growth of 13% and 12% in the Q4 and full-year 2017 periods, respectively Our residential mobile business (including interconnect and handset sales) posted a 6% rebased revenue gain and 2% rebased contraction in the Q4 and full-year 2017 periods, respectively\nQ4 2017 Rebased Revenue Growth - Segment Highlights\nU.K./Ireland: Rebased revenue growth of 4% in Q4 reflects (i)17% rebased growth in residential mobile revenue (including interconnect and mobile handset revenue), reflecting higher revenue from mobile handset sales that was partially offset by lower mobile subscription revenue (ii) 2% rebased growth in our residential cable business, and (iii) 6% rebased revenue growth in our B2B business, largely driven by continued growth in the SOHO segment Belgium: Rebased revenue growth of 1% in Q4 was mainly driven by the net effect of (i) growth in our B2B segment, driven by increased MVNO revenue on Telenet's mobile network and (ii) lower mobile and cable revenue Germany: Q4 rebased revenue growth of 2.5% reflects the net effect of (i) higher residential cable subscription revenue as a result of increases in subscribers and higher ARPU per RGU, (ii) B2B revenue growth, largely driven by an increase in B2B non-subscription revenue, (iii) lower analog video channel carriage revenue of $7 million and (iv) lower fixed-line telephony interconnect revenue. Switzerland/Austria: Rebased revenue growth in Q4 was relatively flat, primarily related to the net effect of (i) lower ARPU per RGU, mainly due to competitive pressures, (ii) higher revenue from the distribution of MySports channels and (iii) increased mobile revenue CEE: Rebased revenue growth of 5% in Q4, driven by the net effect of (i) growth in our B2B business, (ii) higher cable revenue supported by solid RGU additions throughout 2017, and (iii) a small decline in ARPU per RGU\nOperating Income\nOperating income was $496 million and $683 million in Q4 2017 and Q4 2016, respectively, representing a decrease of 27% year over year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating income was $1,948 million, reflecting a decline of 22% as compared to $2,482 million in YTD 2016 The decreases in operating income for both periods primarily resulted from the net effect of lower OCF, as further described below, and for the twelve-month comparison, a decline in depreciation and amortization. The declines in OCF and depreciation and amortization were primarily attributable to the fact that our Netherlands segment is not included in our 2017 consolidated results\nOperating Cash Flow Highlights\nThe following table presents (i) OCF of each of our consolidated reportable segments for the comparative periods, and (ii) the percentage change from period to period on both a reported and rebased basis:\nThree months ended Increase/(decrease) Year ended Increase/(decrease) December 31, December 31, OCF 2017 2016 % Rebased % 2017 2016 % Rebased % in millions, except % amounts U.K./Ireland $ 815.0 $ 724.8 12.4 5.2 $ 2,894.5 $ 2,930.9 (1.2 ) 3.6 Belgium 327.3 281.2 16.4 4.9 1,299.7 1,173.4 10.8 6.1 Germany 460.1 398.7 15.4 5.6 1,700.3 1,586.4 7.2 4.9 Switzerland/Austria 260.0 274.2 (5.2 ) (8.0 ) 1,054.3 1,069.3 (1.4 ) (2.3 ) Central and Eastern Europe 144.7 125.6 15.2 3.4 516.2 471.5 9.5 5.4 The Netherlands — 365.2 (100.0 ) N.M. — 1,472.7 (100.0 ) N.M. Central and Corporate (95.2 ) (134.2 ) (29.1 ) 12.3 (379.4 ) (540.5 ) (29.8 ) 11.4 Total $ 1,911.9 $ 2,035.5 (6.1 ) 4.3 $ 7,085.6 $ 8,163.7 (13.2 ) 4.5 OCF Margin 47.9 % 48.3 % 47.1 % 47.2 % N.M. - Not Meaningful\nReported OCF for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, declined 6% and 13% year-over-year, respectively These results were primarily driven by the net impact of (i) the deconsolidation of our operations in the Netherlands, (ii) organic OCF growth and (iii) the aforementioned impact of FX movements Rebased OCF growth of 4% and 4.5% in Q4 and full-year 2017, respectively, included: The net unfavorable impact on our revenue of certain items, as discussed in the \"Revenue Highlights\" section above An unfavorable $11 million (Q4) and $34 million (full year) network tax increase following an April 1, 2017 increase in the rateable value of our existing U.K. and Irish networks A favorable $10 million (Q4) and $42 million (full year) benefit associated with a telecom operator's agreement to compensate Virgin Media for prior-period contractual breaches related to network charges A favorable $13 million benefit in both the Q4 and full-year period due to our decision to issue Liberty Global shares to satisfy a portion of our 2017 annual incentive compensation A $6 million headwind from the settlement of an operational contingency in the U.K. during Q1 2016 As compared to the prior-year periods, our Q4 and full-year 2017 OCF margins were down 30 and 10 basis points to 47.9% and 47.1%, respectively. Our OCF margins during the 2017 periods were negatively impacted by the deconsolidation of the Netherlands\nQ4 2017 Rebased Operating Cash Flow Growth - Segment Highlights\nU.K./Ireland: Rebased OCF growth of 5% reflects the net effect of (i) revenue growth, (ii) higher handset and programming costs, (iii) increased network taxes, (iv) the aforementioned compensation for prior-period contractual breaches related to network charges and (v) lower marketing spend Belgium: Rebased OCF growth of 5% in Q4, largely driven by the net effect of (i) lower MVNO costs (migrating subscribers to our own mobile network), (ii) higher network related costs and (iii) lower integration costs associated with the BASE acquisition Germany: Increased OCF by 6% in Q4 on a rebased basis, primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in revenue, (ii) lower SG&A costs, primarily due to lower spend for marketing and advertising, (iii) higher direct costs, due to higher programming and copyright cost and interconnect and access cost and (iv) lower indirect costs, due to the net effect of higher outsourced call center costs, lower bad debt expense and lower staff-related costs. Growth was adversely impacted by the aforementioned loss of analog carriage fees, which reduced OCF by approximately $7 million in Q4 Switzerland/Austria: Rebased OCF declined 8% in Q4, primarily due to continuing competition and an increase in the net expenses associated with the MySports Platform. These net expenses are more heavily weighted to the first and fourth quarters of the year CEE: Rebased OCF grew by 3% in Q4, largely driven by the aforementioned revenue growth, partially offset by higher direct and staff-related costs\nNet Earnings (Loss) Attributable to Liberty Global Shareholders\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Liberty Global shareholders (including discontinued operations) were ($992 million) and $2,223 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and ($2,778 million) and $1,705 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively\nLeverage and Liquidity\nTotal capital leases and principal amount of third-party debt: $42.4 billion Leverage ratios: Our adjusted gross and net leverage ratios at December 31, 2017 were 5.1x and 4.9x, respectively Average debt tenor : Nearly 8 years, with ~88% not due until 2021 or beyond Borrowing costs: Blended fully-swapped borrowing cost of our third-party debt was 4.2% Liquidity: $4.9 billion, including (i) $1.7 billion of cash at December 31, 2017 and (ii) aggregate unused borrowing capacity 15 under our credit facilities of $3.2 billion\nForward-Looking Statements and Disclaimer\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements with respect to our strategies, future growth prospects and opportunities; expectations with respect to our OCF growth, as well as OCF results in Switzerland, our Adjusted FCF and our P&E additions, including P&E additions attributable to new build and upgrades; expectations with respect to the development, enhancement and deployment of our innovative and advanced products and services, including WiFi Connect and V6 set-top boxes at Virgin Media; expectations with respect to our new MVNO arrangement in Switzerland; expectations regarding our share buyback program; the strength of our balance sheet and tenor of our third-party debt; and other information and statements that are not historical fact.

We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\nNothing in this press release constitutes an offer of any securities for sale.\nBalance Sheets, Statements of Operations and Statements of Cash Flows\nThe consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows of Liberty Global are in our 10-K.\nRebase Information\nFor purposes of calculating rebased growth rates on a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned during 2017, we have adjusted our historical revenue and OCF for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 to (i) include the pre-acquisition revenue and OCF of certain entities acquired during 2016 and 2017 in our rebased amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 to the same extent that the revenue and OCF of such entities are included in our results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, (ii) exclude the revenue and OCF of Ziggo Group Holding and a sports channel that were contributed to the VodafoneZiggo JV at the end of December 31, 2016, (iii) include revenue for the framework services agreement with the VodafoneZiggo JV and certain associated operating and SG&A expenses that had been allocated to our Netherlands segment during the 2016 periods in our rebased amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 as if the framework services agreement had been in place at the beginning of 2016, (iv) exclude the revenue and OCF of multi-channel multi-point (microwave) distribution system subscribers in Ireland that have disconnected since we announced the switch-off of this service effective April 2016 for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the same extent that the revenue and OCF of these subscribers is excluded from our results for the year ended December 31, 2017 (v) exclude the revenue and OCF of two small disposals made in Belgium during Q1 2017 to the same extent that the revenue and OCF of these disposed businesses is excluded from our results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and (vi) reflect the translation of our rebased amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. We have included SFR and three small entities in whole or in part in the determination of our rebased revenue and OCF for the three months ended December 31, 2016. We have included SFR, BASE and four small entities in whole or in part in the determination of our rebased revenue and OCF for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have reflected the revenue and OCF of the acquired entities in our 2016 rebased amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us (generally pre-acquisition financial statements), as adjusted for the estimated effects of (a) any significant differences between U.S. GAAP and local generally accepted accounting principles, (b) any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments, (c) any significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and (d) other items we deem appropriate. We do not adjust pre-acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post-acquisition periods. As we did not own or operate the acquired businesses during the pre-acquisition periods, no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present the revenue and OCF of these entities on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post-acquisition amounts that are included in our historical results or that the pre-acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors. The adjustments reflected in our rebased amounts have not been prepared with a view towards complying with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. In addition, the rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and OCF that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and OCF that will occur in the future. The rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis, and are not presented as a measure of our pro forma financial performance.\nThe following table provides adjustments made to the 2016 amounts to derive our rebased growth rates:\nRevenue OCF Three months\nended\nDecember 31,\nFull year ended\nDecember 31,\nThree months\nended\nDecember 31,\nFull year ended\nDecember 31,\n2016 2016 2016 2016 in millions Acquisitions $ 57.6 $ 291.2 $ 35.2 $ 137.9 Contribution of Ziggo Group Holding to\nthe VodafoneZiggo JV and other\ndispositions (i)\n(674.4 ) (2,741.6 ) (362.7 ) (1,478.4 ) Foreign Currency 275.0 (127.5 ) 125.9 (45.6 ) Total decrease $ (341.8 ) $ (2,577.9 ) $ (201.6 ) $ (1,386.1 ) (i) In connection with the December 31, 2016 closing of the VodafoneZiggo JV transaction, we entered into a framework services agreement that provides for the terms under which we provide services to the VodafoneZiggo JV. These adjustments to revenue and OCF are net of $34 million and $131 million of revenue for Q4 and full-year 2016, respectively, that we assumed would have been earned if the framework services agreement had been in place on January 1, 2016.

(ii) The capital expenditures that we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed under vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these expenditures are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered, and as repayments of debt when the related principal is repaid.

(ii) Our Internet Subscribers exclude 39,100 digital subscriber line (“DSL”) subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 83,900 subscribers who have requested and received this service. (iii) Our Telephony Subscribers exclude 30,000 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 131,000 subscribers who have requested and received this service. (iv) In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2017, our mobile subscriber count included 515,200 and 514,300 prepaid mobile subscribers in Belgium and the U.K., respectively. (v) Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2017, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 138,100 Cable Customer Relationships, 315,800 RGUs, 113,700 Enhanced Video Subscribers, 116,000 Internet Subscribers, and 86,100 Telephony Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations. Due to the fact that we do not own these partner networks, we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks. Additional General Notes to Tables:\nMost of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from SOHO subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our B2B SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.\nIn Germany, homes passed reflect the footprint and two-way homes passed reflect the technological capability of our network up to the street cabinet, with drops from the street cabinet to the building generally added, and in-home wiring generally upgraded, on an as needed or success-based basis. In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term capital lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet's owned and leased networks.\nWhile we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.\nSubscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.\nFootnotes\n1 The former LiLAC Group has been treated as a discontinued operation and accordingly, the information in this release focuses only on our continuing operations unless otherwise noted. For additional information, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 10-K. 2 The indicated growth rates are rebased for acquisitions, dispositions and FX. Please see Rebase Information for information on rebased growth. 3 Please see Glossary for our Operating Cash Flow (\"OCF\") definition and the required reconciliations. 4 Please see Glossary for information on Adjusted Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) and the required reconciliations. For more detailed information concerning our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in our 10-K. 5 Total B2B includes subscription (SOHO) and non-subscription revenue. B2B and SOHO growth rates include upsell from our residential businesses. 6 Please see Glossary for the definition of RGUs. Organic figures exclude RGUs of acquired entities at the date of acquisition and other nonorganic adjustments, but include the impact of changes in RGUs from the date of acquisition. All subscriber/RGU additions or losses refer to net organic changes, unless otherwise noted. 7 For purposes of measuring our rebased OCF growth in 2018, our 2017 OCF will be rebased to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance that we will begin applying on January 1, 2018. For additional information, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 10-K. 8 Based on FX rates as of February 13, 2018. New build and upgrade spend excludes related CPE. 9 For purposes of calculating our average tenor, total third-party debt excludes vendor financing. 10 Liquidity refers to cash and cash equivalents plus the maximum undrawn commitments under subsidiary borrowing facilities, without regard to covenant compliance calculations. 11 Includes subscription and non-subscription revenue. For additional information regarding how we define our revenue categories, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 10-K. 12 Our gross and net debt ratios are defined as total debt and net debt to annualized OCF of the latest quarter. Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. For purposes of these calculations, debt is measured using swapped foreign currency rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements, and excludes the loans backed or secured by the shares we hold in ITV plc, Sumitomo Corporation and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. 13 As we no longer consolidate the Netherlands effective December 31, 2016, we have removed the Netherlands from certain information presented for periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2016 to enhance comparability. 14 On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired Telenet Group BVBA (\"BASE\"). 15 Our aggregate unused borrowing capacity of $3.2 billion represents the maximum undrawn commitments under our subsidiaries' applicable facilities without regard to covenant compliance calculations. Upon completion of the relevant December 31, 2017 compliance reporting requirements for our credit facilities, and assuming no further changes from quarter-end borrowing levels, we anticipate that our subsidiaries' borrowing capacity will remain at $3.2 billion. Glossary\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow: net cash provided by our operating activities, plus (i) cash payments for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions and (ii) expenses financed by an intermediary, less (a) capital expenditures, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, (b) principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and (c) principal payments on capital leases (exclusive of the portions of the network lease in Belgium and the duct leases in Germany that we assumed in connection with certain acquisitions), with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. We believe that our presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, which are not deducted to arrive at this amount. Investors should view Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We changed our definition of adjusted free cash flow effective January 1, 2017 to remove the add-back of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. This change, which was given effect for all periods presented, was made to accommodate our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, pursuant to which we retrospectively revised the presentation of our consolidated statements of cash flows to remove the operating cash outflows and financing cash inflows associated with excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The following table provides the reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the indicated periods:\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 in millions Net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations $ 1,494.6 $ 1,653.7 $ 5,134.6 $ 5,471.7 Cash payments for direct acquisition and disposition costs 1.8 2.5 8.7 29.3 Expenses financed by an intermediary (i) 439.8 206.1 1,506.9 812.0 Capital expenditures (575.7 ) (551.4 ) (1,953.1 ) (2,153.9 ) Principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (496.5 ) (278.5 ) (3,059.3 ) (2,074.7 ) Principal payments on certain capital leases (19.9 ) (23.3 ) (86.6 ) (105.5 ) Adjusted FCF $ 844.1 $ 1,009.1 $ 1,551.2 $ 1,978.9",
