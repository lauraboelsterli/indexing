    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s annual inflation rate, which stayed above 3 percent each month last year, likely cooled to 2.9 percent in January, a Reuters poll showed.\nHeadline inflation MYCPI=ECI came down after hitting an eight-year high of 5.1 percent in March 2017, but did not drop below 3 percent throughout the year. The December rate was 3.5 percent.\nThe last time the annual inflation rate was under 3 percent was December 2016, when it was 1.7 percent.\nMalaysia’s central bank raised its key interest rate MYINTR=ECI for the first time in three and a half years in January.\nInflation data for January was originally scheduled to be released on Feb. 21. The statistics department has not given a reason for the delay.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
