Slideshow (3 Images) Canada’s men had missed out on the final for the first time since the event was reintroduced to the Games in 1998 and their defeat followed the failure of the Canadian women’s team to win a medal for the first time since 1998. Switzerland’s triumph matched their third place from 2010. Sweden will play the United States in the final on Saturday with both seeking to win gold for the first time.
