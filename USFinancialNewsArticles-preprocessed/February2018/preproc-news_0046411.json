    "text": "ROCKVILLE, Md., Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NS2 Serves announced today that General (Ret.) John Campbell has been appointed to the role of Chairman of the program. The independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization was created to give back to the national security community by training and employing veterans in high-tech careers.\nThe move comes as the founding chairman of the program, Vice Admiral (Ret.) Joseph Kernan, was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate as Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in November 2017. VADM (Ret.) Kernan was instrumental in shaping the mission and objectives of the program to help transitioning veterans gain valuable technology certifications leading to long-lasting careers.\nIn his new role as Chairman of NS2 Serves, General (Ret.) John Campbell will look to continue impacting veterans and their families – aiding in the transition from military to civilian employment in high-tech.\n\"I am humbled and honored to have the opportunity to work with NS2 Serves as it truly makes a difference in the lives of the veterans that it touches. NS2 Serves enables veterans to learn skill sets that are absolutely game changers for them and their families\" said General Campbell. \"The passion and dedication of the folks from SAP NS2 that work tirelessly in this endeavor are inspiring to be around. I want to do all I can to help make a difference with our veterans.\"\nGeneral Campbell retired from the US Army on May 1 st , 2016, after 37 years of active duty service. He was most recently the Commander of NATO Forces for the ISAF/Resolute Support Mission and Commander of United States Forces—Afghanistan from August 2014 to March of 2016. Prior to this command assignment, he served as the 34th Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; the second highest ranking officer for 1.1 million in the US Army. Prior to serving as the Vice Chief, Campbell was the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations-G3, 5 and 7, running the day to day operations of the US Army.\nTo date, NS2 Serves has helped train and employ over 160 veterans. A new class of 20 veterans kicked off the spring session on February 19, taking place at the National Conference Center in Leesburg, VA. NS2 Serves will continue to grow in 2018 with additional classes planned for the summer and fall of 2018.
