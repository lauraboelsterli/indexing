    "text": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is considering declaring a state of emergency at the New York City Housing Authority over what his counsel called “intolerable” conditions in public housing.\nThe measure would come after more than 320,000 people have been left without heat or hot water this winter and following months of revelations that the housing authority had failed to conduct inspections for lead paint as required by federal rules and city law for four years.\n ",
