(NYSE: TSLX, or the “Company”) today reported net investment income of $26.9 million, or $0.45 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Net asset value per share was $16.09 at December 31, 2017 as compared to $16.09 at September 30, 2017. The Company’s Board of Directors previously declared a third quarter variable supplemental dividend of $0.06 per share and a fourth quarter base dividend of $0.39 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of November 30, 2017 and December 15, 2017, respectively, that was paid on December 29, 2017 and January 12, 2018, respectively.\nThe Company announced that its Board of Directors has declared a first quarter 2018 base dividend of $0.39 per share for stockholders of record as of March 15, 2018, payable on April 13, 2018. The Company’s Board of Directors also declared a fourth quarter variable supplemental dividend of $0.03 per share for stockholders of record as of February 28, 2018, payable on March 30, 2018.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors also approved an extension of its stock repurchase plan (“Company 10b5-1 Plan”) to acquire up to $50 million in the aggregate of TSLX’s common stock at prices just below TSLX’s net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Unless extended or terminated by its Board of Directors, the Company expects that the stock repurchase plan will be in effect through the earlier of August 31, 2018, or such time as the approved $50 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions. Under the Company 10b5-1 Plan, no shares were repurchased during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the terms of the amendment, aggregate commitments under the facility were increased to $990 million. With respect to $895 million in commitments, amounts drawn under the facility bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.75% or 1.875% and the stated maturity date has been extended to February 2023. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company may at any time determine to cancel the commitments that were not extended.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS: (amounts in millions, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended (unaudited) December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Investments at Fair Value $ 1,693.7 $ 1,550.3 $ 1,657.4 Total Assets $ 1,720.2 $ 1,581.1 $ 1,675.5 Net Asset Value Per Share $ 16.09 $ 16.09 $ 15.95 Variable Supplemental Dividend Per Share $ 0.03 $ 0.06 $ 0.00 Pro Forma Net Asset Value Per Share (1) $ 16.06 $ 16.03 $ 15.95 Investment Income $ 48.8 $ 52.3 $ 49.7 Net Investment Income $ 26.9 $ 30.9 $ 28.1 Net Income $ 26.7 $ 24.8 $ 32.7 Net Investment Income Per Share $ 0.45 $ 0.51 $ 0.47 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (and Losses) Per Share ($ 0.01 ) ($ 0.10 ) $ 0.08 Net Income Per Share $ 0.44 $ 0.41 $ 0.55 Weighted Average Yield of Debt and Income Producing Securities at Fair Value 10.7 %\n10.7 %\n10.4 %\nWeighted Average Yield of Debt and Income Producing Securities at Amortized Cost 10.8 %\n10.8 %\n10.4 %\nPercentage of Debt Investment Commitments at Floating Rates (2) 100.0 %\n100.0 %\n98.4 %\n(1)\nPro Forma Net Asset Value Per Share gives effect to the supplemental dividend declared related to earnings in the applicable period.\n(2)\nIncludes one or more fixed rate investments for which the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to swap to floating rate.\nConference Call and Webcast\nConference Call Information:\nThe conference call will be broadcast live at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on February 22, 2018.

This compares to $501.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $79.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, gross originations totaled $2,251.5 million. This compares to gross originations of $761.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company made new investment commitments of $296.7 million in five new portfolio companies and two existing portfolio companies. For this period, the Company had $136.4 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company made new investment commitments of $54.3 million in one new portfolio company and two existing portfolio companies. For this period, the Company had $56.8 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made new investment commitments of $1,072.6 million in 22 new portfolio companies and 12 existing portfolio companies. For this period, the Company had $951.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made new investment commitments of $562.7 million in 14 new portfolio companies and 9 existing portfolio companies. For this period, the Company had $416.5 million aggregate principal amount in exits and repayments.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the Company had investments in 45 and 44 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $1,693.7 million and $1,550.3 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the portfolio based on fair value consisted of 93.4% first-lien debt investments, 3.6% second-lien debt investments, and 3.0% equity and other investments. As of September 30, 2017, the portfolio based on fair value consisted of 93.2% first-lien debt investments, 4.0% second-lien debt investments, and 2.8% equity and other investments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of debt investments based on fair value in the portfolio bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 93.3% of these subject to interest rate floors. The Company’s credit facilities also bear interest at floating rates. In connection with the Company’s Convertible Senior Notes and 2023 Notes (issued in January 2018), which bear interest at fixed rates, the Company entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps in order to align the nature of the interest rates of its liabilities with its investment portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at fair value (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.7% and 10.7%, respectively, and the weighted average total yield of debt and income-producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.8% and 10.8%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 100% of the portfolio at fair value was meeting all payment and covenant requirements.\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nInvestment Income\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, investment income totaled $48.8 million and $49.7 million, respectively. The decrease in investment income was primarily driven by lower syndication and amendment fees, partially offset by higher accelerated amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees from unscheduled paydowns.\nExpenses\nNet expenses totaled $21.4 million and $21.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average 1-month LIBOR rate, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $6.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, total principal value of debt outstanding of $716.8 million, and $488.2 million of undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The Company’s weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 3.4% and 2.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nThe Company is rated BBB- with stable outlook by both Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor’s.\nFinancial Statements and Tables\nTPG Specialty Lending, Inc.
