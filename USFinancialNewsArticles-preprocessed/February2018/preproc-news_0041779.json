Sources had told Reuters in November that the company was considering a London listing to raise cash for a $1.5 billion development of the Karish and Tanin fields off Israelâ€™s coast. Energean, a private exploration and production company operating in the eastern Mediterranean, bought the Karish and Tanin licences in December 2016. Editing by Jason Neely",
