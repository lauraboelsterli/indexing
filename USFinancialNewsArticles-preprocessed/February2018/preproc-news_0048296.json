That’s what has given the market a reason to see a little bit of a positive futures,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York.\nBy 9:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 214.51 points, or 0.87 percent, at 25,012.29 and the S&P 500 rose 0.77 percent to 2,722.25. The two indexes were higher after two days of losses.\nThe Nasdaq Composite also gained 0.7 percent to trade at 7,268.93.\nDespite Fed’s hawkish views, bets on the U.S. short-term interest rate futures continued to reflect expectations of three rate hikes this year, based on a Reuters analysis.\nTraders also gave a 94 percent chance that the first hike would come in March.\nAll the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.5 percent gain in the telecom services index and a 0.9 percent rise in the energy index.\nChesapeake Energy was the top gainer, jumping 10.5 percent after the company said it expected production growth this year to match last year’s level, despite plans to lower capital investments.\nPandora Media reversed course to trade 8 percent lower as multiple brokerages slashed their price targets on the internet radio company’s stock following results.\nRoku slid more than 21 percent after the TV streaming device maker forecast current-quarter revenue below estimates.\nEconomic data showed U.S. jobless claims fell more-than-expected to a near 45-year low last week.\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims unchanged at 230,000 in the latest week.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,019 to 527. On the Nasdaq, 1,616 issues rose and 738 fell. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D‘Silva)\n ",
