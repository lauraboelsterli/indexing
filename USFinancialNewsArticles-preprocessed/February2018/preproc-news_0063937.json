    "text": "FAIRMONT, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, MVB Financial Corp. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: MVBF) reported net income of $7.6 million, or $0.69 and $0.68 basic and diluted earnings per share compared to $12.9 million, or $1.44 and $1.31 basic and diluted earnings per share respectively, for the same period in 2016.\n\"Three significant factors contributed to MVB's 2017 performance results compared to 2016. These were the $3.9 million after-tax gain on the asset sale of a wholly-owned subsidiary, MVB Insurance, in 2016; the $1.5 million decrease in net income within MVB Mortgage created by the continued market pressure within the mortgage industry; and a $646 thousand charge associated with the new tax law changes passed in late 2017; however, the tax law will generate a positive net income effect for us in 2018,\" said Larry F. Mazza, CEO and President, MVB Financial.\n“To this end, we strategically added positions to reinforce our sales Team efforts and to take advantage of disruptions in our markets due to recent M&A activity, especially in Northern Virginia. We are successfully recruiting some of the best talent in our markets because people are attracted to our entrepreneurial spirit, team culture and community focus. When the pain to stay the same is equal to the pain to make a job change, people are willing to make a move. With our listing on The Nasdaq, buzz is building around Team MVB.”\nApproximately 1.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock were issued from a capital raise completed in December 2016, and 434,783 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued from a rights offering completed in April 2017. These additional issued shares resulted in a $0.19 and $0.18 decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same time period in 2016, while a $4.7 million decrease in 2017 net income available to common shareholders versus 2016, resulted in the remaining $0.56 and $0.45 decrease in basic and dilutive earnings per share, respectively.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nMVB received approval in December 2017 to list its common stock for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market®. The listing marked a major milestone in MVB’s growth journey. Net interest income of $11.7 million increased $269 thousand, or 2.4% from September 30, 2017, and $858 thousand, or 7.9% from the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. Total assets saw steady growth and reached $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017, an 8.1% increase from December 31, 2016. Loans of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, increased $53.1 million, or 5.0% from December 31, 2016, and $11.5 million, or 1.0% from September 30, 2017. Deposits of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2017, increased $52.6 million, or 4.7% from December 31, 2016. Noninterest bearing deposit balances have grown to $126.0 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.3 million since December 31, 2016.\nWith the passage of tax reform in December 2017, MVB expects to see benefits and to share tax savings with Team MVB and the communities in its footprint. During fourth quarter 2017, MVB approved the hiring of 31 new Team members for 2018 and the opening of additional branches in Northern Virginia.\nDemonstrating its commitment to community development, MVB made a $2 million initial investment in the creation of a Community Development Corporation (\"CDC\"), which started full operations in the fourth quarter, including establishing its initial Board of Directors.\n“Led by its President Herman DeProspero, the CDC will play an integral role in our commitment to the economic welfare of our communities,” Mazza said.\nFINANCIAL DETAILS\nLoans totaled $1.106 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $53.1 million, or 5.0% from December 31, 2016, and $11.5 million, or 1.0% from September 30, 2017. The total loan growth was less than originally anticipated for the year caused primarily by management taking direct action to diversify lending to reduce commercial real estate concentration levels coupled with a 63% increase in commercial loan payoffs.\nIn comparison to the December 31, 2016, deposit balance of $1.107 billion, deposits increased $52.6 million, or 4.7%. Noninterest bearing deposit balances rose to $126.0 million, or 10.9% of the total deposit base as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $10.3 million, or 8.9% since December 31, 2016, and $4.4 million since September 30, 2017.\nNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.7 million, an increase of $269 thousand, or 2.4% from September 30, 2017, and $858 thousand, or 7.9% from the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.29%, a decrease of 8 basis points from September 30, 2017, and an increase of 6 basis points versus the quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.27%. The full year increase in net interest margin was the result of a 12 basis point increase in earning assets due to higher yields.\nInterest expense increased 5.8% during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10.5% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same time period in 2016, due to an 11 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Increased interest rates and an emphasis on loan yields helped to increase net interest income, despite increases in interest expense. Additionally, the flattened yield curve placed pressure on net interest margin earned from our mortgage operations as the cost of short-term borrowings to fund the mortgage business increased, while the yield from loans held for sale remained flat, consistent with the 30-year Treasury bond rates.\nProvision for loan loss was $2.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017, a $1.5 million decrease from the same time period in 2016, despite a 5.0% increase in loans. The substantial decline of average historical loss rates and a $1.1 million decline in charge-offs contributed to the decrease in provision for 2017. Specific loan loss allocations increased by $645 thousand in 2017 compared to a $470 thousand decrease in 2016. Nonperforming loans increased $3.5 million, to 0.88% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. In addition, charge-offs for 2017 decreased $1.1 million compared to 2016, resulting in an annualized net loan charge-offs to total loans ratio of 0.13% as of December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.2 million, flat from September 30, 2017, and an increase of $91 thousand from the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the full year of 2017, noninterest income was $40.7 million, a decrease of $2.5 million from the same period in 2016. The year over year decrease was primarily the result of a $4.2 million decrease in gain on derivatives, primarily the result of a 39.0% decrease in the locked mortgage pipeline for the full year 2017 compared to a 31.6% increase in the locked mortgage pipeline for the full year 2016. In addition, mortgage production volume decreased $102.2 million or 6.2% for the full year 2017 versus the same time period in 2016. Excluding the decrease in gain on derivatives, noninterest income for the full year of 2017 increased $1.7 million, mostly due to increases in mortgage fee income, commercial swap fee income and other operating income. Gain on sale of securities and gain on sale of portfolio loans decreased $351 thousand and $504 thousand respectively, for the full year of 2017 in comparison to 2016.\nNoninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.7 million, a decrease of $252 thousand, or 1.4% from September 30, 2017, and an increase of $900 thousand, or 5.4% from the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. For the full year of 2017, noninterest expense was $70.5 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 1.9% from the same period in 2016.\nA $951 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment costs for the full year of 2017 relates to the two new, high technology MVB branches opened during the third quarter of 2017 and a continued focus and investment in client-friendly technology. To control expenses, two branches in Martinsburg, W.Va., were consolidated in December 2017 due to their proximity.\nThe Company continues to tightly manage expenses and maximize resources to expand revenues and invest in the future. Data processing and communications for the full year of 2017 increased only $152 thousand compared to the same period in 2016, despite $520 thousand in additional expense related to a core system conversion in the second quarter of 2017. Additionally, salary and employee benefits decreased $1.1 million, or 2.5% for the full year of 2017 in comparison to 2016, primarily due to a decrease in mortgage production volume of 6.2% over the same period.\nAs previously announced, on November 22, 2017, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2, 2017, payable December 15, 2017. This was the fourth quarterly dividend for 2017 and was equal to the March, June and September 2017 payouts of $0.025 per share. The cash dividend of $0.10 for the full year 2017, increased $0.025, or 25% compared to the same time period in 2016.\nAbout MVB Financial Corp.\nMVB Financial Corp.
