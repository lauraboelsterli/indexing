    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SouthCrest Bank (SCSG:PK), announces the appointment of Rhonda Grimes as Vice President and Manager of the new SouthCrest Bank Branch in Fayetteville, GA, which is set to open March 12.\nThe addition of Grimes to SouthCrest’s team of veteran bankers and establishment of the Fayetteville Branch are key elements in the company’s continued strategy to become a dominant provider of commercial banking services in the 13-county Metro Atlanta SMSA.\n“Research has shown that for those important monetary life events like buying a home, starting a business, addressing critical bank account needs and even for opening a new bank account, people prefer the reassurance of a face to face meeting with a bank representative over transacting online,” commented Grimes.\n“Our goal is for the new SouthCrest Bank branch to become an integral part of the Fayetteville community,” says Grimes. “Our branch will offer clients a more personal banking relationship experience. At SouthCrest, they will find we are there to help them meet their financial goals and needs.”\nGrimes, a Fayette County resident for more than 15 years, began her banking career as a teller 20 years ago and has steadily advanced. Happily married for 22 years to husband Robert, they have two children, Raven and Robert Jr.\nABOUT SOUTHCREST BANK\nSouthCrest Financial Group, Inc. is a bank holding company with over half a billion dollars in assets, headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The company operates a 9-branch network throughout Georgia through its subsidiary bank, SouthCrest Bank, N.A.
