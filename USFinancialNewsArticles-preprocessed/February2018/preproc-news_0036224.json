    "text": "Alexandria, VA, Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sector 5, Inc. a Nevada Corporation (OTCQB: SFIV) today announced that Erick Kuvshinikov, as the new Chief Executive Officer. The new executive appointment is effective immediately.\nAs an international entrepreneur and business leader, Mr. Kuvshinikov brings more than 22 years of manufacturing and IT management and marketing experience to Sector 5.\nWe feel Erick is exactly the right leader for Sector 5. With his extensive diverse background and vision, we are confident Sector 5 will grow. His strong management experience will help shape Sector 5 as we continue our growth domestically and internationally.\nPrior to his appointment, Erick worked directly with clients from diverse backgrounds in retail, wholesale, business to business. His goal is to instill trust and confidence in Sector 5 products. Erick earned a B.S. degree in Computer Science & Business from Pepperdine University. He began his career as a senior marketing director for a Southern California Furniture Company and was instrumental in developing brand awareness and international trade deals with Chinese companies. Because of his computer science background and business knowhow carried his knowledge into the technical field while assisting local Southern California IT companies. During his time supporting companies in the IT field he received not only his license as a Real Estate Sales Associate, but also his license as a Real Estate Broker, at Realty Works Temecula, California.\nErick Kuvshinikov, CEO, stated, “We want to specifically utilize our relationships with Google to capture a rising market share. New technology is fundamental to the growth of our company. We must make clientele knowledgeable about not only the hardware they are able to acquire, but the software that supports it. Potential customers are unaware of the capabilities that are possible with our units. We will utilize our relationship with Google to make sure that individuals, students, and companies that want our products have access to the training and customer service they deserve. The power to unify and incorporate all of your needed information is essential in today’s moving classrooms and economy. People, schools, & businesses have to be made aware of what can be accomplished through our devices. Not only that, the ease of use must be stressed and advocated. A large portion of people want simple, they don’t want technical if they don’t have too. It’s nice to know it’s there if needed, but the simple solution will allow our customers to get more accomplished from hour to hour.”\nSector 5 is committed to excellence. It is continually negotiating contracts, sales, & securing new sales agents to further its operations. The Sector 5 brand is not only at the forefront of new innovation, but we are continually looking to grow our product awareness in all aspects of retail. With our relationships, we strive to become a household name in U.S. & international markets.
