Adams brings deep expertise in leading fast-growing private and public companies, and will be responsible for attracting and retaining the best talent in enterprise software while preserving and shaping a culture that encourages employee and business growth.\nWith more than 20 years of experience, Adams has devoted her career to building high-performing organizations across technology verticals. During a 14-year tenure at Cisco that saw exponential growth, her team hired more than 40,000 people in 152 countries as the company expanded from 3,800 to 70,000+ employees while revenues jumped from $2.2B to $40B+. After Cisco, Adams joined Allscripts, where she supported the company as it tripled from 2,000 to 7,000 employees by investing in robust leadership and development, employee communication, and philanthropy programs. Adams went on to serve as Chief People Officer at Qlik, one of the fastest-growing technology companies in the world, and was, most recently, Chief Culture and Talent Officer for McGraw-Hill Education.\nAs Sprinklr’s Chief Culture and Talent Officer, Adams will focus on ensuring that the company’s values and culture drive corporate and individual success. She will also help implement concepts laid out in her book, “ It Takes More than Casual Fridays and Free Coffee ,” which explains how people and companies can recognize opportunities to engage and energize their teams, develop creative strategies to meet changing market requirements, and build high-performing cultures.\nThe addition of Adams to Sprinklr’s executive team follows a number of milestones for the company in the past year, including:\nHired Luca Lazzaron as its first CRO and welcomed John Chambers , CEO of JC2 Ventures and former Executive Chairman & CEO of Cisco, to Sprinklr’s Board of Directors. Expanded its social channel partner ecosystem and grew Sprinklr’s global reach with first-of-its-kind",
