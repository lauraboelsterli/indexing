    "text": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - Compass Group Plc, the world’s biggest catering firm, said it expected full-year organic revenue growth to be at the higher end of its forecast, helped by continued strength in North America and better-than-expected performance in Europe.\nCompass, which provides meals for office workers, armed forces and school children around the world, said its organic revenue growth would be above the middle of its 4-6 percent target range.\nOrganic revenue grew 5.9 percent in the three months to Dec. 31, it said.\nThe company’s long-time Chief Executive Richard Cousins, who said in September he would step down from the top job, died in a seaplane crash on New Year’s eve, forcing Compass to advance the date Dominic Blakemore would start as CEO to Jan. 1.
