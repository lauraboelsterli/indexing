We have found that and more with Andy, who brings a wealth of both domestic and international experience, and we are incredibly excited to have him leading the DiversiTech team.”\nMr. Bergdoll commented, “It’s an honor to be joining DiversiTech as CEO. The company has an impressive history of delivering innovative products and solutions and outstanding service to its customers, and I am eager to work alongside the team to build on its market-leading position in the HVACR industry. I am excited to bring my experience building customer-centric innovation and service-oriented businesses to DiversiTech and to lead the next stage of the company’s growth.”\nMr. Coyle continued, “I want to thank Jon Evans, Chief Operations Officer, Nicole Kroner, Chief Financial Officer, and Bud Sjogren, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, for their steady and strong guidance of the Company over the past few months. Under their leadership, the Company continued to execute brilliantly, completing 2017 with impressive revenue growth of 13%. With the addition of Andy – following our two most recent hires, Dan McInerney as Vice President, Logistics and Ted Zerafa as Vice President, Global Sourcing – our Board is confident that DiversiTech’s team is stronger than ever and well-equipped to seize the tremendous opportunities ahead.”\nIn his previous role leading the US business at WESCO International, Mr. Bergdoll was responsible for a portfolio of businesses with approximately 5,000 sales, service, technical and administrative associates across 300 locations. Prior to WESCO, he served as President and CEO of Liberty Wire & Cable (which was acquired by WESCO in 2007) where he drove significant top- and bottom-line growth, while scaling operations. He has also held various leadership positions at Veolia Environment, US Filter, Booz Allen Hamilton, and General Electric. Mr. Bergdoll holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Lehigh University and an MBA in Industrial Administration from Carnegie Mellon University.\nThe Company also announced today that Wayne Hewett will be joining Bill Tolley, former Senior Vice President of Growth & Innovation at Hubbell Inc., as a Non-Executive Director, and will also serve as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.
