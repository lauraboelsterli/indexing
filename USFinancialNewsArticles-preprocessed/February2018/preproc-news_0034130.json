(NASDAQ: BIVV) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nKey financial results include:\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues of $328.7 million, up 28.3% year-over-year Fourth quarter 2017 revenues increased $37.1 million over third quarter 2017, up 12.7% Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income of $141.3 million; Non-GAAP net income of $103.3 million Full year 2017 GAAP tax rate of 21.3%; Non-GAAP tax rate of 34.3%\n“We are proud of our accomplishments in 2017. We increased our market leadership position in the extended half-life market with our products ELOCTATE® and ALPROLIX® and grew revenue by 32% year-over-year. We built a robust clinical stage pipeline by advancing internal assets such as BIVV001 into a Phase 1/2a clinical trial, which is progressing with patients being dosed. We acquired True North Therapeutics and have initiated our Phase 3 registrational trials for BIVV009 in cold agglutinin disease,” said John Cox, Chief Executive Officer of Bioverativ.\n“As we look toward 2018 and our future, Sanofi brings proven capabilities and a global infrastructure, which we believe will help to rapidly expand access to our medicines globally and further our mission of transforming the lives of people with rare blood disorders. Since its inception, I strongly believed Bioverativ would create meaningful value for shareholders. Our transaction with Sanofi delivers tremendous value for those who have invested in and supported our mission,” continued Mr. Cox.\nRevenue Highlights\n(In millions, except percentages) Q4 ‘17 Q3 ‘17 Q4 ‘16 Q4 ‘17\nv.\nQ3 ‘17 Q4 ‘17\nv.\nQ4 ‘16 FY ‘17 FY ‘16 FY ’17\nv.\nFY ‘16 ELOCTATE $ 208.0 $ 186.3 $ 148.7 11.6 % 39.9 % $ 724.5 $ 513.0 41.2 % ALPROLIX $ 100.4 $ 88.5 $ 93.1 13.4 % 7.8 % $ 364.6 $ 333.6 9.3 % Total Product Revenues $ 308.4 $ 274.8 $ 241.8 12.2 % 27.5 % $ 1,089.1 $ 846.6 28.6 % Collaboration Revenues $ 20.3 $ 16.8 $ 14.4 20.8 % 41.0 % $ 79.4 $ 40.8 94.6 % Total Revenues $ 328.7 $ 291.6 $ 256.2 12.7 % 28.3 % $ 1,168.5 $ 887.4 31.7 % Note: Percent changes represented as increase & (decrease)\nIn the US, product revenues grew 26.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 12.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Product revenues outside the US grew 30.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 9.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nELOCTATE remained on a strong trajectory due to high patient retention, continued capture of patients switching to long-acting therapies, and the market trend towards prophylactic treatment.\nALPROLIX volume increased despite competition due to growing understanding and appreciation for safety and efficacy data as well as increased protection and dosing education.\nCollaboration revenues from Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi™) grew $3.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to increased royalty revenue driven by increased sales and new country launches within Sobi’s territory as well as higher contract manufacturing revenue.\nFull year 2017 product revenues grew 27.0% in the US and 37.5% outside the US compared to 2016. Revenue growth was largely attributed to captured market share from short acting factor therapies, increased prophylactic adoption among appropriate patients, and low discontinuation rates.\nExpense Highlights\nGAAP (In millions, except percentages)\nQ4 ‘17 Q3 ‘17 Q4 ‘16 Q4 ‘17\nv.\nQ3 ‘17 Q4 ‘17\nv.\nQ4 ‘16 FY ‘17 FY ‘16 FY ’17 v.

Cost of sales grew $4.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2017 due to increased volume sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX and increased royalties paid to Sobi. Full year 2017 cost of sales grew $41.7 million compared to full year 2016 as volume growth in the US, Japan, and Canada, higher contract manufacturing and royalties paid to Sobi were partially offset by impairment charges associated with the 2016 shutdown of a Biogen Cambridge manufacturing facility, lower inventory write-offs, and prior period allocations.\nResearch and development expenses increased $20.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as costs associated with BIVV009 registrational Phase 3 clinical trials as well as a buyout of royalty and development milestones to a third party associated with BIVV001/BIVV002 were partially offset by lower prior period allocations. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, research and development expenses increased $13.8 million due largely to the BIVV001 clinical manufacturing campaign. Full year 2017 research and development costs rose $14.5 million compared to 2016 as pipeline development for multiple programs offset prior period allocations.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses rose $23.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as an increase in workforce expenses and higher fees and services offset prior period allocations. Compared to the third quarter of 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses grew $4.4 million primarily due to increased fees and services offset by higher workforce expenses. Full year 2017 selling, general and administrative costs rose $70.1 million over 2016 due to the acquisition of True North Therapeutics, increased workforce expenses, and increased fees and services.\nNon-GAAP\n(In millions, except percentages)\nQ4 '17\nQ3 '17\nQ4 '16\nQ4 '17\nv.\nQ3 '17\nQ4 '17\nv.\nQ4 '16\nFY '17\nFY '16\nFY '17 v.

Full year 2017 cost of sales rose $89.2 million compared to 2016. Non-GAAP adjustments for fourth quarter 2017 cost of sales totaled $1.4 million.\nResearch and development expenses increased $4.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Full year 2017 research and development costs decreased $16.0 million compared to 2016 due to prior period allocations. Non-GAAP adjustments for fourth quarter 2017 research and development costs totaled $19.0 million, the most significant of which were a buyout of royalty and development milestones to a third party associated with BIVV001/BIVV002 and a remeasurement of the contingent consideration owed to former equity holders of True North Therapeutics.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses rose $14.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Full year 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses grew $19.7 million compared to 2016. Non-GAAP adjustments for fourth quarter 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $10.7 million primarily due to equity based compensation and spin-related costs.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial results can be found in Table 5 at the end of this release.\nTax\nThe company’s GAAP effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was (18.9%). This compares to GAAP effective income tax rate of (169.6%) for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The difference from the prior year was primarily due to the realization of deferred tax assets resulting from net losses and business credit carryforwards in 2016 as well as the passage of tax reform in December 2017. The company’s GAAP effective income tax rates for full years ending 2017 and 2016 were 21.3% and (50.6%), respectively.\nAdjusting for the realization of deferred tax assets, net losses, and business credit carryforwards in 2016 as well as the impact of recently passed tax reform legislation on net deferred tax liabilities in 2017, the non-GAAP tax rates for full years ending 2017 and 2016 were 34.3% and 34.1%, respectively.\nCash Position\nAs of December 31, 2017, Bioverativ had $436.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.\nRecent Corporate Events\nOn January 22, 2018 it was announced Bioverativ and Sanofi entered into a definitive agreement under which Sanofi will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bioverativ for $105 per share in cash. Presented a wide breadth of data at the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition from December 9-12, 2017, including Phase 1b safety and efficacy results on BIVV009, its first-in-class monoclonal antibody in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAgD); data from the largest natural history study of CAgD, which quantified the risk of life-threatening thromboemobolic events associated with the disease; results from a preclinical imaging study demonstrating that ALPROLIX had higher tissue distribution and retention in joints compared with other factor IX molecules, data on weekly prophylactic dosing with ELOCTATE in people with hemophilia A, and dosing every 14 or more days with ALPROLIX in people with severe hemophilia B. Announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated labeling for ALPROLIX that further supported the long-term efficacy and safety profile of the product and included the addition of pediatric data showing that prophylactic treatment with ALPROLIX results in effective bleed protection with extended dosing intervals. Published interim data in collaboration with Sobi™ of results from a longitudinal study showing improvements in long-term joint health for hemophilia A patients following prophylactic treatment with ELOCTATE. This was the first study to demonstrate continuous improvement in joint health with an extended half-life factor therapy and positive results were seen in study participants regardless of prior treatment regimen, severity of damage or target joints.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe company will not be conducting an earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nAbout Bioverativ\nBioverativ (NASDAQ: BIVV) is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia and other rare blood disorders through world-class research, development and commercialization of innovative therapies.

We believe that the disclosure of these Non-GAAP financial measures provides additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and forms the basis of our management incentive programs. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, financial measures.\nOur Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items from reported GAAP financial measures:\n1. Share-Based Compensation Expense\nWe exclude the costs associated with incentive stock and employee stock purchase plans we maintain for the benefit of our officers, directors, and employees. For the periods prior to February 1, 2017, our share based compensation expense was derived solely from equity awards granted by Biogen to the company’s employees. Share-based compensation expense subsequent to the separation relates to equity awards granted under our share-based plans to our officers, directors, and employees including those awards that converted from Biogen.\n2. Amortization of Developed Technology Intangible Assets\nWe exclude the amortization of intangible assets to facilitate an evaluation of current and past operating performance, particularly in terms of cash returns, and is similar to how management internally assesses performance. The developed technology intangibles primarily relate to approval milestones for ALPROLIX paid to the former Syntonix shareholders.\n3. Biogen Cambridge Manufacturing Facility Shutdown\nWe exclude costs associated with Biogen’s Cambridge manufacturing facility shutdown, which was primarily dedicated to hemophilia manufacturing. On December 31, 2016, the facility was subleased by Brammer Bio, LLC and is no longer used for hemophilia manufacturing. Management believes these costs are not representative of our ongoing operating results.\n4. Tax-Related Items\nWe had established a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 given our cumulative losses and uncertainty about our cost structure as a standalone company. During 2016, we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable and released our valuation allowance. Management believes the release of the valuation allowance is not representative of our ongoing operating results. On December 22, 2017, the US government enacted comprehensive tax legislation which reduces the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. Consequently, we have recorded a one-time decrease related to our net deferred tax liabilities with a corresponding net deferred income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n5. Spin-Related Costs\nIn connection with our separation from Biogen, we have incurred certain separation related expenses, which management believes are not representative of our ongoing operations.\n6. Upfront and Milestone Payments\nWe exclude costs associated with upfront and milestone payments relating to collaborative arrangements as management believes these costs are uncertain, result in different payment and expense recognition patterns than internal R&D activities, and are not representative of our ongoing operating results.\n7. Acquisition-Related Costs\nIn connection with our acquisition of True North Therapeutics, we have incurred certain acquisition related expenses, which management believes are not representative of our ongoing operations. These expenses include banker, legal, tax, and other expenses. In addition, we exclude costs associated with quarterly remeasurement of contingent consideration.\n8. Sanofi Acquisition\nIn connection with our pending acquisition by Sanofi we have incurred certain acquisition related expenses, which management believes are not representative of our ongoing operations.\n9. Tax Effects of the Above Non-GAAP Adjustments\nWe include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP adjusted net income.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180213006375/en/\nINVESTOR CONTACT:\nBioverativ Inc.\nSam Chase, +1 781-663-9277\nIR@bioverativ.com\nSource: Bioverativ Inc.",
