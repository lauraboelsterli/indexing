    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBOT), a leading manufacturer of a key protein utilized in multiple immunotherapy development pipelines targeting Alzheimer's, diabetes, lupus and cancers, among other diseases, today reported financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on its business.\n\"Stellar today has multiple customers progressing in their clinical trials, and we are excited about the opportunities provided by our technology and market position,\" said Stellar President and Chief Executive Officer Frank Oakes. Results from the first of these third party clinical trials are expected as early as midyear. \"While the outcomes of clinical trials cannot be predicted, we are focused operationally on rapidly preparing to meet the greater requirements of anticipated Phase 3 clinical studies,\" he said.\nStellar Chief Financial Officer Kathi Niffenegger said that during the first quarter, the company completed multiple engineering lots under its optimization initiative and continued to prioritize research and development. \"These development projects are designed to support Stellar's commercial partnerships as well as advance our KLH production and manufacturing capabilities.\"\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $.02 million compared to $.14 million for the same period in 2016. The change was primarily due to a decrease in product sales volume. While the company's customer base has not changed significantly, product sales volumes are subject to variability associated with the rate of development and progression of clinical studies of third-party products that utilize Stellar KLH.\nTotal expenses decreased by $0.15 million to $1.41 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.56 million for the same period in 2016.\nCost of sales decreased by $.08 million to less than $.01 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $.08 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to decreased product sales volume as well as reduced expenses related to sales of KLH that was produced as a byproduct of the company's research and development activities. Research and development expenses increased by $.17 million to $.63 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $.46 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to research and development activities intended to increase the scalability and throughput capacity of existing manufacturing systems, including engineering lots of KLH produced under the company's optimization initiative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $.25 million to $.68 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $.93 million for the same period in 2016 primarily due to management's continued actions to reduce corporate expenses.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, Stellar reported a net loss of $1.40 million, or $0.13 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $1.49 million, or $0.15 per basic share, for the first quarter of the prior year.\nAt December 31, 2017, the company had working capital of $5.1 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $5.4 million.\nStellar will file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about February 7, 2018.
