The increase in cash mining costs was mainly due to a $0.9 million increase in mining preparation costs as more underground drilling and tunnelling was expensed in the current period.\nThe cash milling costs was $14.60 per tonne, an increase of 6% compared to $13.76 in the same prior year period.\nCash costs per ounce of silver and all in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, were negative $12.19 and negative $3.59 respectively, compared to negative $7.15 and $1.29 in the same prior year period. The improvement is mainly due to higher by-product credits achieved arising from a 12% and 37% increase, respectively, in lead and zinc realized selling prices.\nApproximately 18,253 m or $0.9 million of underground diamond drilling (same prior year period – 9,489 m or $0.6 million) and 14,285 m or $3.8 million of tunnelling (same prior year period – 11,976 m or $3.2 million) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the GC Mine. In addition, approximately 280 m or $0.2 million of horizontal tunnel, raise, and declines (same prior year period – 1,685 m or $0.7 million) were completed and capitalized.\nFISCAL 2019 PRODUCTION AND CASH COST GUIDANCE\nOre processed\nSilver\nLead\nZinc\n(tonnes)\n(g/t)\n(%)\n(%)\nYing Mining District\n630,000\n285\n4.3\n0.9\nGC Mine\n250,000\n98\n1.6\n3.0\nSilver\nLead\nZinc\nCash cost*\nAISC*\n(Moz)\n(Mlbs)\n(Mlbs)\n($/t)\n($/t)\nYing Mining District\n5.4\n56.1\n6.2\n75.4\n123.7\nGC Mine\n0.6\n7.5\n13.6\n57.2\n75.5\nConsolidated\n6.0\n63.6\n19.8\n70.2\n122.2\n(*) Both AISC and cash cost are non-IFRS measures. AISC refers to all-in sustaining cost per tonne of ore processed. Cash cost refers to cash production costs per tonne of ore processed. Foreign exchange rates assumptions used are: US$1 = CAD$1.25, US$1 = RMB¥6.50.\nIn Fiscal 2019, the Company expects to process approximately 880,000 tonnes of ore, yielding 6.0 million ounces of silver, 63.6 million pounds of lead, and 19.8 million pounds of zinc. Fiscal 2019 production guidance represents an increase of approximately 4% in silver production, 1% in lead production, and 8% in zinc production compared to the prior year's guidance released on February 2, 2017.\n1. Ying Mining District, Henan Province, China\nIn Fiscal 2019, Ying Mining District plans to mine and process 630,000 tonnes of ore averaging 285 g/t silver, 4.3% lead, and 0.9% zinc with expected metal production of 5.4 million ounces of silver, 56.1 million pounds of lead, and 6.2 million pounds of zinc. Fiscal 2019 production guidance at the Ying Mining District represents an increase of approximately 4% in silver head grade and 2% in lead head grade compared to prior year's guidance. Metal production is comparable to prior year's guidance.\nThe cash production costs is expected to be $75.4 per tonne of ore, and the all-in sustaining costs is estimated at $123.7 per tonne of ore processed.\nCapital expenditures at the Ying Mining District in Fiscal 2019 are budgeted at $31.8 million, including $23.2 million for mine tunnelling and ramp development and $8.6 million for equipment and infrastructure.\n2. GC Mine, Guangdong Province, China\nIn Fiscal 2019, GC Mine plans to mine and process 250,000 tonnes of ore averaging 98 g/t silver, 1.6% lead, and 3.0% zinc with expected metal production of 0.6 million ounces of silver, 7.5 million pounds of lead and 13.6 million pounds of zinc. Fiscal 2019 represents an increase of approximately 50% in silver production, 6% in lead production, and 11% in zinc production.\nThe cash production costs is expected to be $57.2 per tonne of ore, and the all-in sustaining costs would be $57.2 per tonne of ore processed.\nCapital expenditures at GC Mine in Fiscal 2019 are budgeted at $3.0 million, including $1.7 million for mine tunnelling and ramp development and $1.3 million for equipment and infrastructure.\nMr. JianZhao Yin, P.Geo., is the Qualified Person for Silvercorp under NI 43-101 and has reviewed and given consent to the technical information contained in this news release.\nThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Management Discussion & Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for the corresponding period, which have been posted on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company's website at www.silvercorp.ca .
