    "text": "February 24, 2018 / 3:04 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Butland howler gifts Leicester an equaliser Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LEICESTER CITY 1 STOKE CITY 1 Feb 24 (Reuters) - An own goal by Stoke City keeper Jack Butland gifted Leicester City an equaliser in a 1-1 Premier League draw at the King Power Stadium on Saturday and denied Paul Lambert’s side a rare win on the road. Slideshow (7 Images) After Stoke took the lead through Xherdan Shaqiri’s third goal in successive league games just before the interval, Butland parried the ball into his net when under no obvious pressure from a Marc Albrighton cross. Stoke, who remain in 19th place, have the worst away record in the division and were unlucky not to hang on to their lead after a gutsy performance that belied their lowly league status. Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez, who was starting his first league game since failing to secure a move to Manchester City, twice had chances to grab a home winner while Harry Maguire and Matty James both hit the post. Stoke gave a debut off the bench to Tyrese Campbell, 18-year-old son of former Everton striker Kevin Campbell. Reporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Clare Fallon",
