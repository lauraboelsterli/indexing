    "text": "17 Hours Ago | 03:15 \nThe rise of a Chinese aircraft manufacturer is \"a real plus\" for Honeywell , which makes everything from jet engines to software systems used in planes, a company executive told CNBC Thursday. \nThe state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac for short, has secured more than 700 orders for its 168-seat C919 passenger jet, expected to have its first delivery in 2021. \n\"It's a real plus for us because we provide the products, the systems, the services that go on any aircraft. So we support all the major OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] globally,\" said Briand Greer, Honeywell's president for Southeast Asia. \nThe narrow-body plane, seen as a symbol of China's aerospace ambitions, adds to competition in the commercial aircraft manufacturing space currently led by Boeing and Airbus . \nThe company has, in fact, worked with Comac to have a number of its products used on the C919 jet, Greer added. \nHoneywell has also strengthened its businesses beyond China . The American conglomerate this week signed contracts with Singapore Airlines Group and Indonesia's Lion Air Group to provide the two with services that include back-up power for planes.",
