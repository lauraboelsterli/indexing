It’s been a challenging year and I‘m proud of the way I have accomplished a few things,” he added. \nSmith, who also won the Allan Border medal in 2015, accumulated 246 votes ahead last year’s winner Warner (162). Spinner Nathan Lyon (156) was third. \nAll-rounder Ellyse Perry won her second Belinda Clark Award for the best woman player and Warner was named top one-day player for the second year in succession. Aaron Finch took the Twenty20 award. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond",
