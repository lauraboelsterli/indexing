    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.—A former neighbor of Nikolas Cruz said she called 911 two years ago because the teen said, in a social-media post, that he looked forward to buying a gun when he turned 18 so he could shoot up his school.\n“I was pleading with the police [officer]. I said, ‘Please, is there anything you can do?’” Joelle Guarino said Saturday. “He said basically no, when you’re 18 you have a right to bear arms, and there was pretty much nothing he could do.”\n... RELATED VIDEO Nikolas Cruz has admitted to being the gunman in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left at least 17 students dead, according to court records. We look back over the events that unfolded during the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012. Photo: Zuma Press ",
