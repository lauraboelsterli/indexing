R. Grace & Co. (NYSE:GRA) announced that fourth quarter net sales of $459.5 million increased 4% compared with the prior-year quarter. Loss from continuing operations attributable to Grace for the fourth quarter was $123.0 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, compared with income of $17.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter results include a charge of $143 million to reflect the estimated impacts of U.S. tax reform. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBIT decreased 3% to $115.1 million, and fourth quarter Adjusted EPS increased 3% to $0.98 per diluted share.\n“I am proud of the way the company delivered seven percent top line growth and ten percent Adjusted EPS growth, overcoming the early obstacles in 2017,\" said Fred Festa, Grace’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"The company is well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities and strong demand for our differentiated products.\"\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net sales of $1,716.5 million increased 7% compared with the prior-year period. Income from continuing operations attributable to Grace was $11.2 million for the twelve months, compared with $107.0 million for the prior-year period, and full-year diluted earnings per share were $0.16 compared with $1.52 for the prior-year period. Adjusted EBIT of $414.0 million increased 3% from the prior-year period, and full year Adjusted EPS increased 10%.\nGrace Catalysts Technologies\nFourth quarter sales for Catalysts Technologies, which includes catalysts and additives for refinery, plastics, and other chemical process applications, as well as polypropylene process technology, were $344.7 million, an increase of 5% compared with the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable currency translation, partially offset by a decrease in average price due to customer mix.\nGross margin was 42.1% compared with 43.5% in the prior-year quarter, a decrease of 140 basis points primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, including raw materials, and customer and product mix.\nOperating income of $109.3 million increased 1% compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable currency translation, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower income from the ART joint venture. Operating margin was 31.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared with the prior-year quarter. The ART joint venture contributed $8.0 million to operating income compared with $11.8 million in the prior-year quarter.\nGrace Materials Technologies\nFourth quarter sales for Materials Technologies, which includes coatings, consumer, pharmaceutical and chemical process applications, were $114.8 million, an increase of 3% compared with the prior-year quarter primarily due to growth in silica sales volumes, favorable currency translation and an acquisition, partially offset by lower pharmaceutical fine chemical sales.\nGross margin was 37.0%, a decrease of 360 basis points compared with the prior-year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, including raw materials, and product and regional mix.\nOperating income of $25.2 million decreased 13% compared with the prior-year quarter. The decrease was due to lower gross profit, partially offset by favorable currency translation and the acquisition. Operating margin was 22.0%, a decrease of 390 basis points compared with the prior-year quarter.\nOther Expenses/Income in Adjusted EBIT\nTotal corporate costs were $16.1 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $1.1 million compared with the prior-year quarter due to higher incentive compensation costs.\nCertain pension costs of $3.3 million increased $0.3 million compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily due to foreign currency translation.\nInterest Expense\nNet interest expense was $19.5 million for the fourth quarter compared with $19.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The weighted average cash interest rate for the fourth quarter was 4.5%.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes paid in cash, net of refunds, were $27.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. We have not had to pay U.S. federal income taxes in recent years due to available tax deductions and credits that fully offset our U.S. tax liability.\nWe recorded a provisional charge of $143 million in the fourth quarter to reflect the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, including the U.S. tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, the write-down of net U.S. deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in corporate tax rates, and the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system. The impacts of the legislation may differ from the estimate, possibly materially, and the amount of the provisional charge may be adjusted over the course of 2018 due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the tax legislation.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $319.2 million compared with $267.5 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 19%. The increase was primarily due to higher pretax income and lower net cash taxes paid, partially offset by the first quarter payment of $30 million to satisfy a deferred payment obligation.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow was $274.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 16% compared with the prior-year period.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn the fourth quarter we did not repurchase any shares in anticipation of the acquisition of the polyolefin catalysts business. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we spent $65.0 million to repurchase approximately 935,000 shares of our outstanding common stock.\nDividend\nToday Grace announced that its Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend rate from $0.84 to $0.96 per common share. The increase will be effective with the $0.24 per common share dividend payable March 22, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nAs of February 8, 2018, our outlook for 2018 is as follows:\nSales growth of 8%-10% (4%-6% organically) Adjusted EBIT in the range of $440-$450 million, up 6%-9% Adjusted EPS in the range of $3.72-$3.82 per share, up 9%-12% Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the range of $210-$250 million, reflecting increased growth and productivity capital spending\nOur outlook assumes the anticipated polyolefin catalysts acquisition is completed by March 31, 2018. In addition, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 27%-28%, which reflects the estimated effects of U.S. tax reform excluding any adjustments to the provisional charge described above, as well as the incremental temporary increase to anti-base erosion taxes that results from our U.S. net operating losses.\nWe are unable to estimate the annual mark-to-market pension adjustment, 2018 net income, or diluted EPS.\nInvestor Call\nWe will discuss these results during an investor conference call and webcast today starting at 9:00 a.m. ET.

R. Grace & Co. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Financial Information (A) In the above charts, Grace presents financial information in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), as well as the non-GAAP financial information described below. Grace believes that this non-GAAP financial information provides useful supplemental information about the performance of its businesses, improves period-to-period comparability and provides clarity on the information management uses to evaluate the performance of its businesses. In the above charts, Grace has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from those results should be evaluated carefully. Grace defines these non-GAAP financial measures as follows:\nAdjusted EBIT means income from continuing operations attributable to W. R. Grace & Co. shareholders adjusted for interest income and expense; income taxes; costs related to legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; income and expense items related to divested businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; gains and losses on sales of businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends. Adjusted EBITDA means Adjusted EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital means Adjusted EBIT (on a trailing four quarters basis) divided by the sum of net working capital, properties and equipment and certain other assets and liabilities. Adjusted Gross Margin means gross margin adjusted for pension-related costs included in cost of goods sold and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment. Adjusted EPS means diluted EPS from continuing operations adjusted for costs related to legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning expenses and asset impairments; pension costs other than service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits; income and expense items related to divested businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; gains and losses on sales of businesses, product lines, and certain other investments; third-party acquisition-related costs and the amortization of acquired inventory fair value adjustment; certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends; and certain discrete tax items. Adjusted ETR means the effective tax rate on Adjusted EBIT less net interest expense, plus or minus certain discrete items (such as changes in tax laws and APB 23 reserves) and the incremental temporary increase to anti-base erosion taxes that results from our U.S. net operating losses. Adjusted Free Cash Flow means net cash provided by or used for operating activities from continuing operations minus capital expenditures plus cash flows related to legacy product, environmental and other claims; cash paid for restructuring and repositioning; capital expenditures related to repositioning; cash paid for third-party acquisition-related costs; and accelerated payments under defined benefit pension arrangements.\nAdjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not purport to represent income or liquidity measures as defined under U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to such measures as an indicator of Grace's performance or liquidity.\nGrace uses Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure in significant business decisions and in determining certain incentive compensation. Grace uses Adjusted EBIT as a performance measure because it provides improved period-to-period comparability for decision making and compensation purposes, and because it better measures the ongoing earnings results of its strategic and operating decisions by excluding the earnings effects of legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning activities; divested businesses; the effects of acquisitions; and certain other items that are not representative of underlying trends.\nGrace uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital, Adjusted Gross Margin, and Adjusted EPS as performance measures and may use these measures in determining certain incentive compensation. Grace uses Adjusted EBIT Return On Invested Capital in making operating and investment decisions and in balancing the growth and profitability of operations.\nGrace uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure to evaluate its ability to generate cash to support its ongoing business operations, to invest in its businesses, and to provide a return of capital to shareholders. Grace also uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a performance measure in determining certain incentive compensation.\nThese measures are provided to investors and others to improve the period-to-period comparability and peer-to-peer comparability of Grace’s financial results, and to ensure that investors and others understand the information Grace uses to evaluate the performance of its businesses. They distinguish the operating results of Grace's current business base from the costs of Grace's legacy product, environmental and other claims; restructuring and repositioning activities; divested businesses; and other items discussed above. These measures may have material limitations due to the exclusion or inclusion of amounts that are included or excluded, respectively, in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and thus investors and others should review carefully the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nGrace is unable without unreasonable efforts to estimate the annual mark-to-market pension adjustment, 2018 net income, or diluted EPS. Without the availability of this significant information, Grace is unable to provide reconciliations for the forward-looking information set forth in the 2018 Outlook, above.\n(B) Grace's segment operating income includes only Grace's share of income from consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. (C) Certain pension costs include only ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which include service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service costs/credits. Catalysts Technologies and Materials Technologies segment operating income and corporate costs do not include any amounts for pension expense. Other pension related costs including annual mark-to-market adjustments and actuarial gains and losses are excluded from Adjusted EBIT. These amounts are not used by management to evaluate the performance of Grace's businesses and significantly affect the peer-to-peer and period-to-period comparability of our financial results. Mark-to-market adjustments and actuarial gains and losses relate primarily to changes in financial market values and actuarial assumptions and are not directly related to the operation of Grace's businesses.
