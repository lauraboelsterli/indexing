This once more attests to the need for a full and thorough investigation by the authorities of all violence in Rakhine State and attacks on the various communities there,” U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters. \nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for the release of the two detained journalists and continues to press for that, Haq said. Reporting by Michelle Nichols, Editing by Franklin Paul",
