    "text": "SEATTLE, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Donuts Inc. , the global leader in new top-level Internet domains, today announced it has acquired the .TRAVEL domain name from registry operator Tralliance Registry Management Company. The .TRAVEL domain becomes Donuts' 239th TLD, and the centerpiece of an already-robust portfolio of travel domains that includes: .CITY, .CRUISES, .FLIGHTS, .GUIDE, .HOLIDAY, .IRISH, .REISEN, .TOURS, .TOWN, .VACATIONS, .VIAJES, .VOYAGE, .CAB, .LIMO, and .TAXI.\n\"We are delighted to add .TRAVEL as the 'anchor tenant' of our travel-related portfolio,\" said Bruce Jaffe, Donuts president and chief executive officer . \"The travel market is global, it's enormous and it's ideal for our top-level domains. We are seeing businesses of all sizes all around the world building their digital identity around our domains, and .TRAVEL is the perfect complement.\"\nToday, nearly 40% of the industry is doing business digitally: travelers and the businesses serving them are discovering, planning, advertising and transacting online. According to eMarketer, the global digital travel market will exceed $200 billion by 2020*.\nSince its launch in 2005, the .TRAVEL domain has been embraced by the travel industry. Domain names ending in .TRAVEL now identify tens of thousands of travel businesses and organizations on the Internet. The .TRAVEL domain is widely recognized as of the highest quality, and is used by leading travel businesses such as: visitloscabos.travel , adventures.travel , hongkongdisneyland.travel , goldman.travel , AARP.travel and tens of thousands of others.\nJaffe continued, \"We believe that adding .TRAVEL to our portfolio will enable us to grow our entire category of domains, by offering compelling choices to travel-related businesses and organizations, and to the many millions of travelers and travel buffs located throughout the world. They're transacting, they're blogging, they're on social platforms, they're podcasting - they're everywhere online. We look forward to working with our partners to introduce these high-quality, relevant names to an enormous, global audience.\"\nThis momentum comes on the heels of Donuts being named Number 1 in the Deloitte Fast 500 .\nAbout Donuts\nDonuts simplifies and connects a fragmented online world with domain names and related technologies that allow people and businesses to build, market and own their digital identities. Donuts holds the world's largest portfolio of new top-level domains, and offers a wide variety of clear and meaningful names for use as business identifiers (such as .ltd, .company), navigation (such as .careers, .support), in vertical markets (such as .photography, .cafe, or .builders) or in broad-based generics (such as .social, .world or .live). Donuts provides its registrar / reseller customers with innovative services for the discovery, registration, usage and monetization of high-quality domain names. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Donuts, the registrar Name.com is one of the most admired brands in the industry.
