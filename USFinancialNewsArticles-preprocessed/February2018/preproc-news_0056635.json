The acquisition advances Splice’s aim to build the definitive online platform for musicians. Exact terms of the acquisition will not be disclosed.\nIndaba’s Founder Dan Zaccagnino and CEO, JJ Rosen, will be joining Splice’s executive team, and will also bring eight team members to the company. As Head of Content at Splice, Mr. Zaccagnino, who founded Indaba Music in 2005, will be responsible for content strategy at the company. Mr. Rosen, who was Executive Vice President of Sony Music Entertainment’s Commercial Music Group before becoming CEO of Indaba in 2012, will serve as the Executive Vice President, Music Strategy & Industry Relations at Splice. He will be responsible for developing relationships and partnerships with external music companies, and overseeing Splice’s partnerships with established and emerging artists.\n“We founded Indaba Music to connect musicians in new ways and accelerate their creativity with creative content and opportunities. Splice shares that vision and has the resources and team needed to bring it to the next level,\" stated Dan Zaccagnino, founder of Indaba Music and Head of Content at Splice.\nAs a longtime leader in the music space, Indaba Music has provided its community with over a thousand opportunities to create, collaborate, and gain exposure. Indaba Music pioneered many formats from remix competitions with high-profile artists, to contests for licensing placements with major brands. Its most notable campaigns have featured major artists and brands including Jack Antonoff, Usher, Yo-Yo Ma, Robert Glasper, Red Bull, X-Box, Sony Electronics, and hundreds more. Splice will now expand remix competitions and begin to offer other activations designed to help musicians create and collaborate more.\n“Indaba has a 12 year track record of creating opportunities for musicians to gain exposure, work together in ways that elevate their craft and their careers, and make the creative process more connected,” said Steve Martocci, co-founder and CEO of Splice. “Indaba Music, combined with Splice’s technology and market position, will give musicians today unprecedented opportunities to unleash their creativity.”\nSplice also intends to maintain and expand the Rubber Tracks Sample Library, which Indaba Music created in partnership with Converse in 2012. The catalogue has over 40,000 royalty-free samples, loops and stems, contributed by legendary musicians including members of The Roots and Earth Wind & Fire, world class instrumentalists who have collaborated and performed with artists like Michael Jackson and Jack White, and popular contemporary artists like Dev Hynes and Machinedrum.\nFor more information, visit http://blog.splice.com .
