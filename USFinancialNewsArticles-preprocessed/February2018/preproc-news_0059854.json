    "text": "SECAUCUS, N.J.,\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nTotal Comparable Sales (4.6%), or (3.2%) adjusted for the holiday timing Digital commerce increases 15.3% GAAP loss per share of $0.75, impacted by restructuring charges and changes in tax law. Adjusted loss per share of $0.17\nVitamin Shoppe, Inc. (NYSE: VSI), an omni-channel, specialty retailer and manufacturer of nutritional products, today announced preliminary results for the three months ended December 30, 2017. Total net sales in the fourth quarter were $268.8 million compared to $304.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Reported basic and fully diluted loss per share in fourth quarter 2017 was $0.75, compared to basic and fully diluted earnings per share loss of $0.50 in fourth quarter 2016. Results in fourth quarter 2017 include a $15.3 million tax charge to revalue the net deferred tax assets based on changes under the Tax Reform Act of 2017. In addition, the fourth quarter 2017 includes net pre-tax expenses of $0.8 million associated with the closure of the New Jersey distribution center and a net pre-tax $3.7 million reduction in previously recorded Nutri-Force restructuring costs. Fourth quarter 2016 results include a $39.2 million pre-tax impairment charge associated with Nutri-Force goodwill and other intangible assets and a $3 million tax benefit from the closure of the Canadian stores. Adjusting for these items in both periods, adjusted EPS loss for fourth quarter 2017 was $0.17 and adjusted EPS for fourth quarter 2016 was $0.37. (Refer to Table 4 at the end of this press release.)\nThe Company also announced that Chief Executive Officer, Colin Watts, will be leaving the Company. To ensure a smooth transition, Mr. Watts intends to stay with the Company and continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer through the end of May. Effective immediately, Alex Smith, who has been serving as Chairman, has been appointed Executive Chairman. The Board has commenced a search for Mr. Watts' successor.\nCommenting on today's announcement, Alex Smith, Executive Chairman of the Vitamin Shoppe Board stated, \"Overall, 2017 yielded disappointing results. Over the past couple quarters, Vitamin Shoppe has begun a turnaround and signs of progress are already visible. We have also reached a mutual agreement with our CEO, Colin Watts to transition the business to new leadership by May. During this time, the entire organization will be committed to implementing the New Base Plan developed by management. In my new role as Executive Chairman, I will work closely with our leadership team in that effort while we execute our search for a new CEO.\"\nColin Watts, Chief Executive Officer of the Vitamin Shoppe stated, \"I am encouraged by the early signs of traction from critical initiatives, as shown by the improving quarterly comps, strong Digital Commerce growth, success of Spark Auto Delivery and growth in new customers in Q4. Our New Base Plan will establish The Vitamin Shoppe brand as consumers' Wellness Authority and create a platform for future growth and profitability. I look forward to working closely with Alex in my last few months to help implement the plan and facilitate an orderly transition for the company.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal sales of $268.8 million in the quarter were 11.8% lower than the same period of the prior year. Total comparable sales were down 4.6% in the quarter or down 3.2% adjusting for the timing of the Christmas holiday. The Company opened three stores in the quarter. Manufacturing sales to the Vitamin Shoppe were $8.9 million while third party sales decreased 41.0% from the same period of the prior year as the Company continues to streamline this business.\nCost of goods sold, which includes product, distribution, manufacturing and store occupancy costs, decreased $21.9 million, or 10.7%, to $182.8 million for the three months ended December 30, 2017, compared with $204.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the quarter, the Company recorded $0.8 million in net expenses related to the closure of the New Jersey distribution center and a net benefit of $3.3 million in restructuring costs for the Nutri-Force turnaround. With respect to Nutri-Force, the Company is also exploring strategic alternatives, including the potential sale.\nGross profit of $86.0 million was 14.1% lower than $100.2 million in fourth quarter 2016. Reported gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 32.0% in fourth quarter 2017, compared to 32.9% in the same period of 2016. Excluding the special items mentioned above, gross profit was $83.5 million in the quarter and the adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.1%. The fourth quarter 2017 year over year decrease was primarily due to deleverage in occupancy and supply chain from lower sales as well as additional investments in pricing and promotions. This was partially offset by improvements in margin from favorable category and private brands mix shifts, lower costs through new vendor partnerships and improvements from Nutri-Force.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), including operating payroll and related benefits and advertising expense, was $87.1 million for the quarter ended December 30, 2017, compared with $83.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. SG&A as a percent of revenue was 32.4% in fourth quarter 2017 and 27.3% in fourth quarter 2016. This deleveraging is mainly driven by a combination of store payroll, advertising, other store operating costs and increases in corporate costs.\nOperating loss in fourth quarter 2017 of $1.8 million compared to an operating loss of $22.7 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted for the items noted in the preceding paragraphs, the operating loss was $4.7 million in fourth quarter 2017 compared to operating income of $16.5 million in fourth quarter 2016.\nIncome taxes reflect an additional $15.3 million of tax expense resulting from the change in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities under the new tax laws.\nReported net loss was $17.6 million for fourth quarter 2017 compared to net loss of $11.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Reported loss per share was $0.75 in fourth quarter 2017, compared to earnings per share loss of $0.50 in fourth quarter 2016. Earnings per share loss, on an adjusted basis (for the items described in Table 4), was $0.17 in fourth quarter 2017 compared to earnings per share of $0.37 for the fourth quarter 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nCash and equivalents at December 30, 2017 were $2.0 million. At year end, the Company had $12.0 million borrowed on its revolving line of credit and a convertible notes liability with a total face value of $143.8 million.\nCapital expenditures were $11.7 million in the quarter and $55.0 million for the full year. Funds were primarily expended on the new distribution center, new and remodeled stores, supply chain, digital and other IT investments as well as additional office space to accommodate closing of the North Bergen facility.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is providing guidance around the key levers that drive the business. Specifically:\nFull year comparable sales of low to mid negative single digits, improving sequentially Full year gross margin rate flat with 2017, benefitting from higher product margins and improvement at Nutri-Force, partially offset by fixed cost deleverage Increase in SG&A expenses of 2.0% - 2.5% over 2017. This excludes expenses associated with CEO change. Combined Federal, State and Local tax rate of 28%. This excludes taxes associated with permanent book to tax differences estimated at $0.5 million to $1 million Full year capital expenditures of approximately $30 million, includes the opening of 2 new stores.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted information is non-GAAP financial information. These supplemental non-GAAP measures should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, and should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented. The Company believes such non-GAAP financial information facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to the Company's and our business segments' core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses such non-GAAP financial information in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the Company's and each business segment's ongoing performance. A reconciliation of adjusted financial information to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is shown in Tables 4.\nWebcast\nManagement will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter 2017 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) today.
