    "text": "HAMBURG, Feb 6 (Reuters) - German car parts maker Continental still has no plans for a potential new corporate structure that are ready for formal decision, it said after an extraordinary supervisory board meeting on Tuesday.\nThe electronics and tyre maker reiterated that it was analysing ways to meet the challenges facing the auto industry, and said labour representatives on its supervisory board had asked for an update on the situation.\nWith the auto industry wrapped up in a strategic transition to zero-emission cars and self-driving technology, carmakers and suppliers are restructuring to reduce their reliance on the internal combustion engine and focus on electric propulsion.\nIn January, Continental had said that it was considering a structural overhaul and aims to flesh out its plans within six months.\nIt is working with JP Morgan on the subject, people familiar with the matter have said.
