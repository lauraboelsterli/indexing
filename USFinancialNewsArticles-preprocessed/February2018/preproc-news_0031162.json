    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Parker Drilling Company (NYSE: PKD) today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, including a reported net loss of $29.6 million, or a $0.21 loss per share, on revenues of $116.3 million.\nThe net loss includes a non-cash pre-tax loss of $4.3 million of asset and inventory write-offs associated with the sale of a rig in Papua New Guinea and $3.3 million of asset and inventory write-offs associated with select international drilling assets. Excluding these items, the adjusted net loss was $22.0 million, or a $0.16 loss per share.\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $22.4 million.\n\"The year ended on a strong note, thanks in large part to the continuing growth in our Rental Tools Services business,\" said Gary Rich, the Company's Chairman, President and CEO. \"While 2017 was another challenging year for the oilfield services sector, compared to 2016, Parker Drilling increased gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, by 35 percent on essentially flat revenue by maintaining diligent focus on cost control. We also worked to maintain liquidity by focusing on working capital and finished the year with $141.5 million in cash, almost $22 million greater than when we started the year.\n\"I am proud of our accomplishments and believe we have fundamentally streamlined our cost structure to best position the company for continued strength going forward. We remain optimistic about our future as we continue to see increasing signs of a recovery taking hold,\" concluded Rich.\nFourth Quarter Review\nParker Drilling's revenues for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with the 2017 third quarter, decreased 1.7 percent to $116.3 million from $118.3 million. Operating gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense (gross margin), decreased 19.2 percent to $24.4 million from $30.2 million and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 21.0 percent, compared with 25.5 percent for the prior period.\nDrilling Services\nFor the Company's Drilling Services business, which is comprised of the U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling and the International & Alaska Drilling segments, fourth quarter revenues declined 7.6 percent to $62.2 million from $67.3 million. Gross margin decreased 54.6 percent to $5.4 million from $11.9 million and gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 8.7 percent, compared with 17.7 percent for the prior period. Contracted backlog was $241 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with $257 million at the end of the third quarter.\nU.S. (Lower 48) Drilling\nU.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment revenues were $1.5 million, a 66.3 percent decrease from 2017 third quarter revenues of $4.6 million. Gross margin was a $2.7 million loss as compared with a 2017 third quarter loss of $0.5 million. The decrease in revenues and gross margin was driven by fewer revenue days, as utilization dropped from 17% in the third quarter to 5% in the fourth quarter.\nInternational & Alaska Drilling\nInternational & Alaska Drilling segment revenues were $60.6 million, a 3.3 percent decrease from 2017 third quarter revenues of $62.7 million. Gross margin was $8.0 million, a 35.5 percent decrease from 2017 third quarter gross margin of $12.4 million. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 13.2 percent as compared with 19.7 percent for the 2017 third quarter. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to lower reimbursable revenues. Excluding reimbursable revenues, revenues were flat as increases associated with additional O&M activity and drilling activity in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq were offset by lower joint venture revenues from Kazakhstan and reduced day rates for the Parker-owned rig in Sakhalin, which completed drilling activities in the third quarter and went on a reduced standby rate in the fourth quarter. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of inventory and asset related write-offs of select drilling assets and the sale of a rig in Papua New Guinea, which collectively reduced gross margin by $3.0 million.\nRental Tools Services\nFor the Company's Rental Tools Services business, which is comprised of the U.S. Rental Tools and International Rental Tools segments, fourth quarter revenues were $54.1 million, a 6.1 percent increase from 2017 third quarter revenues of $51.0 million. Gross margin was $19.1 million, a 4.4 percent increase from $18.3 million for the 2017 third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 35.3 percent as compared with 35.9 percent in the 2017 third quarter.\nU.S. Rental Tools\nU.S. Rental tools segment revenues were $36.3 million, compared with $35.7 million for the 2017 third quarter. Gross margin was $19.0 million compared with $19.6 million for the 2017 third quarter. Revenues were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter as U.S. Land and offshore shelf increases offset reductions in deepwater activity. Gross margin decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and revenue mix associated with decreased deepwater activity.\nInternational Rental Tools\nInternational Rental Tools segment revenues were $17.8 million, compared with $15.3 million for the 2017 third quarter. Gross margin was a gain of $11.0 thousand compared with a loss of $1.3 million for the 2017 third quarter. The increase in revenues was primarily the result of additional activity in most of our international markets. The improvement in gross margin was due to a more favorable product mix as well as cost reductions taken in the third quarter, which fully impacted the fourth quarter.\nConsolidated\nGeneral and Administrative expense decreased to $5.1 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, from $7.0 million for the 2017 third quarter, predominately due to incentive plan adjustments.\nCapital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $9.7 million, and were $54.5 million for the year.\nCredit Facility Amendment\nOn February 14, 2018, the Company executed an amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, modifying the credit facility to an Asset-Based Lending (ABL) structure and reducing the size of the revolver from $100 million to $80 million. The amendment eliminates the financial maintenance covenants required in the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and replaces them with a liquidity covenant and a monthly borrowing base calculation based on eligible rental equipment and eligible domestic accounts receivable. The liquidity covenant requires the Company to maintain a minimum of $30 million of liquidity (defined as availability under the borrowing base and cash on hand), of which $15 million is restricted, resulting in a maximum availability at any one time of $65 million. The amendment also allows greater flexibility to refinance the Company's existing Senior Notes on either a secured or unsecured basis.\nConference Call\nParker Drilling has scheduled a conference call for 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Thursday, February 15, 2018, to review reported results.

Special items include items impacting operating expenses that management believes detract from an understanding of normal operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review current period operating performance and period to period comparisons. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(2) Special items include:\n- For the three months ended December 31, 2017, special items include a $3.0 million write-off of inventory associated with select international drilling assets. This item is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement Of Operations.\n- For the three months ended December 31, 2016, special items include $0.9 million of net severance associated with the departure of three executives.
