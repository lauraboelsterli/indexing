    "text": "World food prices steady in January, cereal output seen at record high - UN FAO Published 6 Hours Ago Reuters \nFAO@ \nROME, Feb 1 (Reuters) - World food prices held steady in January from the month before, as rising prices for cereals and vegetable oils were balanced out by lower quotations for dairy and sugar, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday. \nThe Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 169.5 points, nearly unchanged from December. \nFood prices on international markets were almost 3 percent lower than last January, FAO said. \nAgricultural commodities have emerged from a highly volatile period and FAO has said it expects them to remain stable over the next decade. \nFAO raised its forecast for global cereals output in 2017 to 2.64 billion tonnes, 1.3 percent higher than 2016's harvest and an all-time record high.
