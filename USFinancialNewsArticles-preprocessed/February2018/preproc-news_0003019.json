They are poised for their biggest monthly rise since November 2016.\n“Monetary policy looks very inconsistent with the level of growth and inflation,” said Anujeet Sareen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. “Given the normalisation process, the whole bond market looks like it’s just not high enough in terms of yields.”\nIndeed, the jump in global bond yields this month comes against a backdrop of strong economic data, and in the euro zone, comments from European Central Bank officials suggesting that asset purchases may end sooner rather than later.\nOn Tuesday, data showed the euro zone economy expanded at its fastest rate in a decade in 2017. Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot meanwhile said the ECB should end its asset buys after September but a short phasing-out period is acceptable.\nGermany’s bond yield curve is close to its steepest in around six months, with the gap between 2 and 10-year bond yields at around 121 bps versus 106 bps a month ago.\n“What bond markets are reacting to is the fact that we’re in the strongest growth environment we’ve had for some time,” said Seamus Mac Gorain, senior fixed income portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We are expecting a material rise in bond yields, it’s just happening more quickly than investors had anticipated.”\nEuro zone bond yields fell 1-2 bps on Wednesday ahead of euro zone inflation numbers for January.\nEconomists polled by Reuters forecast a 1.3 percent price rise year-on-year, versus a 1.4 percent rise a month before.\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday while signalling a gradual tightening of monetary policy later this year.\nElsewhere, Germany is scheduled to sell 4 billion euros of five-year bonds later in the day.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
