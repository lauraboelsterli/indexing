    "text": "February 22, 2018 / 7:00 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Haiti suspends Oxfam Great Britain's operating right amid misconduct probe Reuters Staff 1 Min Read PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti has temporarily revoked Oxfam Great Britain’s authorization to operate in the country after allegations of sexual misconduct by some of the charity’s staff there, Planning and External Cooperation Minister Aviol Fleurant said on Thursday. Slideshow (2 Images) Fleurant said the decision had been made on the grounds of “serious failings” by Oxfam Great Britain between 2010 and 2011, and that a definitive decision on the charity’s right to operate in Haiti would be made in some two months time. (This version of the story corrects headline and first sentence to show the suspension only refers to Oxfam Great Britain, not to all of Oxfam) Reporting by Joseph Guyler Delva",
