Arison’s father, Ted, who made his fortune as founder of Carnival Cruise Line, was part of a consortium that bought control of the bank from the government. Arison, Israel’s wealthiest woman, has since bought out her partners. ($1 = 3.4949 shekels) (Reporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Steven Scheer and Elaine Hardcastle)\n ",
