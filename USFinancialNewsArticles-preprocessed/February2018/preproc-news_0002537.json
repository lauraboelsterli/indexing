    "text": "  27 minutes ago Halfpenny stars as dominant Wales thrash Scotland Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \n, (Reuters) - Leigh Halfpenny scored two tries as Wales opened their Six Nations campaign with a dominant 34-7 victory against much-fancied Scotland in Cardiff on Saturday. \nIn an entertaining start to the tournament, Wales banished memories of their defeat to Scotland in last year’s fixture with a commanding victory courtesy of tries from Gareth Davies and Steff Evans and Halfpenny’s double. \nThe experienced fullback added 14 points from the boot for a personal tally of 24. \nScotland had not won in Cardiff since 2002 but arrived in the Welsh capital buoyed up by a superb spell in November that saw them thump Australia and fall agonisingly short of a famous victory against the world champion All Blacks. \nWales, however -- without six British & Irish Lions stars -- started in inspired fashion at a fervent Principality Stadium with Davies intercepting a pass from opposite number Ali Price to canter over from 60 metres. \nThe visitors barely had time to settle in a breathless opening 15 minutes before Halfpenny dived over for his first Wales try since 2013 -- 38 games ago.
