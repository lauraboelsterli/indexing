    "text": "Cost Reduction Actions Begin to Drive Improvement in Results from Operations\nHILLSBORO, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Radisys Corporation (NASDAQ: RSYS), a global leader of open telecom solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Summary\nConsolidated revenue of $32.3 million, with sequential growth in Software-Systems revenue of 31%; GAAP gross margin of 4.2% and non-GAAP gross margin of 40.4%; GAAP loss per share was $0.50 and non-GAAP loss per share was $0.01, above the high-end of the Company’s guidance range; Secured initial orders from new FlowEngine customer for expected deployments into a European service provider; Announced MediaEngine product order for nearly $5 million from a leading Asian customer, of which $3.5 million was shipped during the quarter; and Secured new award for MediaEngine via a channel partner for VoLTE deployment with a Tier 1 service provider in China.\n“Our fourth quarter operating results were at or above the high-end of our expectations through a combination of sequential revenue growth across our strategic product lines and initial savings related to our cost-reduction plans,” said Brian Bronson, Radisys President and Chief Executive Officer. “As announced in January, we are narrowing our strategic focus towards our Software-Systems business, which in part will be enabled by the closing of our recently secured financing. In turn, this has enabled us to implement plans to decrease operating expenses by over $14 million, or 25% annually, in 2018 and also reduce our working capital requirements. As a result of these actions, we are poised to deliver annual non-GAAP gross margins above 40% and operating expenses below $40 million in 2018, while driving to return the Company to quarterly non-GAAP profitability.\n“We are fully focused on executing and delivering differentiated, open-centric software and solutions that are tied to market growth drivers in 5G, voice-over-LTE, SDN and NFV. We have a strong pipeline of engagements for our Software-Systems products, and I continue to believe we are positioned favorably to play a disruptive role in these growing markets as we diligently work to convert opportunities into commercial wins throughout 2018.”\nSoftware-Systems Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Software-Systems revenue was $14.8 million, compared to $11.3 million in the prior quarter and $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential improvement was the result of strong deployments on both a direct and channel basis for MediaEngine as well as the timing of revenue recognition for certain professional services engagements.\nGross margin was 53.9%, compared to 47.9% in the prior quarter and 58.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income was $0.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million in the prior quarter and operating income of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHardware Solutions Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Hardware Solutions revenue was $17.5 million, compared to $17.5 million in the prior quarter and $22.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross margin was (26.7)%, compared to (13.2)% in the prior quarter and 23.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating loss was $9.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $7.9 million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment gross margin and operating losses were significantly impacted by inventory write-downs in the fourth and third quarters of 2017, the impact of which is outlined below:\nImpact of Inventory Charges on Hardware Solutions Segment Gross Margins Q417 Q317 Q416 Inventory charges ($ millions) $9.7 $6.6 $1.5 Inventory charges (%) (56)% (38)% (7)% Consolidated Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, consolidated revenue was $32.3 million, compared to $28.8 million in the prior quarter and $40.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 4.2%, compared to 4.2% in the prior quarter and 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 GAAP research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses were $12.7 million, compared to $13.5 million in the prior quarter and $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in operating expenses over the comparable periods was primarily the result of restructuring actions associated with the Company’s Hardware Solutions business.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2017 gross margin was 40.4%, compared to 10.8% in the prior quarter and 38.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses on a non-GAAP basis were $12.3 million, compared to $13.4 million in the prior quarter and $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a GAAP net loss of $19.6 million, or ($0.50) per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $15.4 million, or ($0.39) per share, in the prior quarter and a GAAP net loss of $4.1 million, or ($0.11) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company recorded a net loss of $0.3 million, or ($0.01) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $11.0 million, or ($0.28) per share, in the prior quarter and net income of $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Guidance\nRevenue is expected between $22 to $24 million, with revenue mix weighted slightly towards the Hardware-Solutions segment at the midpoint. Hardware-Solutions revenue is expected to include approximately $5 million of revenue associated with legacy customer last-time builds. GAAP gross margin is expected to approximate 23% and GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately $11 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected between 31% and 33% of sales. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected to expand throughout 2018 as Software-Systems revenue becomes an increasingly larger portion of the Company’s revenue mix. Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to approximate $10 million, down nearly 20% from the fourth quarter of 2017 as targeted expense actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. GAAP loss is expected to range from ($0.22) to ($0.18) per share. Non-GAAP loss is expected to range from ($0.12) to ($0.08) per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP loss per share are based on a projected 40 million shares outstanding.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results on February 7, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Although help provide additional information about Radisys, investors should keep in mind that are inherently less reliable than historical information. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize (or the other consequences of such a development worsen), or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forecasted or expected. The Company believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. All information in this press release is as of February 7, 2018. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the Company's expectations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain expenses, gains and losses, such as the effects of (a) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expense, (c) restructuring and other charges (reversals), net, (d) non-cash income tax expense, (e) gain on the liquidation of foreign subsidiaries and (f) restructuring inventory write-down. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of its current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring the Company's performance, and the Company believes that it is providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to its internal measurement processes. These non-GAAP measures are considered to be reflective of the Company's core operating results as they more closely reflect the essential revenue-generating activities of the Company and direct operating expenses (resulting in cash expenditures) needed to perform these revenue-generating activities. The Company also believes, based on feedback provided to the Company during its earnings calls' Q&A sessions and discussions with the investment community, that the non-GAAP financial measures it provides are necessary to allow the investment community to construct their valuation models to better align its results and projections with its competitors and market sector, as there is significant variability and unpredictability across companies with respect to certain expenses, gains and losses.\nThe non-GAAP financial information is presented using a consistent methodology from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP information to GAAP information is included in the tables below. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nRadisys® is a

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (In millions, unaudited) Estimates at the\nmidpoint of the\nguidance range\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 GAAP $ 10.8 (b) Stock-based compensation 0.5 Non-GAAP $ 10.3 Non-GAAP financial measures includes the performance of Software-Systems and Embedded Products and Hardware Services. The Company excludes the following corporate and other expenses, reversals, gains and losses from its non-GAAP financial measures, when applicable:\n(a) Amortization of acquired intangible assets: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets primarily relate to core and existing technologies, trade name and customer relationships that were acquired with the acquisitions of Continuous Computing and Pactolus. The Company excludes the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because it does not reflect the Company's ongoing business and it does not have a direct correlation to the operation of the Company's business. In addition, in accordance with GAAP, the Company generally recognizes expenses for internally-developed intangible assets as they are incurred, notwithstanding the potential future benefit such assets may provide. Unlike internally-developed intangible assets, however, and also in accordance with GAAP, the Company generally capitalizes the cost of acquired intangible assets and recognizes that cost as an expense over the useful lives of the assets acquired. As a result of their GAAP treatment, there is an inherent lack of comparability between the financial performance of internally-developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company believes it is useful to provide, as a supplement to its GAAP operating results, non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles in order to enhance the period-over-period comparison of its operating results, as there is significant variability and unpredictability across companies with respect to this expense.\n(b) Stock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation consists of expenses recorded under GAAP, in connection with stock awards such as stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted under the Company's equity incentive plans and shares issued pursuant to the Company's employee stock purchase plan. The Company excludes stock-based compensation from non-GAAP financial measures because it is a non-cash measurement that does not reflect the Company's ongoing business and because the Company believes that investors want to understand the impact on the Company of the adoption of the applicable GAAP surrounding share based payments; the Company believes that the provision of non-GAAP information that excludes stock-based compensation improves the ability of investors to compare its period-over-period operating results, as there is significant variability and unpredictability across companies with respect to this expense.\n(c) Restructuring and other charges, net: Restructuring and other charges, net relates to costs associated with non-recurring events. These include costs incurred for employee severance, acquisition or divestiture activities, excess facility costs, certain legal costs, asset related charges and other expenses associated with business restructuring activities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. The Company does not engage in restructuring activities in the ordinary course of business. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures because it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results.\n(d) Income taxes: Non-GAAP income tax expense is equal to the Company's projected cash tax expense. Adjustments to GAAP income tax expense are required to eliminate the recognition of tax expense from profitable entities where we utilize deferred tax assets to offset current period tax liabilities. We believe that providing this non-GAAP figure is useful to our investors as it more closely represents the true economic impact of our tax positions.\n(e) Loss (gain) on the liquidation of foreign subsidiaries: On a non-recurring basis we have recorded a gain or loss to reflect the realization of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments upon the liquidation of certain international subsidiaries. This gain or loss represents the net unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses accumulated from changes in exchange rates and the related effects from the translation of assets and liabilities of these entities. The liquidation of foreign subsidiaries occurs on an infrequent basis and management does not view the impact of this non-cash charge as indicative of the ongoing performance of the Company. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude this gain from its non-GAAP financial measures because it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results.\n(f) Restructuring inventory write-down: Includes inventory write-downs associated with non-recurring events, predominantly tied to the Company’s decision to end-of-life or discontinue certain products for which the Company has no future ongoing demand. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded such charges tied to discrete product decisions within its Hardware-Solutions segment associated with its DCEngine and certain legacy embedded products. Restructuring inventory write-downs are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although the Company has incurred various inventory write-downs over the past several years, they have generally been associated with ongoing business activities. As such, the Company believes it is appropriate to exclude end-of-life and product discontinuance inventory write-downs from its non-GAAP financial measures because it enhances the ability of investors to compare the Company's period-over-period operating results.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180207006161/en/\nCompany Contact\nRadisys Corporation\nJon Wilson, 503-615-1685\nChief Financial Officer\njon.wilson@radisys.com\nor\nInvestor Contact\nShelton Group\nBrett L.
