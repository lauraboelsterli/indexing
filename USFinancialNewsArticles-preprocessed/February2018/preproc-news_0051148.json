The increase in revenue was driven primarily by growth in professional management revenue, which increased 14% to $118.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $104.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCosts and expenses increased 4% to $101.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $97.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This was due primarily to an increase in employee-related costs, including expenses due to restructuring activities and increases in wages due to headcount growth and compensation increases. There was also an increase in fees paid to plan providers for data connectivity due to growth in professional management revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in consulting and professional services expenses.\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue remained constant at 44% for the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2017.\nIncome from operations increased 55% to $24.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $15.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, income from operations was 20% for the fourth quarters of 2017 compared to 14% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 75%, which includes an impact of $7.6 million associated with the recently-enacted 2017 Tax Act, compared to an effective tax rate of 42% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income was $6.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $9.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income ii was $24.3 million and adjusted earnings per share ii were $0.38 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $18.6 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We ended 2017 with $169.4 billion in assets under management, driven by the addition of $20.5 billion in gross AUM from new clients, an increase of 15% year over year,” said Craig Foster, chief financial officer of Financial Engines. “Our accelerating asset flows, solid financial results, and expanding margins in 2017 reflects our focus and commitment to effectively balance near-term profitability while investing in our long-term growth.”\nAssets Under Contract and Assets Under Management\nWorkplace AUC increased 16% year-over-year to $1.22 trillion as of December 31, 2017 from $1.05 trillion as of December 31, 2016, due primarily to market performance, new employers making the Company’s services available and contributions, partially offset by cancellations and withdrawals.\nAUM increased by 23% year-over-year to $169.4 billion as of December 31, 2017, from $138.0 billion as of December 31, 2016. The increase in AUM was driven primarily by new assets from new and existing clients, and market performance, partially offset by cancellations and withdrawals.\nQ1'17 Q2'17 Q3'17 Q4'17 (In billions) AUM, beginning of period $ 138.0 $ 144.4 $ 151.8 $ 160.2 New assets - new clients (1) 3.4 5.3 5.4 6.4 New assets - existing clients (2) 2.4 2.4 2.5 2.5 Asset cancellations - voluntary (3) (2.1 ) (1.6 ) (1.6 ) (2.1 ) Asset cancellations - involuntary (4) (2.7 ) (3.3 ) (1.9 ) (3.3 ) Assets withdrawn - existing clients (5) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Net new assets 0.8 2.7 4.2 3.3 Market movement and other (6) 5.6 4.7 4.2 5.9 AUM, end of period $ 144.4 $ 151.8 $ 160.2 $ 169.4 (1) New assets from new clients represents the aggregate amount of new AUM, measured at or near the end of the quarter, from new clients who enrolled in its professional management service.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP adjusted net income, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before net interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, including internal use software, amortization and impairment of direct response advertising, amortization of deferred sales commissions, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, as well as expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions, severance and benefits expenses related to restructuring activities, and losses incurred on acquisitions, if applicable for the period. Adjusted net income represents net income before non-cash stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets related to assets acquired, including customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, expenses related to the closing and integration of acquisitions, severance and benefits expenses related to restructuring activities, and losses incurred on acquisitions, if applicable for the period, partially offset by the estimated tax impact of these items, and certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances, income tax impacts from non-deductible transaction expenses related to acquisitions, and the accounting effects of the recently-enacted tax reform, if applicable for the period. Adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. Further information regarding the non-GAAP performance measures included in this press release, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, is contained in the financial tables and will be contained in the Company’s Form 10-K to be filed for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide its Board of Directors, management and investors with additional information and greater transparency with respect to our performance and decision-making. We feel these performance measures provide investors and others with a better understanding and ability to evaluate our operating results and future prospects and provides the same performance measurement information as utilized by management. These adjustments to the Company’s GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nOur management uses non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of operating performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of annual budgets, to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance. In addition, management currently uses non-GAAP measures in determining cash incentive compensation.\nAbout Financial Engines\nWith roots in Silicon Valley, Financial Engines is the nation’s largest independent investment advisor.
