    "text": "By Flora Carr 9:09 AM EST \nA Japanese company is set to build a skyscraper made of 90% wood in Tokyo , which will make it the world’s tallest wooden skyscraper upon completion. \nSumitomo Forestry (smfrf) , the Japanese wood products company, is planning to build the skyscraper to commemorate its 350th anniversary in 2041. \nThe wooden high-rise, named “W350”, will be a “braced tube structure” at 350 meters (1,150 ft) tall and 70 stories, according to a Sumitomo Forestry statement. To construct it, 180,000 cubic meters of indigenous wood will be combined with the other 10% of the building’s makeup—steel. \nThe plans for the building include balconies on all four sides of the skyscraper that “offer… a view of biodiversity in an urban setting,” and an “interior structure… of a pure wood, producing a calm space that exudes the warmth and gentleness of wood”. \nThe internal framework of “braced tubes” also takes account of Japan’s high rates of seismic activity , “to prevent deformation of the building due to lateral forces such as earthquakes or wind”. \nThe total cost of the building will be approximately $5.6 billion (600 billion yen), roughly twice the amount of a conventional high-rise building, according to CNBC . \nThe current tallest wooden building, Brock Commons , is 53 meters (174 ft) and 18 stories high. It serves as student residence at the University of British Colombia, Vancouver. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
