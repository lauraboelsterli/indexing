The performance of its cloud and cybersecurity businesses is encouraging, although with a margin of about 6 percent they are less profitable than the mobile and fixed line businesses, which have margins about 40 percent.\n“The NAS business is a less percentage profitable business than our legacy businesses but we’re very pleased with the progress that we’ve made,” Telstra Chief Financial Officer Warwick Bray told Reuters in a phone interview.\n“We see that very strongly as the future.”\nThe company’s overall net profit for the half was A$1.7 billion ($1.35 billion), its lowest interim profit in five years and coming in below an average A$1.9 billion forecast by three analysts polled by Reuters.\nOther metrics were tracking within company forecasts, including earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which was A$5.2 billion compared with full-year guidance for between A$10.1 billion and A$10.6 billion.\nShares in the company, which have lost a third of their value in the past 12 months, rose 1.3 percent on Thursday, along with the broader market.\n“I think for a re-rate they need growth prospects, and it’s not necessarily clear where that comes from,” said Ric Spooner, Chief Market Strategist at brokerage CMC Markets.\nBROADBAND-AID\nOn top of the headwinds hitting the sector worldwide, Telstra, itself a former government monopoly, faces an additional challenge from a new government-owned broadband network that is upending Australia’s telecommunications landscape.\nThe fiber-optic system will replace Telstra’s copper lines within about four years, and the company forecasts that will lop about A$3 billion from its earnings every year once it is completed.\n“We essentially move from being the wholesale provider of fixed networks in Australia to being a reseller,” Telstra Chief Executive Andy Penn told analysts on a conference call on Thursday.\nThe rollout has hurt earnings at rivals TPG Telecom Ltd and Vocus Group Ltd, and was one reason Telstra cut its guidance last year and said it would slash its dividend in 2017-2018.\nIt announced an interim dividend of 11 Australian cents on Thursday, its lowest half-year payout in 15 years.
