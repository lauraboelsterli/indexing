    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 8:57 AM / Updated 16 minutes ago Turkey dismisses French marks on Syria campaign as 'insults' Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey on Thursday dismissed cautionary remarks from France about its military operation in northern Syria as “insults”, signalling continued strain between Ankara and its NATO allies over the incursion. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday warned Turkey that the operation in the northern Afrin region should not become an excuse to invade Syria and that he wanted Ankara to coordinate its action with its allies. \nTurkey launched the air and ground offensive, dubbed “Operation Olive Branch”, nearly two weeks ago to target the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin. But the incursion has put pressure on relations with the West, particularly the United States, which has backed the Kurdish fighters and has its own troops on the ground supporting them in other parts of Syria. \n“We consider a country like France giving us reminders about an operation we are carrying out in accordance with international laws to be insults,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara.

REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi \n“We are using our right to self defence, this is in line with UN Security Council decisions and not an invasion. They shouldn’t be two-faced,” he said. \nFrance, like the United States, has extended arms and training to a YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. That has infuriated Turkey, which considers the YPG terrorists and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
