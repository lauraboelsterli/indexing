    "text": "U.S. stock index futures posted strong gains ahead of Thursday's open, extending a rally seen in previous sessions. Stocks were poised to open higher despite further gains in Treasury yields.\nDow futures were up 149 points at around 8:30 a.m. ET, indicating a rise of 150.51 points at the open. The Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures also suggested markets would begin trade in the black.\nDuring Wednesday's session, indexes went on a roller-coaster ride, after inflation data rattled investor sentiment.\nMichael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images U.S. Stocks Plunge Heading Into Market Close Ahead of the Wall Street open Wednesday, U.S. futures reversed gains to trade sharply down, after inflation data came in above market estimates. The consumer price index rose 0.5 percent in January , beating forecasts of a 0.3 percent increase — triggering a sharp reaction from domestic markets and from overseas.\nDespite the data — and the subsequent jump in Treasury yields — Wall Street recovered and managed to close sharply higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up more than 250 points.\nThe benchmark 10-year note yield rose to 2.94 percent, hitting a fresh four-year high.\nOn the data front Thursday, jobless claims increased by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 230,000, rebounding from a near 45-year low. The price producer index, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent in January, in line with expectations.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nElsewhere, markets overseas were trading higher, while investors will be paying close attention to the bond market. Concerns of rising inflation have recently sent jitters down Wall Street.\nLast week, all three major U.S. indexes finished the five-day trading period more than 5 percent down each, with the Dow delivering its worst performance in two years.\nWATCH: When the market tanks, it pays to stay invested show chapters When the market tanks, it pays to stay invested 3:56 PM ET Wed, 7 Feb 2018 | 01:02",
