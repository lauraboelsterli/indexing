    "text": "DRUM Agency: Where Creative Content, Media, Data and Technology Move in Rhythm\nNEW YORK & CHICAGO & ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- After a year-and-a-half of close collaboration and one recent acquisition, five award-winning agencies have synchronized talents to create DRUM Agency. The pulse of the marketing services industry beats the loudest when there is a harmonious offering of creative content, media, data and technology. As a result, consumers are moving in rhythm with the goals of DRUM’s clients.\nThe firms that have merged to form DRUM Agency include: unified.agency, BKV, Hiccup, Umarketing and CO&P.\nThe new agency will maintain offices in Chicago, New York and Atlanta, as well as satellite offices in other markets. DRUM offers a wide range of services, including: social media, content strategy, paid online search, SEO, marketing automation, eCRM, public relations, direct marketing, customer insights, strategic planning, campaign analysis and tech consulting. Regardless of the channel and service, DRUM performs tirelessly to exceed client expectations.\n“The roots of DRUM Agency began at the award-winning unified.agency, but the pulse of the market has changed, and so have we,” says Ken Lomasney, Drum Agency COO. “Based on client demand, we’ve expanded our areas of service and focus to meet their growing needs. For example, we are launching several new technology products this year and we have just acquired a PR firm.”\nGeorge Wiedemann, DRUM Agency CEO, sees the changes as especially promising. “Everywhere you look, there are siloed departments and services. We knew to really bring unified marketing to our clients, we needed to create a world without internal walls. That means one P&L across the agency, as well as expanded technology, tools, services and processes. Together, they allow us to operate, execute and optimize across all aspects of the marketing and communications industry. We’re excited about the re-brand, and even more excited about some of the new proprietary tools we’ll be rolling out to our clients this year.”\nUnder this new agency, both prospects and current clients — such as AT&T, Chase, PayPal, Aflac, SPANX, Carhartt, American Red Cross, R.K. Redding Construction, Mill Town Music Hall and Wounded Warrior Project — will continue to receive custom-made, customer-centric and current solutions for the ever-evolving needs of the marketplace. With more than three billion banner impressions, 31 million pieces of direct mail, 328 million emails, and six million keywords managed each year, the DRUM team of experts are recognized for their groundbreaking campaign results.\nThe combined firms have received numerous awards and recognitions, including unified.agency being selected as one of Inc. 5000’s fastest-growing private companies and BKV as Top Workplaces in Atlanta by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Meanwhile, both Hiccup and unified.agency were named to the Chief Marketer Top 200 list.\nBy combining their marketing talents, the newly-branded DRUM is resonating within the industry, its clients, and consumers.\nAbout DRUM Agency:\nCreative content, media, technology and analytics: At DRUM, they do more than coexist. They move in perfect synchronization — not only with each other, but with the goals of our clients. There’s an irresistible beat that gets brands noticed, gets people talking and, above all, gets results.
