(NASDAQ: SGYP) concerning possible violations of federal securities laws.\nOn September 5, 2017, Synergy issued a press release announcing it had closed on a “non-dilutive” $300 million loan from CRG Partners III L.P., which would be available to Synergy “when needed” and fund the Company’s operations through 2019. On November 14, 2017, Synergy revealed that terms of the loan agreement, omitted from prior statements regarding the loan, prevented it from accessing $200 million of the loan without conducting a dilutive secondary offering or offerings of shares to raise cash and, as such, the Company was conducting a secondary offering of its shares.
