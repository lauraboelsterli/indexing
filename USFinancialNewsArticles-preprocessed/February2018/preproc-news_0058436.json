    "text": "Discussion to focus on Phase 3 development plans for GMI-1271 in AML\nROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GlycoMimetics, Inc. (Nasdaq: GLYC) announced today that it will host a conference call and webcast to provide an update on development plans for GMI-1271 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as to report its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results on Tuesday, March 6, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nThe dial-in number for the conference call is (844) 413-7154 for domestic participants and (216) 562-0466 for international participants, with participant code 1453008. A webcast replay will be available via the “Investors” tab on the GlycoMimetics website for 30 days following the call. A dial-in phone replay will be available for 24 hours after the close of the call by dialing (855) 859-2056 for domestic participants and (404) 537-3406 for international participants, participant code 1453008.\nAbout GMI-1271\nGlycoMimetics plans to initiate in mid-2018 a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating GMI-1271 in relapsed/refractory AML patients. In the recently completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial, GMI-1271 was evaluated in both newly diagnosed elderly and relapsed/refractory patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In both populations, patients treated with GMI-1271 together with standard chemotherapy achieved better than expected remission rates and overall survival compared to historical controls, as well as lower than expected induction-related mortality rates. Importantly, treatment in this patient population was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. The candidate drug is designed to block E-selectin (an adhesion molecule on cells in the bone marrow) from binding with blood cancer cells as a targeted approach to disrupting well-established mechanisms of leukemic cell resistance within the bone marrow microenvironment.\nAbout GlycoMimetics, Inc.\nGlycoMimetics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel glycomimetic drugs to address unmet medical needs resulting from diseases in which carbohydrate biology plays a key role. GlycoMimetics' most advanced drug candidate, rivipansel, a pan-selectin antagonist, is being developed for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease and a Phase 3 clinical trial being conducted by its strategic collaborator, Pfizer is expected to read out in the second half of 2018. GlycoMimetics' wholly-owned drug candidate, GMI-1271, an E-selectin antagonist, was evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial as a potential treatment for AML, and the Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 trial in AML in 2018. Clinicians are also currently evaluating GMI-1271 in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The FDA recently granted GMI-1271 Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult AML patients with relapsed/refractory disease. GlycoMimetics has also recently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial with a third drug candidate, GMI-1359, a combined CXCR4 and E-selectin antagonist. GlycoMimetics is located in Rockville, MD in the BioHealth Capital Region.
