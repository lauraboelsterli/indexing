Intercept.com Quote: d Jennifer Willoughby as saying that Porter was abusive.\n“These outrageous allegations are simply false,” Porter said in a statement released by the White House. “I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign.”\nPorter said he would ”seek to ensure a smooth transition when I leave the White House.”\nReporting By Steve Holland\n ",
