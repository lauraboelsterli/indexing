Anderson collected his fourth career title, his first as a top seed, and is expected to improve to ninth in the world rankings on Monday. After a third set that went to serve, Anderson unleashed his 16th ace in the second point of the tiebreak and never looked back before he achieved victory with a crosscourt winner.
