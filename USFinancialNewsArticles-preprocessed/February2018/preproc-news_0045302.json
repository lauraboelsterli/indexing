At 9:48AM EST (1448 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 6.89 points, or 0.04 percent, to 15,459.53. * The energy group climbed 0.4 percent, with Crew Energy Inc and Birchcliff Energy both rising 3 percent. * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Capital Power Corp, which rose 4.8 percent, while the largest decliner was Uni-Select Inc, down 14.7 percent. * Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, up 2.1 percent to $10.34; Bombardier B , unchanged at $3.73 and Canopy Growth Co, up 3.8 percent to $27.51. * The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.6 percent. * Gold futures fell 1.2 percent to $1,337.2 an ounce. * Copper prices declined 0.2 percent to $7,104 a tonne. * The TSX posted three new 52-week highs and three new lows. * Canadian wholesale trade fell 0.5 percent due to lower sales in the personal and household goods sector, Statistics Canada said. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast a 0.4 percent increase. (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio)",
