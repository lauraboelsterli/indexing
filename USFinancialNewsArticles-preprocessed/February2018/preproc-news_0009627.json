    "text": "NORTH ATTLEBORO, MA, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mosquito Shield Franchise Corporation celebrated a year of growth and expansion at its annual owners meeting held recently in Miami Beach, FL.\nFor Mosquito Shield, 2017 proved to be a banner year as the company expanded its national footprint to 26 states and successfully completed its first major acquisition.\nEarly in the year, Mosquito Shield Franchise Corporation entered into an agreement with Green Home Solutions to acquire its residential mosquito and tick control franchises. As a result of the deal, Mosquito Shield doubled the size of its organization to close to 100 franchise territories.\n“We are excited to bring the Mosquito Terminators franchise owners and their customers into the Mosquito Shield family,” said David Briggs, CEO of Mosquito Shield, at the time of the acquisition. “We are making every effort to provide a seamless transition for both.”\nAlso in 2017, Mosquito Shield Franchise Corporation was named one of Entrepreneur’s Top New Franchises. The designation came in the April 2017 edition of Entrepreneur Magazine. The list recognizes the top 100 companies that have been franchising for five years or less, based on data submitted for Entrepreneur’s Franchise 500 ® ranking.\nMosquito Shield currently offers mosquito control and tick control services throughout the country, delivering effective solutions, professional service, and guaranteed results to a rapidly growing base of satisfied customers.\nMosquito Shield was founded in 2001 to fill the need for an effective and affordable residential mosquito and tick treatment. The company developed Mosquito Protection Barrier™ (MPB), a patent pending spray that rids properties of the existing mosquito population and builds a barrier around that property for a virtually mosquito-free environment. MPB includes FlexBlend, the industry’s only intelligent spray-blend technology.\nMosquito Shield Franchise Corporation began operations in 2013.\nMosquito Shield’s annual Owner’s Meeting gives current franchise owners a chance to exchange ideas on best practices, learn about new company products and protocols, and participate in committees that help lead the direction of the company.\nFor more information on participating in a Mosquito Shield franchise, visit www.moshieldfranchise.com or email Michael Moorhouse at Michael@moshield.com .\nAttachments:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cbb543cb-a7ee-4f90-831a-d65da14c7489\nMichael Moorhouse Mosquito Shield 508-316-3429 Michael@moshield.com\nSource: Mosquito Shield",
