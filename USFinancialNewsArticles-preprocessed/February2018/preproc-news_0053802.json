    "text": "In February, Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi mentioned that she wanted to make snacks that cater to women —less mess, less crunch, less crinkly bags. Cue a full-blown Internet backlash over “Lady Doritos.” (Doritos tweeted that the chips would not be created.)\nBut Nooyi wasn’t alone in wanting to tweak a successful model to suit a female audience. The past year has seen a proliferation of women-focused companies. High-end razor service Billie , which has been called the “Dollar Shave Club for women,” launched in December and is on the verge of selling out its inventory. Ellevest , a digital investment platform (similarly nicknamed “Wealthfront for women”), promotes strategies that account for women’s earnings and life expectancy. And WeWork-esque women-only coworking spaces have flourished (see: the Wing, the Riveter, Hera Hub, and more).\nThe fear? Companies will create comparable products and charge more, exacerbating the “ pink tax ” already paid by women in many categories. (So far most of these startups are priced competitively.) The promise, though, is more businesses whose primary audience isn’t a tech bro, but the too-often overlooked other half of the population.\nA version of this article appears in the March 2018 issue of Fortune with the headline “Forget ‘Uber for X,’ Try ‘X for Women’.”",
