    "text": "BERLIN, Feb 6 (Reuters) - German industrial orders rose more than expected in December, data showed on Tuesday, supporting expectations that Europe’s largest economy is on track for another year of solid growth after expanding by 2.2 percent in 2017.\nFactories registered a 3.8 percent increase in orders. December’s reading from the Federal Statistics Office was way over expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.7 percent rise.\nContracts for ‘Made in Germany’ goods fell by 0.1 percent in November, an upward revision from a fall of 0.4 percent previously reported.\nReporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Madeline Chambers\n ",
