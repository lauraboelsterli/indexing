(NYSE:MWA) announced today that for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $178.3 million and net income was $55.1 million, which included an income tax benefit of $42.6 million for remeasuring the Company's net deferred income tax liabilities due to recently enacted federal income tax legislation.\nIn the 2018 first quarter, the Company:\nIncreased net sales $11.1 million, or 6.6 percent, to $178.3 million, as compared with $167.2 million in the prior year quarter. Improved operating income 45.8 percent to $20.7 million, as compared with $14.2 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income was $15.6 million in the quarter and $15.5 million in the prior year quarter. Increased income from continuing operations to $55.1 million from $5.4 million in the prior year quarter, and increased adjusted net income 39.7 percent to $8.8 million, as compared with $6.3 million in the prior year quarter. Sold an idle property for a gain of $9.0 million and incurred other charges of $3.9 million, which were primarily related to its previously announced strategic reorganization. Generated net income per diluted share of $0.34 and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.06, ﻿as compared with both net income per diluted share and adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.04 in the prior year quarter.\n“I was pleased by the 6.6 percent growth in net sales. We had a strong increase in Infrastructure driven by higher shipment volumes, last year's addition of Singer Valve and favorable pricing. These factors were partially offset by lower shipment volumes in Technologies’ meter business,” said Scott Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mueller Water Products. “We delivered continued manufacturing productivity improvements this quarter; however, they were not enough to offset the impact of substantially higher material costs.\n“The new tax legislation will be an ongoing benefit to the Company's liquidity and earnings. We expect our full year 2018 effective income tax rate, excluding the one-time effects of adoption, will be between 26 and 29 percent. We will continue to balance our capital allocation among strategic investments to strengthen and grow the business and return cash to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $10 million in shares during the first quarter, and we recently declared a 25 percent increase in our quarterly dividend.\n“We remain confident in our ability to deliver both strong consolidated net sales growth and conversion margin improvement for 2018, driven by healthy end markets and continued execution of our strategic initiatives.”\nConsolidated Results\nNet sales for the 2018 first quarter increased $11.1 million, or 6.6 percent, to $178.3 million, as compared with $167.2 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nAdjusted operating income was $15.6 million for the 2018 first quarter and $15.5 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nSegment Results\nInfrastructure\nNet sales for the 2018 first quarter increased $13.8 million, or 9.4 percent, to $160.1 million, as compared with $146.3 million in the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to higher shipment volumes, the addition of Singer Valve’s net sales and favorable pricing.\nAdjusted operating income for the 2018 first quarter increased 6.8 percent to $28.1 million, as compared with $26.3 million in the 2017 first quarter. Adjusted operating income increased primarily due to higher shipment volumes, favorable pricing and manufacturing productivity improvements, which were partially offset by higher material costs.\nTechnologies\nNet sales for the 2018 first quarter decreased $2.7 million to $18.2 million, as compared with $20.9 million in the 2017 first quarter. While Echologics’ net sales increased, this growth was more than offset by a decline in Mueller Systems’ net sales.\nAdjusted operating losses were $4.6 million in the 2018 first quarter and $2.2 million in the 2017 first quarter. This decline in adjusted operating results was primarily due to lower shipment volumes at Mueller Systems.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net for the 2018 first quarter decreased to $5.2 million, as compared with $6.4 million in the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to higher interest income this year.\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, tax legislation was enacted that made significant revisions to federal income tax laws, including lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, overhauling the taxation of income earned outside the United States and eliminating or limiting certain deductions. Since the effective date of the tax rate change was January 1, 2018, the Company is subject to a blended federal statutory tax rate of 24.5 percent throughout fiscal 2018.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, the Company reported a net income tax benefit of $39.8 million, which was driven by a benefit of $42.6 million related to remeasurement of its net deferred income tax liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect when the Company expects to recognize the related tax expenses or benefits. Other than this remeasurement benefit, income tax expense was $2.8 million, or 18.3 percent of income before income taxes. This rate differs from the blended rate primarily due to the impacts of state income taxes and discrete items, particularly certain effects of stock compensation transactions. For the 2017 first quarter, income tax expense was 28.0 percent of income before income taxes.\nAlso under this legislation, the Company is subject to a one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings, but the amount of this tax is not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, no provision for this tax has been recorded, but will be recorded later in 2018.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company sold its Anvil business in the 2017 second quarter. Amounts applicable to Anvil have been classified as discontinued operations.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's results as determined under GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP information that management believes is useful to investors. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe Company presents adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as performance measures because management uses these measures in evaluating the Company's underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods and in making decisions about operational strategies. Management also believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company's recurring performance.\nThe Company presents net debt and net debt leverage as performance measures because management uses them in evaluating its capital management, and the investment community commonly uses them as measures of indebtedness. The Company presents free cash flow because management believes it is commonly used by the investment community to measure the Company's ability to create liquidity.\nThe calculations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to GAAP results are included as an attachment to this press release and have been posted online at www.muellerwaterproducts.com .\nConference Call Webcast\nMueller Water Products’ quarterly earnings conference call will take place Friday, February 2, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.
