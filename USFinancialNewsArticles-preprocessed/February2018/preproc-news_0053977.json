    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Steward Partners Global Advisory, LLC, an employee-owned, full-service independent partnership associated with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (member FINRA/SIPC), announced today that Alan Raffer , Director, Sherry Birnbaum CFP Â® , Senior Vice President, and Jeremy Raffer , Senior Vice President, of the Raffer Investment Group have joined Steward Partners from Wells Fargo, where they managed over $170 million in client assets. The three advisors will be based in Steward's newest office in Paramus, New Jersey, which launched in November of last year.\n\"We're excited to welcome high-caliber advisors like Alan, Sherry and Jeremy to our team,\" said Jim Gold, Steward's chief executive officer. \"They will be an outstanding complement to the partners at our new Paramus office. The Raffer Investment Group epitomizes what Steward Partners is all about: great people running great businesses.\"\nFor Alan Raffer, Steward's model offers the best of both worlds. \"Being independent means that we have the flexibility to create and manage investment plans that prioritize our clients' goals and help them to prepare for their financial futures. At the same time, the combination of Steward Partners and Raymond James provides our team with the resources, technology and support to enable us to deliver the concierge-level service that our clients deserve.\"\n\"We were very impressed by the management team and firm culture at Steward,\" added Sherry Birnbaum. \"The idea of partnership and equity ownership appealed to us as well. As we considered our options, we needed to assess how to move forward in a way that enhanced the strong relationships we've built over the years with our clients. The more that we learned about Steward Partners, the more convinced we became that this was the right decision for both our team and our clients.\"\nJeremy Raffer likewise noted the advantages of Steward's relationship with Raymond James. \"The platform is exceptionally sophisticated, and it offers all the products and services that individual investors require. Having the freedom to develop client-focused financial planning strategies and the infrastructure to execute on those strategies is really a winning combination.\"\nSince November 2013, Steward Partners has added over 90 advisors with over $62 million in trailing 12-month production and over $8.5 billion in total client assets.
