The best of Reuters news delivered right into your email box absolutely free.\nHighlights\nThe board of directors of The Weinstein Company said yesterday the New York film and TV studio planned to file for bankruptcy after talks to sell it collapsed, several media outlets reported.\nFederal prosecutors who have already indicted Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort on charges of money laundering, bank fraud and covertly lobbying for pro-Russian interests may have additional leverage arising from a loan he received while engaged in the bankruptcies of properties in California, several former law enforcement officials say. Reuters has found new information about Manafort’s handling of the loan and its potential link to the bankruptcies.\nA Florida sheriff came under mounting criticism yesterday for his deputies’ response to this month’s deadly high school shooting and potential warning signs as dozens of state lawmakers called for his ouster and the governor ordered an independent inquiry.\nCommentary\nLast year, human rights researchers documented an alarming rise in state-sponsored hate speech online, writes Sherif Elsayed-Ali, director of global issues at Amnesty International . “Donald Trump’s retweets of anti-Muslim videos first circulated by an anti-immigrant, far-right British party were just the tip of the iceberg…. In 2017, politicians in many countries deployed social media to spread hate-filled agendas.\nWorld\nChinese speculators pounced on stocks with “emperor” in their name , after the ruling Communist Party set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely.
