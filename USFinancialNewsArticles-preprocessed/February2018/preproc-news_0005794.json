    "text": "MCMURRAY, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mark Farrah Associates (MFA), www.markfarrah.com , released an analysis brief presenting a snapshot of third quarter 2017 profit margins for leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) plans. BCBS plans continue to be health insurance leaders. The Blues brand has generated broad-based market appeal for decades with 36 independent and locally operated Blue Cross Blue Shield companies across all 50 states. According to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, more than 96% of hospitals and 93% of doctors and specialists contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.\nThe six leading BCBS affiliated insurers include: GuideWell (BCBS FL), Blue Shield of CA, Anthem, Highmark, Independence Blue Cross (IBX), Health Care Service Corp. (HCSC). As of September 30, 2017, these industry leaders reported improved profitability comparing year over year performance based on available statutory reporting. Highmark and HCSC experienced the largest margin improvements primarily due to revenue, which outpaced the growth of medical costs, along with decreased spending on administrative costs. Subscribers to MFA’s Health Coverage Portal TM may routinely access membership and financials for health plans industrywide with the benefit of filtering data for Blues plans only.\nTo read the full text of \" Improved Profit Margins for Leading Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans in Third Quarter 2017 ,\" visit the Analysis Briefs library on Mark Farrah Associates' website.\nAbout Mark Farrah Associates (MFA)\nMFA is a leading data aggregator and publisher providing health plan market data and analysis tools for the healthcare industry.
