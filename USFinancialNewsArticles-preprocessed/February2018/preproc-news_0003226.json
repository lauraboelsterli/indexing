We produced another quarter of organic revenue growth, record operating income, and strong cash flow. These results reflect continued high-quality execution for our customers across our company and are in line with our expectations to deliver on our long-term organic revenue and margin expansion goals. We are raising our net income annual guidance to account for strong operating performance year-to-date and expectations for the remainder of FY18. In addition, we are incorporating the benefits we have derived from the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our guidance.”\nSecond Quarter Results as Reported\n(in millions except per-share data) Q2, FY18 Q2, FY17 % Change Revenue $1,087.9 $1,057.5 2.9% Operating income $88.3 $80.3 10.0% Net income $142.8 $42.4 236.6% Diluted earnings per share $5.66 $1.69 234.7% Second Quarter Results Excluding the Impact of Tax Reform (1)\n(in millions except per-share data) Q2, FY18 Q2, FY17 % Change Revenue $1,087.9 $1,057.5 2.9% Operating income $88.3 $80.3 10.0% Net income, excluding the impact of Tax Reform (1) $50.5 $42.4 19.1% Diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of Tax Reform (1) $2.00 $1.69 18.5% (1) See Reconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income excluding the impact of Tax Reform page 11\nRevenue for the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) increased compared to the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2017 (FY17), driven primarily by on-contract growth of existing work and new business wins. The higher operating income was due primarily to improved program execution. The increase in net income was due to the factors noted above and the impact of the passage of Tax Reform legislation, as depicted in the above table and further explained below. Cash provided by operations in the quarter was $76.1 million.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and is reflected in our second quarter net income and EPS. On an ongoing basis, our statutory federal income tax rate will be 21 percent versus 35 percent, and we will be impacted by several other Tax Reform provisions. In addition, our second quarter net income benefited from a reduction in our net deferred tax liability of $94.8 million due to the lower tax rate, partially offset by a tax expense of $9.7 million associated with cumulative foreign earnings. We expect our net effective tax rate in Fiscal Year 2019 and beyond to be approximately 24 percent under the current law. Tax Reform increased second quarter net income by $92.3 million (or $3.66 per diluted share). See page 11 of this release for a reconciliation of second quarter results as reported to second quarter results excluding the impact of Tax Reform as reported.\nAdditional Financial Metrics\nQ2, FY18 Q2, FY17 % Change Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a non-GAAP measure (in millions) (1) $105.4 $98.8 6.7% Diluted adjusted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure (1) $6.31 $2.30 173.8% Days sales outstanding 61 60 (1) See Reconciliation of Net Income to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, to Adjusted Net Income on page 10\nSecond Quarter Awards and Contract Funding Orders\nOur contract awards in the quarter were $1.1 billion, which excludes ceiling values of multi-award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Our contract awards were primarily in the Business Systems and Intelligence-related market areas. Approximately 40 percent of our significant awards were for new business.\nContract funding orders in the second quarter were $750 million, equal to the second quarter of FY17. Our total backlog at December 31, 2017 was $10.9 billion. Funded backlog at December 31, 2017 was $1.9 billion.\nOther Highlights\nCACI has been ranked by Fortune magazine as a World’s Most Admired Company for 2018, our seventh time on the list.

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), and Adjusted Net Income\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company views Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share, all of which are defined as non-GAAP measures, as important indicators of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a commonly used non-GAAP measure when comparing our results with those of other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and earnout adjustments. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business on a consistent basis across reporting periods, as it eliminates the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation of tangible assets, amortization of intangible assets primarily recognized in business combinations, as well as the effect of earnout gains and losses, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. We define Adjusted Net Income as GAAP net income plus stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of financing costs, and earnout adjustments, net of related tax effects. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of long-term value and is used by investors to measure our performance. This measure in particular assists readers in further understanding our results and trends from period-to-period by removing certain non-cash items that do not impact the cash flow performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income as defined by us may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nQuarter Ended Six Months Ended (dollars in thousands) 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change Net income $ 142,795 $ 42,420 236.6 % $ 184,841 $ 79,083 133.7 % Plus: Income taxes (65,489 ) 25,510 -356.7 % (51,478 ) 46,016 -211.9 % Interest expense, net 10,956 12,325 -11.1 % 22,203 24,918 -10.9 % Depreciation and amortization 18,258 18,132 0.7 % 35,846 36,195 -1.0 % Earnout adjustments (1,131 ) 406 -378.6 % (2,013 ) 820 -345.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,389 $ 98,793 6.7 % $ 189,399 $ 187,032 1.3 % Quarter Ended Six Months Ended (dollars in thousands) 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change Revenue, as reported $ 1,087,860 $ 1,057,530 2.9 % $ 2,173,674 $ 2,130,810 2.0 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,389 $ 98,793 6.7 % $ 189,399 $ 187,032 1.3 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 9.7 % 9.3 % 8.7 % 8.8 % Quarter Ended Six Months Ended (dollars in thousands) 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 % Change Net income $ 142,795 $ 42,420 236.6 % $ 184,841 $ 79,083 133.7 % Plus: Stock-based compensation 6,038 5,660 6.7 % 12,389 10,557 17.4 % Depreciation and amortization 18,258 18,132 0.7 % 35,846 36,195 -1.0 % Amortization of financing costs 1,104 1,124 -1.8 % 2,212 2,252 -1.8 % Earnout adjustments (1,131 ) 406 -378.6 % (2,013 ) 820 -345.5 % Less: Related tax effect (7,980 ) (9,965 ) -19.9 % (15,925 ) (19,608 ) -18.8 % Adjusted net income $ 159,084 $ 57,777 175.3 % $ 217,350 $ 109,299 98.9 %\nSelected Financial Data (Continued)\nReconciliation of Net Income Excluding the Impact of Tax Reform\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company views Net Income excluding the impact of Tax Reform, a non-GAAP measure, as an important indicator of performance, consistent with the manner in which management measures and forecasts the Company’s performance. Net Income excluding the impact of Tax Reform is defined as GAAP Net Income adjusted to exclude the impact of Tax Reform. We believe this is an important calculation to show company performance without the benefits of Tax Reform. Management is incented to perform via metrics without the impact of Tax Reform. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThree Months Six Months (Amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) 12/31/2017 12/31/2017 Net Diluted Net Diluted Income EPS Income EPS Net Income, as reported $ 142,795 $ 5.66 $ 184,841 $ 7.33 Tax reform benefit from lower tax rate and other items (7,100 ) (0.28 ) (7,100 ) (0.28 ) Net Income before remeasurement and transition tax reform adjustments $ 135,695 $ 5.38 $ 177,741 $ 7.05 Remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities (94,831 ) (3.76 ) (94,831 ) (3.76 ) Transition tax on foreign earnings 9,676 0.38 9,676 0.38 Net income, excluding impact of tax reform $ 50,540 $ 2.00 $ 92,586 $ 3.67\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180131006178/en/\nCACI International Inc\nCorporate Communications and Media:\nJody Brown\nExecutive Vice President, Public Relations\n(703) 841-7801\njbrown@caci.com\nor\nInvestor Relations:\nDavid Dragics\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n(866) 606-3471\nddragics@caci.com\nSource: CACI International Inc",
