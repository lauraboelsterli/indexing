    "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures opened weaker on Sunday, extending the rout equity markets experienced on Friday which saw the benchmark S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial average notch their worst week since early January 2016.\nS&P 500 e-minis were down 18, or 0.63 percent.\nU.S. Treasury futures prices rose at the open of trading with 10 year note futures up 3/32 of a point in price in early trading. Rising bond yields and prospects for increasing inflation undermined equities and pushed benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to a four-year high on Friday.\nReporting by Daniel Bases; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
