    "text": " 37 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago Manchester City thrash Arsenal to win League Cup final Martyn Herman 1 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Pep Guardiola claimed his maiden English silverware as goals by Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and David Silva gave his Manchester City side an easy 3-0 victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final on Sunday. The first ever domestic final clash between the sides was a largely disappointing affair at a freezing Wembley Stadium but runaway Premier League leaders City had far too much for an Arsenal side who suffered a forgettable afternoon. Slideshow (11 Images) Aguero’s 18th-minute goal gave City a halftime lead and Arsenal withered after the break as Kompany prodded in from close range after 58 minutes before Silva effectively ended the contest seven minutes later with a left-foot finish. After a trophy-less first season in charge of City, Guardiola’s career trophy haul as a manager now stands at 19, having won 11 with Barcelona and seven at Bayern Munich. Arsenal have now lost a record six League Cup finals while City have won it three times in five years. Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar",
