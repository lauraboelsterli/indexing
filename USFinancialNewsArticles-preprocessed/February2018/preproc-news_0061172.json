    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Admiral Capital Group (“Admiral”) and McCann Realty Partners (“McCann”) today announced the acquisition of Retreat at Riverside (formerly known as Altera Riverside), a 412-home community in Lawrenceville, Georgia within the Atlanta MSA. The property will be managed by Atlanta-based Pegasus Residential.\nRetreat at Riverside a 412-home community in Lawrenceville, Georgia within the Atlanta MSA\nThe 1996/1999 vintage property offers three-story buildings within an attractive, low-density setting across 35 acres. Retreat at Riverside is located on Duluth Highway, with close proximity to Georgia Gwinnett College, Gwinnett Medical Center Lawrenceville, and the I-85 job corridor (19 million square feet of office and 45 million square feet of industrial space).\nThe joint venture will invest capital to upgrade all unrenovated units, reduce utility consumption across the property, and add new amenities, including a package system, children’s playground, and outdoor kitchens.\n“Gwinnett County’s population growth has continued to impress us since our first investment in the submarket,” said Admiral’s Vice President of Acquisitions, Patrick Heffernan. “Retreat at Riverside was particularly attractive due to its microlocation, providing immediate access to the local job centers as well as the abundant retail amenities.”\n“We are excited to add another Atlanta community to our portfolio and expand our successful partnership with McCann,” said Admiral Co-Founder Dan Bassichis. “We identified Atlanta and the northeast high job growth corridor as an area for investment opportunity several years ago. We have had great success acquiring value add assets and transforming them into thriving communities that meet the needs of the growing population in the area.”\n“We believe Lawrenceville is a later recovery suburb of Atlanta that still has significant upside. Our team is looking forward to executing further renovations to provide the residents with an even better living experience,” said Thomas Upson, Principal and Managing Director at McCann.\nMcCann President Matthew Akin said, “We are pleased to expand our partnership with Admiral. The Atlanta MSA has a strong and very diversified employment base. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to find quality assets where we can create value through upgrades to the property and benefit from an improving submarket.”\nThe acquisition represents Admiral’s fifth investment in Atlanta bringing its units currently under management to over 2,000 across the MSA. Admiral Co-Founder David Robinson added, “Atlanta’s impressive job growth continues to make it an attractive and core investment market for Admiral.”\nCBRE’s Atlanta team led by Kevin Geiger handled sale.\nAbout Admiral Capital Group\nAdmiral Capital Group was founded by David Robinson, philanthropist and NBA Hall of Famer, and Daniel Bassichis, formerly of Goldman Sachs, to invest in real estate and private equity opportunities.
