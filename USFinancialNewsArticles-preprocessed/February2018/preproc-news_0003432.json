    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 5:51 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Muslim scholar Ramadan to remain in custody in France Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - A French judge decided on Tuesday to keep Swiss Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan in custody pending a possible trial for allegations of rape, a source with the prosecutorâ€™s office said. \nRamadan, who denies the allegations, was notified on Friday that he would be the target of a full investigation and had been in detention since. \nAfter a debate between his lawyers, prosecutors and magistrates, judges decided not to release him, taking the inquiry a step further. \nUnder French law, investigating magistrates can still decide not to hold a trial, depending on the evidence. Temporary custody is usually reserved for cases where the accused might be a flight risk. Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; writing by Michel Rose",
