Our strong margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth are the result of both M&A cost synergies and core productivity improvements. I would like to thank all of Sensata's employees who helped to make 2017 such a successful year. Looking ahead, with our strong cash flow and improved balance sheet, we have significant opportunities to augment our solid operational performance with a balanced, value-creating capital deployment strategy in 2018.”\nSegment Performance\nFor the three months ended December 31, For the full year ended December 31, $ in 000s 2017 2016 2017 2016 Performance Sensing revenue $ 634,696 $ 587,985 $ 2,460,600 $ 2,385,380 Performance Sensing profit $ 180,695 $ 161,986 $ 664,186 $ 615,526 % of Performance Sensing revenue 28.5 % 27.5 % 27.0 % 25.8 % Sensing Solutions revenue $ 205,838 $ 200,411 $ 846,133 $ 816,908 Sensing Solutions profit $ 67,539 $ 63,177 $ 277,450 $ 261,914 % of Sensing Solutions revenue 32.8 % 31.5 % 32.8 % 32.1 % Performance Sensing’s profit as a percentage of revenue totaled 28.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance, and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance. We also believe presenting these non-GAAP measures provides additional transparency into how management evaluates our business.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as, or comparable to, similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures referenced by Sensata in this release include: adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”), adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), adjusted EBIT margin, free cash flow, net debt, organic revenue growth, and segment profit margin measured on a constant currency basis. We also refer to the change of certain non-GAAP measures, usually reported either as a percentage or number of basis points, between two periods and measured on either a reported or an organic basis, the latter of which excludes the impact of acquisitions, net of exited businesses that occurred within the previous 12 months and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate differences between the comparative periods. Such changes are also considered non-GAAP measures.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described in the accompanying reconciliation tables. Adjusted net income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by net revenue. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by the number of diluted weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding in the period. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nAdjusted EBIT is defined as net income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding interest expense, net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described in the accompanying reconciliation tables. Adjusted EBIT margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBIT by net revenue. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to fund acquisitions, repurchase ordinary shares, or accelerate the repayment of debt obligations.\nNet debt is defined as total debt, capital lease and other financing obligations, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and management as an indicator of trends in our overall financial condition.\nOrganic revenue growth is defined as the reported percentage change in net revenue, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the impact of acquisitions, net of exited businesses that occurred within the previous 12 months and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate differences between the comparative periods. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nSegment profit margin measured on a constant currency basis is defined as segment profit, excluding the favorable or unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate differences with the comparative (prior) period, divided by segment revenue, also adjusted to exclude the favorable or unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate differences with the comparative (prior) period. We believe that this measure is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis earnings release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Sensata’s deferred provision for/(benefit from) income taxes includes adjustments for book-to-tax basis differences due primarily to the step-up in fair value of fixed and intangible assets and goodwill, the utilization of net operating losses, and adjustments to our U.S. valuation allowance in connection with certain acquisitions. Other tax expense/(benefit) includes certain adjustments to unrecognized tax positions.\nAs Sensata treats deferred income tax and other tax expense/(benefit) as an adjustment to compute adjusted net income, the deferred income tax effect associated with the reconciling items, above, would not change adjusted net income for any period presented.\nThe current income tax (benefit)/expense associated with the reconciling items above, which is included in adjusted net income, would be as follows: Depreciation and amortization expense related to the step-up in fair value of fixed and intangible assets and inventory: $0.0 million and $(0.0) million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $0.0 million and $(0.1) million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; and Restructuring and special charges of $(0.2) million and $(0.5) million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $(0.5) million and $(1.0) million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following unaudited table identifies where in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations the adjustments to reconcile net income to adjusted net income were recorded for the three months and full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n($ in 000s) Three months ended\nDecember 31, Full year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Cost of revenue $ 4,453 $ 6,791 $ 20,217 $ 19,653 Selling, general and administrative 3,849 262 11,216 4,140 Amortization of intangible assets 37,883 48,634 155,292 195,848 Restructuring and special charges (800 ) 857 6,243 2,829 Interest expense, net 1,713 1,833 7,241 7,334 Other, net 546 5,150 (4,695 ) (14,480 ) (Benefit from)/provision for income taxes (67,343 ) 936 (55,156 ) 17,086 Total adjustments $ (19,699 ) $ 64,463 $ 140,358 $ 232,410 The following unaudited table reconciles Sensata’s net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\n($ in 000s) Three months ended December 31, Full Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 185,367 $ 125,174 $ 557,646 $ 521,525 Additions to property, plant and equipment and capitalized software (41,048 ) (35,633 ) (144,584 ) (130,217 ) Free cash flow $ 144,319 $ 89,541 $ 413,062 $ 391,308 The following unaudited table reconciles Sensata’s diluted net income per diluted share to organic adjusted EPS growth for the three month and full year periods December 31, 2017 and 2016.
