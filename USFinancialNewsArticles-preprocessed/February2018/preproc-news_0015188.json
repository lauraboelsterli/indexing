I feel good. Part of it depends on the Democrats. This is a bipartisan bill. It’s going to need bipartisan support,” Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt. “We are going to deliver our share of support. I feel very good about Republicans who are focused on the military are very happy with where we landed on that.” Reporting by Makini BriceEditing by Jonathan Oatis",
