    "text": "February 12, 2018 / 3:13 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago Rugby union - Injured Henshaw to miss rest of Six Nations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland centre Robbie Henshaw will miss the rest of the Six Nations after injuring his shoulder in the 56-19 win over Italy in Dublin on Saturday. \nHenshaw left the pitch with his shoulder in a sling after picking up the injury when he landed awkwardly while scoring his second try. \nThe Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said in a statement that the player had undergone a procedure on his shoulder and had been ruled out of the remaining three matches of the campaign. \nProp Tadhg Furlong, who suffered a minor hamstring injury against Italy, underwent a scan but was expected to be fit for the game against Wales in Dublin on Feb. 24. \nHenshawâ€™s absence is a big loss for Ireland who are already without Garry Ringrose, who is making good progress in his recovery from an ankle injury and not far off a return, in midfield. \nIreland are level on points with holders England at the top of the Six Nations standings after wins over France and Italy.
