    "text": " 19 PM / in 6 minutes Fairfax to buy some of Carillion's Canadian services business Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFeb 5 (Reuters) - Insurer Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd said on Monday it would buy some Canadian assets of bankrupt UK-based construction and services company Carillion for an undisclosed amount. \nThe deal would include facilities management at airports, commercial and retail properties, defense and select healthcare units, Fairfax said. \nCarillion collapsed on Jan. 15 after its banks halted funding, triggering Britain’s biggest corporate failure in a decade and forcing the government to step in to guarantee public services from school meals to roadworks. \nFairfax will also assume certain liabilities related to Carillion’s Canadian operations. \nCanada is one of the largest markets for Carillion outside the UK. \nCanadian unions had previously urged Ontario’s provincial government to end hospital services privatization after the collapse of Carillion.
