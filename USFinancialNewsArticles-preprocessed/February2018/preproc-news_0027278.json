Funds for the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal also increased. \nThe 2019 budget documents specifically highlighted “reversing the erosion of the U.S. military advantage in relation to China and Russia” which was a focal point of the National Defense Strategy unveiled by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in the National Defense Strategy released in January.
