    "text": "MILAN, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Italian airline Meridiana will make Milan’s Malpensa airport its new hub, rename the carrier ‘Air Italy’ and aims to grow its fleet and passenger numbers fourfold by 2022 in a bid to become the country’s national carrier, executives said on Monday.\nMeridiana was put under new ownership last year after Qatar Airways bought a 49 percent stake in AQA Holding, the Sardinia-based carrier’s new parent, with previous sole owner Alisarda retaining 51 percent.\nAir Italy is Italy’s second-largest airline behind Alitalia, which was put under administration last year after workers rejected a plan to cut jobs and salaries.\nHowever, with a new restructuring plan - that includes the launch of new domestic and intercontinental routes - Air Italy aims to become Italy’s “airline of reference”.\nBy 2022, the carrier expects “to transport 10 million passengers a year and have a fleet of 50 aircraft,” Chairman Francesco Violante said at the launch of the new brand in Milan.\nOver the next three years, 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will be added to Air Italy’s fleet, the first of which arrives in April.\nQatar Airways will lease five of its Airbus A330-200 to Air Italy “at market prices”, said CEO Akbar Al Baker.\nNo details of planned investments were disclosed.\nAir Italy will fly out of Malpensa’s main terminal, said Pietro Modiano, chairman of SEA, the company that manages the airport.\nReporting by Massimo Gaia, writing by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Louise Heavens\n ",
