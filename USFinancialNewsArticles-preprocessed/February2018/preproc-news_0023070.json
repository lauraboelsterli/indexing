    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jones Energy Holdings, LLC (“JEH”) and Jones Energy Finance Corp. (“JEFC” and, together with JEH, the “Issuers”), both subsidiaries of Jones Energy, Inc. (NYSE:JONE) (“Jones Energy” or the “Company”), announced today that they have priced an offering of $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior secured first lien notes due 2023 (the “First Lien Notes”) at an offering price equal to 97.526% of par. The First Lien Notes will be senior secured first lien obligations of the Issuers and will be guaranteed on a senior secured first lien basis by Jones Energy and each of the Issuers’ existing and future restricted subsidiaries.\nThe offering is expected to close February 14, 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the offering to repay all but $25 million of the outstanding borrowings under JEH’s existing senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Existing Revolver”), to fund drilling and completion activities, and for other general corporate purposes, which may include limited repurchases of the Issuers’ existing 6.75% senior notes due 2022 and 9.25% senior notes due 2023 (the “Existing Notes”). In connection with the closing of the offering, JEH intends to amend and restate the Existing Revolver to, among other things, (i) reduce the borrowing base from the current $350 million to $50 million, (ii) suspend testing of our senior secured leverage ratio until March 31, 2019 and (iii) suspend certain covenants indefinitely, including the financial maintenance covenants.\nThe securities have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. Accordingly, the securities are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nAbout Jones Energy\nJones Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Anadarko basin of Texas and Oklahoma.
