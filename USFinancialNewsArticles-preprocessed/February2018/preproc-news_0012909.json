Two months later the Portuguese was sacked. \nConte’s methods underwent further scrutiny over the weekend when it was revealed that new signing Ross Barkley will miss Monday’s game at Vicarage Road after becoming the eighth Chelsea player to suffer a hamstring injury this season. \nConte has consistently said his squad is not strong enough, although striker Olivier Giroud and defender Emerson Palmieri were recruited last week in an attempt to provide more options. \nPublicly at least, Conte is putting a brave face on the situation, refusing to confirm media reports he has been at odds with director Marina Granovskaia, one of owner Roman Abramovich’s most trusted employees, following November’s surprise departure of transfer chief Michael Emenalo. \nConte maintains that he intends to stay until at least until next summer when his contract runs out. \n“We are doing the maximum for this club. If the club understands this and the club wants to extend a new contract, we can talk,” he said. \n“We can talk. Why not? My contract expires in 2019. My desire and my will are to continue to work with this club.” \nAlthough Conte’s position would be bolstered by a strong showing against Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16, he knows that, after 18 months in the job, he has survived longer than most at a club which has employed 10 managers in as many years.
