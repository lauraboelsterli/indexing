    "text": "0 COMMENTS LONDON—Oil prices were mixed Wednesday as the dollar strengthened on the back of the Federal Reserve’s upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy.\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, rose 0.1% at $66.64 a barrel on London’s Intercontinental Exchange . On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were broadly flat at $63.02 a barrel.\nTestifying before Congress on Tuesday , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said his “outlook for the economy had strengthened” in recent months, indicating the central bank would continue to lift short-term interest rates.\nMr. Powell’s comments boosted the U.S. dollar, pushing oil prices down. The dollar tends to have an inverse relationship with dollar-denominated commodities like oil.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 of its peers, edged up 0.2% Wednesday, building on its 0.6% advance Tuesday.\n“In the very short-term, a stronger U.S. dollar may weigh on commodity prices. But as soon as the odds of four rate hikes is market consensus, commodities should benefit from rising inflationary pressure, as they are viewed as a natural hedge against inflation and investors begin to rotate into commodities,” said Jan Edelmann, commodity analyst at HSH Nordbank AG.\nOil was also pressured by a fall in global equities , as investors sold off stocks amid concerns Mr. Powell could move to raise interest rates at an even faster pace than anticipated.\nMeanwhile, “amid the perky dollar, additional heartache for oil bulls came as the U.S. shale growth story came back under the spotlight,” according to Stephen Brennock, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd.\nThe head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, reportedly said Tuesday that U.S. shale production would help the country surpass Russia as the world’s biggest crude producer by 2019 at the latest.\nOil market participants are looking ahead to official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later Wednesday on crude inventory levels and production.\nAmong refined products, Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock—the benchmark gasoline contract—was down 0.92%, at $1.98 a gallon. ICE gas oil, a benchmark for diesel fuel, changed hands at $590.50 a metric ton, down 0.67% from the previous settlement.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com",
