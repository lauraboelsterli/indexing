Net loss for the fourth quarter was $40.5 million, or $0.75 per basic share and diluted share, respectively, compared to net income for the same period in 2016 of $7.2 million, or $0.18 and $0.16 per basic and diluted share, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $285.4 million at December 31, 2017.\n“We had a productive fourth quarter and begin the year with optimism for our growing pipeline of muscle biology directed drug candidates,” said Robert I. Blum, Cytokinetics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2018, we are looking forward to results from four mid-stage clinical trials of CK-2127107 in our skeletal muscle activator program which may inform plans to advance to a Phase 3 clinical program under our collaboration with Astellas. Additionally, enrollment in GALACTIC-HF remains on track with planning under our collaboration with Amgen. Our research continues to power innovation with two potential drug candidates expected to move through IND-enabling studies and into Phase 1 trials in 2018.”\nRecent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nCardiac Muscle Program\nomecamtiv mecarbil (cardiac myosin activator)\nContinued site activation and patient enrollment in GALACTIC-HF, the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil. Enrollment is proceeding according to plan with patients that have the intended risk profile consistent with the trial design.\nContinued protocol development, feasibility assessments, regulatory interactions and other readiness activities for a second Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil . This trial which is intended to evaluate the potential of omecamtiv mecarbil to increase exercise performance in patients with heart failure is planned to be conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Amgen.\nAnnounced that a post-hoc responder analysis from COSMIC-HF ( C hronic O ral S tudy of M yosin Activation to I ncrease C ontractility in H eart F ailure), a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, was presented by John Teerlink, M.D. in an Abstract Rapid Fire Oral presentation at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. The proportion of patients achieving various thresholds in the percent reduction of NT-proBNP was larger in patients who received omecamtiv mecarbil than in patients who received placebo.\nSkeletal Muscle Program\ntirasemtiv (fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (FSTA))\nAnnounced the presentation of results from VITALITY-ALS ( V entilatory I nvestigation of T irasemtiv and A ssessment of L ongitudinal I ndices after T reatment for a Y ear in ALS ), the international Phase 3 clinical trial of tirasemtiv in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), at the 28th International Symposium on ALS and Motor Neurone Disease (MND) in Boston. The presentation, by Jeremy Shefner, M.D., Ph.D., Lead Investigator of VITALITY-ALS, Professor and Chair of Neurology at Barrow Neurological Institute, and Professor and Executive Chair of Neurology at University of Arizona, Phoenix, followed our prior announcement that the trial did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline in slow vital capacity which was evaluated at 24 weeks following randomization or any of the secondary endpoints in the trial which were evaluated at 48 weeks.\nContinued treatment of patients in VIGOR-ALS ( V entilatory I nvestigations in G lobal O pen-Label R esearch in ALS ), an open-label clinical trial designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS who have completed participation in VITALITY-ALS. Currently, there are still over 100 patients who are receiving tirasemtiv in VIGOR-ALS.\nCK-2127107 , reldesemtiv (next-generation fast skeletal muscle troponin activator)\nReceived final approval from the World Health Organization and the United States Adopted Name Council for reldesemtiv to be used as the International Nonproprietary Name for CK-2127107.\nContinued conduct of our Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv which is designed to assess its effect on multiple measures of muscle function in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients with SMA. This trial has enrolled over 60 patients toward the objective of 72 patients and is being conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas.\nContinued site activation and patient enrollment in FORTITUDE-ALS ( F unctional O utcomes in a R andomized T rial of I nvestigational T reatment with CK-2127107 to U nderstand D ecline in E ndpoints – in ALS ), the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv which is designed to assess the change from baseline in the percent predicted slow vital capacity (SVC) and other measures of skeletal muscle function after 12 weeks of treatment with reldesemtiv in patients with ALS. This trial has screened over 100 patients and enrolled nearly 90 patients toward the objective of 445 patients and is being conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Astellas.\nContinued site activation and patient enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which is designed to assess its effect on physical function. This trial has enrolled over 30 patients towards the objective of 40 patients and is being conducted by Astellas in collaboration with Cytokinetics.\nContinued site activation and patient enrollment in the Phase 1b clinical trial of reldesemtiv in elderly subjects with limited mobility which is designed to assess its effect on measures of physical function. This trial has enrolled over 20 subjects towards the objective of 60 subjects and is being conducted by Astellas in collaboration with Cytokinetics.\nAnnounced the publication of “CK-2127107 Amplifies Skeletal Muscle Response to Nerve Activation in Humans,” in Muscle & Nerve , which showed that reldesemtiv increased the force generated by the tibialis anterior muscle versus placebo in response to nerve stimulation in a dose, plasma concentration, and frequency-dependent manner. Single doses of reldesemtiv were well-tolerated in healthy volunteers up to 4000 mg. No serious adverse events were reported and adverse events were all mild or moderate.\nPre-Clinical Research and Development\nAdvanced a next-generation cardiac muscle activator into development under our collaboration with Amgen. This milestone triggered a $1 million payment from Amgen to Cytokinetics.\nAdvanced a next-generation skeletal muscle activator into development under our collaboration with Astellas.\nAnnounced that Cytokinetics is advancing an unpartnered cardiac sarcomere directed compound from research into IND-enabling studies in 2018.\nContinued collaboration activities under our joint research program with Amgen directed to the discovery of next-generation cardiac muscle activators and under our joint research program with Astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal muscle activators. Cytokinetics and Astellas recently agreed to extend the joint research program through 2019.\nCompany scientists continued independent research activities directed to our other muscle biology programs.\nFinancials\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $11.0 million in milestone revenues from Amgen as well as $1.3 million of research and development revenues from our collaboration with Amgen, and $11.9 million of research and development revenues plus $8.8 million of license revenues from our collaboration with Astellas. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were offset by $20.0 million (out of the total of $40 million) for payments to Amgen related to our option to co-fund the Phase 3 development program of omecamtiv mecarbil in exchange for an increased royalty upon potential commercialization. Revenues in 2016 were primarily due to license revenue from the September 2016 expansion of our collaboration with Astellas and a $26.7 million milestone payment from Amgen.\nResearch and development expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $26.3 million and $90.3 million, respectively, from $18.8 million and $59.9 million for the same periods in 2016, primarily due to increased clinical activity, including activity for VITALITY-ALS, increased clinical trials activity for reldesemtiv , as well as increased personnel.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $10.3 million and $36.5 million, respectively, from $6.7 million and $27.8 million for the same periods in 2016, primarily due to increased personnel, non-cash stock compensation expense and commercial readiness activities.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company also announced financial guidance for 2018. The company anticipates cash revenue will be in the range of $17 to $23 million, operating expenses will be in the range of $105 to $115 million, and net cash utilization will be approximately $100 million.\n2018 Corporate Milestones\nCardiac Muscle Program\nomecamtiv mecarbil (cardiac myosin activator)\nExpect to complete enrolling patients with chronic heart failure in GALACTIC-HF in approximately one year.\nExpect to finalize plans and prepare to start the second Phase 3 trial of omecamtiv mecarbil .\nSkeletal Muscle Program\nCK-2127107 ( reldesemtiv ), (next-generation fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (FSTA))\nExpect results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with SMA in Q2 2018.\nExpect results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with ALS in 2H 2018.\nExpect results from a Phase 2 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with COPD in 2H 2018.\nExpect results from a Phase 1b clinical trial of reldesemtiv in adults with limited mobility in 2H 2018.\nPre-Clinical Research\nExpect to advance one development compound, under each of our collaborations with Amgen and Astellas, into IND-enabling studies in 2018, one of which may proceed to Phase 1 this year.\nExpect to advance an unpartnered cardiac sarcomere directed compound through IND-enabling studies in 2018 to enable initiation of Phase 1 in 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nMembers of Cytokinetics’ senior management team will review the company’s fourth quarter results via a webcast and conference call today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.
