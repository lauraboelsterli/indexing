    "text": "Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance and AmerisourceBergen slid after CNBC reported deal talks have cooled and that a takeover looks unlikely. \nSources told CNBC that Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina and Amerisource Chief Executive Steven Collis met to discuss a potential tie-up, but those early-stage explorations ended without an agreement.\nThe sources, who cautioned the deal talks could once again resume, declined to be named because the information is confidential.\nShares of Walgreens fell nearly 3 percent on the news, while Amerisource's stock tumbled nearly 6 percent. \nWhen The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this month that Walgreens had made a takeover approach to Amerisource, the drug distributor's stock surged about 25 percent. The report had cautioned that a formal offer hadn't yet been made and that a deal might not materialize.\nWalgreens already owns a roughly 26 percent stake in Amerisource.",
