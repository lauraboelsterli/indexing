    "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif., Feb. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq:GNMK), a leading provider of automated, multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $16.0 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year period Revenues for the full year 2017 were $52.5 million, representing an increase of 7% over 2016 Placed 49 ePlex ® analyzers in the fourth quarter of 2017 Exited the year with an installed base of 196 ePlex analyzers in U.S. and European labs XT-8 installed base remained relatively stable at 620 analyzers in U.S. labs\n“In 2017, we achieved several significant product launches that are fundamental to the continued growth and success of our business. We launched our FDA cleared ePlex system and Respiratory Pathogen Panel in the U.S. ahead of the current severe flu season, and we introduced our ePlex family of CE Marked BCID sepsis panels in Europe. We’re also very pleased with the recent launch of our ePlex NP system, which we designed to address lower test-volume sites and decentralized near patient settings,” said Hany Massarany, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunity we have in 2018 and beyond, to drive ePlex commercialization with an expanded menu of test panels and a rapidly growing number of customers utilizing ePlex for routine clinical testing,” concluded Massarany.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue was $16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 8% versus $14.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit was $4.7 million, or 30% of revenue, compared with $8.6 million, or 58% of revenue in the same period of 2016, reflecting the increased proportion of ePlex revenues in the quarter.\nAnnuity per XT-8 analyzer was approximately $65,000 over the last 4 quarters. Annuity per ePlex analyzer was approximately $120,000 in the fourth quarter.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $18.7 million compared to $20.7 million in the same period for 2016. The decrease was largely due to reduced ePlex development expenses.\nLoss per share was $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a $0.27 loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company ended the quarter with $72.0 million in cash and investments, reflecting the impact of increasing inventory levels in advance of the flu season.\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\nGenMark projects revenue for the full year 2018 to range from $68 to $72 million. Gross margin is expected to be in the mid 30% range and operating expenses in the mid-$60 million range. The Company expects ePlex placements of 140-170 analyzers, and an annuity per ePlex placement in the range of $100,000 to $120,000.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss fourth quarter results in further detail on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 starting at 4:30 p.m. ET.
