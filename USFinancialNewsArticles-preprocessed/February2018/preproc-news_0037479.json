    "text": "A gauge of consumers’ confidence in the economic outlook rebounded this month, as low unemployment and optimism about the new tax regime outweighed financial-market volatility for American households.\nThe University of Michigan on Friday said its consumer-sentiment index was 99.9 in February, up from 95.7 in January. The preliminary result overshot economists’ expectations for a reading of 95.0 for February. A final reading for the month will be released March 2.\n ",
