    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - Top U.S. grains merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co posted a rise in fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by higher profit from its agricultural and corn processing businesses and a $249 million income tax benefit.\nNet earnings attributable to ADM rose to $788 million, or $1.39 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $424 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue fell to $16.07 billion from $16.50 billion.\nADM’s results come amid media reports that the grain trader is in talks to buy smaller rival Bunge Ltd.\nADM made no mention of such talks in its earnings statement.
