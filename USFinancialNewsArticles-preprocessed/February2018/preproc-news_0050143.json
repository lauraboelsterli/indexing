    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sterling Bay, the Chicago-based real-estate developer and investor, and institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management today announced the acquisition of the approximately 1.65-million-square-foot former Montgomery Ward catalog warehouse located at 600 W. Chicago Avenue from Chicago-based real estate investment trust Equity Commonwealth, led by Sam Zell. Now home to Groupon's headquarters, the property was purchased for $510 million, making it Sterling Bay's largest deal to date.\nLocated on the east side of the Chicago River's North Branch, the property is 94 percent leased. In addition to Groupon, tenants include Echo Global Logistics, Uptake Technologies, Jump Trading, Big Ten Network and venture capital firm Lightbank.\n\"The property at 600 W.
