Table 7 for information about our use of non-GAAP measures and definitions of OIBDA and free cash flow, and Table 8 for footnotes.\nTABLE 7\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n“OIBDA,” “Adjusted OIBDA,” “cash interest expense” and “free cash flow” are not financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. We define OIBDA as operating income before depreciation and amortization and Adjusted OIBDA as OIBDA plus investment income from affiliate. OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, which may have different depreciation and amortization policies, and are key components in our covenant calculations.\nWe define cash interest expense as interest expense, net, less amortization of deferred financing costs. Cash interest expense excludes the amortization of financing costs which were paid upon the financing of the relevant debt.\nFor Mediacom Broadband LLC, we define free cash flow as OIBDA less capital expenditures, cash interest expense and dividends to preferred members. For Mediacom LLC, we define free cash flow as Adjusted OIBDA less capital expenditures and cash interest expense. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTABLE 8\nFootnotes\n(a) See Table 7 for information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures. (b) Represents OIBDA as a percentage of total revenues. (c) Represents the total number of customers that take at least one service, without regard to which service(s) customers purchase. (d) Represents average total monthly revenues for the period divided by average PSUs for such period. (e) Represents average total monthly revenues for the period divided by average customer relationships for such period. (f) Total debt excludes the effect of deferred financing costs, net. (g) For Mediacom Combined and Mediacom Broadband LLC, represents total debt at period end divided by annualized OIBDA for the period. For Mediacom LLC, represents total debt at period end divided by annualized Adjusted OIBDA for the period. (h) For Mediacom Combined and Mediacom Broadband LLC, represents OIBDA divided by cash interest expense for the period. For Mediacom LLC, represents Adjusted OIBDA divided by cash interest expense for the period. (i) Annual customer changes and average total monthly revenue metrics for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 have been adjusted to reflect Mediacom LLC’s January 2017 acquisition of 7,000 video customers, 6,000 HSD customers and 1,000 phone customers, aggregating 14,000 PSUs and 9,000 customer relationships as if it had occurred on December 31, 2016.
