    "text": "MELBOURNE, Feb 23 (Reuters) - London copper eased on Friday and was headed for a small weekly drop as the dollar gained steam this week on rising expectations of U.S. interest rate hikes, but prospects of demand were rosy given a healthy outlook for global economic growth. FUNDAMENTALS * LME: London Metal Exchange copper eased by 0.3 percent to $7,144 a tonne by 0136 GMT, after logging a small gain in the previous session. * SHFE: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper was up by 1.4 percent at 53,530 yuan ($8,434) a tonne. * DOLLAR: Support came from the dollar which sagged broadly on Friday after its recovery this week faded as U.S. Treasury yields declined from their recent peaks. A weaker dollar supports metals by making them more affordable for buyers using other currencies. * The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near 45-year low last week, pointing to strong job growth in February and solid momentum in the economy. * ALUMINIUM: Russian aluminium giant Rusal almost matched forecasts with a 42 percent jump in fourth-quarter core earnings on Friday, helped by higher aluminium prices, and said it saw a 5 percent increase in demand this year, pushing the market into a more than 2 million tonne deficit. * LME aluminium edged up by 0.3 percent. Prices are down around 4 percent YTD with China factories ramping up production as pollution-linked winter curtailments expire next month. * NICKEL: LME nickel fell 0.5 percent, while SHFE nickel rallied nearly 2 percent amid volatile trade. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Asian shares rebounded on Friday as comments from a Federal Reserve official eased worries that the central bank might raise rates more aggressively this year, while the safe-haven yen held on to its gains amid heightened volatility across markets.
