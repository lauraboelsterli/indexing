    "text": "LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Oil and natural gas have begun flowing again from the Forties pipeline in the North Sea, following a brief outage the previous day, a spokesman for operator INEOS said on Thursday.\n“The pipeline is back up and running,” the spokesman said.\nThe Forties pipeline, which carries around a quarter of all North Sea crude oil output and roughly a third of Britain’s total offshore natural gas production, shut down on Wednesday for the second time in two months, after a feed control valve closed at its Kinneil facility in Scotland.\nThe pipeline, which Swiss-based INEOS bought in late October for $250 million from BP, carries around 450,000 barrels per day of Forties crude oil.\nReporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
