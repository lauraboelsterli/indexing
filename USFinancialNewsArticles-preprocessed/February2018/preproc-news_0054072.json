Among other federal tax law changes, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the new law establishes a flat corporate income tax rate of 21% to replace our current rate of 35% and eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax. The Company's fourth quarter income tax provision was $10.4 million (45.7% Effective Tax Rate) and reflected the impact of the Tax Act, including additional tax expense of $3.6 million resulting from the re-measurement of the Company's estimated net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017. The Company's effective tax rate for the full year of 2017 was approximately 36.3%. The Company currently expects its full year 2018 effective income tax rate to range between 23 and 25 percent.\nSelected Balance Sheet Data\n(in thousands, except per share figures)\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nAssets\nCash equivalents and investment portfolio\n$\n215,078\n$\n165,206\nAccounts receivable\n19,220\n18,605\nDeferred taxes\n5,844\n8,737\nOther assets\n10,246\n7,170\nTotal assets\n$\n250,388\n$\n199,718\nLiabilities\n57,868\n46,653\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n20,077\n13,841\nTotal shareholders' equity\n172,443\n139,224\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n250,388\n$\n199,718\nBook value per share\n$\n49.69\n$\n40.81\nOutstanding shares\n3,470\n3,412\nChange in Assets Under Management\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\nAUM at beginning of the year\n$\n19,381\n$\n16,841\nNet cash inflows (outflows)\nproprietary funds\n843\n548\nsub-advised funds\n(164)\n639\ninstitutional accounts\n(254)\n(1,023)\n425\n164\nNet market appreciation and income\n2,511\n2,376\nIncrease during the year\n2,936\n2,540\nAUM at end of the year\n$\n22,317\n$\n19,381\nAbout Diamond Hill:\nWe are an independent investment management firm with significant employee ownership and $22.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2017.

For more information visit www.diamond-hill.com .\nUse of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures\nAs supplemental information, we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"non-GAAP\"). We believe the non-GAAP measures below are useful measures of our core business activities, are important metrics in estimating the value of an asset management business, and may enable more appropriate comparison to our peers. These non-GAAP measures should not be a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and may be calculated differently by other companies. The following schedule reconciles GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\nTotal revenue\n$\n145,202\n$\n136,103\nNet operating income, GAAP basis\n$\n67,001\n$\n63,069\nNon-GAAP adjustment:\nGains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net (1)\n2,382\n1,837\nNet operating income, as adjusted, non-GAAP basis (2)\n69,383\n64,906\nNon-GAAP Adjustment:\nTax provision on net operating income, as adjusted, non-GAAP basis (3)\n(25,192)\n(23,626)\nNet operating income, as adjusted, after tax, non-GAAP basis (4)\n$\n44,191\n$\n41,280\nNet operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share, non-GAAP basis (5)\n$\n12.80\n$\n12.09\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding, GAAP basis\n3,452\n3,413\nOperating profit margin, GAAP basis\n46%\n46%\nOperating profit margin, as adjusted, non-GAAP basis (6)\n48%\n48%\n(1) Gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan investments, net: The gain (loss) on deferred compensation plan investments, which increases (decreases) deferred compensation expense included in operating income, is removed from operating income in the calculation because it is offset by an equal amount in investment income (loss) below net operating income on the income statement, and thus has no impact on net income attributable to the Company.\n(2) Net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the Company's net operating income adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains and losses on investments in the deferred compensation plan.\n(3) Tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure represents the tax provision excluding the impact of investment related activity and the sale of subsidiary and is calculated by applying the tax rate from the actual tax provision to net operating income, as adjusted.\n(4) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by taking the net operating income, as adjusted less the tax provision on net operating income, as adjusted.\n(5) Net operating income, as adjusted after tax per diluted share: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted after tax by diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\n(6) Operating profit margin, as adjusted: This non-GAAP measure was calculated by dividing the net operating income, as adjusted by total revenue.\nOur management does not promote that investors consider the above non-GAAP financial measures alone, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThroughout this press release, the Company may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to such matters as anticipated operating results, prospects and levels of assets under management, technological developments, economic trends (including interest rates and market volatility), expected transactions and similar matters. The words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"hope,\" \"seek,\" \"plan,\" \"intend\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date thereof. While we believe that the assumptions underlying our reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and accordingly, our actual results and experiences could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such actual results or experiences to differ from results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance of our products; changes in interest rates; changes in national and local economic and political conditions, the continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; changes in government policy and regulation, including monetary policy; changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees; unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations; and other risks identified from time-to-time in other public documents on file with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/diamond-hill-investment-group-inc-reports-2017-financial-results-300603003.html\nSOURCE Diamond Hill Investment Group, Inc.",
