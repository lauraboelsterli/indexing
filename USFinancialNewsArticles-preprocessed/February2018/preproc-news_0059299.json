But last year’s numbers show the bank has started to regain confidence among investors.\nSão Paulo-based BTG Pactual’s expanded loan book totaled 28.6 billion reais, up 2 percent from the previous quarter. The bank also said that provisions for loan losses rose in the quarter.\nLatin America’s largest independent bank said recurring return on equity was 16 percent annualized, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous quarter.\nBTG Pactual’s investor relations head Joao Dantas said in November that the bank is aiming for an average return on equity of 20 percent in the medium term.\nManagement, led by Chief Executive Officer Roberto Sallouti, will discuss the company’s results in a conference call on Wednesday.
