GAAP gross profit margin was 56.4% vs. 60.4% reported for the fourth quarter 2016. GAAP net loss was $7.1 million, or $(0.22) per share, compared with GAAP net income of $10.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016.\nNon-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.42 for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $0.51 in the fourth quarter 2016. Non-GAAP net income was $14.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the prior year's fourth quarter non-GAAP net income of $16.8 million. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 60.4% vs. 61.3% reported for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenue of $501.0 million, an increase of 31.2% compared to $381.9 million reported for the same period in 2016. GAAP gross profit margin was 56.1% vs. 61.5% reported for the same period in 2016. GAAP net loss was $20.3 million, or $(0.62) per share, compared with GAAP net income of $42.6 million, or $1.29 per diluted share in the same period in 2016.\nNon-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.45 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.62 in the same period in 2016. The Company reported non-GAAP net income of $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year's non-GAAP net income of $53.5 million.\n“As we previously released, revenue in the fourth quarter was lower than expected due to weakness in our U.S. neurodiagnostic business and lower than expected revenues from Otometrics. Revenue from our recently acquired neurosurgery business was above our expectations. Newborn care performed as expected during the quarter,” said Jim Hawkins, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Non-GAAP earnings per share correspondingly came in lower than expected as well.”\n“We remain very excited about Otoscan, our digital ear scanning technology. While we expect minimal revenues from Otoscan in 2018 as our initial customer network is established, we believe digital imaging of the ear will become the standard for custom hearing aid fitting in the years ahead,” Hawkins continued.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Reform Act”) was enacted. The most material impact to the Company from the Tax Reform Act is the tax on deemed repatriation of all foreign subsidiary earnings. The repatriation tax resulted an estimated one-time tax cost of $18.3 million. In addition, the Tax Reform Act requires that the Company re-measure its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the impact of lower corporate tax rates on the future reversal of temporary differences. Due to the Company's net U.S. deferred tax asset position, this re-measurement results in an additional estimated tax cost of $3.9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, the Company also released its historical valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets. This one-time benefit decreased our GAAP tax expense by $10.8 million.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company provided revenue guidance of $125.0 million to $127.0 million and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance of $0.23 to $0.24.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company provided revenue guidance of $535.0 million to $540.0 million and non-GAAP earnings per share to $1.60 to $1.65.\nThe Company's non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes charges for amortization expense associated with intangible assets from prior acquisitions, which the Company expects to be approximately $6.8 million and $27.0 million for the first quarter 2018 and full year, respectively, and which the Company expects will reduce GAAP earnings per share by approximately $0.21 and $0.82 for the respective periods. Non-GAAP earnings per share also excludes the inventory FMV step-up of $2.6 million related to the Integra acquisition that is required for purchase accounting.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company presents in this release its non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin results which exclude amortization expense associated with certain acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring charges, certain discrete items, direct costs of acquisitions, and the related tax effects. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures is included in this press release.\nThe Company believes that the presentation of results excluding these charges or gains provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results and better reflects the ongoing economics of the Company's operations. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparison of operating results across reporting periods.\nSpecifically, the Company excludes the following charges, gains, and their related tax effects in the calculation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP operating expense and excludes all but restructuring charges from the calculation of non-GAAP gross margin: 1) Non-cash amortization expense associated with certain acquisition-related intangibles. The charges reflect an estimate of the cost of acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. 2) Restructuring charges. The Company has over time completed multiple acquisitions of other companies and businesses. Following an acquisition the Company will, as it determines appropriate, initiate restructuring events to eliminate redundant costs. Restructuring expenses, which are excluded in the non-GAAP items, are exclusively related to permanent reductions in our workforce and redundant facility closures. 3) Certain discrete items. These items represent significant infrequent charges or gains that management believes should be viewed outside of normal operating results. These items are specifically identified when they occur. 4) Direct costs of acquisitions. These are direct acquisition-related costs that occur when the Company makes an acquisition, such as professional fees, due diligence costs, and earn-out adjustments.\nThe Company applies GAAP methodologies in computing its non-GAAP tax provision by determining the annual expected effective tax rate after taking into account items excluded for non-GAAP financial reporting purposes. The Company’s non-GAAP tax expense and its non-GAAP effective tax rate are generally higher than its GAAP tax expense and GAAP effective tax rate because the income subject to taxes would be higher due to the effect of the expenses excluded from non-GAAP financial reporting. The nature of each quarterly discrete transaction will be evaluated to determine whether it should be excluded from non-GAAP reporting.\nThe Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods and the Company believes that investors also benefit from being able to refer to these non-GAAP financial measures along with the GAAP operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical performance. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nConference Call\nNatus has scheduled an investment-community conference call to discuss this announcement beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific Time) today, February 7, 2018.
