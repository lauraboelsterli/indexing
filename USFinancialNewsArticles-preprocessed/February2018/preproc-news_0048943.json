On a same-store basis casino revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter. Same-store table games revenue increased 4% year-over-year due primarily to higher table games hold at the Company's Las Vegas Strip resorts, partially offset by a 3% decrease in table games drop. Same-store slots revenue decreased 2%.\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for the Company's Las Vegas Strip resorts:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions)\nTable Games Drop\n$\n909\n$\n949\nTable Games Win %\n25.3%\n23.5%\nSlot Handle\n$\n3,129\n$\n3,315\nSlot Hold %\n8.9%\n8.8%\nDomestic resorts rooms revenue decreased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. On a same-store basis, rooms revenue decreased 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Las Vegas Strip REVPAR decreased 4.9% compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe following table shows key hotel statistics for the Company's Las Vegas Strip resorts:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nOccupancy %\n85%\n89%\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR)\n$\n158\n$\n158\nRevenue per Available Room (REVPAR)\n$\n134\n$\n141\nOperating income at the Company's domestic resorts was $305 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and included a $15 million charge for MGM National Harbor's share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connection with the MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP's (the \"MGP Operating Partnership\") purchase of its long-term leasehold interests and real property improvements and a $20 million charge related to asset disposals at Monte Carlo recorded in property transactions, net, compared to $312 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nDomestic resorts Adjusted Property EBITDA increased 1% to $496 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was positively impacted by a full quarter of operations at MGM National Harbor, partially offset by a decrease at Monte Carlo as a result of disruption related to its transformation to Park MGM. Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA decreased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding MGM National Harbor and Monte Carlo, Adjusted Property EBITDA increased slightly compared to the prior year quarter.\nMr. Murren continued, \"Consistent with our prior guidance, after taking into consideration the tough year-over-year citywide convention comparison and continued construction disruption at Monte Carlo, we expect our Las Vegas Strip REVPAR to decrease 4 to 6 percent, and our Las Vegas Strip net revenues to decrease 3 to 5 percent in the first quarter. As a result, we anticipate that our Las Vegas Strip Adjusted Property EBITDA margins will decline approximately 250 basis points.\"\nMr. Murren concluded, \"As we look at the underlying fundamentals of our business, the first quarter is not reflective of our outlook for the full year. We remain optimistic about the rest of 2018, driven by the demand we see for our resorts, our strong group and event calendar, and a healthy U.S. economic backdrop, which we believe will drive year-over-year increases in Las Vegas Strip net revenues and profitability. We expect Las Vegas Strip REVPAR for the year to be up a healthy 2 to 4 percent.\"\nCorporate Expense\nCorporate expense was $116 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $44 million compared to the prior year quarter. The current quarter included a $16 million charge for the MGP Operating Partnership's share of real estate transfer taxes recorded in connection with the MGM National Harbor transaction, $8 million of expenses related to the launch of the Company's corporate brand campaign, a $5 million increase in legal expenses, and a $5 million increase in charitable contributions.\nMGM China\nOn February 20, 2018, as part of its regular dividend policy, the Board of Directors of MGM China Holdings Limited (\"MGM China\") announced it will recommend a final dividend for 2017 of $47 million to MGM China shareholders subject to approval at the MGM China 2018 annual shareholders meeting to be held in May, bringing the total 2017 dividend to $104 million including the interim dividend paid in September of 2017.

The call will be accessible via the Internet through http://investors.mgmresorts.com/investors/events-and-presentations/ or by calling 1-888-317-6003 for domestic callers and 1-412-317-6061 for international callers. The conference call access code is 0077590. A replay of the call will be available through Tuesday, February 27, 2018. The replay may be accessed by dialing 1-877-344-7529 or 1-412-317-0088. The replay access code is 10116201. The call will be archived at http://investors.mgmresorts.com . In addition, MGM Resorts will post supplemental slides today on its website at http://investors.mgmresorts.com for reference during the earnings call.\n1 REVPAR is hotel revenue per available room.\n2 \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, goodwill impairment charges, and property transactions, net. \"Adjusted Property EBITDA\" is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expense and stock compensation expense related to the MGM Resorts and MGP stock compensation plans, which are not allocated to each property. MGM China recognizes stock compensation expense related to its stock compensation plan which is included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for MGM China. \"Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA\" is Adjusted Property EBITDA related to operating resorts which were consolidated by the Company for both the entire current and prior year periods presented. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes these measures are 1) widely used measures of operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies. Management presents Adjusted Property EBITDA on a \"same-store\" basis as supplemental information because management believes that providing performance measures on a \"same-store\" basis is useful for evaluating the period-to-period performance of the Company's domestic casino resorts.\nManagement believes that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA, and Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, management believes excluded items may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when the Company is developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within the Company's resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period.\nIn addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA and Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary measure of the Company's operating resorts' performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA and Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income, as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA in a different manner.\nReconciliations of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP operating income (loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDA and Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA are included in the financial schedules in this release.\nThe Company does not provide reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA or Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA to net income on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to forecast the amount or significance of certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts. These items include gains or losses on sale or consolidation transactions, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges, gains or losses on retirement of debt and variations in effective tax rate, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events, but which are excluded from the Company's calculations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Property EBITDA and Same-store Adjusted Property EBITDA.\nAbout MGM Resorts International\nMGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) is an S&P 500® global entertainment company with national and international locations featuring best-in-class hotels and casinos, state-of-the-art meetings and conference spaces, incredible live and theatrical entertainment experiences, and an extensive array of restaurant, nightlife and retail offerings.
