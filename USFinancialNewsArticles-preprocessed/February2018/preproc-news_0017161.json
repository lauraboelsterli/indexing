    "text": "(Reuters) - Investors trimmed their long positions in most emerging Asian currencies in the last two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as rising Treasury yields helped the dollar rebound from a three-year low touched in late January.\nThere has been a steady climb in U.S. yields over the past two weeks on expectations the European Central Bank will tighten monetary policy, and on increasing worries that inflation is accelerating due to bigger paychecks.\nThe benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR rose to a four-year high of 2.88 percent, with traders adding to their positions for a faster pace of rate hikes, lending support to the dollar.\nAmong Asian currencies, bullish bets on the Chinese yuan CNY=CFXS dipped for the first time since December, while that on the Malaysian ringgit MYR= touched their lowest since November.\nLong positions on the Singapore dollar SGD=D3 and the Taiwan dollar TWD=TP reached a near two-month low, according to the poll of 12 analysts, traders and fund managers.\nInvestors, however, turned more bearish on the Philippine peso PHP=PDSP , with short positions at their highest since November.\nThe peso has been the weakest in Asia against the dollar so far this year, shedding 2.8 percent, with vulnerability to capital outflows seen increasing due to deficit concerns.\nThe Philippine central bank projects there was a current account deficit of $100 million last year, the first since 2002, and it forecasts a deficit of $700 million this year.\nBullish bets on the Korean won KRW=KFTC were trimmed to five-month lows, while positions on Indonesian rupiah IDR= went from long to nearly neutral.\nThe won has lost about 1.6 percent so far this year, making it the second weakest currency in the region after the peso.\nBullish sentiment towards the Thai baht THB=TH weakened slightly, while the Indian rupee INR=IN , which has slid about 0.5 percent so far this year, saw bullish bets at their lowest since January 2017.\n“The more neutral positioning on the rupee reflects the Indian markets’ heightened unease about the government’s fiscal path, triggered by its budget last week, which has led to higher inflation expectations,” said Reuters FX analyst Krishna Kumar.\nThe poll was conducted between Tuesday and Wednesday, with the bulk of the responses coming in by Wednesday.\nThe Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.\nThe poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long on U.S. dollars.\nThe figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Aaron Saldanha, and Chris Thomas; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ",
