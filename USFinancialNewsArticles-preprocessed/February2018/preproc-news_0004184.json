    "text": "Peter Nicholas Associated Press Former Trump adviser Carter Page was allegedly the target of surveillance abuses, according to a memo released Friday. \nThe House of Representatives on Friday released a politically charged memo alleging surveillance abuses against Carter Page, a onetime adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, that Republicans say raise serious questions about decisions made by law enforcement during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. \nThe memo says surveillance against Page—approved by top officials at the Justice Department and FBI—used information from an-ex British spy. The memo added top law-enforcement officials knew the spy, Christopher Steele was being paid through intermediaries by the Democratic Party when they sought the warrant and the renewals. Steele’s information was an essential basis for the warrant, the memo said. \nLaw-enforcement officials obtained an initial warrant against Page in October 2016 and then three renewals, including some that occurred while Trump was president. Then-FBI director James Comey and then-deputy director Andrew McCabe signed the renewals on behalf of the FBI, while top Justice Department officials appointed by both former President Barack Obama and Trump on behalf of the Justice Department.
