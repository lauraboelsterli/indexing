    "text": "February 6, 2018 / 4:09 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Boeing's $50 billion services revenue target would need acquisitions - executive Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing Global Services’ target of more than tripling annual revenue to $50 billion ($35.8 billion) in as little as five years will require acquisitions, the CEO of Boeing’s ( BA.N ) services unit said on Tuesday. \nThe jet manufacturer has been looking to boost revenue in its services business which involves jet maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), data analytics and pilot training. \nRevenue grew by 5.5 percent to $14.6 billion in 2017 and the growth rate is forecast to be even higher this year, Boeing Global Services CEO Stan Deal told Reuters at the Singapore Airshow. \n“Over the next 5 to 10 years we are going to accomplish that as a stretch objective,” he said of the $50 billion target, adding it will “clearly involve” acquisitions.
