    "text": "LISBON (Reuters) - Prosecutors have dropped an investigation into Portuguese Finance Minister Mario Centeno, who heads the Eurogroup, over allegations of receiving tickets from soccer club Benfica, the prosecutor said on Thursday.\nThe Lisbon prosecutor’s office said in a statement it had concluded there was “no crime of favoritism or any other (crime)” and that it has archived the case.\nCenteno took over as head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers in January.\nPrime Minister Antonio Costa had dismissed the ticket allegation as “ridiculous” and having “no impact on the credibility and good name of Centeno.”\nThe allegations were published in local media at the weekend.\nReporting By Axel Bugge; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ",
