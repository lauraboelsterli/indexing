Launched in 2016, Boardroom Ready is Executive Women In Bio’s exclusive executive development platform, designed to fuel women’s participation on corporate boards in the life sciences.\nWIB is delighted to announce that Jane Wasman, President, International and General Counsel of Acorda Therapeutics, has been appointed as Chair of the Board of Directors of Sellas Life Sciences (NASDAQ:SLS).

Ms. Wasman participated in WIB’s Boardroom Ready program in 2017.\n“Boardroom Ready provides a strong platform for women to expand their networks and maximize their opportunities to join company boards. With research showing that board diversity correlates with improved company results and increased shareholder value, programs such as Boardroom Ready can benefit both individual women executives and the companies whose boards they join.”\nMs. Wasman continued, “I am delighted to be working with my fellow directors to support the team at Sellas as they continue building on their progress in developing their novel immunotherapy pipeline to address the unmet needs of patients battling cancer.”\nMs. Wasman is a strategic leader with over 20 years in the biopharmaceutical industry, including extensive U.S. and international experience.
