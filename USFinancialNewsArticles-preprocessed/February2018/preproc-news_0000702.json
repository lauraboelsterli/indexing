    "text": "January 31, 2018 / 10:42 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Southampton dominate but held by fellow strugglers Brighton Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJan 31 (Reuters) - Southampton and Brighton & Hove Albion, both struggling to keep their heads above water in the fight for Premier League survival, fought out a 1-1 draw at St Mary’s on Wednesday. \nBrighton fancied they could earn a crucial win on the road following a bright start which saw Glenn Murray convert from the penalty spot after 14 minutes after Wesley Hoedt had caught Solly March on the ankle in the box. \nSouthampton largely dominated from then on with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the bar before Saints’ manager Mauricio Pellegrino really went on the attack after the break, introducing their new record signing Guido Carrillo. \nJack Stephens earned their 64th minute equaliser with his second goal in two games, nudging the ball home from James Ward-Prowse’s mishit free kick, but it was not enough to stop the Saints remaining a point behind Brighton in the danger zone.
