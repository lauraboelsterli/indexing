    "text": "February 17, 2018 / 8:05 PM / Updated an hour ago Kvitova knocks out Wozniacki to set up Qatar final with Muguruza Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Petra Kvitova made a shaky start but found her attacking verve midway through the match to beat world number one Caroline Wozniacki 3-6 7-6(3) 7-5 in the Qatar Open on Saturday and set up a final with Spain’s Garbine Muguruza. Kvitova, 27, who lost the opening set tamely and looked in some trouble while trailing 3-1 in the second, fought back in style to clinch her fourth straight victory over the Dane in two hours and 35 minutes. “I don’t know what happened. I was a little crazy in my mind and I was playing everywhere and not to the court,” twice Wimbledon champion Kvitova said in a courtside interview. ”I tried to calm myself down a little bit in the second set. Even though I was losing, I was trying to get back somehow. Tennis - WTA Premier 5 - Qatar Open - Semifinals - Doha, Qatar - February 17, 2018.

REUTERS/Ibraheem Al Omari “When I was down 3-1 I was really angry with myself and I tried to hit some winners,” added Kvitova, who made 59 unforced errors including 11 double faults, but also hit 50 winners. Having dragged the second set into a tiebreaker which she edged, the battling Czech quickly switched gears and attacked her opponent relentlessly to prevail in the decider.

Who knows if it’s an advantage or not, but I had a great match,” added Kvitova. “It was great for my confidence turning the match around.” World number 21 Kvitova won the St Petersburg Ladies Trophy earlier this month and a second title of the season on Sunday could give her a shot at getting back into the top 10.
