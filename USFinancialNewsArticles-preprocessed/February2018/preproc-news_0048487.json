    "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP), the leading provider of commercial real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces, announced today that revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $965 million, an increase of 15% over revenue of $838 million for the full year of 2016. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 16% year-over-year to $254 million.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $38 million to $123 million or $3.66 per diluted share compared to $85 million for the full year of 2016, an increase of 44%. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $44 million or $1.22 per diluted share compared to $30 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 49%. EBITDA (defined below) for the full year of 2017 was $237 million versus $215 million for the full year of 2016, an increase of 10%.\n\"We had an exceptional year and I am delighted that we reached $1 billion in revenue run rate in the fourth quarter of 2017, one full year ahead of our goal we announced in 2014,\" said Andrew C. Florance, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of CoStar Group. \"2017 was a year of successful investments for CoStar, as we expanded our research capabilities, improved product quality and in the fourth quarter completed the CoStar-LoopNet database integration. For the full year of 2017, we added $127 million in revenue and we achieved our best sales year ever with $148 million in net new bookings, up 32% over 2016.\"\nFlorance continued, \"Our net new bookings for the fourth quarter of 2017 accelerated to $43 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year. CoStar Suite net new bookings for the same period were up 100% as we successfully converted 4,200 LoopNet users to CoStar. We also converted nearly 400 former Xceligent clients during the 13-day period from December 18-31, 2017 after Xceligent, formerly our number one commercial real estate information competitor, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in mid-December. Sales conversions continued to be robust into 2018. Through January 31, 2018, we have signed a total of over 5,400 LoopNet users and approximately 1,000 former Xceligent users to CoStar. On the multifamily side of our business, in the fourth quarter of 2017 Apartments.com amazingly bucked the historically negative seasonality of the winter months and had its best net new bookings quarter ever, up 36% year-over-year.\"\nYear 2016-2017 Quarterly Results - Unaudited\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2016\n2017\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nRevenues\n$\n200\n$\n207\n$\n213\n$\n218\n$\n227\n$\n237\n$\n248\n$\n254\nNet income\n17\n16\n23\n30\n22\n22\n34\n44\nNet income per share - diluted\n0.52\n0.48\n0.72\n0.91\n0.68\n0.68\n1.04\n1.22\nWeighted average outstanding shares - diluted\n32.4\n32.4\n32.4\n32.5\n32.6\n32.7\n32.8\n36.1\nEBITDA\n48\n46\n58\n64\n55\n44\n73\n66\nAdjusted EBITDA\n58\n56\n67\n75\n64\n54\n84\n78\nNon-GAAP net income\n31\n29\n36\n42\n34\n28\n46\n45\nNon-GAAP net income per share - diluted\n0.95\n0.91\n1.11\n1.29\n1.05\n0.86\n1.41\n1.25\n\"One of the key factors that contributed to our strong sales in 2017 was our investment in our Global Research Center in Richmond,\" said Florance. \"In a little over a year, we elevated the industry's best database and analytics offering to new heights of excellence by updating active listings much more frequently and hiring 250 tenant researchers to vastly improve our tenant data. We also launched CoStar Listing Manager at the beginning of the fourth quarter, which enables brokers to update their listings directly in CoStar. We believe this adds to the quality of data in the system as brokers have made hundreds of thousands of entries monthly since October 2017.\"\nCoStar Suite revenue growth accelerated throughout the year to 15% for the fourth quarter of 2017. CoStar Suite revenue grew to $122 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $16 million versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Multifamily revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 26% to $76 million versus $60 2016. Revenue by services can be found within the tables included in this release.\nNon-GAAP net income (defined below) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $154 million or $4.59 per diluted share, an increase of $16 million versus the full year of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (which excludes stock-based compensation and other items as defined below) was $280 million for the full year of 2017, an increase of 9% over adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2016.\nCoStar Group had an effective tax rate of 26% for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 1,200 basis points from 38% for the year ended 2016. This year-over-year reduction in the effective tax rate is related to benefits for research and development tax credits, the change in accounting for share-based payments, and revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and long-term investments, and no outstanding debt. Earlier today, the Company closed its previously announced acquisition of ForRent.com and paid approximately $350 million in cash and issued approximately $35 million in shares of CoStar Group common stock. The purchase price is subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments.\n\"We are delighted we have completed the ForRent acquisition as it strengthens our position in multifamily,\" said Florance. \"I welcome the ForRent team to the best multifamily marketing service in the United States. We continue to deliver unparalleled value to our advertisers and consumer users as a leader in the apartments industry in traffic, visits, leads, leases and revenue.\"\n2018 Outlook\n\"We believe our exceptional sales performance throughout the year and particularly in the fourth quarter of 2017 positions us well for accelerating revenue growth in 2018,\" stated Scott Wheeler, Chief Financial Officer of CoStar Group.\nThe Company expects revenue in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.190 billion for the full year of 2018, reflecting revenue growth of 22% at the midpoint of the range. This includes ForRent revenue in the range of $65 million to $70 million for 2018 and the reduction in LoopNet Premium Searcher revenue from approximately $32 million in 2017 to $4 million in 2018 as we accelerate the transition to CoStar. The vast majority of LoopNet information subscribers have been notified that their service will be discontinued as of the end of February 2018. As a result, we will see a headwind to sales in February, but we expect to see offsetting gains in CoStar sales through the spring and summer of 2018. Excluding the ForRent acquisition, we expect revenue for the existing, organic business to be in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.120 billion, which implies an annual growth rate of 15% to 16% over 2017.\nWe expect revenue for the first quarter of 2018 in the range of $269 million to $272 million, representing revenue growth of 19% over the first quarter of 2017 at the midpoint of the range. Our revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2018 includes an assumption of $7 million to $8 million of revenue from For Rent, which is approximately one month of revenue.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $365 million to $375 million for the full year of 2018, which includes approximately $5 million to $7 million of adjusted EBITDA from the ForRent acquisition. Excluding the acquisition of ForRent, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 33% at the midpoint of our guidance range. As we proceed with the integration of ForRent throughout the year, we remain confident we will achieve our goal of 40% margin exiting 2018.\nFor the first quarter we expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $70 million to $74 million, which includes approximately $3 million of negative adjusted EBITDA from the ForRent business.\nWe expect full-year 2018 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $7.01 to $7.21, based on 36.5 million shares. For the first quarter we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $1.32 to $1.40 based on 36.3 million shares. These ranges include a revised non-GAAP tax rate of 25%, which has been reduced from 38% in prior years primarily due to the impact of recently passed federal tax legislation. The lower tax rate has the effect of increasing our non-GAAP net income for full year 2018 by approximately $44 million or $1.22 per diluted share at the midpoint of our guidance range.\nThe preceding reflect CoStar Group's expectations as of February 21, 2018, including forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis. Given the risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed above, actual results may differ materially. Other than in publicly available statements, the Company does not intend to update its until its next quarterly results announcement.\nReconciliation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share and all of the disclosed non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail below, along with definitions for those terms. A reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, can be found within the tables included in this release.\nFor information regarding the purpose for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release and why management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations, please refer to the Company's latest periodic report.\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income attributable to CoStar Group before (i) interest income (expense) and loss on debt extinguishment, (ii) provision for income taxes, and (iii) depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents EBITDA before (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) acquisition and integration related costs, (iii) restructuring charges and related costs, and (iv) settlements and impairments incurred outside the Company's normal business operations.\nNon-GAAP net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income attributable to CoStar Group before (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) acquisition and integration related costs, (iv) purchase accounting adjustments, (v) restructuring charges and related costs, (vi) settlements and impairments and (vii) loss on debt extinguishment. From this figure, we then subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to arrive at non-GAAP net income. In 2016 and 2017, the company assumed a 38% tax rate, and in 2018 the company is assuming a 25% tax rate in order to approximate our statutory corporate tax rate.\nNon-GAAP net income per diluted share (also referred to as non-GAAP EPS) is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents non-GAAP net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. For periods with GAAP net losses and non-GAAP net income, the weighted-average outstanding shares used to calculate non-GAAP net income per share includes potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the calculation of GAAP net income per share as the effect was anti-dilutive.\nEarnings Conference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call at 11:00 AM EST on Thursday, February 22, 2018 to discuss earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the Company's outlook.
