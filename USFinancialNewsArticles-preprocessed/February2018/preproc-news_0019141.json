Both teams are 12-1 in the Big Ten and this was their only scheduled meeting. The Buckeyes (21-5) rallied from a 14-point deficit with 10 minutes left.\nCarsen Edwards scored a career-high 28 points on 8-of-14 shooting for the Boilermakers. Haas added 18 points on 7-of-11 shooting\nBates-Diop led the Buckeyes with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Andre Wesson scored 13 points, hitting 3 of 5 3-point attempts. Jae‘Sean Tate, hampered by four fouls, finished with 10 points, and Musa Jallow hit 3 of 4 3-point tries en route to 10 points. Freshman forward Kaleb Wesson was scoreless and also hampered with four fouls.\nBates-Diop tipped in Tate’s miss for the game-winning basket.\nPurdue led 53-39 before Ohio State answered with a 9-0 run to cut the deficit to 53-48.\nAndrew Dakich’s layup eventually cut Purdue’s lead to 58-57. Carsen Edwards hit two free throws to push the lead to 60-57 with 3:28 left. C.J. Jackson pulled the Buckeyes within 60-59 with a layup.\nAfter Purdue missed its sixth consecutive shot, Wesson sank a 3-pointer to give Ohio State a 62-60 lead with 1:16 left. Vincent Edwards’ three-point play put Purdue back up 63-62 with 52 seconds left.\nAfter Tate missed a shot, Dakich got the rebound and called timeout with 16.2 seconds left, setting up the winning put-back.\nOhio State shot 42.9 percent from the floor while Purdue was right behind at 41.7 percent.\nThe Buckeyes scored the final seven points of the first half to trim Purdue’s lead to 31-29 going into intermission.\nOhio State hit 11 of 25 shots in the first half while Purdue was 10 of 24 from the field.\nOhio State missed its first seven shots but was only down 5-0 because Purdue started slow as well.\nThe Buckeyes played without Kam Williams, who was suspended Sunday for violating team rules. Williams averages eight points and is hitting 46.3 percent from 3-point range.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
