The fourth quarter 2017 dividend represented the 181 st consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the Company on its common stock.\nIn conjunction with this release, the Company has declared a 2018 annualized dividend per share of $1.29, a 4.0 percent increase over 2017.\nOutlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018 , the Company has established the following earnings guidance ranges:\nNet income per share $0.06 to $0.08 FFO per share $0.46 to $0.48 FFO as Adjusted per share $0.46 to $0.48 AFFO per share $0.44 to $0.46 For the full-year 2018, the Company has established the following earnings guidance ranges:\nNet income per share $0.26 to $0.30 FFO per share $1.91 to $1.95 FFO as Adjusted per share $1.91 to $1.95 AFFO per share $1.76 to $1.80 Full-Year 2017 FFO as Adjusted per share as compared to full-year 2018 guidance at the midpoint:\nThe difference between the Company’s full-year 2017 FFO as Adjusted of $1.87 per share and the $1.93 midpoint of its full-year 2018 FFO as Adjusted guidance range is primarily due to:\nA positive impact of approximately $0.07 from same-store, joint venture and commercial operations; A negative impact of approximately $0.01 from higher LIBOR and other non-core items; A neutral impact from development and Developer Capital Program investments after accounting for costs to fund; and Flat general and administrative expense year-over-year.\nFor the full-year 2018, the Company has established the following same-store growth guidance ranges:\nRevenue 2.50% to 3.50% Expense 2.50% to 3.50% Net operating income 2.50% to 3.50% Additional assumptions for the Company’s first quarter and full-year 2018 guidance can be found on Attachment 15 of the Company’s fourth quarter Supplemental Financial Information.

Definitions and Reconciliations December 31, 2017 (Unaudited) Held For Disposition Communities: The Company defines Held for Disposition Communities as those communities that were held for sale as of the end of the most recent quarter. Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items as net income/(loss), excluding the impact of consolidated interest expense, real estate depreciation and amortization of wholly-owned and joint venture communities, other depreciation and amortization, income tax provision/(benefit), net and the impact of other non-recurring items including, but not limited to, net gain/(loss) on the sale of real estate owned and casualty-related expenses and recoveries of wholly-owned and joint venture communities divided by total consolidated interest, excluding the impact of costs associated with debt extinguishment. Management considers Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation of the components that comprise Interest Coverage Ratio - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure. Joint Venture Reconciliation at UDR's weighted average ownership interest: In thousands 4Q 2017 YTD 2017 Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities $ 19,666 $ 31,257 Management fee 1,206 4,654 Interest expense 9,446 37,933 Depreciation 14,128 57,102 General and administrative 139 563 West Coast Development JV Preferred Return - Attachment 12(B) (1,375 ) (5,932 ) Developer Capital Program - Other (1,081 ) (6,370 ) Other (income)/expense (includes 717 Olympic casualty (gain)/expense) 94 (311 ) (Gain)/loss on sales (20,850 ) (35,363 ) Total Joint Venture NOI at UDR's Ownership Interest $ 21,373 $ 83,533 JV Return on Equity (\"ROE\"): The Company defines JV ROE as its share of property NOI plus property and asset management fee revenue less interest expense, annualized, divided by the average of beginning and ending equity capital for the quarter. Management considers JV ROE a useful metric for investors as it provides a widely used measure of how well the Company is investing its capital on a leveraged basis. JV Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\"): The Company defines JV ROIC as its share of property NOI plus property and asset management fee revenue, annualized, divided by the average of beginning and ending invested capital for the quarter. Management considers JV ROIC a useful metric for investors as it provides a widely used measure of how well the Company is investing its capital on an unleveraged basis. Net Debt-to-EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items: The Company defines Net Debt-to-EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items as total consolidated debt net of cash and cash equivalents divided by EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items. EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss), excluding the impact of consolidated interest expense, real estate depreciation and amortization of wholly owned and joint venture communities, other depreciation and amortization and income tax provision/(benefit), net. EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of other non-recurring items including, but not limited to, net gain/(loss) on the sale of real estate owned and casualty-related expenses and recoveries of wholly owned and joint venture communities. Management considers Net Debt-to-EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items a useful metric for investors as it provides ratings agencies, investors and lending partners with a widely-used measure of the Company’s ability to service its debt obligations as well as compare leverage against that of its peer REITs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and EBITDA - adjusted for non-recurring items is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure. Net Operating Income (“NOI”): The Company defines NOI as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent and other revenues less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent. Management considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations.
