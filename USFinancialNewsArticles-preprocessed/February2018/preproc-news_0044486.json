Imports at the nation’s seaports in January kept up the strong pace that began midway through last year, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, as strong economic demand and a rush to restock ahead of the Lunar New Year slowdown boosted freight business from Southern California to Savannah. Trade analysts Panjiva set overall U.S. import growth at 7.7% in January, a signal that international shipments remain a major force filling domestic road and rail distribution networks. Trucking measures show highway shipments remain at elevated levels for the first quarter and intermodal volume on railroads is also strong. The 10% gain in imports at Georgia’s Port of Savannah suggests more goods are on the way. The port is a major gateway to Southeastern U.S. manufacturing sites, where factories appear in position to boost output to match the growing economic demand.\nInvestors are putting more money behind efforts to lift the fog around freight shipments in transit. Chicago-based technology startup FourKites Inc. just completed a $35 million funding round that will help the company expand outside the U.S. and improve its ability to predict shipping transit times and delivery . WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes that visibility into real-time information on an industrial scale is a growing focus in the supply-chain technology world as companies try to bridge a gap between broad enterprise planning and the nuts-and-bolts of implementation. Walmart Inc. recently highlighted the issue when it put new demands on suppliers for more precise delivery of goods. And bigger companies are snapping up startups that monitor freight: Software giant Descartes Systems Group last year bought truck tracking specialist MacroPoint, and GPS developer Trimble Inc. purchased logistics visibility specialist 10-4 Systems Inc. FourKites says it’s focused on expanding its lineup of retail customers, not on mergers-and-acquisitions.\nToy companies are trying to take a lesson from fast-fashion, and they’re not playing around. Hasbro Inc., Mattel Inc. and other companies are rushing to collapse production times and gets to market with uncommon speed as they try to keep up with the rapid rise and fall of trends driven by social media. The WSJ’s Paul Ziobro writes that the big companies are acting as the $27 billion U.S. toy industry copes with a slowdown that comes along with steep and potentially long-lasting changes. The overall business grew only 1% last year, and there’s more momentum in trends driven by social media like slime-making kits rather than big-budget marketing campaigns behind big brands like “Star Wars.” That means jumping on trends in weeks, and moving faster and more nimbly. That may demand big changes in the industry’s supply-chain fundamentals, and may call into question the long cycles built around manufacturing in Asia and shipping across the Pacific.\nECONOMY & TRADE The Port of Los Angeles. Photo: Bloomberg News The Trump administration is considering trade actions that could alter some of the world’s fundamental industrial supply chains. A new finding that imports of steel and aluminum impair U.S. national security sets the stage for potential new quotas and tariffs on metals imports from around the world that are central to factory production. The report provides various options, but the WSJ’s Jacob M. Schlesinger and William Mauldin write that all are aimed at slashing imports in hopes of boosting domestic production. President Donald Trump has until April to act, but the recommendations are already driving up stocks of U.S. metals producers while boosting prices of aluminum. China is the big target in any actions: The administration says Chinese overcapacity is swamping steel and aluminum markets and that Chinese firms sidestep penalties by shipping cheap products to third countries that then sell them into the U.S.\nAn Iranian airline appears to have run its supply chain for aircraft parts through Turkey. The allegations in a new filing by U.S. authorities put a spotlight on the network of front companies and shadowy logistics operations Iranian companies have used to circumvent international sanctions, and the WSJ’s Ian Talley writes that they complicate Boeing Co.’s efforts to build commercial business in Iran. The Trump administration is considering whether to grant Boeing licenses to sell planes to Iran Air, as the White House takes a more aggressive stance on Iran and steps up sanctions. The U.S. says a Turkish woman set up a series of shell companies, including Trigron Lojistik Kargo, to buy parts and jet engines that it funneled to a separate carrier, Mahan Air. Boeing and rival Airbus SE have some $40 billion in deals at stake in Iran, and the extensive clandestine operation at Mahan Air also suggests how badly the country needs fresh aircraft services.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We are working with our suppliers and logistics providers as they adjust to the present conditions.
