    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cavium, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAVM), a leading provider of semiconductor products that enable intelligent processing for enterprise, data center, cloud, wired and wireless networking, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Due to the pending merger with Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (\"Marvell\"), the Company will not schedule an earnings conference call.\nNet revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $260.4 million, a 3.3% sequential increase from the $252.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2017 and 15.1% from the $226.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Results\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.1 million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, compared to $6.2 million, or ($0.09) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. Gross margins were 53.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 54.6% in the third quarter of 2017. As a percentage of revenue, GAAP loss from operations was 4.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to GAAP operating income of 0.2% in the third quarter of 2017. Total cash and cash equivalents were $140.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe GAAP results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 included an income tax benefit of $11.1 million as a result of the Company's preliminary assessment of the impact of the newly enacted U.S. Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"), which significantly changes the existing U.S. tax laws. Major reforms in the legislation include a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, and a move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system. As a result of enactment of the legislation, the Company recognized a tax benefit mentioned above due to the reduction in its net long term deferred tax liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. Although the Company believes the amount of recognized tax benefit is a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects of the Act, it should be considered provisional and may differ from the amounts that will be reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as the Company continuously refines its assessment of the impact. Further, the final assessment of the impact of the Act may differ due to and among other things, changes in interpretations, assumptions made by the Company, the issuance of additional guidance, and actions the Company may take as a result of tax reform. The SEC has issued rules which allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Act to finalize the accounting for the related tax impacts. Any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of income tax expense or benefit in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.\nNon-GAAP Results\nCavium believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Cavium's financial condition and results of operations. Cavium believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight into Cavium's ongoing performance and core operational activities and has chosen to provide these measures for more consistent and meaningful comparison between periods. These measures should only be used to evaluate Cavium's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Non-GAAP results exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes, amortization of acquisition related assets, acquisition related inventory charges, acquisition and integration related costs, tax reform impact and acquisition related tax adjustment. The acquisition and integration related costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 included various transaction-related charges associated with the pending Merger with Marvell, primarily financial advisory and outside legal fees. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results is provided in the financial statements portion of this release.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Non-GAAP net income was $60.8 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.2% and Non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of revenue was 24.2%.\nRecent News Highlights\nJanuary 23, 2018 - Cavium FastLinQ® Enables Scalable Networking for HyperConverged Infrastructure December 5, 2017 - Cavium Partners with IBM for Next Generation Platforms by Joining OpenCAPI November 28, 2017 - Cavium FastLinQ® Delivers Advanced Networking I/O for HPE Gen 10 Servers November 20, 2017 - Marvell and Cavium to Combine Creating an Infrastructure Solutions Powerhouse November 14, 2017 - Microsemi Announces Adaptec Smart Storage Adapter Support for Cavium ThunderX2 ARM-Based CPUs November 13, 2017 - HPE Helps Businesses Capitalize on High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence Applications with New High-Density Compute and Storage November 13, 2017 - Cray Catapults Arm-Based Processors Into Supercomputing November 13, 2017 - GIGABYTE Announces Production Availability of Cavium's ThunderX2-based Server Portfolio November 13, 2017 - Ingrasys Announces Production Systems Based on Cavium's ThunderX2 Processor November 13, 2017 - Cavium and Leading Partners to Showcase ThunderX2™ Arm-based Server Platforms and FastLinQ® Ethernet Adapters for High Performance Computing at SC17 November 8, 2017 - Cavium™ ThunderX2 Motherboard Specification for Microsoft's Project Olympus Contributed to the Open Compute Project November 7, 2017 - University of Michigan Partners with Cavium™ on Big Data Computing Platform for U-M Researchers\nAbout Cavium\nCavium, Inc.
