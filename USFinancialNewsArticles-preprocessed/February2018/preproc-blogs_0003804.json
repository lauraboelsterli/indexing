    "text": "Want to travel with an emotional support dog, duck or miniature horse? Starting next month, United Airlines will want passengers to show they can behave.\nThe airline is setting more stringent requirements for emotional support animals, joining Delta Air Lines in cracking down on a sharp increase in such animals in the cabin. Delta complained that some of the animals soiled cabins or bit travelers. \nUnited said the number of customers bringing emotional support animals on board has risen 75 percent over the past year. \n\"The Department of Transportation's rules regarding emotional support animals are not working as they were intended to, prompting us to change our approach in order to ensure a safe and pleasant travel experience for all of our customers,\" United said.\nStarting March 1, United passengers will have to confirm that the animal is trained to behave in a \"public setting\" and take responsibility for the animal's behavior. Travelers must also hand over a form signed by veterinarian that shows the animal is up-to-date on vaccinations and a document that states \"there is no reason to believe that the animal will pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others on the aircraft or cause a significant disruption in service.\" \nThe airline already requires passengers to notify the airline 48 hours in advance of the flight if they plan to bring an emotional support animal on board and bring a letter from a mental-health professional regarding the animal.\nLate last month, a Brooklyn artist tried to bring a peacock on board a cross-country United flight , but was turned away by the airline because of the bird's weight and size.\nEmotional support animals are allowed in cabins free of charge under the 1986 Air Carrier Access Act.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation said airlines may turn away certain unusual animals.\n\"As a reminder, animals currently prohibited from traveling in the cabin include hedgehogs, ferrets, insects, rodents, snakes, spiders, reptiles, sugar gliders, non-household birds, exotic animals and animals not properly cleaned or carry a foul odor,\" said United. \nPassengers traveling with service animals, such as seeing-eye dogs will still not be required to provide documentation or advance notice to the airline.\nWATCH: Airlines are rethinking their emotional-support animal policies show chapters Airlines are rethinking their emotional-support animal policies      10:51 AM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 | 01:10",
