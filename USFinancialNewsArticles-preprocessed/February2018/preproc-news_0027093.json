    "text": "Reuters A view shows a scene where a short-haul regional Antonov AN-148 crashed after taking off from Moscow A jet operated by Saratov Airlines crashed in the Moscow region on Sunday, killing all 71 people on board.\nRussia's Interfax news outlet was the first to report that the Orsk-bound An-148 jet went off radar shortly after departing from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport. The agency later said eyewitnesses saw a burning airplane fall to the ground in the Moscow region.\n\"Debris has been found, there are no survivors,\" news agency TASS Quote: d a source as saying. It was not immediately clear what caused the crash which was reported to have been in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region.\nRussia's transport minister confirmed the fatalities, saying there are no survivors from the crash, The Associated Press reported.\nThere were 65 passengers and six crew members on board and there were no survivors from the crash, according to TASS, who cited a source from the emergency services.\nTweet 1\nInterfax added, citing the Russian Transport Ministry, that several theories for the crash were being considered, including weather conditions and a human factor.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences on the deaths of the people in the crash and has instructed the government to create a special commission to investigate the incident, TASS said, citing the presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.\nFlight Radar 24, which tracks aircraft movements, said the aircraft descended from 6200 feet to 3200 feet before a satelite communications signal was lost some 20 kilometers southeast of Domodedevo. The Antonov An-148 was seven years old, it added.\nShould the death toll from the crash be confirmed, it would make it the deadliest passenger jet incident since a LaMia charter carrying a Brazilian soccer team crashed near Medellin, Colombia in November 2016.\nThe crash also breaks a stretch of air travel safety. Last month, Dutch aviation consulting firm To70 said 2017 was the safest year on record, with no accident fatalities on commercial passenger jets in the year.\nâ€”Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
