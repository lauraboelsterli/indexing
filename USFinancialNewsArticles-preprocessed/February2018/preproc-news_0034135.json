    "text": "Fans attending the Tuesday night game between the Boston Bruins and Calgary Flames at TD Garden in Boston were sent home with a Patrice Bergeron bobblehead -- and a game-winning Bergeron goal.\nThe Bruins’ alternate captain netted the winner early in the third period and padded the lead with another goal as Boston earned a 5-2 victory against Calgary.\nBergeron increased his goal tally to a team-leading 27. Riley Nash scored twice, Zdeno Chara added another, and Tuukka Rask made 28 saves as the Bruins were victorious for the fifth time in six tries.\nJohnny Gaudreau scored his 19th goal and Sam Bennett put home one for the Flames. David Rittich recorded 35 stops as Calgary returned to the loss column after a 3-2 road win over the New York Islanders on Sunday.\nBergeron wristed the winning shot past Rittich on a power play with 18:45 remaining to break a 2-2 tie. He then tipped in Brad Marchand’s shot for some insurance with 10:41 to go.\nChara’s long-distance empty-netter with 3:46 left capped the scoring.\nA busy first period produced a 2-1 lead for Calgary.\nNash opened the scoring for Boston just 28 seconds into the game when he slammed home David Backes’ feed from behind the Flames’ net.\nCalgary answered quickly as Bennett capitalized on a Boston turnover in front of the net and sent a loose puck past Rask with 17:57 left in the first.\nFormer Boston College star Gaudreau put the Flames in front when he tucked the puck past Rask from behind the goal line amidst chaos around the net with 10:48 to go in the period.\nNash’s second goal on a close-range tip from Tim Schaller’s feed with 3:40 remaining in the second period tied it.\nBefore the game, the Bruins honored the 40th anniversary of their 1977-78 team known as the “Lunch Pail A.C.” that featured 11 20-goal scorers, an NHL record that still stands today.\nCalgary plays at Nashville on Thursday. Boston begins a five-game trip Saturday in Vancouver and faces the Flames again next Monday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
