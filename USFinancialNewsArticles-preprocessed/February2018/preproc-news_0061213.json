(NYSE: EOG) (EOG) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $2,430 million, or $4.20 per share. This compares to a fourth quarter 2016 net loss of $142 million, or $0.25 per share. For the full year 2017, EOG reported net income of $2,583 million, or $4.46 per share, compared to a net loss of $1,097 million, or $1.98 per share, for the full year 2016.\nAdjusted non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was $401 million, or $0.69 per share, compared to an adjusted non-GAAP net loss of $7 million, or $0.01 per share, for the same prior year period. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the full year 2017 was $648 million, or $1.12 per share, compared to an adjusted non-GAAP net loss of $893 million, or $1.61 per share, for the full year 2016. Adjusted non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated by matching hedge realizations to settlement months and making certain other adjustments in order to exclude non-recurring and certain other items. One of the adjusting items in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was a non-cash reduction in income tax expense of $2.2 billion, or $3.75 per share, related to the revaluation of EOG's deferred tax liability and certain other items resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.\nHigher commodity prices, increased production volumes, well productivity improvements and per-unit cost reductions resulted in significant increases to adjusted non-GAAP net income, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the fourth quarter 2016. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.\nOperational Highlights\nCrude oil and condensate volumes in the U.S. increased 20 percent in 2017 to 335,000 barrels of oil per day (Bopd). Increased development activity and well productivity improvements supported the volume increase. Total company natural gas liquids (NGLs) volumes grew 8 percent while natural gas volumes decreased 6 percent primarily due to the sale of the company's Barnett and Haynesville Shale dry gas assets in late 2016. Transportation expenses decreased 11 percent and depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased 12 percent, on a per-unit basis.\nIncreased development activity drove substantial volume increases in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin during the fourth quarter. Total company crude oil and condensate volumes increased 40,200 Bopd compared to the third quarter 2017. Natural gas liquids volumes grew 15 percent while natural gas volumes increased 6 percent, compared to the third quarter 2017.\n\"EOG emerged from the industry downturn in 2017 with unprecedented levels of efficiency and productivity, driving oil production volumes to record levels with capital expenditures approximately one half the prior peak,\" said William R. \"Bill\" Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"EOG's integrated teams demonstrated superb operational performance, overcoming a major hurricane and other challenges to deliver record production volumes and cost savings which surpassed original targets set at the beginning of the year.\"\n2018 Capital Plan\nEOG's disciplined capital plan is designed to achieve strong returns on capital employed and healthy growth while spending within cash flow. The company expects to grow total company crude oil volumes by 18 percent, generate double-digit ROCE and cover capital investment and dividend payments within discretionary cash flow. EOG can deliver on its 2018 plan at oil prices below $50 and generates significant free cash flow at a $60 oil price.\nEOG's return-based culture continues to drive cost reductions. The company targets lower well costs and per-unit operating expenses in 2018 despite a potentially inflationary operating environment. EOG is also focused on driving continued improvements in well productivity and pursuing exploration efforts in new plays.\nCapital expenditures for 2018 are expected to range from $5.4 to $5.8 billion, including production facilities and gathering, processing and other expenditures, and excluding acquisitions. EOG expects to complete approximately 690 net wells in 2018, compared to 536 net wells in 2017. Capital will be allocated primarily to EOG's highest rate-of-return oil assets in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Rockies, Woodford and the Bakken.\nAt least 90 percent of the wells completed in 2018 are expected to be premium. EOG has an inventory of approximately 8,000 such wells, which have a direct after-tax rate of return of at least 30 percent assuming $40 flat crude oil prices and $2.50 flat natural gas prices.\n\"EOG enters 2018 better positioned than ever to generate significant shareholder value through the development of its large and diverse inventory of high rate-of-return premium wells,\" Thomas said. \"We are determined to maintain the discipline, record-level operational efficiency and performance gained through the downturn. Our deep inventory of premium wells across the U.S. offers flexibility to adjust to changing conditions. We also see significant opportunities to increase our premium well inventory through organic exploration and development technology to further extend EOG's return on capital advantage.\"\nDividend Increase\nThe board of directors increased the cash dividend on the common stock by 10.4 percent. Effective with the dividend payable April 30, 2018, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2018, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.185 per share on the common stock. The indicated annual rate is $0.74 per share.\nDelaware Basin\n2017 was a watershed year for EOG in the Delaware Basin, where it successfully integrated the Yates acquisition, identified 1,240 additional net premium well locations, added the First Bone Spring as its fourth premium play and reduced completed well costs by $800,000 per well. Delaware Basin crude oil and condensate volumes increased over 80 percent in 2017 and exceeded 100,000 Bopd in the fourth quarter 2017.\nEOG continued active development of its 416,000 net acre position in the Delaware Basin in the fourth quarter 2017, completing 65 wells.\nIn the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, in Lea County, NM, EOG completed a four-well package, the Calm Breeze 2 Fed Com #701-704H, with an average treated lateral length of 7,100 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 2,605 Bopd, 440 barrels per day (Bpd) of NGLs and 3.7 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas.\nIn the Delaware Basin First Bone Spring, in Lea County, NM, EOG completed the Righteous 6 State Com #301H with a treated lateral length of 7,100 feet and 30-day initial production rate of 1,305 Bopd, 170 Bpd of NGLs and 1.4 MMcfd of natural gas.\nIn the Delaware Basin Leonard, in Loving County, TX, EOG completed a four-well package, the State Atlas A#3H â€“ D#6H, with an average treated lateral length of 9,800 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 1,215 Bopd, 270 Bpd of NGLs and 2.3 MMcfd of natural gas.\nSouth Texas Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk\nEOG continues to enhance the productivity of its bellwether asset in the South Texas Eagle Ford. Eight years after initiating development, EOG further reduced well costs and improved well performance during 2017 in its 520,000 net acre position in the crude oil window of this world class play. EOG also expanded its enhanced oil recovery program, adding 56 wells last year. For the full year 2017, crude oil production in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk increased one percent year-over-year despite interruption to producing volumes as a result of Hurricane Harvey.\nIn the fourth quarter, EOG completed 74 wells in the Eagle Ford. These included 13 wells with lateral lengths of more than 10,000 feet. In LaSalle County, EOG completed a four-well package, the White 5H-8H, with an average treated lateral length of 12,900 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 1,545 Bopd, 80 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of natural gas. In DeWitt County, EOG completed a four-well package, the Hendrix 8H-10H and the Hendrix 12H, with an average treated lateral length of 6,700 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 2,545 Bopd, 420 Bpd of NGLs and 2.4 MMcfd of natural gas.\nEOG continued to test its position in the South Texas Austin Chalk, a geologically complex formation which lies above the South Texas Eagle Ford, completing four net wells in the fourth quarter.\nRockies\nEOG's Wyoming Powder River Basin and DJ Basin activity both contributed to the company's 2017 crude oil production growth. In the Powder River Basin, EOG continued exploration activity on its 400,000 net acre position in the core of the play. The company tested the prospectivity of multiple target zones and also tested the aerial extent of various targets in the Powder River Basin during the year. In the DJ Basin, EOG achieved significant well cost reductions during 2017 through a focus on efficiency improvements in drilling and completion operations.\nIn the fourth quarter, EOG completed nine wells in the Powder River Basin. In Converse County, EOG completed the Mary's Draw 453-0310H and 455-0310H wells with an average treated lateral length of 7,300 feet per well and average 30-day initial production rates per well of 1,280 Bopd, 610 Bpd of NGLs and 7.6 MMcfd of natural gas. In the DJ Basin, EOG completed three wells in the fourth quarter. This included the Big Sandy 522-2536H with a treated lateral length of 8,800 feet and 30-day initial production rate of 1,100 Bopd, 110 Bpd of NGLs and 0.2 MMcfd of natural gas.\nReserves\nAt year-end 2017, total company net proved reserves were 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 18 percent compared to year-end 2016. Net proved reserve additions from all sources, excluding revisions due to price, replaced 201 percent of EOG's 2017 production at a finding and development cost of $8.71 per barrel of oil equivalent. Revisions due to price increased net proved reserves by 154 MMBoe and asset divestitures decreased net proved reserves by 21 MMBoe. (For more reserves detail and a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.)\nFor the 30 th consecutive year, internal reserves estimates were within 5 percent of estimates independently prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton.\nHedging Activity\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, EOG entered into crude oil financial price swap contracts and differential basis swap contracts. A comprehensive summary of crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is provided in the attached tables.\nCapital Structure and Asset Sales\nAt December 31, 2017, EOG's total debt outstanding was $6.4 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 28 percent. Considering cash on the balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, EOG's net debt was $5.6 billion with a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 25 percent. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.\nProceeds from asset sales for the full year 2017 totaled $227 million.\nConference Call February 28, 2018\nEOG's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results conference call will be available via live audio webcast at 8 a.m. Central time (9 a.m. Eastern time) on Wednesday, February 28, 2018.

There are numerous ways that industry participants present Reserve Replacement Costs, including an \"All-In\" calculation, which reflects total exploration and development expenditures divided by total net proved reserve additions from all sources. Combined with Reserve Replacement, these statistics provide management and investors with an indication of the results of the current year capital investment program. Reserve Replacement Cost statistics are widely recognized and reported by industry participants and are used by EOG management and other third parties for comparative purposes within the industry. Please note that the actual cost of adding reserves will vary from the reported statistics due to timing differences in reserve bookings and capital expenditures. Accordingly, some analysts use three or five year averages of reported statistics, while others prefer to estimate future costs.
