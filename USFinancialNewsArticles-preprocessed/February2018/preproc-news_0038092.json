    "text": "SARASOTA, Fla., Feb. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- xG® Technology, Inc. (\"xG\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq : XGTI, XGTIW), a leading provider of wireless video solutions to broadcast, law enforcement and defense markets, and private mobile broadband networks for critical communications, announced today a collaboration between its IMT business and Marshall Electronics to offer a full wireless video solution for live broadcasts and sporting events. Marshall is a recognized leader in supplying professional cameras and display monitors. The integrated bundles of IMT's wireless video transmitters and Marshall's POV cameras will be on display at NAB 2018 (Booths C6008 and C6508 ).\nThe bundles include one of IMT's ultra-miniature wireless video systems – IMTDragonFly or MicroLite 2 HD COFDM wireless video transmitter — as well as a Marshall Mini-Broadcast POV Camera — CV502 (HD-SDI) or CV505 (HD-SDI/HDMI) . The bundles will provide quality live broadcasting solutions for capturing engaging points-of-view for supported broadcast programing of any kind. The integration includes full paint control of the Marshall camera, accessed through the IMTDragonFly and Microlite 2 Web Page interface.\n\"This collaboration will help IMT achieve a long-range, professional and effective wireless video and camera control solution for customers at a competitive price,\" says John Payne IV, president of IMT USA. \"These products work together to provide an all-encompassing solution for both licensed and unlicensed users that are looking to capture high-quality and uninterrupted video.\"\n\"Our customers have been utilizing IMT wireless technology with Marshall cameras for professional sports and other wireless broadcast applications for many years,\" says Tod Musgrave, director of cameras at Marshall Electronics. \"It was only logical to collaborate with them to offer a more complete and integrated wireless solution encompassing the strengths of our Marshall cameras and the IMT DragonFly and MicroLite 2 video transmitters.\"\nThe IMTDragonFly sets the standard in compact wireless video technology by delivering completely new and expanded points of view and perspective. It is available in a range of kits to fit various applications, including drones, sports, broadcast and body worn configurations. Each offering caters to the specific needs of the application. The IMTDragonFly has a compact and lightweight form factor and features minimized power requirements, making it ideal for drone and mobile use. It features HD/SD-SDI or optional HDMI inputs, and delivers up to 50mW of power in a package measuring in at 1.85 in. x 1.38 in. x .51 in. (50 mm x 35 mm x 13 mm) that weighs less than 1.2 oz. (34 g), providing long range, reliable HD video transmission.\nThe MicroLite 2 provides enhanced performance and video quality, perfect for broadcast applications where high-quality live streaming video is needed. The MicroLite 2 transmitter features HD/SD-SDI and HDMI inputs with COFDM transmission in a small, lightweight chassis. It delivers up to 200mW of power, providing long range, reliable HD video transmission.\nThe Marshall CV502 (HD-SDI) and CV505 (HD-SDI/HDMI) miniature cameras deliver up to 1920x1080p resolution at 60/59.94/50 frame rates. With a very low 0.2 lux (color) rating, the cameras capture accurate, sharp color images even under low-light conditions. The CV502 ships with an ultra-wide 3.7mm HD lens that is interchangeable to customize for specific applications. Marshall also offers a wide assortment of lens options for a fully-customizable AOV and focal length per camera position within an installation.\nTo further cater to unique applications, IMT and Marshall will continue to offer custom configurations. Package options will include support for specialized integration enclosures and mounts. As a reseller and distributor of Marshall cameras and accessories, IMT recently sold 50 Marshall POV cameras for use on the ADAC GT Masters series to be used in its specialized racing cars. IMT-Vislink's reseller in Germany, SalesCube GmbH, sold the equipment to Bert Blümer - Drahtlose Kamera Systeme Blümer Systementwicklung GmbH, who will handle the production.\nClick here to see sample video footage captured with an IMT and Marshall wireless video solution.\nAbout Marshall:\nFor over 30 years, Marshall has been a trusted provider of high quality and reliable video, audio and multimedia systems for Broadcast Video, Pro A/V, Pro Audio and OEM applications worldwide.
