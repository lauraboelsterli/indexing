    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Independent, full-service creative agency, Something Massive , today announced the opening of its new office in Oakland, California. The Bay Area presence will service existing clients and allow for closer access to emerging and early stage companies looking to build their brands and accelerate growth—an area in which Something Massive has had repeated success. It also represents the agency’s launch of its next major growth phase.\nThe agency also announced the appointment of Victoria Fiore as its new Vice President of Strategy, who will spearhead the formalization of the agency’s brand strategy practice and business development efforts, including building out a larger team nationally. Fiore joins Something Massive from the brand side, most recently having worked at Plum Organics for five years where she led masterbrand positioning and strategy. Fiore also formed and led the Mission team at Plum Organics, guiding the purpose-driven innovation brand through its acquisition to Campbell Soup Company. With an MBA from UC Berkeley, Fiore brings expertise in business model innovation for the modern market, and a commitment to scaling brands that have a positive impact on the community, to the Something Massive team.\n“Throughout my career, my goal has always been to help organizations that strive to make the world a little better -- whether that’s a microfinance institution in rural India or a Californian baby food brand on a mission to change the way kids eat,” said Fiore. “I look forward to working with the team at Something Massive to generate audacious, big ideas, agnostic of the medium or budgets.”\nOne of Something Massive’s startup success stories is existing client, organic baby and toddler food company Plum Organics , which it began working with when the brand was a Silicon Valley startup 8 years ago, through to its acquisition by Campbell Soup Company in 2013, until present day. The brand has boasted a host of successful marketing efforts in that time, including its first ever national campaign, “Parenting Unfiltered” followed by “Do Your Part(ner),” both applying an unfiltered lens to the realities of parenting and taking home a series of industry accolades in the process.\n“Something Massive has a hugely successful track record working with and evolving early stage and challenger brands, thanks to our production expertise and in-house capabilities alongside strategic creative ideas,” said Rebecca Coleman, founder and CEO of Something Massive. “Having known Victoria and witnessed her business acumen and extensive brand strategy experience for six years, I have no doubt she will be instrumental in connecting us with the Bay Area’s rich surplus of startups looking for the type of brand-building expertise we offer. We’re thrilled to have her onboard.”\nThe agency’s experience creating consumer-facing marketing campaigns for companies in medical technology, such as Medtronic , and venture-backed startups, like Qualitas Health , positions them well to service Silicon Valley’s emerging med and biotech brands.\nAbout Something Massive\nSomething Massive is an independent, female-founded creative agency based in Los Angeles living at the intersection of digital culture and brand. We're purveyors of passion - experts at creating authentic campaigns with emotional spark. Our work is driven by insights, and our goal is to propel ongoing brand/customer connections through relevant, timely and relatable content.\nWe’ve never been followers, so we bucked the agency trend and parked ourselves in Hollywood. Our office is like an Escher lithograph; no matter where you’re headed there are a million ways to go. Upstairs, we do our research, dream big, and develop our plan. Downstairs, in our own production studio, we bring campaigns to life.\nWe work with billion-dollar brands like Medtronic Diabetes, Campbell’s Soup Company’s growing suite of challenger brands like Plum Organics, as well as Regal Cinemas and Sky Zone Trampoline Parks, to name just a few.\nMedia Contact\nBridget Bulters\nDiGennaro Communications\nbridget.bulters@digennaro-usa.com\nSource: Something Massive",
