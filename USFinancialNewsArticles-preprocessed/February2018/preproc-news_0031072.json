    "text": "Fourth quarter total revenues of $73.2 million, up 35% year-over-year\nFull year total revenues of $217.4 million, up 32% year-over-year\nNEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Varonis Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:VRNS), a pioneer in data security and analytics, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nYaki Faitelson, Varonis CEO, said, \"2017 was a very strong year for Varonis. Total revenues increased 32%, we achieved non-GAAP profitability and generated meaningful levels of cash flow from operations. These results validate that our highly differentiated data security solutions are solving critical needs of organizations globally. High profile data breaches and regulation are driving organizations to take a more data-centric approach to their security strategy. We are clearly benefiting from these secular trends, as organizations struggle to manage and secure their growing on-premises and cloud data in an increasingly complex hybrid environment that is no longer defined by a traditional perimeter. Our focus on innovation, our expanded set of product offerings and our ability to more effectively reach companies with 1,000 or more employees is driving our land and expand strategy. We believe we are just scratching the surface on our larger market opportunity and are building a company to drive meaningful levels of growth while scaling operations to deliver increasing profit and cash flow from operations.”\nFinancial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues:\nTotal revenues were $73.2 million, up 35% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.

Total revenues from Rest of World were $12.8 million. Generated 56% of license and first year maintenance revenues from new customers and 44% from existing customers in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 57% and 43%, respectively, in the prior-year period.

Recognized as a Finalist in SC Magazine 2018 Awards in the following categories: Best Enterprise Security Solution, Best Regulatory Compliance Solution and Best Customer Service. A recent independent survey indicated that data theft and data loss were cited as top concerns for organizations in 2018, with nearly half (45%) of IT professionals bracing for a cyberattack. The survey also revealed that more than half (57%) of IT professionals are concerned about being GDPR compliant by the May 25, 2018 deadline. 56% of the respondents believe that the right to erasure/“to be forgotten” poses the greatest challenge in meeting the GDPR, followed by implementing data protection by design. The survey, which polled 500 IT decision makers from organizations with 1,000+ employees in the U.S. and Europe, was commissioned by Varonis and conducted by Survey Sampling International from September 28 to October 6, 2017.\nFinancial Outlook\nThe Company’s financial outlook reflects the adoption of ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method. The Company expects the adoption will have no material impact on its revenues and operating profitability metrics.\nDue to the appreciation of the New Israeli Shekel against the U.S. Dollar, the Company expects its operating expenses, mainly those related to research and development, to be negatively impacted by this foreign currency movement in 2018 compared to 2017. For both the first quarter and full year 2018, we expect this impact to be approximately 300 basis points to our non-GAAP operating margin.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects revenues in the range of $49.2 million to $50.0 million, representing 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. The Company anticipates first quarter 2018 non-GAAP operating loss in the range of ($8.6) million to ($8.2) million and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share in the range of ($0.32) to ($0.31), based on a tax provision of $400,000 to $600,000 and 28.3 million basic and diluted shares outstanding. Expectations of non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share exclude stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects revenues in the range of $260.0 million to $264.5 million, representing 21% to 23% year-over-year growth. The Company anticipates full year 2018 non-GAAP operating income of $1.5 million to $4.0 million and non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share in the range of ($0.04) to non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.02. This is based on a tax provision of $2.7 million to $3.2 million and 28.6 million basic and diluted shares outstanding and 32.2 million diluted shares outstanding. Expectations of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income (loss) per basic and diluted share exclude stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nThe tables at the end of this press release include a reconciliation of ASC 605 to ASC 606 for the first quarter 2017 and full year 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast\nVaronis will host a conference call today, February 12, 2018, at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, to discuss the Company's fourth quarter 2017 financial results, current financial guidance and other corporate developments. To access this call, dial 877-425-9470 (domestic) or 201-389-0878 (international). The passcode is 13675180. A replay of this conference call will be available through February 19, 2018 at 844-512-2921 (domestic) or 412-317-6671 (international). The replay passcode is 13675180. A live webcast of this conference call will be available on the \"Investors\" page of the Company's website ( www.varonis.com ), and a replay will be archived on the website as well.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nVaronis believes that the use of non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) is helpful to our investors. These measures, which the Company refers to as our non-GAAP financial measures, are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-GAAP operating income (loss) is calculated as operating income (loss) excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated as net income (loss) excluding (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation.\nBecause of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash expense, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period. In addition, the Company excludes payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation expense because, without excluding these tax expenses, investors would not see the full effect that excluding stock-based compensation expense had on our operating results. These expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting or exercise, which factors may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Similar to stock-based compensation expense, the Company believes that excluding this payroll tax expense provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations and facilitates comparison with other periods as well as the results of other companies.\nEach of our non-GAAP financial measures is an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own operating results over different periods of time. The non-GAAP financial data are not measures of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss) or net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Varonis urges investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measures to evaluate our business.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and statements made during the above referenced conference call will contain, \"forward-looking\" statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including regarding the Company's growth rate and its expectations regarding future revenues, operating income or loss or earnings or loss per share.
