    "text": "MILPITAS, Calif., Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumentum Holdings Inc. (\"Lumentum\" or the \"Company\") today reported results for its fiscal second quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nNet revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2018 was $404.6 million, with GAAP net income of $204.8 million, or $3.17 per diluted share. Net revenue for fiscal first quarter of 2018 was $243.2 million, with GAAP net income of $7.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. Net revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2017 was $265.0 million, with GAAP net income of $11.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP net income for the fiscal second quarter of 2018 was $107.8 million, or $1.67 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal first quarter of 2018 was $27.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal second quarter of 2017 was $35.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. The Company held $624.5 million in total cash and short-term investments at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2018.\n\"We achieved record revenue and profitability and exceeded our guidance for the second quarter driven by strong demand and execution in our 3D sensing, ROADM, industrial and telecom pump laser businesses. Our performance demonstrates the power of Lumentum's proprietary capabilities, which leverage many years of experience across multiple end markets,\" said Alan Lowe, President and CEO. \"Our proven capabilities position us well for the future as demand for our industrial lasers and ROADMs is strengthening, and 3D sensing opportunities are broadening to more customers and end markets.\"\nFinancial Overview – Fiscal Second Quarter Ended December 30, 2017\nGAAP Results ($ in millions)\nQ2\nQ1\nQ2\nChange\nFY 2018\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNet revenue\n$404.6\n$243.2\n$265.0\n66.4%\n52.7%\nGross margin\n42.3%\n28.2%\n32.8%\n1,410bps\n950bps\nOperating margin\n22.4%\n1.1%\n5.0%\n2,130bps\n1,740bps\nNon-GAAP Results ($ in millions)\nQ2\nQ1\nQ2\nChange\nFY 2018\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nNet revenue\n$404.6\n$243.2\n$265.0\n66.4%\n52.7%\nGross margin\n44.9%\n34.0%\n36.9%\n1,090bps\n800bps\nOperating margin\n28.3%\n11.8%\n14.7%\n1,650bps\n1,360bps\nNet Revenue by Segment ($ in millions)\nQ2\n% of\nQ1\nQ2\nChange\nFY 2018\nNet Revenue\nFY 2018\nFY 2017\nQ/Q\nY/Y\nOptical Communications\n$360.1\n89.0%\n$207.9\n$236.6\n73.2%\n52.2%\nLasers\n44.5\n11.0%\n35.3\n28.4\n26.1%\n56.7%\nTotal\n$404.6\n100.0%\n$243.2\n$265.0\n66.4%\n52.7%\nThe tables above provide comparisons of quarterly results to prior periods, including sequential quarterly and year-over-year changes. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is contained in this release under the section titled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company expects the following for the fiscal third quarter 2018:\nNet Revenue to be in the range of $280 million to $305 million Non-GAAP Operating margin of 15.5% to 18.0% Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.80;\nNote: Earnings per share based on approximately 65 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis\nOur projection of 65 million shares outstanding does not include the potentially dilutive effect of the convertible notes, as we have the ability and intent to settle the face value in cash; and therefore, we use the treasury stock method for calculating the dilutive impact of the 2024 Notes. The notes will have an impact on our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when the average price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $60.62.\nWe have not provided reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP measures for our outlook. A large portion of non-GAAP adjustments, such as derivative liability adjustments, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, litigation, non-cash income tax expense and credits, and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current and future operations are by their nature highly volatile and we have low visibility as to the range that may be incurred in the future. For example, in the fiscal second quarter of 2018, we had a credit of $207.0 million primarily related to a release of a U.S. valuation allowance, which was offset by a write down of deferred tax assets in the amount of $83.0 million due to the lower corporate tax rate enacted under 2017 \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" reform.\nConference Call\nLumentum will host a conference call on February 6, 2018 at 5:30am PT/8:30am ET.

Lumentum believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. Specifically, the Company believes that providing this information allows investors to better understand the Company's financial performance and, importantly, to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such operating performance. However, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.\nNon-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per share, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP income (loss) before income taxes and non-GAAP expenses exclude (i) workforce related charges such as severance, retention bonuses and employee relocation costs related to formal restructuring plans, (ii) costs for facilities not required for ongoing operations, and costs related to the relocation of certain equipment from these facilities and/or contract manufacturer facilities, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) amortization of acquired developed technologies, (v) non-cash interest expense, (vi) unrealized loss on derivative liability, (vii) warranty charges related to our vendor quality issues with expected future recoveries, (viii) release of a U.S. valuation allowance and the write down of deferred tax assets due to the 2017 \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\", and (ix) other charges comprised mainly of inventory write-downs due to cancelled programs, as well as, acquisition, integration, litigation and other costs and contingencies unrelated to current and future operations. Management does not believe that these non-GAAP items are reflective of the Company's underlying operating performance. The presentation of these and other similar items in Lumentum's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\nA quantitative reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data with respect to historical periods is included in the supplemental financial table attached to this press release.\nLUMENTUM HOLDINGS INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nDecember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nGross profit on GAAP basis\n$\n171.1\n$\n87.0\n$\n239.6\n$\n168.7\nStock-based compensation\n4.4\n2.1\n7.1\n4.1\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n5.5\n7.1\n16.2\n9.9\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.7\n1.6\n3.4\nGross profit on non-GAAP basis\n$\n181.8\n$\n97.9\n$\n264.5\n$\n186.1\nResearch and development on GAAP basis\n$\n43.8\n$\n38.7\n$\n80.1\n$\n75.6\nStock-based compensation\n(3.8)\n(3.0)\n(6.9)\n(5.8)\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n(1.1)\n(0.3)\n(1.8)\n(0.6)\nResearch and development on non-GAAP basis\n$\n38.9\n$\n35.4\n$\n71.4\n$\n69.2\nSelling, general and administrative on GAAP basis\n$\n35.7\n$\n31.0\n$\n62.3\n$\n56.1\nStock-based compensation\n(6.6)\n(4.0)\n(10.1)\n(6.9)\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n(0.8)\n(3.4)\n(2.3)\n(3.8)\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n—\n(0.1)\n—\n(0.2)\nSelling, general and administrative on non-GAAP basis\n$\n28.3\n$\n23.5\n$\n49.9\n$\n45.2\nIncome from operations on GAAP basis\n$\n90.8\n$\n13.3\n$\n93.5\n$\n30.1\nStock-based compensation\n14.8\n9.1\n24.1\n16.8\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n7.4\n10.8\n20.3\n14.3\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.8\n1.6\n3.6\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.8\n4.0\n3.7\n6.9\nIncome from operations on non-GAAP basis\n$\n114.6\n$\n39.0\n$\n143.2\n$\n71.7\nInterest and other (expense) income, net on GAAP basis\n$\n(3.2)\n$\n(0.2)\n$\n(6.6)\n$\n—\nNon-cash other income (expense)\n—\n(0.2)\n—\n(0.2)\nEffective interest expense on convertible notes\n4.1\n—\n8.2\n—\nInterest and other (expense) income, net on non-GAAP basis\n$\n0.9\n$\n(0.4)\n$\n1.6\n$\n(0.2)\nIncome before income taxes on GAAP basis\n$\n95.5\n$\n17.9\n$\n99.0\n$\n12.2\nStock-based compensation\n14.8\n9.1\n24.1\n16.8\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n7.4\n10.8\n20.3\n14.3\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.8\n1.6\n3.6\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.8\n4.0\n3.7\n6.9\nNon-cash other income (expense)\n—\n(0.2)\n—\n(0.2)\nEffective interest expense on convertible notes\n4.1\n—\n8.2\n—\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivative liability\n(7.9)\n(4.8)\n(12.1)\n17.9\nIncome before income taxes on non-GAAP basis\n$\n115.5\n$\n38.6\n$\n144.8\n$\n71.5\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes on GAAP basis\n$\n(109.3)\n$\n6.1\n$\n(112.9)\n$\n3.8\nImpact of non-GAAP income tax (benefit) expense (a)\n117.0\n(3.4)\n122.1\n1.1\nProvision for income taxes on non-GAAP basis\n$\n7.7\n$\n2.7\n$\n9.2\n$\n4.9\nNet income on GAAP basis\n$\n204.8\n$\n11.8\n$\n211.9\n$\n8.4\nStock-based compensation\n14.8\n9.1\n24.1\n16.8\nOther charges related to non-recurring activities\n7.4\n10.8\n20.3\n14.3\nAmortization of acquired developed technologies\n0.8\n1.8\n1.6\n3.6\nRestructuring and related charges\n0.8\n4.0\n3.7\n6.9\nNon-cash other income (expense)\n—\n(0.2)\n—\n(0.2)\nEffective interest expense on convertible notes\n4.1\n—\n8.2\n—\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivative liability\n(7.9)\n(4.8)\n(12.1)\n17.9\nImpact of non-GAAP income tax benefit (expense) (a)\n(117.0)\n3.4\n(122.1)\n(1.1)\nNet income on non-GAAP basis\n$\n107.8\n$\n35.9\n$\n135.6\n$\n66.6\nNet income per share on non-GAAP basis\n$\n1.67\n$\n0.57\n$\n2.10\n$\n1.06\nShares used in per share calculation -
