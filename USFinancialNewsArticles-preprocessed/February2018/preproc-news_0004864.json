    "text": "February 1, 2018 / 7:42 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago Daimler warns spending on new technology to dampen earnings growth Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSTUTTGART (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) warned its 2018 earnings growth would be dampened by spending on new technologies as it reported weaker than expected quarterly operating profit and a narrower margin for its Mercedes-Benz Cars business. \nThe return on sales at Mercedes-Benz Cars shrank to 9.7 percent in the fourth quarter through end-December, down from a high level of 10.7 percent a year earlier, even as unit sales rose by 4 percent. \nQuarterly earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were flat at 3.47 billion euros ($4.30 billion), missing consensus of 3.65 billion euros in a Reuters poll. \nWhile growth in unit sales and revenue will have a positive impact on the development of earnings, Daimler said higher spending on new cars and innovative technologies would dampen earnings growth, resulting in 2018 EBIT in the magnitude of the previous year. \nIt also said despite a continued rise in demand for cars in China this year, it expected more moderate demand in the first months of this year. \nMercedes-Benz expects a slight rise in unit sales and flat EBIT at its cars division this year, while the vans business expects a significant increase in unit sales and a dip in operating profit due to costs for the launch of a pickup truck. \nShares in Stuttgart-based Daimler fell 1.3 percent in early Frankfurt trade, making it the second-biggest decliner on the blue-chip DAX .GDAXI index.
