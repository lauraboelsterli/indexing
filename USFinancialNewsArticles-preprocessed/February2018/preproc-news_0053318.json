Photo: François-Xavier MARIT/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images In an upset win over Canada in the men’s Olympic curling semifinal on Thursday, U.S. captain John Shuster glided across the ice pushing 42 pounds of Scottish granite.\nHe gave the curling stone a clockwise turn that made it curve slightly right as it slid toward its target, the curl the sport is named for. As the stone traveled, two teammates raced in front, furiously scrubbing the ice in its path with brooms.\nThis is a puzzling sport to play—and so far impossible for scientists to explain.\nSpin an overturned glass clockwise on a smooth countertop and it drifts to the left. Spin it counterclockwise and it drifts to the right. A curling stone in play does the opposite. Spin that glass harder and it makes a sharper turn. In curling, the faster the stone spins, the more straight it goes.\nNina Roth, U.S. women’s curling team captain, delivers a stone. Photo: john sibley/Reuters “We have no idea why a rock curls,” says U.S. women’s curling team captain Nina Roth.\nNeither do scientists, who have been stumped for close to a century. “Anything unusual gets us excited, and a curling rock has that,” says Ray Penner, an astrophysicist at Vancouver Island University , who also studied the physics of golf. He took up curling and got hooked on finding an explanation.\nThe curling stone is completely smooth except for a raised ring on the bottom called the running band. That is where the mystery’s rubber hits the road.\nCurling's Conundrum Scientists for nearly a century have failed to explain why a curling stone moves the way it does. The faster the stone spins, the straighter it will go.\nSpin the curling stone clockwise and it will curve right.\nThe harder the glass spins, the more its path will curve.\nSet a glass upside down on a counter and spin it clockwise. It will curve to the left.\nSources: Nina Roth, U.S. women’s Olympic curling; Mark Shegelski, University of Northern British Columbia\nThe earliest known theory to explain the stones’s apparent misbehavior surfaced in 1924, the year of the first Winter Olympics, held in Chamonix, France.\nUniversity of Saskatchewan physicist Ertle Harrington attributed it to friction differences between the stone’s right and left sides as it moved on ice.\nWriting in the journal Nature in 1930, researchers William Macauley and G.E. Smith said the friction differences were actually between the stone’s front and back.\nMr. Harrington responded that their idea was “nonconcordant with the known behavior of curling stones.” You get the drift.\nUniversity of Northern British Columbia physicist Mark Shegelski recently teamed up with Edward Lozowski, an emeritus professor at the University of Alberta, to arrive at the stick-slip friction theory .\nCurling’s playing surface is pebbled with droplets of frozen water that get their tops flattened by a machine called a nipper, making a tiny landscape of miniature buttes.\nMessrs. Shegelski and Lozowski say parts of a stone’s running band briefly stick—for billionths of a second—to the pebbles. But the right side of a clockwise turning stone is a bit stickier than the left. Going back to the overturned glass, it is as if the right side of the rim gets stuck on a bit of jam on the table; the glass would rotate around the sticky spot to the right.\nEquipment used by Mark Shegelski and Edward Lozowski to measure a curling stone’s trajectory along the ice. Photo: Ed Lozowski In the mathematical model Messrs. Shegelski and Lozowski developed to describe this action, slow and fast spinning rocks curl the same amount.\nThe stick-slip friction theory hasn’t gained traction with some scientists. Former aerospace engineer Mark Denny says the model doesn’t properly account for how the theory would work in practice. If stick-slip was really happening, he said, a faster spinning stone would curl more.\n“I have come up with similar curling theories and they have fallen down for similar reasons,” he says.\nMr. Denny and Mr. Shegelski have been dueling in scientific papers over curling theories since the late 1990s, around the time curling officially joined the Olympics program in the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.\nSpin a cup clockwise and it drifts to the left. The inquiries have since spread among scientists in Scotland, Japan and Russia. Harald Nyberg was doing graduate work on industrial friction at Uppsala University in Sweden when a World Curling Association ice expert introduced him to the puzzle.\nMr. Nyberg, who now conducts research on friction for parts used by heavy-duty truck maker Scania, says he and his grad-school colleagues “got stuck on this question.” The problem with Mr. Shegelski’s theories, including the latest one, he says, is that “they are nice and accurate math models for how a rock would move, but never really get into where those forces come from.”\nSolving that question led to Mr. Nyberg’s own aha! moment. He and his team found that curling stones left behind tiny scratches on the ice pebbles.\nA researcher measured friction as part of Harald Nyberg’s curling project.

Here’s how: The leading edge of a rotating stone engraves curved scratches on the ice. As the back edge passes over the scratches, the etched grooves gently push the stone in the direction it is rotating.\nImagine the grooves in a vinyl record. If you lightly dragged a finger tip across the record’s surface, it would be pulled in the direction of the grooves.\nNot surprisingly, Messrs. Shegelski and Lozowski have problems with the scratch theory. First, they say, the Swedish researchers haven’t presented a formal mathematical model to explain it. And wouldn’t scratches on the ice left by previous stones affect the ones that follow?\n“It would seem to me it would get kind of confusing for the rocks,” Mr. Lozowski says.\nTake a Look at Other Recent A-Heds\nWhat Makes Scotland Scottish, Not British? Whisky, Haggis, Tartan—and Irn-Bru Norwegian Olympians Have Won the Most Medals. And They’re Joking Around. Is It Possible to Have Too Many Cup Holders? Auto Makers Are Trying to Find Out The Swedish theory may have contributed to a minor scandal—dubbed, not surprisingly, Broomgate. Not long after their research was published in 2013, curling team sweepers started using brooms that scratched the ice, giving more control over the direction of the stone’s travel. Those brooms were banned in 2016, but elite curlers still sweep differently than they used to.\nThe news Monday that Russian curler Aleksandr Krushelnitckii had failed a doping test drew some snickers. But the sport’s new appreciation for the role of sweepers has put a premium on fitness and endurance.\n“How you sweep can definitely affect the rock in a pretty amazing way,” says Mr. Shuster, the U.S. men’s team skipper, who won a bronze medal in 2006 and is competing in his fourth Olympics.\nFor athletes, the why of it all seems best left to scientists or theologians.\n“I don’t know,” Mr. Shuster says. “I just throw the rocks, man.”\nJohn Shuster of the U.S. curling team delivers a stone.
