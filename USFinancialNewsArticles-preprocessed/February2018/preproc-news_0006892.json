    "text": "PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Power utilities EDF and Uniper have been notified of a strike in the French power sector which will impact their electricity production, grid operator RTE said on Friday.\nCGT, one of France’s more hardline trade unions, has called for a nationwide strike in the electricity, gas and rail sectors on Feb. 8 to protest against government liberalisation policies in the public sector.\nRTE said on its website that French state-controlled utility EDF had been notified that workers would stop work for 24 hours starting Wednesday Feb. 7 at 2000 GMT.\nAt Uniper’s production sites, workers plan to go on strike from midnight on Feb. 7 until March 31, RTE said.
