Martyn Herman 3 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Victory over Manchester City in Sunday’s League Cup final could salvage Arsenal’s season but would also provide more ammunition to those who deride the Gunners as a glorified ‘cup team’. It is 14 years since Arsenal last won the Premier League, and they have finished in the top two only once in the past decade, albeit 10 points behind Leicester City in 2016. Last season they finished fifth and Arsene Wenger’s side are currently being left behind in sixth spot as they prepare to face runaway Premier League leaders City at Wembley. The annual debate about Wenger’s future will rage again in the closing months of the season -- with the club’s supporters split between loyalists and those who believe the Frenchman needs to step aside if Arsenal are to challenge for the title. Wenger will point to the three FA Cups he has won in the past four seasons, including last season when they denied Chelsea a league and cup double. Arsenal have not won the League Cup since 1993 and despite reaching two finals under Wenger, the club has generally regarded the competition as disposable during his reign. Which makes it all the more ironic that Arsenal’s season could boil down to what happens against Pep Guardiola’s City.

Their hopes of returning to the Champions League may well depend on whether they can go on and win the Europa League, having stumbled into the last 16 despite a 2-1 home defeat by Swedish club Ostersunds on Thursday. “That should be a wake-up call,” Winterburn said. Wenger has won seven of his 12 cup finals with Arsenal, but all of the last three. His record still looks shoddy compared with that of Guardiola, however, who has bagged 11 out of 12. Even if favourites City do stumble on Sunday, though, they are almost certain to be celebrating winning the Premier League in the Spring -- a feeling Arsenal fans now begin each season hoping for but not expecting.
