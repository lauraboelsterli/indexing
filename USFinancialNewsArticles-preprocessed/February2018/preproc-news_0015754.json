The flight safety body said it would investigate the incident. \n“As always, the safety and support of our customers and employees remains our primary focus and we are working to get them on their way as quickly as possible,” Southwest spokesman Brian Parrish said. \nPictures and video posted to social media showed heavy skid marks where the front of the plane slid to the edge of the taxiway. \n“Sliding into vacation the wrong way,” Instagram user Josh@cherrimanj wrote on a picture showing the plane’s nose pointed to a grassy area out of taxiway lines.
