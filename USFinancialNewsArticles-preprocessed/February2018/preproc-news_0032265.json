ASU 2017-07 modified the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs and requires the service cost component to be reported separately from the other components in order to provide more useful information. Under ASU 2017-07, the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs is required to be presented in the same expense category as the related salary and wages for the employee.

Prior to this reorganization, CenturyLink operated and reported as two segments, business and consumer. As a result of this reorganization, CenturyLink changed the name of the predecessor business segment to \"enterprise\" segment. Additionally, CenturyLink also reassigned its information technology, managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network services from its former business segment to a new non-reportable operating segment. CenturyLink reported two segments, enterprise and consumer, from January 2017 through October 2017.\nIn connection with CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3, CenturyLink implemented a new organization structure and began managing its operations in two segments: business and consumer. CenturyLink's consumer segment remains substantially unchanged under this reorganization, and CenturyLink's newly reorganized business segment includes the legacy CenturyLink enterprise segment operations and the legacy Level 3 operations. In addition, it reassigned its information technology, managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network operations into the business segment from the former non-reportable operating segment.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\nNET DEBT TO LTM PRO FORMA ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet Debt to LTM Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Ratio\nGross Debt\n$\n38,053\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n(551)\nNet Debt\n$\n37,502\nLTM Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Excluding Acquisition-Related Expenses\n$\n8,698\nNet Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA Ratio\n4.31\nGross Debt is defined as total long-term debt, less unamortized discounts, premiums and other, net of $23 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of $350 million.\nNet Debt to Last Twelve Months (LTM) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is defined as Gross Debt, reduced by cash and cash equivalents and divided by LTM Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Excluding Acquisition-Related Expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income (loss) from the Pro Forma Combined Company Results less depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash impairment charges, non-cash stock compensation expense and special items, excluding CenturyLink colocation revenue and related estimated costs.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts and shares in thousands)\nFourth Quarter 2017\nLess\nAs Adjusted\nAs\nSpecial\nexcluding\nReported\nItems\nSpecial Items\nNet Income as reported in Consolidated Statement of Income\n$\n1,117\n(956)\n161\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding - Diluted\n889,135\n889,135\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.26\n0.18\nSpecial items include:\nIntegration costs related to CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3\n$\n206\nInterest income related to Term Loan B Escrow account for pre-acquisition\n(4)\nInterest expense associated with Term Loan B for pre-acquisition\ncolocation business\n20\nIncome tax effect of special items\n(46)\nImpact of Tax Reform\n(1,132)\n$\n(956)\nOutlook\nTo enhance the information in our outlook with respect to non-GAAP metrics, we are providing a range for certain GAAP measures that are components of the reconciliation of the non-GAAP metrics. The provision of these ranges is in no way meant to indicate that CenturyLink is explicitly or implicitly providing an outlook on those GAAP components of the reconciliation. In order to reconcile the non-GAAP financial metric to GAAP, CenturyLink has to use ranges for the GAAP components that arithmetically add up to the non-GAAP financial metric. While CenturyLink feels reasonably comfortable about the outlook for its non-GAAP financial metrics, it fully expects that the ranges used for the GAAP components will vary from actual results. We will consider our outlook of non-GAAP financial metrics to be accurate if the specific non-GAAP metric is met or exceeded, even if the GAAP components of the reconciliation are different from those provided in an earlier reconciliation.\nCenturyLink, Inc.\n2018 OUTLOOK\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Dollars in millions)\nAdjusted EBITDA Outlook\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2018\nRange\nLow\nHigh\nNet Income\n$\n320\n720\nIncome Tax Expense\n120\n240\nTotal Other Expense\n2,300\n2,200\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n5,500\n5,400\nNon-Cash Compensation Expense\n210\n190\nIntegration-related expenses\n300\n200\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n8,750\n8,950\nFree Cash Flow Outlook\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2018\nRange\nLow\nHigh\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities excluding integration costs\n$\n7,050\n7,150\nCapital Expenditures, excluding: integration projects\n(3,900)\n(3,800)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n3,150\n3,350\nCENTURYLINK STANDALONE\nDESCRIPTION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo enable investors to track CenturyLink's results through the end of 2017 on a basis that assumes CenturyLink did not acquire Level 3, we are providing selected unaudited results in the format previously used.\nWe use the term Special items as a non-GAAP measure to describe items that impacted a period's net income and the statement of operations for which investors may want to give special consideration due to their magnitude, nature or both. We do not use the term non-recurring because while some of these items are special because they are unusual and infrequent, others may recur in future periods.\nWe use Adjusted Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or the term Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to show profitability in our continuing, central business activities, without regard for the effects of special items, capital structure or tax structure, which may be helpful in analyzing trends or making comparisons to other companies that have different capital or tax structures. Other companies may refer to this measure using the term Operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA). Adjusted EBITDA is an accrual based measure that has the effect of excluding quarter-to-quarter variances that are caused by changes in working capital. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted from the measure. It is also not intended to be used as a replacement for the GAAP measures of Operating income or Cash flows provided by operating activities. Rather it is intended to provide additional information to enhance the understanding of CenturyLink's GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by investors in addition to, but not in substitution for, the GAAP measures.\nCenturyLink Standalone\nREVENUES\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nStrategic services *\nEnterprise high-bandwidth data services (1)\n$\n773\n755\n3,069\n2,990\nOther enterprise strategic services (2)\n181\n331\n916\n1,320\nIT and managed services (3)\n169\n158\n652\n641\nConsumer broadband services (4)\n688\n666\n2,683\n2,689\nOther consumer strategic services (5)\n94\n118\n405\n458\nTotal strategic services revenues\n1,905\n2,028\n7,725\n8,098\nLegacy services *\nEnterprise voice services (6)\n533\n579\n2,215\n2,413\nEnterprise low-bandwidth data services (7)\n274\n325\n1,179\n1,381\nOther enterprise legacy services (8)\n241\n266\n995\n1,075\nConsumer voice services (6)\n513\n589\n2,191\n2,443\nOther consumer legacy services (9)\n72\n75\n288\n312\nTotal legacy services revenues\n1,633\n1,834\n6,868\n7,624\nData integration\nEnterprise data integration\n109\n130\n479\n528\nIT and managed services data integration\n4\n—\n18\n3\nConsumer data integration\n—\n1\n1\n2\nTotal data integration revenues\n113\n131\n498\n533\nOther revenues\nHigh-cost support revenue (10)\n166\n170\n667\n688\nOther revenue (11)\n147\n126\n539\n527\nTotal other revenues\n313\n296\n1,206\n1,215\nTotal revenues\n$\n3,964\n4,289\n16,297\n17,470\n(1)\nIncludes MPLS, Ethernet and wavelength revenue\n(2)\nIncludes primarily colocation, broadband, VOIP, video and fiber lease revenue\n(3)\nIncludes primarily IT services, managed hosting, cloud hosting and hosting area network revenue\n(4)\nIncludes broadband and related services revenue\n(5)\nIncludes video and other revenue\n(6)\nIncludes local and long-distance voice revenue\n(7)\nIncludes private line (including special access) revenue\n(8)\nIncludes UNEs, public access, switched access and other ancillary revenue\n(9)\nIncludes other ancillary revenue\n(10)\nIncludes CAF Phase 1, CAF Phase 2 and federal and state USF support revenue\n(11)\nIncludes USF surcharges and failed-sale-leaseback rental income\n*\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, CenturyLink determined that certain of its legacy services, specifically its dark fiber network leasing, are more closely aligned with CenturyLink's strategic services than with its legacy services. As a result, CenturyLink now reflects these operating revenues as strategic services, and CenturyLink has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to this change.

These calculations are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP. In keeping with its historical financial reporting practices, the company believes that the supplemental presentation of these calculations provides meaningful non-GAAP financial measures to help investors understand and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nIn addition, measures referred to in the accompanying news release as being calculated \"on a constant currency basis\" or \"in constant currency terms\" are non-GAAP metrics intended to present the relevant information assuming a constant exchange rate between the two periods being compared. Such metrics are calculated by applying the currency exchange rates used in the preparation of the prior period financial results to the subsequent period results.\nCore Network Services Revenue includes revenue from colocation and datacenter services, transport and fiber, IP and data services, and voice services (local and enterprise).\nNetwork Access Costs includes leased capacity, right-of-way costs, access charges, satellite transponder lease costs and other third party costs directly attributable to providing access to customer locations from the Level 3 network, but excludes Network Related Expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Network Access Costs do not include any employee expenses or impairment expenses; these expenses are allocated to Network Related Expenses or Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nNetwork Related Expenses includes certain expenses associated with the delivery of services to customers and the operation and maintenance of the Level 3 network, such as facility rent, utilities, maintenance and other costs, each related to the operation of its communications network, as well as salaries, wages and related benefits (including non-cash share-based compensation expenses) associated with personnel who are responsible for the delivery of services, operation and maintenance of its communications network, and accretion expense on asset retirement obligations, but excludes depreciation and amortization.\nNetwork Access Margin ($) is defined as total Revenue less Network Access Costs from the Statements of Income, and excludes Network Related Expenses.\nNetwork Access Margin (%) is defined as Network Access Margin ($) divided by total Revenue. Management believes that network access margin is a relevant metric to provide to investors, as it is a metric that management uses to measure the margin available to Level 3 after it pays third party network services costs; in essence, a measure of the efficiency of Level 3's network.\nAdjusted EBITDA ($) is defined as net income (loss) from the Statements of Income before income tax (expense) benefit, total other income (expense), non-cash impairment charges, depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (%) is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are relevant and useful metrics to provide to investors, as they are an important part of Level 3's internal reporting and are key measures used by Management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of Level 3 and to make resource allocation decisions. Management believes such measures are especially important in a capital-intensive industry such as telecommunications. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (and similarly uses these terms excluding acquisition-related expenses) to compare Level 3's performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non-cash and non-operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures, fund growth, service debt and determine bonuses. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash impairment charges and non-cash stock compensation expense because of the non-cash nature of these items. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with Level 3's capitalization and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non-cash expenses primarily reflect the impact of historical capital investments, as opposed to the cash impacts of capital expenditures made in recent periods, which may be evaluated through cash flow measures. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the gain (or loss) on extinguishment and modification of debt and other, net because these items are not related to the primary operations of Level 3.\nThere are limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from Level 3's calculations. Additionally, this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charges, non-cash stock compensation expense, the gain (or loss) on extinguishment and modification of debt and net other income (expense). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (either with or without acquisition-related expense adjustments) should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.\nUnlevered Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures, plus cash interest paid and less interest income all as disclosed in the Statements of Cash Flows or the Statements of Income. Management believes that Unlevered Cash Flow is a relevant metric to provide to investors, as it is an indicator of the operational strength and performance of Level 3 and, measured over time, provides management and investors with a sense of the underlying business' growth pattern and ability to generate cash. Unlevered Cash Flow excludes cash used for acquisitions and debt service and the impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents balances.\nThere are material limitations to using Unlevered Cash Flow to measure Level 3's cash performance as it excludes certain material items such as payments on and repurchases of long-term debt, interest income, cash interest expense and cash used to fund acquisitions. Comparisons of Level 3's Unlevered Cash Flow to that of some of its competitors may be of limited usefulness since Level 3 does not currently pay a significant amount of income taxes due to net operating loss carryforwards, and therefore, generates higher cash flow than a comparable business that does pay income taxes. Additionally, this financial measure is subject to variability quarter over quarter as a result of the timing of payments related to accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. Unlevered Cash Flow should not be used as a substitute for net change in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures as disclosed in the Statements of Cash Flows. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a relevant metric to provide to investors, as it is an indicator of the Level 3's ability to generate cash to service its debt. Free Cash Flow excludes cash used for acquisitions, principal repayments and the impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents balances.\nThere are material limitations to using Free Cash Flow to measure Level 3's performance as it excludes certain material items such as principal payments on and repurchases of long-term debt and cash used to fund acquisitions. Comparisons of Level 3's Free Cash Flow to that of some of its competitors may be of limited usefulness since Level 3 does not currently pay a significant amount of income taxes due to net operating loss carryforwards, and therefore, generates higher cash flow than a comparable business that does pay income taxes. Additionally, this financial measure is subject to variability quarter over quarter as a result of the timing of payments related to interest expense, accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow should not be used as a substitute for net change in cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nLevel 3 Standalone\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\n(UNAUDITED)\n(Dollars in millions)\nThree months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016 (1)\nCore Network Services Revenue\n$\n2,017\n1,933\nWholesale Voice Services Revenue\n93\n99\nTotal Revenue\n2,110\n2,032\nNetwork Access Costs\n724\n680\nNetwork Access Margin\n65.7\n%\n66.5\n%\nNetwork Related Expenses (NRE) (2)(7)\n335\n327\nSelling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A) (2)\n387\n316\nNon-cash Compensation Expense\n32\n35\nAdjusted EBITDA (3)\n664\n709\nAdjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisition-related expenses (3) (4)\n758\n724\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (3)\n31.5\n%\n34.9\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding acquisition-related expenses (3) (4)\n35.9\n%\n35.6\n%\nCash Flows from Operating Activities (5)\n431\n557\nCapital Expenditures\n308\n306\nCapital Expenditures, excluding acquisition-related capital expenditures (6)\n301\n306\nUnlevered Cash Flow (3)\n221\n386\nUnlevered Cash Flow, excluding cash acquisition-related expenses (3) (4) (5)\n451\n401\nFree Cash Flow (3)\n123\n251\nFree Cash Flow, excluding cash acquisition-related expenses (3) (5)\n353\n266\nNet Income\n74\n250\n(1) -\nThe reported fourth quarter 2016 results have been adjusted to reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels as of the beginning of 2017.\n(2) -\nExcludes non-cash compensation expense.\n(3) -\nSee schedule of non-GAAP metrics for definitions and reconciliation to GAAP measures.\n(4) -\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, acquisition-related expenses were $87 million and $15 million in fourth quarter 2016.
