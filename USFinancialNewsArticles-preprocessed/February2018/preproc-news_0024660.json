    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's is proposing a $4 trillion-plus budget for next year that projects a $1 trillion or so federal deficit and — unlike the plan he released last year — never comes close to promising a balanced federal ledger even after 10 years.\nAnd that's before last week's $300 billion budget pact is added this year and next, showering both the Pentagon and domestic agencies with big increases.\nThe spending spree, along with last year's tax cuts, has the deficit moving sharply higher with Republicans in control of Washington.\nThe original plan was for Trump's new budget to slash domestic agencies even further than last year's proposal, but instead it will land in Congress three days after he signed a two-year spending agreement that wholly rewrites both last year's budget and the one to be released Monday.\nThe  \n \nTrump   easily   time.\n\"The budget does bend the trajectory down, it does move us back towards balance. It does get us away from trillion-dollar deficits,\" Mulvaney said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\"Just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone. We do have a chance still to change the trajectory. And that is what the budget will show tomorrow,\" he said.\n \nBut critics are likely to say this year's Trump plan, which promises 3 percent growth, continuing low inflation, and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing, underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt.\nThe White House is putting focus this year on Trump's long-overdue plan to boost spending on the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The  \nPresidential budgets tend to reprise many of the same elements year after year. While details aren't out yet, Trump's budget is likely to curb crop insurance costs, cut student loan subsidies, reduce pension benefits for federal workers and cut food stamps, among other proposals.",
