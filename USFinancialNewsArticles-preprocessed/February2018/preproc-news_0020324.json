    "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif., A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMRK) , a full-service precious metals trading company and an official distributor for all the major sovereign mints, reported results for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Q2 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 21% to $1.68 billion from $2.13 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and decreased 22% from $2.16 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 Gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 10% to $8.9 million from $9.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and increased 22% from $7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $0.2 million or $(0.03) per diluted share (which includes $0.3 million of additional tax expense as a result of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), as compared to net income of $2.8 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and net income of $0.5 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2017 Gold ounces sold in the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 51% to 376,000 ounces from 772,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and increased 13% from 332,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 Silver ounces sold in the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 48% to 12.0 million ounces from 22.8 million ounces for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and decreased 18% from 14.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2017 As of December 31, 2017, the number of secured loans increased 66% to 2,823 from 1,698 as of December 31, 2016 and increased 15% from 2,454 as of September 30, 2017\nFiscal Q2 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues decreased 21% to $1.68 billion from $2.13 billion in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to a decrease in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold and lower silver prices, offset by higher gold prices and an increase in forward sales.\nGross profit decreased 10% to $8.9 million (0.53% of revenue) from $9.9 million (0.46% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross profit was primarily related to a decrease in the total volume of gold and silver ounces sold, partially offset by higher gross profits realized by the newly acquired Direct Sales segment (Goldline). The decrease in volume of gold and silver ounces sold was primarily related to slower market conditions in the current period compared to the same year-ago quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 53% to $9.3 million from $6.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses related to the company’s newly acquired Direct Sales segment (Goldline) and other non-recurring costs, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expenses.\nInterest income increased 10% to $3.3 million from $3.0 million in same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in interest rates and the aggregate value of the company’s secured loan portfolio, partially offset by decreases in other finance product income.\nInterest expense increased 37% to $3.4 million from $2.4 million in same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher usage of the company’s lines of credit, a new debt financing agreement related to the acquisition of Goldline, higher average inventory levels primarily related to product financing arrangements, amortization costs related to loan fees associated to third party financing arrangements, as well as higher LIBOR interest rates that went into effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases.\nNet loss totaled $0.2 million or $(0.03) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $2.8 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter. The net loss includes $0.3 million additional tax expense related to an adjustment to deferred tax assets and liabilities as part of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On a reportable segment basis, Goldline (“Direct Sales Segment”) had a $2.1 million pre-tax loss while A-Mark (“Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services”) had a $2.3 million pre-tax profit.\nFiscal Six Months 2018 Highlights\nRevenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 2% to $3.84 billion from $3.93 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2016 Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 10% to $16.2 million (0.42% of revenue) from $17.9 million (0.46% of revenue) for the six months ended December 31, 2016 Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 94% to $0.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share from $4.7 million or $0.66 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Net income includes an additional $0.3 million of tax expense related to the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Gold ounces sold in the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 46% to 708,000 ounces from 1.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016 Silver ounces sold in the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 41% to 26.5 million ounces from 44.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016\nFiscal Six Months 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues decreased 2% to $3.84 billion from $3.93 billion in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold and lower silver prices, offset by an increase in forward sales.\nGross profit decreased 10% to $16.2 million (0.42% of revenue) from $17.9 million (0.46% of revenue) in the same year-ago period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily related to a decrease in the total volume of gold and silver ounces sold, partially offset by higher gross profits realized by the new acquired Direct Sales segment (Goldline). The decrease in volume of gold and silver ounces sold was primarily related to slower market conditions in the current period compared to the same period last year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 38% to $16.3 million from $11.8 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses related to the company’s newly acquired Direct Sales segment (Goldline), stock compensation expense and other non-recurring costs, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expenses.\nInterest income increased 11% to $6.4 million from $5.8 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to increases in interest rates and the aggregate value of the company’s secured loan portfolio, partially offset by decreases in other finance product income.\nInterest expense increased 30% to $6.1 million from $4.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher usage of the company’s lines of credit, a new debt financing agreement related to the acquisition of Goldline, higher average inventory levels primarily related to product financing arrangements, amortization of loan fees, as well as higher LIBOR interest rates that went in to effect subsequent to the Federal Reserve rate increases.\nNet income decreased 94% to $0.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share from $4.7 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit, higher interest expense and higher selling, general and administrative expenses, offset by higher interest income and lower taxes. On a reportable segment basis, Goldline (“Direct Sales Segment”) had a $1.7 million pre-tax loss while A-Mark (“Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services”) had a $2.7 million pre-tax profit.\nManagement Commentary\n“While our second quarter results reflect the continued challenging environment for precious metals products since the 2016 election, we continue to execute our plans to grow our market share,” said company CEO Greg Roberts. “We believe our initiatives to invest in our business and further diversify and strengthen our product offerings to customers put A-Mark in an optimal position to capitalize on profitable opportunities when market conditions improve. One of these initiatives was the prior quarter acquisition of Goldline, which expanded A-Mark’s distribution to retail and created a unique distribution platform for precious metals globally through the combination of Goldline’s client base, leads and sales and marketing expertise with A-Mark’s product offerings, logistics and storage expertise. We continue to refine Goldline’s business model and work through the challenges of the integration of the Goldline business.\n“Despite some initial tax expenses in this quarter from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we believe the new corporate tax rate of 21% and new business investment incentives for capital assets will positively contribute to growth, profits and cash flow over the long term.”\nConference Call\nA-Mark will hold a conference call today (Thursday, February 8, 2018) to discuss these financial results.
