GLOBAL TOP NEWS •U.S. House passes stopgap spending bill to avert shutdown The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved another stopgap bill to keep the federal government from shutting down, hours after President Donald Trump said he would \"love\" to see a shutdown if immigration legislation were not included. •Theme parks lift Disney profit, more 'Star Wars' coming Walt Disney Co on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts as theme park crowds packed a new \"Avatar\" land, making up for a decline at the ABC broadcasting network. •SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket soars in debut test launch from Florida The world's most powerful rocket, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, roared into space through clear blue skies in its debut test flight on Tuesday from a Florida launch site where moon missions once began, in another milestone for billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's private rocket company. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) •The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,636.00, trading up 1.35 percent from its previous close. •The rupee will likely open higher against the dollar, tracking gains across Asian peers, as global equity markets bounced back following recent massive sell-offs. •Indian sovereign bonds are likely to trade steady ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee’s decision on interest rates due later in the day.The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.55 percent-7.59 percent band till the policy decision due at 2:30 p.m. GLOBAL MARKETS • Shaken out of many months of calm, Wall Street braced for a higher level of volatility in the days ahead, after a roughly 2 percent rebound in U.S. stocks on Tuesday followed the biggest one-day selloff in more than six years. • Asian share markets were trying to find their footing as a semblance of calm returned to Wall Street where major indices bounced into the black after days of deep losses. • The dollar was firmer against the yen but trimmed gains against the euro when U.S. equities bounced overnight after suffering deep losses earlier in the week. • U.S. Treasury debt prices gained on the day on Tuesday as volatile equity markets led some investors to seek out lower risk bonds, though many investors remained nervous after a week long bond rout sent yields on Monday to four-year highs. • Oil prices rose amid a share market recovery and supported by a report that U.S. crude inventories fell last week, although analysts warned that soaring U.S. output and a seasonal demand drop could soon weigh on crude. • Gold prices edged up as investors resorted to bargain hunting after the yellow metal's sharp decline of over 1 percent to its lowest in more than three weeks in the previous session.
