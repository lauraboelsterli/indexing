    "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. independent refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp ( MPC.N ) beat analystsâ€™ quarterly profit estimate on Thursday, helped by higher refining margins.\nThe company said its refining and marketing margin rose 16 percent to $13.12 per barrel in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.\nNet income attributable to the company rose to $2.02 billion, or $4.09 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $227 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.\nThe company booked a $1.5 billion gain in the latest quarter from the recent changes to the U.S. tax law.\nExcluding items, Marathon Petroleum reported earnings of $1.03 per share, while analysts on average had expected 99 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue and other income rose to $21.24 billion from $17.28 billion.\nReporting by Anirban Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
