    "text": "ST. LOUIS, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FleishmanHillard (FH) has appointed Candace Peterson to the role of global managing director, brand marketing , charged with the creative and activation needed to connect consumers with the brands they love on behalf of FH clients.\nIn her new role, Peterson will connect brand specialists across the global FH network to bring creative problem-solving, breakthrough ideas and trending marketing insights to clients on a real-time basis guided by the firm's strength in social data analytics and research. This effort will use FleishmanHillard's signature \" Authenticity Gap\" reputation research to analyze how well brand experience aligns with consumer expectations that drive purchase decisions.\n\"Candace is a rare talent whose experience reflects a fluency in marketing and creative disciplines not often found inside a public relations agency,\" said J.J. Carter , FleishmanHillard chief operating officer and president, Americas. \"She speaks the language of the CMO, and her unique understanding of how brands and companies can creatively connect to individual consumers, communities and the world will inspire our teams and our clients to blaze new trails.\"\nPeterson brings an award-winning background in advertising, creative and marketing to her new role following a career spanning more than 20 years working with powerhouse creative firms including Ogilvy & Mather, J. Walter Thompson and TracyLocke.

In her new role, she will leverage the firm's first-class social intelligence, planning and insights, and creative power to fuel marketing-driven clients and campaigns.\n\"I was drawn to FleishmanHillard because of its unique point of difference,\" Peterson said. \"One that understands both brand and reputation – and attracts clients who recognize brand sentiment is impacted by both sides of that equation.\"\nPeterson aims to cement FH's position as the strategic and creative partner-of-choice by marketing-driven clients and partner agencies.\n\"Engaging customers is a fluid process that requires brands to constantly innovate and embrace the notion that brand loyalty is something that must be earned on a perpetual – even daily – basis,\" Peterson said. \"By leading with creative problem solving, we plan to unlock the power of brand loyalty.\"\nAbout FleishmanHillard\nFleishmanHillard specializes in public relations, reputation management, public affairs, brand marketing, digital strategy, social engagement and content strategy.
