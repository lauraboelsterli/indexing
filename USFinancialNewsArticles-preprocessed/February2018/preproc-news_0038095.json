    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hearst today announced it has completed its acquisition of WCWG-TV from Lockwood Broadcast Group. The CW-affiliated television station serves North Carolina’s Piedmont Triad television market encompassing Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem.\nHearst subsidiary Hearst Television Inc., which owns the market’s NBC affiliate WXII-TV, has been partnering with WCWG, also known as The Triad CW, and its digital subchannel, which carries Bounce network programming, under a channel-sharing arrangement. Terms of the transaction, for which Hearst received requisite regulatory approval earlier this week, were not disclosed.\n“We are truly excited to add WCWG to Hearst Television, growing our presence in the Triad community with even more news and entertainment programming,” said Hearst Television President Jordan Wertlieb. “WXII’s proven leadership and commitment to serve the community makes them an excellent partner for WCWG as it continues to grow.”\nIn August 2017, WXII launched a 10 p.m. hour-long weeknight newscast, two hours of weekday morning news and half-hour weekend newscasts on WCWG.\nThe Piedmont Triad is the 48 th largest television market in the United States.
