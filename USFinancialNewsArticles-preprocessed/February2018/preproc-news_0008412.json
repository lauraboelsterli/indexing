    "text": "Feb 6 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index is seen opening 275 points lower at 7,060 on Tuesday, according to financial bookmakers. * ROYAL DUTCH SHELL: Royal Dutch Shell Plc shut the 25,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) coker at its 225,800-bpd Norco, Louisiana, refinery as part of a planned multi-unit overhaul, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday. * GOLD: Gold prices rose on Tuesday as a rout in global equities prompted investors to seek shelter in safe havens such as gold, although expectations of more U.S. rate hikes this year weighed on the market. * OIL: Oil prices dropped by more than 1 percent on Tuesday, extending falls from the previous session as global financial markets headed south in the wake of one of the biggest intra-day falls ever registered on Wall Street. * METALS: London nickel fell three percent on Tuesday, leading the base metals complex towards late January lows as \"risk off\" sentiment soured sharemarkets and safe-haven buying lifted the dollar. * BRITAIN ECONOMY: Britain's shoppers carried on spending more on food in January, reflecting the rise in inflation since the Brexit vote, while they again cut back on non-essential purchases, a survey showed on Tuesday. * The UK blue chip index lost 1.4 percent and is down more than 4.5 percent year to date on Monday, as worries over inflation and rising bond yields took their toll on global equity markets and a survey showed Britain's economy slowed sharply in January. * For more on the factors affecting European stocks, please click on: cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=livemarkets * UK CORPORATE DIARY: Babcock International Group PLC Trading Statement Release BP PLC Q4 2017 Earnings Release Ocado Group PLC Full Year 2017 Earnings Release Hargreaves Lansdown PLC Half Year 2018 Earnings Release TODAY'S UK PAPERS > Financial Times > Other business headlines Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra : visit topnews.session.rservices.com * For Top News : topnews.reuters.com (Reporting by Harish Bhaskar)\n ",
