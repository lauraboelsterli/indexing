The Nifty closed below 10,500 for the seventh time in nine sessions, ending 0.58 percent lower at 10,492.85. The Sensex closed down 0.47 percent at 34,184.04. Investors now await October-December gross domestic product data due later in the day for clues about the domestic economy. Reporting by Arnab Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu",
