    "text": "ARCHBOLD, Ohio, Feb. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:FMAO) today reported financial results for the 2017 fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Include (on a year-over-year basis unless noted):\n59 consecutive quarters of profitability Total gross loans increased 3.5% from 2017 third quarter Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased 12.0% to $9,481,000 Net income increased 7.6% to a record $3,436,000 Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 5.7% to $0.37\n(share data has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split on September 20, 2017) Return on average assets of 1.25%, up from 1.22% Return on average equity of 10.29%, up from 10.12%\n2017 Full-Year Financial Highlights Include :\nTotal gross loans increased 8.6% to a record $823,024,000 Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased 10.9% to $35,899,000 Net income increased 9.1% to a record $12,720,000 Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 8.7% to a record $1.38\n(share data has been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split on September 20, 2017) Return on average assets of 1.18%, up from 1.14% Return on average equity of 9.75%, up from 9.38% Tangible book value per share increased 7.0% to $13.99\n“Across the board, 2017 was an historic year of achievements for Farmers & Merchants as our bank attained record financial and operating results,” stated Paul S. Siebenmorgen, President and Chief Executive Officer. “During 2017, total loans increased 8.6% to a record $823,024,000, and profitability improved 9.1% to a record $12,720,000, driven by a net interest margin of 3.61%, which was an increase of five basis points over the prior year. The growth we achieved during 2017 was a direct result of the company’s focus on loan growth, the contribution of the three new branches we have opened in the past three years, and stable economic trends across our markets. I am pleased that we were able to share 2017’s success with our shareholders by increasing the company’s quarterly cash stock dividend twice during the year, as well as declaring a two-for-one stock split in August. The annual cash dividend, adjusted for the two-for-one stock split, increased 8.7% year-over-year to $0.50 per share, representing the 18 th consecutive year F&M raised its annual cash dividend. Finally, I am encouraged by F&M’s improving investor awareness, as a result of the company’s strong 2017 operating and financial results, the uplisting to Nasdaq, the inclusion into the Russell 3000, and the two-for-one stock split.”\nIncome Statement\nNet income for the 2017 fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $3,436,000, or $0.37 per basic and diluted share, compared to $3,194,000, or $0.35 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year. The 7.6% improvement in net income for the 2017 fourth quarter was primarily due to a 12.0% increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses, partially offset by a 4.9% increase in noninterest expense.\nNet income for the 2017 twelve months was $12,720,000, or $1.38 per basic and diluted share compared to $11,664,000, or $1.27 per basic and diluted share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The 9.1% improvement in net income for 2017 was primarily due to a 10.9% increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses, partially offset by a 4.7% increase in noninterest expense.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not have a material impact on F&M’s 2017 fourth quarter or full year financial results, and the company expects to benefit from a lower effective tax rate in 2018.\nLoan Portfolio and Asset Quality\nTotal loans were $823,024,000, compared to $758,094,000 at December 31, 2016, and $795,205,000 at September 30, 2017. Total loans for 2017, compared to 2016, increased 8.6%, and were up 3.5% from the 2017 third quarter. Year-over-year loan growth was strong across many of the company’s lending areas and included an 8.8% increase in commercial real estate loans, a 15.6% increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 13.8% increase in consumer loans, an 2.7% increase in agricultural real estate loans, and a 12.5% increase in agricultural loans, partially offset by a 3.0% reduction in consumer real estate loans.\nThe company’s provision for loan losses for the 2017 fourth quarter was $25,000, compared to $197,000 for the 2016 fourth quarter. The provision for loan losses for 2017 was $222,000, compared to $1,121,000 in 2016.\nF&M’s loan quality remains strong as the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 684.8% at December 31, 2017, compared to 490.4% at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $138,000, or 0.02% of average loans, compared to $394,000 or 0.05% of average loans, at December 31, 2016.\nStockholders’ Equity and Dividends\nTangible stockholders’ equity increased to $129,667,000 as of December 31, 2017, compared to $120,763,000 at December 31, 2016. On a per share basis, tangible stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was $13.99 compared to $13.07 at December 31, 2016. The increase in tangible stockholders’ equity is the result of growth in retained earnings due to increased profitability. At December 31, 2017, the company had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.02%, compared to 11.77% at December 31, 2016.\nFor 2017, the company declared cash dividends of $0.50 per share, which is an 8.7% increase over 2016’s declared dividend. For 2017, the dividend payout ratio was 34.72% compared to 32.97% for the same period last year.\nMr. Siebenmorgen concluded, “F&M remains well positioned in its local Northwest Ohio and Northeast Indiana markets, which continue to demonstrate favorable economic trends. While we had many financial and operating achievements during 2017, we are not complacent. Across all layers of the company we remain focused on executing our growth-oriented business plan and see significant growth opportunities throughout 2018 and beyond within our existing markets, as well as the three new markets we have entered in the past three years. The company continues to implement its proactive de novo growth strategy, and during the 2018 first quarter, F&M opened its 25 th branch in Findlay, Ohio. I am excited to enter Hancock County and begin offering our community-oriented banking services to customer within this compelling market. Our 2017 financial results demonstrate the success we are having achieving our growth goals and we are optimistic 2018 will be another good year for the bank.”\nAbout Farmer & Merchants State Bank:\nThe Farmers & Merchants State Bank is a local independent community bank that has been serving Northwest Ohio and Northeast Indiana since 1897.
