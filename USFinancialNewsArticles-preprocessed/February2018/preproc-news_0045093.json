    "text": "7:02 AM ET Tue, 20 Feb 2018 | 01:12 \nThanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law in December, many small businesses can expect to take a 20 percent deduction when filing their taxes this year. That's helped to push small-business confidence to a record level in the first quarter. But there's a large disconnect between how small-business owners plan to spend tax windfalls and how most people would prefer those to be doled out. \nIn the Q1 CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey , 37 percent of the general public said they would like to see small businesses use their tax break to boost employees' salaries — easily the most popular use for a potentially large windfall. But small-business owners had previously told us they were not likely to make this a priority. \nIn the Q4 installment of the survey, about a third of small-business owners said they would use their — at the time, hypothetical — windfall to \"pay down debt.\" In second place, 22 percent of small-business owners said they would \"invest in new facilities, equipment or technology,\" and the third most popular choice (12 percent) was to \"pay for maintenance or repair of existing facilities, equipment or technology.\" \nJust 10 percent said they would raise employees' salaries. Joshua Roberts | Getty Images \nDebt payments and facilities may not be the most thrilling ways to spend a big heap of cash, but they are certainly practical. Over the four quarters that we've conducted our survey, small-business owners across the country have consistently ranked the cost of capital/debt as a more critical business issue than the cost of labor. (Both are outranked by other issues, including customer demand, the cost of employee health care and taxes — perhaps not a priority for much longer.) \nDespite a labor market that continues to strengthen, wage growth has failed to exert any upward pressure until just recently . Passing a tax break on to employees may be the response the public hopes for, but small-business owners themselves may not feel the same pressure from their own employees. \nOne reason for this may be simply that most small businesses are truly small and they don't have many employees who can demand an increase in wages. By definition, small businesses have few employees aside from the owner: 61 percent have fewer than five employees, 77 percent have fewer than 10, and 87 percent have fewer than 20. \nMore from the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey:",
