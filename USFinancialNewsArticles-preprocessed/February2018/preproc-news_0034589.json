    "text": "SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lear Corporation (NYSE: LEA), a leading global supplier of automotive seating and electrical systems, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the Company's share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion and extended the authorization period until December 31, 2020. In addition, the Board raised the quarterly cash dividend on the Company's common stock by 40% from $0.50 per share to $0.70 per share. The next dividend is payable on March 26, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2018.\n\"The Company's record financial performance, balance sheet strength and very favorable outlook are allowing us to significantly increase our dividend and continue our proven track record of returning capital to our shareholders,\" said Matt Simoncini, Lear President and Chief Executive Officer. \"For some time now, we have made significant investments in our business which have given Lear unique product capabilities and an industry-leading cost structure. Today we are in the strongest competitive position in our 100-year history. Over the last five years, we have returned record levels of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Lear's total return to shareholders during this period was 300%, better than any of our peers and three times the return for the S&P 500.\"\n\"Lear's Board of Directors fully supports the Company's balanced strategy of investing in the business and consistently returning cash to shareholders, while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet. The shareholder actions announced today are consistent with this strategy and demonstrate the confidence Lear's Board has in the Company's outlook,\" said Henry D. G. Wallace, Lear's Non-Executive Chairman.\nAt the end of 2017, Lear had $546 million remaining on its share repurchase authorization. Including today's action, Lear's total available share repurchase authorization is now $1.5 billion. Since the Company began its share repurchase and dividend programs in 2011, Lear has returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders, including the repurchase of 42% of the Company's shares outstanding at the commencement of our share repurchase program.\nLear may implement share repurchases under its share repurchase authorization utilizing a variety of methods including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions and structured repurchase transactions. Share repurchases are subject to the Company's alternative uses of capital and prevailing financial, market and industry conditions.\nLear's 2018 Annual Stockholders Meeting will be held on May 17, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the Company's corporate headquarters, 21557 Telegraph Road, Southfield, Michigan 48033.
