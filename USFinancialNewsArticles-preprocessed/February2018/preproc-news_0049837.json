    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany and LITTLETON, Mass., Feb. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TÜV Rheinland , a testing and certification leader at the forefront of interoperability, performance and safety in the globally connected world, today announced it plans to invest more than €40 million through 2020 to expand its expertise and offerings in wireless technology testing and certification. These funds will be used to develop new testing facilities for future technologies such as eCall and NB-IoT, while increasing current wireless laboratory capacities as a whole. TÜV Rheinland already operates several laboratories for wireless communication technology and IoT products in Europe, the United States, Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and India. With this new investment program, TÜV Rheinland will strengthen its leadership position within the rapidly growing global IoT market.\nTo become the global one-stop-shop service provider for wireless communication technologies, the testing service provider plans to increase its “Wireless/IoT” team by around 220 staff by 2020.\n“We have already reached several of the milestones set forth in our 2017 wireless strategy of record, with the acquisition of a wireless laboratory in Lund, Sweden and the opening of the ‘TÜV Rheinland Center of Excellence Wireless / IoT’ laboratory in Silicon Valley to handle wireless testing in North America and beyond,” said Stefan Kischka, vice president of Wireless/Internet of Things at TÜV Rheinland. “In addition, the 2017 integration of 4ffCom has allowed TÜV Rheinland to offer customers their own fully automated testing solutions such as a comprehensive testing environment (CTE). Our next objective is to become the global one-stop-shop service provider for all wireless communication technologies and data.”\nTÜV Rheinland’s laboratory network in Europe is currently receiving new investments in Cologne, Nuremberg, Leek, Milan and Lund in order to become a strong partner in the IoT Ecosystem across all of Europe.\n“Direct communication with our customers and partners is critical,” said Mr. Kischka. “Major industry events provide the perfect opportunity for this, and we will have sizable presence in the coming weeks at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona (hall 8, booth E31), embedded world in Nuremberg (hall 3/3, booth 433), and Light + Building in Frankfurt (hall 4.1, booth B40). At all three events, we will deliver expert talks and have ample availability to meet with customers and partners alike.”\nComplete range of wireless communication technologies for various industries\nToday, TÜV Rheinland is one of the leading testing service providers and pioneers across the entire spectrum of wireless communication. For example, the firm was the world’s first testing service provider to establish a Wi-Fi lab, and experts from TÜV Rheinland were involved in developing Bluetooth technology during the technology’s inception. TÜV Rheinland is also the global leader in testing short-range wireless devices and technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee. There is high demand, in particular, for services that ensure smart home devices comply with the wireless communication protocols on which they were designed.\nOne-stop-shop service provider for wireless communication technologies\nThe company maintains active membership on numerous committees dedicated to various wireless technologies, lending its expertise to support standardization processes, joint development of new technologies, and to certify new products before they are launched in the market. These committees include the 5G Automotive Association, LoRaWAN Alliance, Zigbee Alliance, Global Certification Forum (GCF/ PTCRB), CTIA, Wi-Fi Alliance, SIGFOX Alliance, Wi-SUN Alliance, Bluetooth SIG Alliance, Thread Group, openADR, Echonet Lite and many more. The testing service provider remains tightly bound to manufacturers and users around the world, always ready to offer its knowledge-base in wireless communication standards.\nFor more information about TÜV Rheinland’s expanding reach in wireless testing for interoperability, performance and safety, please visit its recently launched landing page at www.tuv.com/wireless .\nFor more information about TÜV Rheinland, visit www.tuv.com/en/ .\nAbout TÜV Rheinland:\nTÜV Rheinland is a global leader in independent inspection services, founded 145 years ago.
