    "text": "2 COMMENTS NEW DELHI—India’s economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a year last quarter, regaining the top spot from China of the world’s fastest-growing major economies.\nAsia’s third-largest economy grew 7.2% in the three months through December compared with a year earlier, government data show. The figure raised hope that the disruptions from dramatic policy moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year may have faded.\nIndia’s growth beat economists’ prediction of 6.9% and was significantly stronger than the 6.5% and 5.7% expansion in the preceding quarters . China’s economic growth, which had overtaken India’s about a year ago , grew 6.8% last quarter.\nA “higher-than-expected GDP number is a positive surprise and reaffirms that the economy has indeed picked up pace,” said Tanvi Garg, an economist at HDFC Bank. “We are optimistic about the growth outlook as the economic recovery further gains momentum.”\nThe data showed strength across most sectors, except for mining. Manufacturing output grew 8.1%, farm output 4.1% and construction output 6.8%, all strengthening from the previous quarter. Services continued to do well, with trade, hotels and transport clocking a 9% expansion. Mining was the lone weak link, with output declining 0.1% following a 7.1% expansion.\nGDP growth had dipped below 6% in the first half of last year as demand was hit by Mr. Modi’s decision to void most of the currency in circulation —a move aimed at stemming corruption and bolstering cashless transactions. The government also implemented a new nationwide goods and services tax, confusing some businesses with new rules .\nWhile India’s economy is growing at an impressive pace by global standards, it needs even-faster expansion to provide jobs to the more than 10 million Indians entering the workforce each year.\nPressure is growing on Prime Minister Modi, who promised his policies would help create millions of new jobs. His biggest moves to modernize an economy in which many businesses operate outside the formal system were initially widely lauded, but doubts have grown about whether they were worth the pain.\nMr. Modi argues that these policies have helped pull India out of what was known as the “fragile five” group of economies—which include Turkey, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia—and will lead to longer-term gains.\nIn October, the government unveiled economy-boosting measures, including a $32 billion capital infusion for state-run banks that are finding it hard to increase lending burdened by bad loans.\nBut a scandal at the country’s second-largest state-run bank has jolted investor confidence. Punjab National Bank in February disclosed a $1.77 billion scheme where a few employees issued unauthorized guarantees to private firms for raising loans. The fraud has since grown to about $2 billion and the health of other state-run banks that had lent money to the companies based on the guarantees has come under question.\nDespite rebounding growth, many businesses, particularly exporters, are still struggling. “The garment industry has been ruined,” said Lalit Thukral, a garment exporter based in Noida on the outskirts of New Delhi. “Small exporters are dying,” he said, because tax refunds due to them under the new system are long overdue, squeezing cash availability and profit margins.\nMore\nChina’s Factory Activity Slips to 19-Month Low Ip: Why an Unpleasant U.S. Inflation Surprise Could Be Coming Sign Up: Real Time Economics newsletter He said his business could slip into a loss this year as the goods and services tax, or GST, has pushed up compliance costs and he loses business to competitors in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Myanmar.\nStill, pockets of the economy are growing smartly. Automobile sales have risen healthily over the past quarter, exports are growing and production of key infrastructure sectors such as cement, steel and refinery products is rising.\nPrivate investment, a weak point of the economy, could pick up as a result, helping the economy build momentum.\nDinesh Singhal, a manufacturer of transformers based in Meerut in northern India, said the GST has reduced tax evasion, helping provide a level-playing field with competitors who were earlier operating outside the tax net and could undercut their prices.\nHis company is investing about 250 million rupees ($3.8 million) during the next year to add production capability for a new product. “We are optimistic. Business should improve this year,” he said.\nWrite to Anant Vijay Kala at anant.kala@wsj.com",
