    "text": "Exceeded Revenue and Gross Margin Guidance; Increased Share Repurchase Authorization to $500 Million\nNIWOT, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX) a world leader in innovative casual footwear for men, women, and children, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nAndrew Rees, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We had a strong final quarter of the year, which enabled us to meet or exceed our revenue and gross margin guidance for the fourth consecutive quarter. Throughout 2017, we focused on our strategic objectives: simplifying our business to reduce costs, improving the quality of our revenues, and positioning ourselves to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Looking at 2018, our Spring/Summer collection is being well received. We expect moderate wholesale and double-digit e-commerce growth to be offset by the loss of retail revenues associated with store reductions. We also anticipate delivering continued gross margin gains and completing our SG&A reduction plan. This lays the groundwork for generating top line growth in 2019 and, ultimately, delivering double-digit EBIT margins.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results:\nRevenues were $199.1 million, growing 6.2% over the fourth quarter of 2016, or 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Top line growth was achieved despite the loss of approximately $14 million due to operating fewer stores and absorbing the impact of the sales of the Taiwan and Middle East businesses. The wholesale and e-commerce businesses grew at double-digit rates and the retail business delivered positive comparable store sales. Gross margin was 45.4%, an increase of 340 basis points over last year's fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by continuing to prioritize high margin molded product, improving go-to-market capabilities, and better managing promotions. Favorable currency rates drove approximately 100 basis points of the improvement. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $120.7 million compared to $118.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percent of revenues, SG&A improved 260 basis points. Fourth quarter 2017 results included $9.4 million of non-recurring charges. The non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan came in at $3.1 million. In addition, $6.3 million of non-recurring charges were incurred in connection with a non-cash impairment charge and a contract termination. Fourth quarter 2016 results included $1.4 million of non-recurring charges. The loss from operations of $30.4 million improved by 23.7% compared to last year’s fourth quarter loss from operations of $39.8 million. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $28.3 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $44.5 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in last year’s fourth quarter. We had 69.5 and 73.5 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n2017 Operating Results:\nRevenues were $1,023.5 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues decreased 1.7% compared to the prior year. Gross margin was 50.5%, an increase of 220 basis points over the prior year. SG&A was $499.9 million compared to $506.3 million in the prior year. Results for 2017 included $17.0 million of non-recurring charges compared to $2.2 million in 2016. Income from operations was $17.3 million compared to a loss from operations of $6.2 million in 2016. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $5.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $31.7 million, or $0.43 per share, in 2016. We had 72.3 and 73.4 million weighted average diluted common shares outstanding on December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights:\nCash provided by operating activities increased 147.2% to $98.3 million during 2017 compared to $39.8 million during 2016. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 increased 16.6% to $172.1 million compared to $147.6 million as of December 31, 2016, despite having repurchased $50.0 million of common stock during the year. This growth reflects the successful execution of the Company’s strategic objectives along with improved working capital management. Inventory declined 11.3% to $130.3 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $147.0 million as of December 31, 2016, reflecting the continued focus on inventory management. Capital expenditures for 2017 were $13.1 million compared to $22.2 million in 2016, as the Company opened fewer stores, completed fewer store remodels, and had lower technology-related expenditures. At December 31, 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding on the $100 million credit facility.\nShare Repurchase Activity and Increased Share Repurchase Authorization:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $22.9 million, at an average price of $10.22 per share. For the full year, the Company repurchased 5.7 million shares of its common stock for $50.0 million, at an average price of $8.82 per share. At year end, $69 million of the Company’s $350 million share repurchase authorization remained unexercised.\nThe Board of Directors recently increased the share repurchase authorization to $500 million. With this increase, $219 million remains available for future share repurchases.\nFinancial Outlook:\nFirst Quarter 2018:\nWith respect to the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects:\nRevenues to be between $265 and $275 million compared to $267.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin to be approximately 49% compared to 49.9% in the first quarter of 2017. At the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed its inventory costing methodology from average cost to first-in-first-out, or FIFO. This change will result in timing-related charges to cost of sales in the first quarter, but has no impact on the full year. Absent these charges, the Company would expect first quarter gross margin to be up modestly to prior year. SG&A of approximately $115 million compared to $118.0 million last year. Both years include approximately $2 million of non-recurring charges incurred in connection with our SG&A reduction plan.\nFull Year 2018:\nWith respect to 2018, the Company expects:\nRevenues to be relatively flat to the prior year. Revenues in 2018 will be negatively impacted by approximately $60 million compared to 2017 due to the impact of business model changes and store closures. Gross margin to be up approximately 70 to 100 basis points over our 2017 gross margin of 50.5%. SG&A is expected to be approximately $475 million. This includes approximately $5 million of non-recurring charges associated with the SG&A reduction plan and approximately $5 million of additional expense associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. This compares to $499.9 million in 2017, which included $17.0 million of non-recurring charges. Income from operations to be approximately $50 million, compared to $17.3 million in 2017. Depreciation and amortization to be approximately $30 million compared to $33.1 million in 2017. Income tax expense of approximately $13 million compared to $7.9 million in 2017.\nConference Call Information:\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results is scheduled for today, Wednesday, February 28, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EST.

Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented.\nWe also present certain information related to our current period results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance. We believe they also provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCROCS, INC.
