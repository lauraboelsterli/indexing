    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Loyal Subjects™ (TLS) - a collectible toy company – is bringing its World Without Borders™ to the Big Apple during the upcoming annual North American International Toy Fair February 17-20. The company will preview its exciting 2018 product line-up in booth #6665, at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City.\nNot all collectible figures are treated equal, unless they're from TLS. The company creates collectible three and a quarter inch (3.25\") stylized Action Vinyls™ (AV), highly detailed, poseable figures that are like nothing else on the market. Action Vinyls lines feature fine-tuned elements, including 12 points of articulation – making them hyper-poseable – plus great sculpt and paint details. AV figures include accessories and collector cards, and many AV lines are packaged in a blind box format with rare chase figures, all for an approximate retail price of $12.99 each. Small figures that PLAY BIG !\nAll this attention to detail with Action Vinyls styling enables deeper play experiences with dynamic interaction among figures from different lines. In the TLS Universe it makes perfect sense for Skeletor™ to take on the Red Ranger™ or have Raphael™ (TMNT) battle Vegeta™ – it's action figures in \"Super Smash Bros\" style! Having a uniform size and style plus interchangeable accessories across AV lines makes the worlds blend seamlessly.\n\"The uniqueness of our Action Vinyls is that there are no borders within the TLS Universe. We give the controls back to the collector, so they're in charge of their own story, their own army building/capture the flag campaign. The power of TLS Action Vinyls are the story telling capabilities inherent in a highly detailed, poseable collectible. We provide that little spark to the collector's imagination and watch that fire ignite when the collectors go knee deep into their stories. It's magical!,\" noted Jonathan Cathey, The Loyal Subjects Founder/CEO and President. \"We are driven by consumer passion. We hear time-and-time again that The Loyal Subjects collectibles are drivers for a more enhanced, fulfilled customer experience. It's like the \"Indian in the Cupboard\" – our figures spring to life! Collectors become their own screenwriters, producers, actors, and directors of their own show and that's really powerful!\"\nThe Loyal Subjects is an emerging brand that is thriving at big box retailers, such as Walmart and Target, and is also formidable on specialty store shelves, including Hot Topic, GameStop, and Toys\"R\"Us. The company has sold more than 2MM Action Vinyls collectible figures since its first AV release in 2012. TLS has enjoyed rapid expansion over the past couple of years as it moved to the \"main stage,\" propelled by a growing base of passionate collectors who are known to drive hundreds of miles to visit many stores in order to load up on TLS AV figures.\nThe 2018 Action Vinyls product line-up from The Loyal Subjects include:\nMega Man: Available now at mass market and specialty retail locations ThunderCats: Available now at mass market and specialty retail locations Horror: featuring characters from It, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and The Exorcist: Available May 2018 Aliens: Available May 2018 Predator 2: Available June 2018 WWE: Available June 2018 Game of Thrones: Available July 2018 Gudetama: Available July 2018 Nickelodeon '90s Splat!: Available July 2018 Ghostbusters: Available September 2018 One Punch Man: Available November 2018 Naruto: Available November 2018\nTLS pays homage to the collector base by offering branded scarcity items and \"Easter eggs.\" Club 28™ is a very limited edition of 28 figures included in an AV line! Aftermarket values on a single Club 28 figure can swell into thousands of dollars. These scarce products are stamped with a \"28\" to commemorate the edition. Additionally, in its retailer-exclusive editions of each AV line, the company produces a single Gold figure stamped with the retailer name (i.e. Walmart's Gold figure has a \"WM\" stamp, Hot Topic \"HT\", Toys\"R\"Us \"TRU\", Target \"TG\"). These figures are a collector's \"Holy Grail,\" with some Gold figures trading between collectors for upwards of $5,000.\nFor more press information please visit: http://toyfair.vporoom.com/TheLoyalSubjects\nAll trademarks mentioned are the properties of their respective owners.\nAbout The Loyal Subjects\nBorn in 2009, The Loyal Subjects™ (TLS) has infused collectible toys with the art, quality, nuances, details and value its loyal fan base of collectors expect.
