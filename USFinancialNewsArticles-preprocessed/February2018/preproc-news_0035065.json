    "text": "ATLANTA, Feb. 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aaron's, Inc. (NYSE: AAN), a leading omnichannel provider of lease-purchase solutions, today announced financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n\"A strong fourth quarter capped a year of significant achievement for Aaron's,\" said John Robinson, Chief Executive Officer. \"We delivered record revenues, EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the full year while making strategic investments in each of our businesses to support long-term growth. At the same time, we further strengthened the balance sheet while enhancing returns for our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. I'm extremely proud of our team and excited about the future.\"\n\"Progressive continues to strengthen its position as a market leader by driving innovation. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 32% and EBITDA increased by 20%. The team is improving speed and ease of use for both customers and retail partner associates. At the same time, we believe our decisioning continues to benefit from scale and further enhancements that are allowing us to capture additional profit dollars and drive more revenue for our retail partners.\"\n\"In the Aaron's Business, we are beginning to reap the benefits from our transformation program. This program encompasses a number of initiatives balanced between revenue growth and cost improvement. The Aaron's Business saw meaningful improvement in average ticket and lease margin in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a significant gain in the EBITDA margin. Many of the leading indicators we follow for the performance of the Aaron's Business are positive, underscoring our optimistic expectations for the business going forward.\"\n\"As we look to 2018, we believe we can accelerate revenue and earnings growth as we build on our momentum,\" continued Mr. Robinson. \"We are conservatively capitalized, which will enable us to further invest in our existing operations and remain well positioned to execute on opportunities that promote innovation and growth. We also plan to continue returning capital to shareholders, when market conditions are appropriate, as evidenced by our new $500 million share repurchase program, which replaces our prior authorization,\" Mr. Robinson concluded.\nFinancial Summary\nAaron's, Inc. (the \"Company\") conducts its operations through three primary businesses: 1) Progressive Leasing's virtual lease-to-own business (\"Progressive Leasing\"); 2) Aaron's branded Company-operated and franchised lease-to-own stores, Aarons.com , our e-commerce platform and Woodhaven, the Company's furniture manufacturing operations (collectively, the \"Aaron's Business\"); and 3) Dent-A-Med, Inc. (\"DAMI\"), our second-look financing business.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Company revenues were $884.6 million compared with $795.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net earnings were $177.6 million compared with $21.6 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share were $2.46 compared with $0.30 a year ago, which reflects a provisional net benefit of $137 million 1 to recognize the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $47.0 million compared with $36.3 million for the same period in 2016, and non-GAAP earnings per share assuming dilution were $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $0.50 for the same quarter in 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of amortization expense resulting from our 2014 acquisition of Progressive Leasing, amortization expense and acquisition and transaction costs resulting from the 2017 acquisition of our largest franchisee, restructuring charges for the Aaron's Business and DAMI and a provisional tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act. For the fourth quarter of 2016, non-GAAP earnings results exclude the effects of Progressive Leasing amortization, restructuring charges for the Aaron's Business and a gain related to the Company's sale of its HomeSmart business.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Company, which excludes the charges and adjustments mentioned above, increased 21.7% to $89.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $73.8 million for the same period in 2016. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and the related non-GAAP reconciliation accompanying this press release.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, revenues increased 5.5% to $3.38 billion compared with $3.21 billion for the prior year period. Net earnings were $292.5 million versus $139.3 million and diluted earnings per share were $4.06 compared with $1.91 last year, primarily due to the provisional tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act and the growth in revenues and net earnings at Progressive Leasing.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net earnings for fiscal year 2017 were $184.7 million compared with $167.7 million for the same period in 2016, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.56 compared with $2.30 for the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share for 2017 exclude the effects of amortization expense resulting from the 2014 acquisition of Progressive Leasing, amortization expense and transaction and transition costs resulting from the 2017 acquisition of our largest franchisee, restructuring charges for the Aaron's Business and DAMI, and a provisional tax benefit as a result of the Tax Act. Non-GAAP earnings results for 2016 exclude the effects of Progressive Leasing amortization, a gain on the sale of the Company's headquarters building, retirement and severance charges, and a loss resulting from the Company's disposition of HomeSmart. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and the related non-GAAP reconciliation accompanying this press release.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Company, which excludes the charges and adjustments discussed above, was $362.7 million for fiscal year 2017 compared with $342.5 million for 2016.\nThe Company generated $158.1 million in cash from operations during 2017 and ended the year with $51.0 million in cash compared with a cash balance of $308.6 million to end 2016. The reduction in cash was due primarily to the acquisition of our largest franchisee, scheduled principal payments of the Company's term loan and unsecured notes, the repurchase of common stock and the repayment of the DAMI credit facility, offset by cash from operations. The Company repurchased approximately 1.96 million shares of its common stock during 2017 and, as stated above, has announced a new program to repurchase up to $500 million of its shares.\n1 Amount represents a preliminary estimate of the effect of revaluing net deferred tax liabilities to a 21% federal tax rate due to the enactment of Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The final impact of Tax Act may change from this preliminary estimate, possibly materially, when assumptions are refined and interpretations of the legislation are finalized including the Company's application of any additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.\nProgressive Leasing Results\nProgressive Leasing's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 32.3% to $428.5 million from $324.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Progressive Leasing's revenue for the 2017 fiscal year increased 26.6% to $1.57 billion from $1.24 billion for fiscal 2016. Active doors increased 10% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to approximately 20,000. Invoice volume per active door increased 24%. Progressive Leasing had 740,000 customers at December 31, 2017, a 24% increase from December 31, 2016.\nEarnings before income taxes for Progressive Leasing were $38.5 million and $140.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with $29.0 million and $104.7 million for the same periods a year ago. EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $50.0 million and $187.8 million, respectively, compared with $41.7 million and $155.5 million for the same periods of 2016. As a percentage of revenues, EBITDA was 11.7% and 12.0%, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with 12.9% and 12.6% for the same periods in 2016. The provision for lease merchandise write-offs was 5.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 5.9% in the same period of 2016. Bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter was 12.1% compared with 11.3% in the same period of 2016.\nThe Aaron's Business Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenues for the Aaron's Business decreased 3.6% to $446.9 million from $463.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenues for fiscal year 2017 decreased 8.4% to $1.78 billion compared with $1.95 billion for fiscal 2016.\nLease revenue and fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 0.6% and decreased 7.1%, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Non-retail sales, which primarily consist of merchandise sales to the Company's franchisees, decreased 17.0% and 12.7% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same periods of the prior year. The decline is attributed in part to the reduction in non-retail sales resulting from the franchise acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2017.\nEarnings before income taxes for the Aaron's Business were $25.1 million and $110.6 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $4.8 million and $123.0 million for the same periods a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $41.4 million and $180.0 million compared with $32.4 million and $191.2 million for the same periods in 2016. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA was 9.3% and 10.1% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with 7.0% and 9.8% for the same periods last year. Write-offs for damaged, lost or unsaleable merchandise were 4.2% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 4.6% for the same period last year.\nSame store revenues (revenues for Company-operated stores open for the entirety of the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 and fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively) decreased 5.4% during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 and decreased 7.0% during the 2017 fiscal year, compared to the 2016 fiscal year. Customer count on a same store basis was down 4.0% during the fourth quarter of 2017. Company-operated Aaron's stores had 983,000 customers at December 31, 2017, a 1.0% increase from 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Aaron's Business had 1,175 Company-operated stores and 551 franchised stores. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company acquired six franchised stores, closed or consolidated eleven Company-operated stores and sold one Company-operated store to a third party. Additionally, one franchised store opened, twelve franchised stores closed and one franchised store was sold to a third party.\nCompany-operated stores that were closed are primarily related to the Company's previously disclosed program to identify, close and consolidate underperforming stores and right size the Company's store footprint in existing markets. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Aaron's Business incurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $3.2 million related to these closures. In the 2017 fiscal year, the aggregate pre-tax restructuring charge related to these store closures and other restructuring activities was $17.5 million.\nDAMI Results\nDAMI's revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $9.3 million and $34.9 million versus $7.5 million and $24.1 million for the same periods of 2016. DAMI's loss before income taxes was $2.8 million and $11.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with a loss before income taxes of $1.6 million and $9.3 million for the same periods in 2016. DAMI's pre-tax, pre-provision loss was $1.8 million and $6.5 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $0.6 million and $3.6 million for the same periods a year ago.\nPre-tax, pre-provision loss is a non-GAAP measure that represents loss before income taxes, adjusted so that loan charge-offs and recoveries are recognized in earnings as they occur by excluding the effect on earnings of changes to management's provision for estimated future loan losses. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\" and the related non-GAAP reconciliation accompanying this press release for more information regarding the calculation of pre-tax, pre-provision loss.\nSignificant Components of Revenue\nConsolidated lease revenues and fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 15.7% and 7.9%, respectively, over the same prior year periods. Franchise royalties and fees decreased 24.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 17.3% for fiscal year 2017 compared with the same periods a year ago. The decrease in franchise royalties and fees was the combined result of decreases in revenues generated by the Company's franchisees and the number of franchised stores. The Company's franchisee revenues totaled $162.1 million and $777.7 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 24.3% and 15.2% from the same periods for the prior year. Same store revenues for franchised stores were down 5.2% and same store customer counts were down 3.9% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter in 2016. For the 2017 fiscal year, same store revenues for franchised stores were down 5.4%. Franchised stores had 416,000 customers at the end of 2017, a 23.5% decline from the end of 2016. Revenues and customers of franchisees are not revenues and customers of the Aaron's Business or the Company. Any changes in the metrics presented above from the prior year periods are not adjusted to net out the effects of the July 2017 purchase of our largest franchisee, which had 104 store locations.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for its 2018 fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share is presented both on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis excluding intangible amortization related to the 2014 Progressive acquisition and the 2017 acquisition of our largest franchisee and any future one-time or unusual items.

The 2016 period is presented to reflect this change.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information:\nNon-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 each exclude $5.4 million in Progressive Leasing-related intangible amortization expense, $1.0 million in amortization expense resulting from our 2017 acquisition of our largest franchisee, $3,000 in acquisition transaction & transitions costs related to the acquisition of our largest franchisee, $3.4 million in restructuring charges and $137.1 million in net provisional tax benefits from the impacts of the Tax Act. For the twelve months of 2017 Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude $23.0 million in Progressive Leasing-related intangible amortization expense, $2.1 million in amortization expense resulting from our 2017 acquisition of our largest franchisee, $2.0 million in acquisition transaction & transition costs related to the acquisition of our largest franchisee, $18.0 million in restructuring charges and $137.1 million in net provisional tax benefits. Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 exclude $6.6 million in Progressive Leasing-related intangible amortization expense, $15.6 million in restructuring charges and a $214,000 gain related to the HomeSmart asset sale. For the twelve months of 2016 Non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude $26.4 million in Progressive-related intangible amortization expense, an $11.1 million gain from the sale of the Company's headquarters building, $3.7 million in retirement and severance charges, $20.2 million in restructuring charges and a $5.4 million impairment charge related to the HomeSmart asset sale.\nThe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA figures presented in this press release are calculated as the Company's earnings before interest expense, depreciation on property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the other adjustments described in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings above.\nManagement believes that non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, and are widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance.\nNon-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings provides management and investors with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain items that generally arose from larger, one-time transactions that are not reflective of the ordinary earnings activity of our operations. This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also provides management and investors with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. These measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because the measures:\nAre widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors. Are a financial measurement that is used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness. Are used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of our operating entities and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nFinally, this press release presents pre-tax, pre-provision loss for DAMI, which is also a supplemental measure not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes this measure is useful because it gives management and investors an additional, supplemental metric to assess DAMI's underlying operational performance for the period. Due to the growth of our originated credit card loan portfolio after our October 2015 acquisition of DAMI, we believe pre-provision, pre-tax loss helps investors to assess DAMI's operating performance until such time as the credit card portfolio reaches levels which management believes will be normal and recurring. Management uses this measure as one of its bases for strategic planning and forecasting for DAMI. Our use of pre-provision, pre-tax loss may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner.\nNon-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be used as a substitute for, or considered superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as the Company's GAAP basis net earnings and diluted earnings per share and the GAAP earnings before income taxes of the Company's segments, which are also presented in the press release. Further, we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and pre-tax, pre-provision loss may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies, because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner.\nReconciliation of Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share Assuming Dilution to Non-GAAP\nNet Earnings and Earnings Per Share Assuming Dilution\n(In thousands, except per share)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\n(Unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet Earnings\n$\n177,560\n$\n21,631\n$\n292,536\n$\n139,283\nAdd Progressive Leasing-Related Intangible Amortization Expense (1)(2)\n3,611\n4,413\n14,935\n16,803\nAdd Franchisee Related Intangible Amortization Expense (3)\n678\n—\n1,336\n—\nLess Gain on Sale of Building (4)\n—\n—\n—\n(7,060)\nAdd Retirement and Severance Charges (5)\n—\n—\n—\n2,349\nAdd Loss on Sale of HomeSmart (6)\n—\n(143)\n—\n3,463\nAdd Restructuring (7)(8)\n2,250\n10,424\n11,674\n12,893\nAdd Acquisition Transaction and Transition Costs (9)\n2\n—\n1,282\n—\nLess Tax Act Benefit\n(137,098)\n—\n(137,098)\n—\nNon-GAAP Net Earnings\n$\n47,003\n$\n36,325\n$\n184,665\n$\n167,731\nEarnings Per Share Assuming Dilution\n$\n2.46\n$\n0.30\n$\n4.06\n$\n1.91\nAdd Progressive Leasing-Related Intangible Amortization Expense (1)(2)\n0.05\n0.06\n0.21\n0.23\nAdd Franchisee Related Intangible Amortization Expense (3)\n0.01\n—\n0.02\n—\nLess Gain on Sale of Building (4)\n—\n—\n—\n(0.10)\nAdd Retirement and Severance Charges (5)\n—\n—\n—\n0.03\nAdd Loss on Sale of HomeSmart (6)\n—\n—\n—\n0.05\nAdd Restructuring (7)(8)\n0.03\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\nAdd Acquisition Transaction and Transition Costs (9)\n—\n—\n0.02\n—\nLess Tax Act Benefit\n(1.90)\n—\n(1.90)\n—\nNon-GAAP Earnings Per Share Assuming Dilution (10)\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.50\n$\n2.56\n$\n2.30\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding Assuming Dilution\n72,314\n72,365\n72,121\n73,013\n(1)\nNet of taxes of $1,810 and $8,084 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 calculated using the estimated tax rates of 33.4% and 35.1% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(2)\nNet of taxes of $2,175 and $9,547 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 calculated using the effective tax rate for the respective periods.\n(3)\nNet of taxes of $340 and $724 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 calculated using the estimated tax rates of 33.4% and 35.1% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(4)\nNet of taxes of $4,011 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 calculated using the effective tax rate for the period.\n(5)\nNet of taxes of $1,334 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 calculated using the effective tax rate for the period.\n(6)\nNet of taxes of $71 and $1,968 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 calculated using the effective tax rate for the respective periods.\n(7)\nNet of taxes of $1,127 and $6,320 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 calculated using the estimated tax rates of 33.4% and 35.1% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(8)\nNet of taxes of $5,136 and $7,325 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 calculated using the effective tax rate for the respective periods.\n(9)\nNet of taxes of $1 and $694 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 calculated using the estimated tax rates of 33.4% and 35.1% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\n(10)\nIn some cases, the sum of individual EPS amounts may not equal total EPS calculations due to rounding.\nDAMI Pre-tax, Pre-provision Loss\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\n(Unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nLoss Before Income Taxes\n$\n(2,832)\n$\n(1,587)\n$\n(11,289)\n$\n(9,273)\nAdd: Adjustment to Increase Allowance for Loan Losses During\nPeriod\n992\n1,035\n4,830\n5,687\nPre-tax, Pre-provision Loss\n$\n(1,840)\n$\n(552)\n$\n(6,459)\n$\n(3,586)\nDue to the growth of our originated credit card loan portfolio subsequent to the October 2015 acquisition of DAMI, we believe pre-provision, pre-tax loss helps investors to assess DAMI's operating performance until such time as the credit card portfolio reaches levels which management believes will be normal and recurring.
