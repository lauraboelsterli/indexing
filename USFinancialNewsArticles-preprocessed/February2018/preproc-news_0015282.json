Our pro forma presentation excludes\namortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation, reorganization costs and net gains or losses from\ninvestments, as well as their related tax effects. We also utilized an assumed tax rate of 40% in both 2017 and 2016, which excludes items\nsuch as the tax effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, any release of reserves for uncertain tax positions established in prior years and\nthe effect of any adjustments related to the filing of prior year tax returns. The pro forma data does not purport to be prepared in accordance\nwith Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States.\n(2) The tax effect of adjusting items is based on the accounting treatment and rate for the jurisdiction of each item.\n(3) To compute pro forma net income, we apply a pro forma effective tax rate of 40% to each quarter and period presented.\nForrester Research, Inc.\nKey Financial Data\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nBalance sheet data:\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable investments\n$ 134,123\n$ 138,105\nAccounts receivable, net\n$ 70,023\n$ 58,812\nDeferred revenue\n$ 145,207\n$ 134,265\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nCash flow data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 37,493\n$ 44,477\nPurchases of property and equipment\n$ (7,861)\n$ (4,140)\nRepurchases of common stock\n$ (39,967)\n$ (1,791)\nDividends paid\n$ (13,631)\n$ (12,987)\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nMetrics:\nAgreement value\n$ 242,900\n$ 238,400\nClient retention\n76%\n75%\nDollar retention\n88%\n87%\nEnrichment\n96%\n93%\nNumber of clients\n2,409\n2,432\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nHeadcount:\nTotal headcount\n1,392\n1,378\nResearch and consulting staff\n515\n520\nSales force\n539\n523\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/forrester-research-reports-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial-results-300595344.html\nSOURCE Forrester",
