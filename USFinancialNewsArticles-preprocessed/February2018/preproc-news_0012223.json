    "text": "(For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on)\nCANOVANAS, Puerto Rico, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo. The illegal shantytown emerged on a public wetland after 1989s Hurricane Hugo left thousands homeless.\nAbout 6,000 squatters landed here, near the El Yunque National Forest, and built makeshift homes on 40 acres that span a low-lying valley and its adjacent mountainside. Wood and concrete dwellings, their facades scrawled with invented addresses, sit on cinder blocks. After Maria, many are missing roofs; some have collapsed altogether.\nAmid the rubble, 59-year-old Joe Quirindongo sat in the sun one recent day on a wooden platform - the only remaining piece of his home. Soft-spoken with weathered skin and a buzzcut, Quirindongo pondered his limited options.\nI know this isnt a good place for a house, said Quirindongo, who survives on U.S. government assistance. Sometimes I would like to go to another place, but I cant afford anything.\nVilla Hugo reflects a much larger crisis in this impoverished U.S. territory, where so-called informal homes are estimated to house about half the population of 3.4 million. Some residents built on land they never owned. Others illegally subdivided properties, often so family members could build on their lots.\nMost have no title to their homes, which are constructed without permits and usually not up to building codes. The houses range in quality and size, from one-room shacks to sizable family homes. Many have plumbing and power, though not always through official means.\n(For a Wider Image photo essay on the island's post-Maria housing crisis, see: http://reut.rs/2EJmIq3 )\nThe concentration of illegal housing presents a vexing dilemma for local and federal authorities already overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding an economically depressed island after its worst natural disaster in nine decades.\nPuerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló has stressed the need to build back better, a sentiment echoed by U.S. disaster relief and housing officials. But rebuilding to modern standards or relocating squatters to new homes would take an investment far beyond reimbursing residents for lost property value. Its an outlay Puerto Ricos government says it cant afford, and which U.S. officials say is beyond the scope of their funding and mission.\nYet the alternative - as Villa Hugo shows - is to encourage rebuilding of the kind of substandard housing that made the island so vulnerable to Maria in the first place.\nIts definitely a housing crisis, said Fernando Gil, Puerto Ricos housing secretary. It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it.\nIn Puerto Rico, housing is by far the largest category of storm destruction, estimated by the island government at about $37 billion, with only a small portion covered by insurance. That's more than twice the governments estimate for catastrophic electric grid damage, which was made far worse by the shoddy state of utility infrastructure before the storm.\nPuerto Rico officials did not respond to questions about how the territory estimated the damage to illegally built homes.\nMaria destroyed or significantly damaged more than a third of about 1.2 million occupied homes on the island, the government estimates. Most of those victims had no hazard insurance - which is only required for mortgage-holders in Puerto Rico - and no flood insurance. Just 344,000 homes on the island have mortgages, according U.S. Census Bureau data.\nOfficials at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) acknowledged the unique challenges of delivering critical housing aid to Puerto Rico. Among them: calculating the damage to illegal, often substandard homes; persuading storm victims to follow through on application processes that have frustrated many into giving up; and allocating billions in disaster aid that still wont be nearly enough solve the islands housing crisis.\nBy far the most money for Puerto Rico housing aid is expected to come from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\nHUD spokeswoman Caitlin Thompson declined to comment on how the agency would spend billions of dollars in disaster relief funds to rebuild housing, or how it planned to help owners of informally built homes. Two HUD officials overseeing the agencys Puerto Rico relief efforts, Todd Richardson and Stan Gimont, also declined to comment.\nBut the disaster aid package currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress would provide far less housing aid than Puerto Rico officials say they need. Governor Rosselló is seeking $46 billion in aid from HUD, an amount that dwarfs previous allocations for even the most destructive U.S. storms.\nThat's nearly half the island's total relief request of $94 billion.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives instead passed a package of $81 billion, with $26 billion for HUD, that still needs Senate and White House approval. The money would be divided between regions struck by several 2017 hurricanes - including Maria, Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida - as well as the recent California wildfires. Congress could also decide to approve additional aid later.\nMY MOTHER IS SCARED\nA generation ago, Maria Vega Lastra, now 61, was among the estimated 28,000 people displaced by Hurricane Hugo. Neighbors helped her build a new home in what would become Villa Hugo, in the town of Canóvanas.\nHer daughter, 34-year-old Amadaliz Diaz, still recalls her older brother grinning as he sawed wood for the frame of their self-built, one-floor house, with a porch and three bedrooms.\nNow, Vega Lastras roof has holes in it, and her waterlogged wooden floorboards buckle with each step.\nVega Lastra has been staying with her daughter, who lives in Tampa, as the family waits on applications for FEMA aid. The agency initially denied her application in December, saying it could not contact her by phone, Diaz said.\nVega Lastra is returning to her home this week, uncertain if its condition has gotten worse. Her daughter bought her an air mattress to take with her.\nMy mother is scared, Diaz said. I hope the government helps her. I work, but I have three kids to take care of.\nThe islands housing crisis long predated the storm. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency data, Puerto Ricos index of new home prices fell 25 percent over the last decade, amid a severe recession that culminated last May in the largest government bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.\nLegal home construction, meanwhile, plummeted from nearly 16,000 new units in 2004 to less than 2,500 last year, according to consultancy Estudios Tecnicos, an economic data firm.\nA 2007 study by environmental consultant Interviron Services Inc, commissioned by the Puerto Rico Builders Association, found that 55 percent of residential and commercial construction was informal. That would work out to nearly 700,000 homes.\nThat figure might be high, said David Carrasquillo, president of the Puerto Rico Planning Society, a trade group representing community planners. But even a very conservative estimate would yield at least 260,000 illegally built houses, he said.\nGenerations of Puerto Rican governments never made serious efforts to enforce building codes to stop new illegal housing, current and former island officials said in interviews. Past administrations had little political or economic incentive to force people out of neighborhoods like Villa Hugo.\nFormer Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, in office during Hurricane Hugo, said he tried to help informal homeowners without policing them. Our policy was not to relocate, but rather improve those places, Hernandez Colon said in an interview.\nSubsequent administrations advocated similar policies; none made meaningful headway, partly because of Puerto Ricos constant political turnover.\nToday, informal communities provide a stark contrast to San Juans glittering resorts and bustling business districts. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz pointed to poor barrios like those near the city's Martín Peña Channel, hidden behind the skyscrapers of the financial hub known as the Golden Mile.\nIts not something Im proud of, but we hide our poverty here, Cruz said in an interview.\nRECOVERY DILEMMA\nThe task of rebuilding Puerto Ricos housing stock ultimately falls to the territory government, which has no ability to pay for it after racking up $120 billion in bond and pension debt in the years before the storm.\nThat leaves the island dependent on U.S. relief from FEMA, the SBA and HUD.\nThe SBA offers low-interest home repair loans of up to $200,000. FEMA provides homeowners with emergency grants, relocation assistance and other help. HUD is focused on long-term rebuilding efforts, working directly with local agencies to subsidize reconstruction through grants.\nFEMAs cap for disaster aid to individuals is $33,300, and actual awards are often much lower. Normally, FEMA eligibility for housing aid requires proving property ownership, but the agency says it will help owners of informal homes if they can prove residency.\nHow exactly to help gets complicated. For example, someone who builds their own home with no permits on land they own is more likely to be treated as a homeowner, said Justo Hernandez, FEMAs deputy federal coordinating officer. Squatters who built on land they didn't own, however, would likely only be given money to cover lost items and relocate to a rental, he said.\nSeveral Villa Hugo residents said they received money from FEMA, but many didnt know what it was for and complained it wasnt enough.\nLourdes Rios Romero, 59, plans to appeal the $6,000 grant she got for repairs to her flooded home, citing a much higher contractors quote. Neighbor Miguel Rosario Lopez, a 62-year-old retiree, showed a statement from FEMA saying he was eligible for $916.22, to perform essential repairs that will allow you to live in your home.\nWithout money for major changes, most homeowners said they planned to combine the aid they might get from FEMA with what little money they could raise to rebuild in the same spot.\nFEMA does not police illegal building. Code enforcement is left to the same local authorities who have allowed illegal construction to persist for years.\nQuirindongo is planning to buy materials to rebuild his Villa Hugo home himself with about $4,000 from FEMA. It will be the third time he has done so, having lost one home to a 2011 flood, another to a fire.\nI just want to have something that I can say, This is mine, Quirindongo said.\nGIVING UP\nMany others appear to have given up on FEMA aid because the agencys application process is entangled with a separate process for awarding SBA loans to rebuild homes.\nFEMA is legally bound to assess whether applicants might qualify for SBA loans before awarding them FEMA grants. If an applicant passes FEMAs cursory eligibility assessment, they are automatically referred to SBA for a more thorough screening.\nApplicants are not required to follow through on the SBA process - but they cannot qualify for FEMA aid unless they do. FEMA only provides a grant when the SBA denies the applicant a loan.\nFEMA said it has referred about 520,000 people out of 1.1 million total applicants so far to the SBA. But as of Monday, only 59,000 followed through with SBA applications. Of those, some 12,000 later withdrew, SBA data shows.\nAs soon as people see SBA they say, I give up, I dont want a loan - I cant afford a loan, FEMA's Hernandez said.\nSBA spokeswoman Carol Chastang said the agency is working with FEMA to educate flood victims on available benefits and the application process, including sending staffers to applicants homes.\n330,000 VACANT HOMES\nBefore the storm hit, Puerto Rico already had about 330,000 vacant homes, according to Census Bureau 2016 estimates, resulting from years of population decline as citizens migrated to the mainland United States and elsewhere. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can move to the mainland at will.\nPuerto Rico and federal officials have considered rehabilitating the vacant housing for short- and long-term use, along with building new homes and buying out homeowners in illegally built neighborhoods, according to Gil and federal officials.\nRosselló, the Puerto Rican governor, has said the rebuilding plan must include a fleet of properly built new homes. Gil, the housing secretary, said the administration would like to build as many as 70,000 properties.\nHUD officials declined to comment on whether the agency would finance new housing. Its Community Development Block Grant program allows for local governments to design their own solutions and seek HUD approval for funding.\nThe cost of constructing enough new, code-compliant properties to house people displaced by Maria could far exceed the available federal aid. Making them affordable also presents a problem.\nPuerto Ricos subsidized social interest housing, geared toward low-income buyers, typically provides units that sell in the mid-$100,000 range, with prices capped by the government. Thats beyond the means of many displaced storm victims.\nGil offered little detail on a solution beyond saying it will include a mix of new development, buyout programs for owners of illegally built homes and other options.\nThe answer will come down to how much Washington is willing to pay, he said. He invoked the islands territorial status and colonial history as a root cause of its poor infrastructure and housing stock before the storm.\nIt is precisely because we have been neglected by the federal government that the islands infrastructure is so weak, he said.\nMany Puerto Rico officials continue to advocate for bringing relief and legitimacy to squatter communities like Villa Hugo, rather than trying to relocate their residents.\nCanovanas Mayor Lornna Soto has been negotiating with island officials to provide property titles to Villa Hugos population. The vast majority still dont have them.\nIts long overdue to recognize that they are not going anywhere and their communities need to be rebuilt with proper services, Soto said.\nDiaz said she supports her mother's decision to return to Villa Hugo, regardless of what aid the government ultimately provides.\nI grew up there, Diaz said. Everyone knows us there.\n(Reporting by Nick Brown in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico; editing by Brian Thevenot)",
