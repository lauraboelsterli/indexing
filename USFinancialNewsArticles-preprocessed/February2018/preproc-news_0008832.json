    "text": "BEIJING, Feb 7 (Reuters) - London metals on Wednesday recovered some of the ground they had lost in the previous session as global equities bounced back after days of sharp falls. FUNDAMENTALS * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the LME was up 1 percent at $7,145 a tonne by 0154 GMT, recovering from a 1.3 percent drop in the previous session. * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded March copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 0.1 percent at 53,080 yuan ($8,485.33) a tonne. * OTHER METALS: LME zinc, nickel and aluminium made gains of 1 percent to 2 percent, with only lead losing ground, trading down 0.5 percent. * FREEPORT: Freeport-McMoRan Inc reinstated its cash dividend on Tuesday, three years after suspending it, reflecting a stronger financial position, improved market conditions and a positive outlook for cash generation. * ZIMBABWE: Zimbabwe has the potential to be a leading producer of lithium, which has so far attracted more interest than any other of its minerals, Zimbabwe's new Minister of Mines and Mining Development Winston Chitando said on Tuesday. * MARUBENI: Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp on Tuesday posted a 53 percent jump in April-December net profit and lifted its full-year forecast by 18 percent, boosted by higher copper and coal price. * COLUMN: Africa's mining industry should be poised on the verge of great things, but instead it appears to be seeking a reset button as miners continue to clash with governments over how best to exploit the continent's resources. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or MARKETS NEWS * Asian share markets were trying to find their footing on Wednesday as a semblance of calm returned to Wall Street where major indices bounced into the black after days of deep losses.
