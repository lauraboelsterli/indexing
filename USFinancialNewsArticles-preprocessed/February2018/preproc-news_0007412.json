    "text": "SCRANTON, Pa., Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Peoples Financial Services Corp. (\"Peoples\") (NASDAQ: PFIS), the bank holding company for Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, today reported unaudited financial results at and for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Peoples reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.36 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.7 million, or $0.64 per share for the comparable period of 2016.\nNet income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, totaled $18.5 million or $2.50 per share compared to $19.6 million or $2.65 per share for the same period last year.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which among other things reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), the Company concluded that its deferred tax assets, net had to be revalued. The Company's deferred tax assets, net represents expected corporate tax benefits anticipated to be realized in the future. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate reduces these anticipated future benefits. The revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets, net at December 31, 2017 resulted in a reduction of these net assets and a corresponding increase in income tax expense of $2.6 million or $0.35 per share, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to evaluating its results of operations in accordance with GAAP, Peoples routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as tangible stockholders' equity and core net income ratios. The reported results included herein contain items, which Peoples considers non-core, namely gains on sales of investment securities available-for-sale, gains on the sale of our merchant services portfolio and the non-recurring tax provision related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Peoples believes the reported non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding its operating performance and trends. Where non-GAAP disclosures are used in this press release, a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure is provided in the accompanying tables. The non-GAAP financial measures Peoples uses may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures of other financial institutions.\nCore net income, which excludes the $2.6 million non-recurring charge to tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $5.3 million or $0.71 per share, an increase of $0.6 million or 11.5% from $4.7 million for the same period in 2016. The results in the fourth quarter of 2016 did not include any items considered non-core.\nCore net income, which we have defined to exclude gains on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale, the gain on the sale of our merchant services portfolio, net of tax, and the non-recurring charge to income tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets, for the twelve months ended December 31, totaled $19.8 million and $19.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Core net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.67, an increase from $2.59 for the same period in 2016. The results in 2017 include a gain on the sale of our merchant services portfolio of $2.3 million and a charge to income tax expense of $2.6 million for the revaluing of our deferred tax assets, net, while the results for 2016 include net gains on the sale of investment securities of $623 thousand.\nNOTABLES\nLoans, net growth of $60.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (14.7% annualized rate), with total growth during 2017 of $160.1 million, or 10.4%. Deposit growth of $31.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (7.3% annualized rate), with total deposit growth during 2017 of $130.3 million or 8.2%. Book value per share improved to $35.82 at December 31, 2017 from $34.71 at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share improved to $26.83 at December 31, 2017 from $25.57 at December 31, 2016. Tax-equivalent net interest income increased to $17.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17.5 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Tax-equivalent net interest margin decreased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 3.63%, compared to 3.73% for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and decreased four basis points compared to 3.67% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets to loans, net, and foreclosed assets decreased to 0.68% at December 31, 2017, from 0.83% at September 30, 2017 and 0.93% at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses to loans, net was 1.12 % at December 31, 2017, an increase from 1.04% at December 31, 2016. With the passage of \"H.R.1.\", the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"the Tax Act\"), we took a non-recurring charge to income tax expense of $2.6 million due to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets, net in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Tax Act, among other items, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% commencing in 2018.\nINCOME STATEMENT REVIEW\nThe tax-equivalent net interest margin for the three and twelve months ended December 31, were 3.63% and 3.69% respectively in 2017, compared to 3.67% and 3.77% for the same periods in 2016.\nTax-equivalent net interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, increased $5.1 million to $77.6 million in 2017 from $72.5 million in 2016. The increase in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily due to a $135.9 million increase in average earning assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. The tax-equivalent yield on the loan portfolio decreased to 4.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 4.43% for the comparable period in 2016. Loans, net averaged $1.6 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $1.5 billion for the comparable period in 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, the tax-equivalent yield on total investments decreased to 2.84% in 2017 from 2.89% in 2016. Average investments totaled $272.4 million in 2017 and $271.3 million in 2016. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $104.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period last year. The cost of funds, which represents our average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities, increased to 0.61% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 0.55% for the same period of 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses totaled $4.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and $5.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. For the quarter ended December 31, the provision for loan losses was $1.2 million in 2017 and $1.4 million in 2016.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, noninterest income totaled $17.2 million in 2017, an increase from $15.9 million in 2016. The gain on sale of our merchant services portfolio was $2.3 million in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 when we recognized gains of $623 thousand from the sale of available-for-sale investment securities. Increases in service charges, fees and commissions, income from fiduciary activities and wealth management services more than offset decreases in income generated from merchant services, income from mortgage banking activities and life insurance investment income. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, noninterest income totaled $3.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower merchant services income in the current period due to the sale of our merchant business in the second quarter of 2017 as well as lower revenues generated from mortgage banking activities and life insurance investment income. Offsetting the decrease was higher service charges, fees and commissions, income from fiduciary activities and wealth management services.\nNoninterest expense increased $3.3 million or 6.8% to $51.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $48.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $4.2 million or 18.9% due to merit increases and continued investment in our expansion markets in the Lehigh Valley and King of Prussia. Partially offsetting the increase in salaries, merchant services related expenses decreased $1.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 due to the sale of our merchant business in the second quarter of 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, noninterest expense increased to $12.5 million from $12.3 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $173 thousand or 1.4%. Salaries and employee benefits were the key driver increasing to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $5.7 million for the comparable period in 2016, an increase of $1.1 million or 19.0%. As with the results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the buildout of our expansion plan led to the increases in salaries and employee benefit expense. Partially offsetting the increase to salaries and benefits was a decrease of $711 thousand or 98.3% in merchant services expense due to the sale of our merchant services portfolio during the second quarter of 2017.\nBALANCE SHEET REVIEW\nAt December 31, 2017, total assets, loans and deposits were $2.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. Loans, net grew $160.1 million or 10.4% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Total deposits grew $130.3 million or 8.2% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $27.1 million or 7.7% while interest-bearing deposits increased $103.2 million or 8.4% in 2017. Total investments were $281.8 million at December 31, 2017, including $272.5 million securities classified as available-for-sale and $9.3 million classified as held-to-maturity.\nStockholders' equity equaled $265.0 million or $35.82 per share at December 31, 2017, and $256.6 million or $34.71 per share at December 31, 2016.

Dividends declared for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $1.26 per share representing a dividend payout ratio of 50.4%.\nASSET QUALITY REVIEW\nNonperforming assets were $11.6 million or 0.68% of loans, net and foreclosed assets at December 31, 2017, compared to $14.2 million or 0.93% of loans, net and foreclosed assets at December 31, 2016. The allowance for loan losses equaled $19.0 million or 1.12% of loans, net at December 31, 2017 compared to $16.0 million or 1.04% of loans, net, at December 31, 2016. Loans charged-off, net of recoveries, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, equaled $1.8 million or 0.11% of average loans, compared to $2.0 million or 0.14% of average loans for the comparable period last year.\nAbout Peoples:\nPeoples Financial Services Corp. is the parent company of Peoples Security Bank and Trust Company, a community bank serving Bucks, Lackawanna, Lehigh, Luzerne, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming Counties in Pennsylvania and Broome County in New York through 27 offices.

Such factors include, but are not limited to: prevailing economic and political conditions, particularly in our market area; credit risk associated with our lending activities; changes in interest rates, loan demand, real estate values and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; changes in any applicable law, rule, regulation or practice with respect to tax or legal issues; our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting Peoples' operations, pricing, products and services and other factors that may be described in Peoples' Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nIn addition to these risks, acquisitions and business combinations, present risks other than those presented by the nature of the business acquired.
