    "text": "Gulf Breeze, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AppRiver, a leading provider of cloud-based cybersecurity and productivity services, today announced it has hired Chris Essex to fill the new position of senior vice president of global sales.\nThe creation of the role, and the choice of Essex to fill it, are steps toward the company’s strategic goals for rapidly expanding its reseller channel, dominating the Office 365 and Microsoft 365 space, and taking a leadership position in new markets around the world.\n“Chris has proven many times over that he has the experience, initiative, and leadership qualities it takes to develop a high-performance channel and a powerful global sales operation,” said Michael Murdoch, AppRiver President and CEO. “He was our clear first choice to lead AppRiver’s worldwide sales teams and we are incredibly excited he will be spearheading our charge to number one.”\nOn the heels of another year of record sales growth, AppRiver intends to firmly establish itself as a premier global cloud-based cybersecurity and productivity service provider. To achieve that goal, the company is offering best-in-class reseller margins, making licensing and provisioning easier for partners and end users, and making strategic acquisitions that will augment AppRiver’s security service offerings.\n“We don’t just expect to be the best choice for resellers,” said Scott Cutler, the company’s chief operating officer. “AppRiver will be the driving force in the security SaaS market, the company creating and empowering successful channel partners worldwide. Chris is going to be instrumental in making that happen.”\nEssex brings to AppRiver more than 15 years of direct and channel sales leadership experience in the technology space, with an emphasis on SaaS and security solutions. Previously a vice president for Forecepoint (formerly Websense), Essex has established a long track record of developing successful, high-growth sales teams that focused on enterprises and SMBs, as well as vertical and specialty markets, in the US and abroad.\n“AppRiver has enjoyed tremendous success thus far. We’re set for a rapid, upward trajectory in the months ahead and we’re taking our resellers and agents with us,” Essex said. “This is an exciting time to join the team and to be in a position to help the company move further and faster toward its full global potential.”\nAbout AppRiver\nAppRiver offers cloud-based cybersecurity and productivity services to over 60,000 companies worldwide. Launched in 2002, with spam and virus filtering as its flagship service, AppRiver has since added web malware protection, email encryption, secure archiving, and email continuity to its suite of security services.
