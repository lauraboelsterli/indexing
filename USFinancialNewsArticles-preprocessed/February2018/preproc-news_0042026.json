    "text": "BERLIN, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Niki Lauda has teamed up with German holiday airline Condor to sell flights for Laudamotion, the airline created after he bought Austrian carrier Niki out of insolvency.\n* Lauda agreed a deal to buy Niki, a unit of collapsed Air Berlin, in January, beating a rival offer from British Airways-owner IAG\n* Lauda plans to restart the carrier with 15 planes by the end of March, scrap the Niki brand and integrate it into his Laudamotion business, which offers business charter flights\n* However, without an established airline group behind it, Laudamotion lacks sales and marketing channels to get it back up and running quickly.\n* Condor, part of Thomas Cook, said it will market Laudamotion flights to holiday destinations, such as in Spain, on its website and in travel agencies\n* Laudamotion is also in talks about its planes and crews flying for Lufthansaâ€™s budget carrier Eurowings while the Austrian airline restarts its own operations, although no decision has yet been taken (Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Edmund Blair)\n ",
