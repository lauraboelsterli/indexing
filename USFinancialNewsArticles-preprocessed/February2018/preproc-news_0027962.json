    "text": "DUBAI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Emaar Properties reported a 16 percent slide in fourth-quarter net profit on Wednesday as costs weighted on Dubai’s largest listed developer.\nEmaar’s weak performance follows results from fellow developer DAMAC Properties earlier, which showed a nearly 47 percent plunge in net profit for the quarter.\nRising supply from new developments and modest demand dragged down property prices in Dubai last year.\nEmaar raised $1.3 billion in November when it sold a 20 percent stake, or 800 million shares, in a listing of unit Emaar Development.\nNet profit for Emaar Properties dipped 16 percent from the same period of last year to 1.36 billion dirhams ($370.3 million) in the fourth quarter.\nDubai’s residential property market shows few signs of bouncing back quickly from a now three-year downturn, National Bank of Kuwait said in its economic update earlier this month.\nPrices are down 16-19 percent from their peaks of over three years ago, the report said.\nRevenue for Emaar Properties rose 21 percent to 5.36 billion dirhams in the quarter.\nBut a 32 percent climb in cost of revenues and a 14 percent rise in selling, marketing and general expenses weighed on the results.\nChairman Mohamed Alabbar said last week he was worried about 2019 and would prefer to keep debt levels “reasonable.” He did not elaborate.\nEmaar Development reported this month a 30 percent increase in 2017 profit to 2.74 billion dirham. Emaar Malls, another unit, reported a 27 percent rise in fourth quarter profit to 574 million dirhams.\nEmaar Properties is part of a joint-venture building The Tower in Dubai, which it has said would be the world’s tallest tower, outdoing the more than 160-storey Burj Khalifa, built by the developer.\nThe Tower at Dubai Creek Harbour is scheduled to be completed in 2020.
