    "text": "TORONTO, Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northland Power Inc. (“ Northland ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:NPI) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Northland achieved outstanding financial, operational and development results in 2017,” noted John Brace, Northland’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our thirtieth year in business was highlighted by several notable achievements. We completed two offshore wind projects totalling €4.0 billion on or ahead of schedule and under budget, bringing our total operating capacity to over 2 GW. We also acquired a third offshore wind project, with a total project cost of €1.3 billion. We achieved a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 6% increase in free cash flow over 2016, with the 11% dividend increase announced in December reflecting our strong performance. Our competitive position is strong, and we remain confident and excited about our continued ability to grow while generating robust long-term value for our shareholders.”\nHighlights:\n2017 Financial Results\nSales increased 25% from $1.1 billion in 2016 to $1.4 billion and gross profit increased 37% to $1.2 billion primarily due to contributions from Gemini, pre-completion revenue from Nordsee One and positive contributions from the on-shore wind facilities, primarily Grand Bend. These positive variances were partially offset by the impact of the one-time receipt of retroactive payments in connection with the Global Adjustment Decision in 2016 ($94.7 million net impact included in 2016 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow; refer to Northland’s 2017 Annual Report for additional information). Contributions from Kingston were also lower than in 2016 as a result of the expiration of its PPA in January 2017, referred to as the “ Kingston Remarketing Initiative ”. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) increased 22% from $627 million in 2016 to $765 million primarily due to contributions from the Gemini and Nordsee One offshore wind facilities, partially offset by the Global Adjustment Decision, the Kingston Remarketing Initiative, and higher plant operating and management and administration costs. Adjusted EBITDA of $765 million exceeded the most recent guidance range issued of $710 to $750 million primarily as a result of higher than expected wholesale market prices at Gemini in the fourth quarter, favourable foreign exchange movements and timing of certain development expenditures. Free cash flow per share (a non-IFRS measure) increased 4% from $1.40 in 2016 to $1.46 primarily as a result of contributions from Gemini, partially offset by the impact of the Kingston Remarketing Initiative, the Global Adjustment Decision, and higher interest expense. Free cash flow per share exceeded the most recent guidance range issued of $1.18 to $1.30 per share primarily as a result of the same factors affecting adjusted EBITDA. Net income increased 45% from 2016 to $276 million primarily due to an increase in operating income combined with a non-cash fair value gain associated with derivative contracts ($50.8 million gain compared to a $27.8 million loss in 2016). The positive variances were partially offset by higher depreciation and finance costs in connection with completed projects.\nSales and net income, as reported under IFRS, include consolidated results of entities not wholly-owned by Northland, whereas adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow only include Northland’s net economic interest.\n2018 Outlook\nFinancial Guidance – In 2018, management expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $860 to $930 million, an increase of approximately 17% from 2017. In 2018, management expects the free cash flow per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.00 per share, an increase of approximately 27% over 2017. Refer to the Outlook section of this press release for additional information.\nConstruction\nNordsee One – 332 MW offshore wind farm, German North Sea – In December 2017, the Nordsee One offshore wind project achieved final completion, which marked the end of construction and the start of commercial operations, and commenced the term-loan phase of the project debt. The project was completed on schedule and under its total budget of €1.2 billion. Concurrently with final completion, Nordsee One renegotiated the project’s €840 million senior debt, reducing loan margins by 150 basis points. Deutsche Bucht – 252 MW offshore wind project, German North Sea – Subsequent to the project’s acquisition and financial close in August 2017, key associated construction contracts have been signed, and manufacturing of the offshore substation, monopiles and transition pieces has commenced. Project completion is expected by the end of 2019. The total estimated project cost is approximately €1.3 billion. Northland has invested $0.4 billion of corporate funds into the project.\nSummary of Consolidated Results (in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts) Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 FINANCIALS Sales $ 394,611 $ 478,500 $ 1,376,256 $ 1,099,000 Gross profit 365,026 422,870 1,236,717 905,760 Operating income 196,456 276,649 632,126 508,637 Net income (loss) 82,281 290,735 275,836 190,559 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 238,675 277,096 765,176 626,879 Cash provided by operating activities 257,642 344,424 849,007 719,812 Free cash flow (1) 69,547 118,998 256,100 242,324 Cash dividends paid to common and class A shareholders 34,254 34,790 134,307 139,890 Total dividends declared to common and class A shareholders (2)\n49,068 46,648 189,981 185,606 Per share information Free cash flow (1) $ 0.40 $ 0.69 $ 1.46 $ 1.40 Total dividends declared to common and class A shareholders (2) $ 0.28 $ 0.27 $ 1.09 $ 1.08 ENERGY VOLUMES Electricity production in gigawatt hours ( GWh ) (3) 2,125 2,035 6,556 6,392 (1) Refer to the Non-IFRS Financial Measures section of this press release for additional information. (2) Represents total dividends declared to common and class A shareholders including dividends in cash or in shares under the DRIP. (3) Includes Gemini and Nordsee One pre-completion production volumes. Refer to SECTION 5.1 Operating Facilities’ Results of the 2017 Annual Report for additional information. Fourth Quarter Results Summary\nOffshore wind facilities\nElectricity production, including pre-completion production, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 was 530 GWh higher compared to the same quarter last year primarily due to all of Gemini’s turbines producing power throughout the quarter. Nordsee One earned the equivalent of 326 GWh in pre-completion production, including paid curtailment.\nSales and adjusted EBITDA increased $52.4 million and $48.5 million, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year primarily as a result of pre-completion revenue from Nordsee One, partially offset by lower results at Gemini. Gemini’s 15-year subsidy agreements with the Government of the Netherlands tops up the wholesale market-based revenue to a fixed, contractual rate per megawatt hour ( MWh ). The subsidy is subject to an annual production ceiling (the “ Gemini Subsidy Cap ”), beyond which, production earns revenue at wholesale market rates. In addition, the top up to a fixed contractual rate is subject to a floor price, thereby exposing Gemini to market price risk when wholesale prices fall below the contractual floor price. Sales were lower in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the annual Gemini Subsidy Cap being achieved in November 2017. Plant operating costs increased $13.1 million compared to the same period last year because wind turbines were not fully commissioned in the prior year.\nThermal facilities\nElectricity production decreased 473 GWh compared to the same quarter of 2016 primarily due to the Kingston Remarketing Initiative and a change in management’s operating strategy at the Iroquois Falls facility as a result of the Enhanced Dispatch Contract ( EDC ) executed in 2017 and fewer dispatches at Thorold.\nSales decreased $136.8 million compared to the same quarter of 2016 as a result of these factors and the receipt of one-time payments of $104.5 million associated with the Global Adjustment Decision in 2016. Operating income and adjusted EBITDA were $107.2 million and $92.9 million lower, respectively, primarily as a result of lower sales, partially offset by lower plant operating and other costs.\nOn-shore renewable facilities\nElectricity production of 381 GWh was higher than the same quarter last year. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were consistent with the same quarter in 2016 due to higher production at Jardin and Mont Louis being offset by the impact of a shutdown at Grand Bend to complete a one-time planned substation reactor installation. As a result of the above factors, operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the renewable facilities increased by $1.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nManagement and administration (M&A) costs comprised of corporate and facility related costs, decreased $3.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Corporate M&A costs decreased $5.7 million primarily due to the timing of early-stage development activities, as well as the impact of certain non-recurring costs in 2016, partially offset by higher personnel costs in 2017. Facility M&A costs increased $2.4 million primarily due to higher costs at Gemini as a result of partial capitalization of M&A costs during commissioning in 2016.\nFinance costs, net (primarily interest expense) increased $20.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year primarily due to interest costs at Gemini and Nordsee One no longer being capitalized following completion of construction activities.\nImpairments were nil in 2017. The $23.1 million charge in 2016 primarily related to changes in cash flow forecasts for the Kingston facility.\nNon-cash fair value gains totalled $11.9 million, including a $9.7 million gain in the fair value of financial derivative contracts, compared to a $177.5 million gain in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the adoption of hedge accounting. The fair value adjustments in 2017 are non-cash items which will reverse over time, and have no impact on the cash obligations of Northland or its projects.\nOther expense (income) increased $6.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year primarily due to a $10.3 million fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 on a third-party partner loan, partially offset by a gain on the sale of the German on-shore wind farms.\nNet income\nMainly due to the factors described above, combined with a $16.4 million higher depreciation expense and a $50.0 million lower deferred income tax expense, net income was $82.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $290.7 million for the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNorthland’s adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $38.4 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. The significant factors decreasing adjusted EBITDA include:\n$94.7 million as a result of the one-time receipt in 2016 of retroactive payments in connection with the Global Adjustment Decision; $38.2 million as a result of lower sales at Gemini due to the annual Gemini Subsidy Cap having been achieved in November 2017, after which production generated revenue solely at wholesale market rates; $8.1 million as a result of the expiration of the PPA at Kingston in January 2017; and $5.3 million as a result of a planned major outage at North Battleford which did not occur in 2016.\nFactors partially offsetting the decrease in adjusted EBITDA include:\n$87.4 million as a result of pre-completion revenue (net of certain operating costs) from Nordsee One; $10.4 million higher operating income from Northland’s other operating facilities; $7.5 million as a result of higher operating income under the Enhanced Dispatch Contract executed by Iroquois Falls in 2017; and $3.9 million decrease in relevant corporate M&A costs related to timing of development projects partially offset by increased personnel costs.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow of $69.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $49.5 million lower than the corresponding period in 2016. Significant factors decreasing free cash flow include:\n$94.7 million due to the one-time receipt in 2016 of retroactive payments in connection with the Global Adjustment Decision; $32.4 million increase in net interest expense primarily related to a full year of Gemini senior debt; $8.1 million decrease due to the expiration of the PPA at Kingston in January 2017; and $5.8 million increase in scheduled debt repayments related to Gemini and McLean’s.\nFactors partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow include:\n$59.7 million increase in contributions from Gemini, partially offset by the impact of the annual Gemini Subsidy Cap being reached during the quarter; $7.5 million increase in operating income from the Enhanced Dispatch Contract at Iroquois Falls executed in 2017; $6.3 million decrease in relevant corporate M&A costs related to the timing of development projects; $6.1 million increase in Gemini interest income on the subordinated debt; and $4.6 million increase in operating income from Northland’s other operating facilities.\nOutlook\nNorthland actively pursues new power development opportunities that encompass a range of clean technologies, including natural gas, wind, solar and hydro.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nIn 2017, adjusted EBITDA of $765 million exceeded the most recent guidance range issued of $710 to $750 million primarily as a result of higher than expected wholesale market prices at Gemini in the fourth quarter, favourable foreign exchange movements and timing of certain development expenditures. In 2018, management expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $860 to $930 million, an increase of approximately 17% over 2017, assuming a CAD/euro exchange rate of 1.52. In 2020, once the construction of the Deutsche Bucht offshore wind project is completed and is fully operational, management expects Deutsche Bucht to generate adjusted EBITDA of approximately €155 to €175 million annually.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn 2017, free cash flow of $1.46 per share exceeded the most recent guidance range issued of $1.18 to $1.30 per share primarily as a result of the same factors affecting adjusted EBITDA. In 2018, management expects the free cash flow per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.00 per share, an increase of approximately 27% over 2017.\nRefer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in Northland’s 2017 Annual Report for additional information on Northland’s outlook for 2018.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis press release includes references to Northland’s adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and applicable payout ratio and per share amounts, which are not measures prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ). Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and applicable payout ratio and per share amounts do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and, as presented, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income, cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Rather, these measures are provided to complement IFRS measures in the analysis of Northland’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow and applicable payout ratio and per share amounts are widely accepted financial indicators used by investors to assess the performance of a company and its ability to generate cash through operations.
