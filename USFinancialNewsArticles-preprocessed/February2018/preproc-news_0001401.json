Cricket - South Africa v India - First One Day International - Kingsmead Stadium, Durban, South Africa - February 1, 2018. India's Virat Kohli celebrates scoring a century. REUTERS/Rogan Ward \nDu Plessis carried his side as his team mates were strangled by India’s wrist spinners, slumping to 134-5 with Kuldeep Yadav the pick of the bunch as he finished with figures of 3-34 in an economical 10-over spell. \nTogether with Chris Morris (37), Du Plessis piled on late runs to take South Africa to a better than expected total, and hand a sell-out crowd hope but still significantly short of a defendable target. Slideshow (10 Images) \nIndia have won eight of their previous nine ODIs chasing down a target and Kohli felt his side always in with a chance of doing so again. \n“It was a special knock for me because the first game of a series is always important. When we restricted South Africa we knew we needed one partnership to effectively take us home,” Kohli said at the presentation ceremony. \nThe second game of the series is at Centurion in Pretoria on Sunday. South Africa top the International Cricket Council’s ODI team rankings with India second. Reporting by Mark Gleeson,; Editing by Ed Osmond",
