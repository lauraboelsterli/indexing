    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 3:28 AM / in 4 hours Israel warplanes target Syria military position: Syrian state TV Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBEIRUT (Reuters) - Israeli warplanes struck a Syrian military position in a rural area near Damascus on Wednesday, triggering Syria’s air defense system which destroyed most of the missiles, a Syrian army statement carried by state television said. \nThe statement said several missiles were launched by the Israeli jets from inside the territory of neighboring Lebanon at 03:42 am local time. \n“The general command of the armed forces holds Israel fully responsible for the dangerous consequences of its repeated, aggressive and uncalculated adventures,” the army statement said. \nIn Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokeswoman said: “We do not respond to such reports.” \nThe Syrian army said it had destroyed most of the Israeli missiles fired at its position, but did not give details of any damage or casualties. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the missiles targeted “positions of the Syrian army and its allies” in the region of Jamraya, west of Damascus, which was also hit in December. \nThe Israeli air force has said it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Lebanon’s Hezbollah nearly 100 times since the war in Syria began more than six years ago. \nIsrael regards the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which is fighting alongside the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as the biggest threat it faces on its borders. \nIt has grown deeply alarmed by Iran’s expanding clout during the conflict, and has warned it would act against any threat from Tehran. \n(This story has been refiled to change dateline to BEIRUT from CAIRO) Reporting by Dahlia Nehme in Beirut, Kinda Makieh in Damascus and Jeffrey Heller in Jerusalem; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky",
