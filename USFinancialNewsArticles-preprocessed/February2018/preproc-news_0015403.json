(NASDAQ: ALXN) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Total revenues for the full year of 2017 were $3.551 billion, a 15 percent increase compared to 2016. The negative impact of foreign currency on total revenues year-over-year was 1 percent or $28.6 million, net of hedging activities. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the full year of 2017 was $1.97, a 12 percent increase versus the prior year, inclusive of $286.5 million of expenses related to the previously announced restructuring activities. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the full year of 2017 was $5.86 per share, a 27 percent increase versus the prior year.\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter were $909.7 million, a 9.5 percent increase compared to the same period in 2016. The benefit of foreign currency on total revenues year-over-year was less than 1 percent or $0.1 million, net of hedging activities. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.13 per share, a 68 percent decrease versus the prior year, inclusive of $95.1 million of expenses related to the previously announced restructuring activities and $45.8 million related to U.S. tax reform. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.48 per share, a 17 percent increase versus the prior year.\n\"2017 was a year of rapid transformation for Alexion as we continued to advance our global leadership in rare diseases and position Alexion for the future. I am proud of our accomplishments and performance in 2017, which include strengthening the leadership team and Board of Directors, achieving regulatory approvals for Soliris for the treatment of patients with gMG in the US, Europe and Japan, completing enrollment in the ALXN1210 PNH Phase 3 trials and the Soliris NMOSD Phase 3 trial, strengthening our global patent portfolio for Soliris and continuing to achieve double-digit revenue and volume growth,\" said Ludwig Hantson, Chief Executive Officer of Alexion. \"We enter 2018 with a well-defined strategy to build long-term sustainable value for shareholders. I look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year.\"\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nSoliris ® (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,144.1 million, compared to $2,843.2 million in 2016, representing an 11 percent increase.

Friedman, M.D., Francois Nader, M.D. and Judith Reinsdorf, J.D. Alexion also previously announced that Directors M. Michele Burns, Alvin S. Parven and Ann M. Veneman, J.D. have advised the Board that they do not plan to stand for re-election at the Company’s next annual meeting of shareholders.\nResearch and Development\nComplement Portfolio Updates\nSoliris ® (eculizumab)- Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG): In December 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan approved Soliris as a treatment for patients with gMG who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive and whose symptoms are difficult to control with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy or plasmapheresis (PLEX). Soliris (eculizumab)- Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Enrollment is complete in the PREVENT study, a single, multinational, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of Soliris in patients with NMOSD. Alexion expects to report data in mid-2018. ALXN1210- Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): Enrollment is complete in a Phase 3 trial comparing ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients with PNH and in a Phase 3 PNH Switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Alexion expects to report data from these studies in the second quarter of 2018. ALXN1210- Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in a Phase 3 trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS. Enrollment is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enrollment and dosing are also ongoing in a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with aHUS. ALXN1210- Subcutaneous: Alexion plans to initiate in late 2018 a single, PK-based Phase 3 study of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously once per week to support registration in PNH and aHUS. In December 2017, Alexion entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. that enables the Company to use Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology in the development of subcutaneous formulations for its portfolio of products, including a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nTotal revenues $3,850 to $3,950 million Soliris revenues $3,325 to $3,400 million Metabolic revenues $525 to $550 million R&D (% total revenues) GAAP 20% to 22% Non-GAAP 18% to 20% SG&A (% total revenues) GAAP 26% to 28% Non-GAAP 23% to 24% Operating margin GAAP 31% to 34% Non-GAAP 48% to 49% Earnings per share GAAP $4.35 to $4.75 Non-GAAP $6.60 to $6.80 2018 financial guidance assumes the following:\nA foreign currency benefit, net of hedging activities, of $45 million to $55 million Unfavorable Soliris revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year GAAP effective tax rate of 15 to 17 percent; non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16 to 18 percent (both inclusive of Alexion's provisional assessment of the impact of U.S. tax reform)\nAlexion’s financial guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates net of hedging activities and does not include the effect of business combinations, license and collaboration agreements, asset acquisitions, intangible asset impairments, changes in fair value of contingent consideration or restructuring and related activity outside of the previously announced activities that may occur after the day prior to the date of this press release.\nAlexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $30 million to $70 million related to the 2017 restructuring activities. As the Company continues to execute its strategic business plan and global footprint, it may incur restructuring expenses in 2018 that are materially different from the current estimate.\nConference Call/Webcast Information:\nAlexion will host a conference call/audio webcast to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Alexion does not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except when a duty arises under law.\nIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial measures that Alexion believes, when considered together with the GAAP information, provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to performance, trends and prospects that promote a more complete understanding of our operating results and financial position during different periods.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the attached Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Results and GAAP to non-GAAP 2018 Financial Guidance for explanations of the amounts adjusted to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and projected twelve months ending December 31, 2018.\nPrior year amounts may have been adjusted to conform to current year rounding presentation.\n(Tables Follow)\nALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

As a result of the adoption, we recorded an $18.8 million decrease in retained earnings, primarily resulting from the elimination of previously recorded prepaid tax assets.
