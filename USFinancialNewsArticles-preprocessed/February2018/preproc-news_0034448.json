    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Carriage Services, Inc. (NYSE: CSV) today announced results for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nMel Payne, Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"After eight consecutive years of record performance, our 2017 consolidated operational and financial performance did not meet our reported high performance expectations, as Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share declined 14.2% to $1.39, Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA declined 6.8% to $68.7 million, Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin declined 310 basis points to 26.6% and Adjusted Free Cash Flow declined 21.4% to $37.4 million.\nMany of the reasons behind the decline in our operating performance were addressed in our Second and Third quarter earnings releases, e.g. weak cemetery preneed sales, lower Field EBITDA Margins of funeral home acquisitions made in 2016 not yet integrated under our Standards Operating Model, and investment in overhead infrastructure and people. However, beneath the covers of the reported performance our company was continuously improving in many areas during the year. We were encouraged by the fourth quarter results from our Acquisition Funeral Home and Cemetery segments as these businesses achieved year over year improvement in both organic revenue growth and Field EBITDA Margins. The momentum shown in these segments in the fourth quarter has accelerated into 2018.\nYear to date and fourth quarter comparative highlights are shown below:\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRecord Total Revenue of $258.1 million, an increase of 4.0%; Record Net Income of $37.2 million, an increase of 89.9%; Record GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $2.09, an increase of 86.6%;\nRecord Total Field EBITDA of $104.5 million, an increase of 0.1%; Total Field EBITDA Margin down 160 basis points to 40.5%; Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of $68.7 million, a decrease of 6.8%; Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin down 310 basis points to 26.6%; Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.39, a decrease of 14.2%; and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $37.4 million, a decrease of 21.4%.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nRecord Total Revenue of $65.1 million, an increase of 3.5%; Record Net Income of $22.7 million, an increase of 449.1%; Record GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.31, an increase of 495.5%;\nTotal Field EBITDA of $26.7 million, a decrease of 1.7%; Total Field EBITDA Margin down 220 basis points to 41.0%; Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of $17.5 million, a decrease of 7.4%; Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin down 320 basis points to 26.9%; Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.39, an increase of 8.3%; and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $12.5 million, a decrease of 3.3%.\nAt the beginning of 2012 we launched what we now refer to as the Carriage Good To Great Journey that never ends. We think about and lead the company in terms of a Ten Year Vision and Five Year Strategy with our Rolling Four Quarter Outlook within a 'Roughly Right Range' of outcomes over time as we execute our three core models. Having produced extraordinary performance during the first five year timeframe of our Good To Great Journey that ended in 2016, we believe in hindsight that 2017 was clearly a year of transition and continued transformation which was evident across the Carriage Operating and Consolidation Platform.\nWe upgraded leadership talent in both operations and home office support teams, achieved the best Same Store Funeral volume and revenue trends in years, and established a surge of acquisition activity and momentum into 2018 from a larger and more effective Corporate Development Team. The continuous improvement transformation that occurred during 2017 coupled with the major tax reform legislation passed at year end has set the table for our Company to achieve a much higher plateau of performance in the future as compared to the past, starting in 2018. Therefore we consider the first quarter of 2018 to be the beginning of the second five year timeframe of Carriage's Good To Great Journey that never ends.\nWe are increasing our Rolling Four Quarter 'Roughly Right Outlook Range' of Adjusted Diluted EPS to $2.00 - $2.05, a 16% increase compared to the previous Outlook. The Rolling Four Quarter Outlook includes the impact from the recently enacted tax reform legislation and a continuation of the positive operating momentum we experienced in the latter part of 2017 that has continued into 2018. The Outlook does not include any future acquisition activity, although we are more excited than ever about the industry consolidation landscape and the pipeline of high quality candidates produced by our Corporate Development Team. We expect our effective GAAP tax rate to be in a range of 26%-28% in 2018, compared to our historic rate of 40%.\nAll of our leaders and employees have accepted the challenge of making 2018 a historic year of operating and financial performance for our Company. Additionally, all of our senior leaders have accepted the challenge of Executing on eleven ' Big Ideas ' that will accelerate the Carriage Good To Great Journey during our second five year timeframe. And most importantly, each of our Managing Partners has accepted the challenge of leading the successful realization of a Ten Year Vision of growth and success for their individual business. Therefore I am pleased to announce our annual theme: Carriage Services 2018: Our Guiding Principles and Shared 'Being The Best' Ten Year Vision and Execution of Each Business! ,\" concluded Mr. Payne.\nHIGH PERFORMANCE HEROES\nCarriage 2017 Pinnacle of Service Award Winners\nAs an important part of our High Performance Culture tradition and language, and because we have a passionate conviction that RECOGNITION is the highest form of motivation, listed below are 29 Carriage Being The Best Pinnacle Of Service Award winners and 12 managing partners who achieved 100% Of Standards for 2017:\n\"Being The Best\" Pinnacle of Service Award\nCurtis Ottinger\nHeritage Funeral Home; Chattanooga, TN\nMatthew Simpson\nFry Memorial Chapel; Tracy, CA\nMichael Nicosia\nOuimet Brothers Concord Funeral Chapel; Concord, CA\nAndy Shemwell\nMaddux-Fuqua-Hinton Funeral Homes; Hopkinsville, KY\nJustin Luyben\nEvans-Brown Mortuaries & Crematory; Sun City, CA\nVerdo Werre\nMcNary-Moore Funeral Service; Colusa, CA\nJames Terry\nJames J.

We have had many wonderful performances since the start of our Good To Great Journey by High Performance Hero Funeral and Cemetery Managing Partners and Sales Managers and their teams of winning employees, so I am more than honored on behalf of our Standards Council members, senior leadership team and Board of Directors to announce our second group of Good To Great Award winners for the five year timeframe that began in 2013 and ended at year end 2017, as listed below:\nCindy Hoots\nSchmidt Funeral Homes; Katy, TX\nJim Terry\nJames J.

Throughout the year, we slowly shifted the portfolio allocation to equity securities, as we found better relative value opportunities versus the high yield market. Given current market conditions, we expect to allocate a lower portion of our portfolio to fixed income throughout 2018.\nReported Financial Revenue declined 5.9% to $17.5 million and Financial EBITDA declined 7.2% to $16.2 million. The decline in Financial Revenue and EBITDA was primarily due to the reduction of realized income from a lower allocation to fixed income in our Cemetery Perpetual Care Trusts.\nADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW\nWe produced Adjusted Free Cash Flow from operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 of $12.5 million and $37.4 million, respectively, compared to Adjusted Free Cash Flow from operations of $13.0 million and $47.6 million for the corresponding periods in 2016. A reconciliation of Cash Flow Provided by Operations to Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017\nCash flow provided by operations\n$\n15,195\n$\n14,405\n$\n50,035\n$\n45,230\nCash used for maintenance capital expenditures\n(2,239)\n(2,100)\n(7,402)\n(8,422)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n12,956\n$\n12,305\n$\n42,633\n$\n36,808\nPlus: Incremental Special Items:\nAcquisition and divestiture expenses\n—\n—\n516\n—\nSeverance costs\n—\n—\n3,979\n—\nConsulting fees\n—\n—\n496\n—\nNatural Disaster Costs\n—\n222\n—\n620\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n$\n12,956\n$\n12,527\n$\n47,624\n$\n37,428\nROLLING FOUR QUARTER OUTLOOK\nThe Rolling Four Quarter Outlook (\"Outlook\") reflects management's opinion on the performance of the portfolio of existing businesses, including performance of existing trusts, and excludes size and timing of acquisitions for the Rolling Four Quarter Outlook period ending December 31, 2018 unless we have a signed Letter of Intent and high likelihood of a closing within 90 days. This Outlook is not intended to be management estimates or forecasts of our future performance, as we believe precise estimates will be precisely wrong all the time. Rather our intent and goal is to reflect a \"Roughly Right Range\" most of the time of future Rolling Four Quarter Outlook performance as we execute our Standards Operating, Strategic Acquisition and 4E Leadership Models over time. Similarly, we self-publish a Company and Investment Profile, available on our website, that includes a Five Year \"Roughly Right Scenario\" of our future performance which together with our Five Year Trend Report provides investors a ten year past and future profile of our financial value creation dynamics and condition, making it easier to judge whether our \"trends will continue to be the friend\" of long term investors.\nROLLING FOUR QUARTER OUTLOOK – Period Ending December 31, 2018\nRange\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenues\n$280 - $285\nAdjusted Consolidated EBITDA\n$80 - $85\nAdjusted Net Income\n$34 - $36\nAdjusted Basic Earnings Per Share (1)\n$2.18 - $2.22\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (1)\n$2.00 - $2.05\nFactors affecting our analysis include, among others, funeral contract volumes, average revenue per funeral service, cemetery interment volumes, preneed cemetery sales, capital expenditures, execution of our funeral and cemetery Standards Operating Model, market volatility and changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy. Revenues, Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the four quarter period ending December 31, 2018 are expected to improve relative to the trailing four quarter period ended December 31, 2017 due to increases in our existing Funeral Home and Cemetery portfolio and modest decreases in overhead as a percentage of revenue.\n(1)\nThe Rolling Four Quarter Outlook on Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share does not include any changes to our fully diluted share count that could occur related to additional share repurchases or a stock price increase and EPS dilution calculations related to our convertible subordinated notes and outstanding and exercisable stock options.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACT\nCarriage Services has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow, February 15, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. central time.

the Company. Our non-GAAP reporting provides a transparent framework of our operating and financial performance that reflects the earning power of the Company as an operating and consolidation platform.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe the Non-GAAP results are useful to investors to compare our results to previous periods, to provide insight into the underlying long-term performance trends in our business and to provide the opportunity to differentiate ourselves as the best consolidation platform in the industry against the performance of other funeral and cemetery companies.\nThe Company's GAAP financial statements accompany this release. Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures are provided in this press release.\nThe Non-GAAP financial measures include \"Special Items\", \"Adjusted Net Income\", \"Consolidated EBITDA\", \"Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA\", \"Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin\", \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\", \"Funeral, Cemetery and Financial EBITDA\", \"Total Field EBITDA\", \"Total Field EBITDA Margin\", \"Divested Revenue\", \"Divested EBITDA\", \"Divested EBITDA Margin\", \"Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share\" and \"Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\" in this press release. These financial measurements are defined as similar GAAP items adjusted for Special Items and are reconciled to GAAP in this press release. In addition, the Company's presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other companies' reports. The definitions used by the Company for our internal management purposes and in this press release are as follows:\nSpecial Items are defined as charges or credits included in our GAAP financial statements that can vary from period to period and are not reflective of costs incurred in the ordinary course of our operations. Special Items are taxed at the federal statutory rate of 35 percent for both the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, except for the accretion of the discount on the Convertible Notes as this is a non-tax deductible item. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income plus adjustments for Special Items and other expenses or gains that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. Consolidated EBITDA is defined as net income before income taxes, interest expenses, non-cash stock compensation, depreciation and amortization, and interest income and other, net. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is defined as Consolidated EBITDA plus adjustments for Special Items and other expenses or gains that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operations, adjusted by Special Items as deemed necessary, less cash for maintenance capital expenditures. Funeral Field EBITDA is defined as Funeral Gross Profit, excluding depreciation and amortization, regional and unallocated funeral costs and Financial EBITDA related to the Funeral Home segment. Cemetery Field EBITDA is defined as Cemetery Gross Profit, excluding depreciation and amortization, regional and unallocated cemetery costs and Cemetery Financial EBITDA related to the Cemetery segment. Funeral Financial EBITDA is defined as Funeral Financial Revenue less Funeral Financial Expenses. Cemetery Financial EBITDA is defined as Cemetery Financial Revenue less Cemetery Financial Expenses. Total Field EBITDA is defined as Gross Profit, excluding depreciation and amortization, regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs. Total Field EBITDA Margin is defined as Total Field EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Divested Revenue is defined as revenues from sold businesses and revenues lost as a result of the termination of a municipal contract in 2017. Divested EBITDA is defined as Divested Revenue, less field level and financial expenses related to the sold businesses and the terminated municipal contract noted above. Divested EBITDA Margin is defined as Divested EBITDA as a percentage of Divested Revenue. Adjusted Basic Earnings Per Share is defined as GAAP Basic Earnings Per Share, adjusted for Special Items. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is defined as GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, adjusted for Special Items.\nFuneral Field EBITDA and Cemetery Field EBITDA\nOur operations are reported in two business segments: Funeral Home Operations and Cemetery Operations. Our Field level results highlight trends in volumes, Revenues, Field EBITDA (the individual business' cash earning power / locally controllable business profit) and Field EBITDA Margin (the individual business' controllable profit margin).\nFuneral Field EBITDA and Cemetery Field EBITDA are defined above. Gross Profit is defined as Revenue less \"Field costs and expenses\" - a line item encompassing four areas of costs: i) Funeral field costs, ii) Cemetery field costs, iii) depreciation and amortization and iv) regional and unallocated costs. Funeral and Cemetery field costs include funeral merchandise costs, cemetery merchandise costs, operating expenses, labor and other related expenses incurred at the business level.\nRegional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs presented in our GAAP statement consist primarily of salaries and benefits of our Regional leadership, incentive compensation opportunity to our Field employees and other related costs for field infrastructure. These costs, while necessary to operate our businesses as currently operated within our unique, decentralized platform, are not controllable operating expenses at the Field level as the composition, structure and function of these costs are determined by Executive leadership in the Houston Support Center. These costs are components of our overall overhead platform presented within Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA. We do not openly or indirectly \"push down\" any of these expenses to the individual business' field level margins.\nWe believe that our \"Regional and unallocated funeral and cemetery costs\" are necessary to support our decentralized, high performance culture operating framework, and as such, are included in Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, which more accurately reflects the cash earning power of the Company as an operating and consolidation platform.\nConsolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA\nConsolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are defined above. Our Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA include adjustments for Special Items and other expenses or gains that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations.\nHow These Measures Are Useful\nWhen used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, our Field EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that we believe are useful measures to facilitate comparisons to our historical consolidated and business level performance and operating results.\nWe believe our presentation of Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA, key metric used internally by our management, provides investors with a supplemental view of our operating performance that facilitates analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nLimitations of the Usefulness of These Measures\nOur Field EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies' due to different methods of calculation. Our presentation is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Funeral Field EBITDA and Cemetery Field EBITDA are not consolidated measures of profitability.\nField EBITDA excludes certain costs presented in our GAAP statement that we do not allocate to the individual business' field level margins, as noted above. A reconciliation of Field EBITDA to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.\nConsolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA exclude certain items that we believe do not directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our normal business operations. A reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is set forth below.\nTherefore, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of our performance and should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis press release includes the use of certain financial measures that are not GAAP measures. The Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for additional information and are reconciled to their most comparable GAAP measures below.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income for the
