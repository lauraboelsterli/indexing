    "text": "Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc raised its offer to buy NXP Semiconductors NV to $127.50 per share from $110, after being pressured by shareholders led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe raised offer valued NXP at $44 billion, and the higher offer could come as soon as this week, the paper reported. ( on.wsj.com/2EUFXzs )\nBroadcom Ltd, which is seeking to buy Qualcomm for $121 billion, had said its offer was contingent on either Qualcomm buying NXP at $110 per share or the deal being terminated.\nReporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru\n ",
