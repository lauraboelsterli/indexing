Refer to the section entitled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this release.\nNORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ingevity Corporation (NYSE:NGVT) today reported preliminary fourth quarter net sales of $229.5 million and net income of $47.8 million, representing 20.8 percent of sales. Sales were up 8.8 percent versus $210.9 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter and net income increased 309 percent versus $11.7 million last year. Net income in the current period was favorably impacted by volume, price and mix improvements, and tax benefits recognized from the H.R. 1 - U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform). As a result of the U.S. tax reform, the company recorded a one-time benefit of $24.5 million associated with the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities. The fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.97. Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $0.45 excluding certain items of $0.52 per share, which includes a benefit of $0.58 per share from U.S. tax reform. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $52.6 million were up 46.1 percent versus fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $36.0 million. Ingevity’s fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.9 percent was up 580 basis points from the prior year’s fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1 percent.\nFor the full year, net sales were $972.4 million and net income was $145.0 million, representing 14.9 percent of sales. Sales were up 7.1 percent versus $908.3 million in the prior year and net income increased 227 percent versus $44.4 million last year. Net income in the year was favorably impacted by higher volumes, stronger operating performance, and tax benefits from U.S. tax reform. The diluted earnings per share for 2017 were $2.97. Diluted adjusted earnings per share were $2.58 excluding certain items of $0.39 per share, which includes a benefit of $0.58 per share from U.S. tax reform. Adjusted EBITDA of $242.7 million were up 19.9 percent versus 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $202.4 million. Ingevity’s 2017 adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.0 percent was up 270 basis points from the prior year’s adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.3 percent.\n“This was an outstanding quarter that exceeded our expectations,” said Michael Wilson. “In what is seasonally a slower quarter, we realized higher sales of Performance Chemicals’ products to pavement applications based on weather patterns that extended the paving season. What’s more, our Performance Materials segment’s sales were higher than expected due to stronger than forecast U.S. and Canadian auto demand.”\nHe added that, as expected, sales to oilfield customers continued to strongly rebound as U.S. drilling increased.\nWilson said that in addition to the increased volumes, the company’s earnings benefited from improved price and mix, and lower raw material costs. “As a result,” said Wilson, “we posted an increase in adjusted EBITDA of more than 46 percent.”\nLooking at the full year 2017, Wilson said that the year was notable for the strong growth in the Performance Materials segment and a marked turnaround in the company’s Performance Chemicals segment. “Our adjusted EBITDA rose almost 20 percent in 2017, to 25 percent of sales, on higher revenues in automotive activated carbon products, and sales to oilfield and pavement applications, combined with lower raw material costs and a more favorable cost structure based on restructuring initiatives the company took in 2016,” he said.\n“It was a great year for Ingevity,” Wilson said. “I couldn’t be more proud of our team. Our employees achieved our best-ever safety performance, executed our business plans and strategies superbly, and delivered outstanding financial results.”\nReportable Segment Financial Results\nPerformance Materials: Segment sales in the fourth quarter 2017 were $91.0 million, up $13.7 million, or 17.7 percent, versus the fourth quarter 2016. Segment operating profit was $32.5 million, up $10.3 million, or 46.4 percent, versus the prior year quarter segment operating profit. This translates to segment operating margin of 35.7 percent. Segment EBITDA were $37.4 million, up $10.4 million, or 38.5 percent, versus the prior year segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA margin rose 620 basis points to 41.1 percent. Volumes, particularly in sales of “honeycomb” products to meet automotive gasoline emission standards, drove increases in revenues and earnings. Earnings were moderately impacted by higher SG&A spending.\nFor the full year 2017, segment sales were $349.3 million, up $48.3 million, or 16.0 percent, versus 2016. Segment operating profit was $122.0 million, up $15.1 million, or 14.1 percent, versus the prior year segment operating profit. Segment EBITDA were $141.8 million, up $18.5 million, or 15.0 percent, versus the prior year segment EBITDA.\nPerformance Chemicals: Segment sales in the fourth quarter 2017 were $138.5 million, up $4.9 million, or 3.7 percent, versus the fourth quarter 2016. Segment operating profit was $10.1 million, up $6.7 million, or 197.1 percent, versus the prior year quarter segment operating profit. This translates to segment operating margin of 7.3 percent. Segment EBITDA were $15.2 million, up $6.2 million, or 68.9 percent, versus the prior year quarter segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA margin rose 430 basis points to 11.0 percent. Revenue growth in pavement and oilfield applications was partially offset by lower volumes in industrial specialties applications. Despite modest revenue growth, earnings benefited from improved price and mix and lower raw material costs.\nFor the full year 2017, segment sales were $623.1 million, up $15.8 million, or 2.6 percent, versus 2016. Segment operating profit was $80.3 million, up $23.6 million, or 41.6 percent, versus the prior year segment operating profit. Segment EBITDA were $100.9 million, up $21.8 million, or 27.6 percent, versus the prior year segment EBITDA.\nOutlook\nIngevity announced its fiscal year 2018 guidance for sales between $1.070 billion and $1.130 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $285 million and $305 million.\n“While I am pleased with our financial performance since going public in May 2016, I remain convinced that even stronger growth lies ahead of us,” said Wilson. “In 2018, at the mid-point of our guidance we expect to increase revenues by 13 percent and earnings by 22 percent.”\nThe company’s expected increase in revenues and earnings is attributable to the acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemicals business, as well as lower costs for crude tall oil, both of which should benefit the company’s Performance Chemicals segment. The company also expects continued implementation of more stringent gasoline vapor emission regulations – particularly in North America – that will continue to drive solid revenue growth in the Performance Materials segment.\nIngevity: Purify, Protect and Enhance\nIngevity provides specialty chemicals and high-performance carbon materials and technologies that purify, protect and enhance the world around us.

Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the financial schedules accompanying this news release, under the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA as projected for 2018 is not provided. Ingevity does not forecast net income as it cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income. These components, net of tax, include additional separation costs associated with the separation from WestRock; further restructuring and other income (charges); acquisition-related charges in connection with the planned acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemical business; and revisions due to future guidance and assessment of U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures. Further, in the future, other items with similar characteristics to those currently included in adjusted EBITDA, that have a similar impact on comparability of periods, and which are not known at this time, may exist and impact adjusted EBITDA.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements generally include the words “may,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “plans,” “intends,” “targets,” “will,” “expects,” “suggests,” “anticipates,” “outlook,” “continues,” “forecast,” “prospect,” “potential” or similar expressions.

These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business, because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.\nIngevity uses the following non-GAAP measures:\nAdjusted earnings (loss) is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Ingevity stockholders plus restructuring and other (income) charges, separation costs, acquisition costs and the income tax expense (benefit) on those items, less the benefit from U.S. Tax Reform.\nDiluted adjusted earnings (loss) per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to Ingevity stockholders plus restructuring and other (income) charges, net per share, separation costs per share, acquisition costs per share and the income tax expense (benefit) per share on those items, less the per share tax benefit from U.S. Tax Reform.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other (income) charges, separation costs and acquisition costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Sales\nSegment EBITDA is defined as segment operating profit plus depreciation and amortization.\nSegment EBITDA Margin is defined as Segment EBITDA divided by Net Sales.\nThe Company also uses the above financial measures as the primary measures of profitability used by managers of the business and its segments. In addition, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are useful measures because they exclude the effects of financing and investment activities as well as non-operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP and investors should consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are set forth within the following pages.\nA reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA as projected for 2018 is not provided. Ingevity does not forecast net income as we cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income. These components, net of tax, include additional separation costs associated with the separation from WestRock; further restructuring and other income (charges); acquisition-related charges in connection with the planned acquisition of Georgia-Pacific’s pine chemical business; and revisions due to future guidance and assessment of U.S. Tax Reform. Additionally, discrete tax items could drive variability in our projected effective tax rate. All of these components could significantly impact such financial measures.
