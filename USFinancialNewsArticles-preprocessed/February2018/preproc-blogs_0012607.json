Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!\"\nDonald Trump tweet \nThousands of people marched in London Saturday, demanding more government money for Britain's overburdened National Health Service.\nTrump has sought to repeal President Barack Obama's health-care law.\nCongress repealed the repealed the unpopular requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty. That takes effect next year. But other major parts of the overhaul remain in place.",
