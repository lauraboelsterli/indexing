    "text": "CALABASAS, Calif., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NETSOL Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTWK), a global business services and enterprise application solutions provider, reported results for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nOperational Highlights\nReported quarterly cost savings of $2.1 million directly tied to recent cost rationalization initiatives, bringing total savings to $4.4 million and with an anticipated reduction of more than $6.0 million through fiscal 2018.\nAn auto finance company of a leading bank in Indonesia, and an existing customer, launched its leasing project, further strengthening NETSOL’s relationship with this Indonesian business partner and paving the way for further success in the market.\nCaptive finance company of a leading truck manufacturer in China successfully went live with NetSol’s web Point of Sale (POS) solution and is now also offering NETSOL's mPOS solution to its clients.\nTotal consolidated pipeline of new business increased to approximately $175 million, driven by potential Ascent™ contracts across all three major NETSOL markets.\nFiscal Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $14.4 million, compared with $15.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease in total net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in license fees of $3.3 million, which was offset by an increase in services revenue of $1.9 million.\nTotal license fees were $453,000, compared with $3.8 million in the prior year period. Total maintenance fees were $3.7 million, compared with $3.6 million in the prior year period. Total services revenues were $10.3 million, compared with $8.4 million in the prior year period.\nGross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $6.7 million (or 46.3% of net revenues), compared to $6.7 million (or 42.0% of net revenues) in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in cost of revenues for the quarter. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and consultant costs of $618,000 related to the reduction of technical employees at key locations, including Pakistan, Thailand, China, UK and North America, as well as a decrease in travel costs of $548,000.\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 9% to $6.4 million (or 44.1% of net revenues) from $7.0 million (or 44.2% of net revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to cost reductions in selling and marketing expenses, salaries and wages, depreciation, and professional services.\nGAAP net income attributable to NETSOL for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $634,000 or $0.06 per diluted share, an improvement from a net loss of $2.2 million or $(0.20) per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $2.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $299,000 or $(0.03) per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (see note regarding “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure).\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $10.0 million, an increase from $8.6 million at the end of the prior quarter.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn July 18, 2017, NETSOL’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized potential repurchases of up to one million shares of its common stock. The program expired on December 15, 2017. At the conclusion of the program, the company had repurchased 139,275 shares of its common stock at an aggregate value of $601,000. The board of directors will evaluate future stock repurchase programs both in the U.S. and Pakistan, but can make no guarantee as to the timing of specifics related to such decisions.\nManagement Commentary\n\"The fiscal second quarter marked an improvement over Q1 in many ways, most notably in a return to profitability, but it was also affected by a continuation of the same prolonged sales cycles we have experienced over the past several quarters as well,\" said company Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Najeeb Ghauri. \"Nevertheless, we are continuing to control and manage what we can to mitigate these matters in the near term, as evidenced by the sustained success of our cost-reduction initiative, which contributed to a $1.4 million decrease in our total cost of revenues and a more than $600,000 decrease in our operating expenses in Q2.\n“Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the size and breadth of our overall pipeline of new business, which has increased to approximately $175 million, driven by strong demand for our Ascent solution across all our market regions. Despite these continued elongated sales cycles, we remain wholly focused on managing costs and executing on our more immediate prospects, so that we are ideally positioned to capitalize on our growing pipeline of opportunities beginning in the second half of the fiscal year and beyond.”\nConference Call\nNETSOL Technologies management will hold a conference call today (February 13, 2018) at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time (6:00 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss these financial results. A question and answer session will follow management's presentation.\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-0789\nInternational dial-in: 1-201-689-8562\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
