    "text": "February 7, 2018 / 2:54 PM / in 6 minutes Libyan commander wanted by ICC 'hands himself in' to military police: source   \nTRIPOLI, Libya (Reuters) - A Libyan commander sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the alleged summary execution of dozens of people has handed himself in to the military police in eastern Libya, a military source said on Wednesday. \nIt was not clear whether the apparent move would lead to any action being taken against the commander, Mahmoud al-Werfalli, or any restrictions on his movement. \nWerfalli is a member of an elite unit of the Libyan National Army (LNA), the dominant force in eastern Libya. \nThe ICC issued an arrest warrant for Werfalli in August last year. The same month, the LNA said it had detained Werfalli and was investigating him, but the ICC said it had received subsequent reports that Werfalli was at large and involved in additional killings. \nLast month, the United Nations called for Werfalli to be handed over to the ICC immediately after images surfaced appearing to show him shooting dead 10 people in front of a mosque in Benghazi hit by a twin car bombing the previous day. \nA video was posted late on social media late on Tuesday showing a man resembling Werfalli sitting on a sofa in military uniform at an undisclosed location, saying he would hand himself over to military police at LNA headquarters in the eastern town of Marj. \nWerfalliâ€™s unit said last year that it rejected the ICC warrant.
