(OTC: WAYN) (\"WAYN\" or the \"Company\"), today announced that it has launched a proxy contest for a seat on the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") and has delivered an open letter to WAYN stockholders. The Stilwell Group will seek to gain Board representation at WAYN's upcoming 2018 annual meeting and work to maximize stockholder value at the Company.
