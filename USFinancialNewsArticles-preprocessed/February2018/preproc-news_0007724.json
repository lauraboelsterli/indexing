    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP:\nTo: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Tesaro, Inc. (\"Tesaro\") (NASDAQ:TSRO) between March 14, 2016 and January 12, 2018 . You are hereby notified that a securities class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
