    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NorthWestern Corporation d/b/a NorthWestern Energy (NYSE: NWE) reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net income for the period was $162.7 million, or $3.34 per diluted share, as compared with net income of $164.2 million, or $3.39 per diluted share, for 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of a $17.0 million tax benefit related to costs to repair generation property in our 2016 results. However, pretax income increased $19.6 million in 2017 primarily due to improved gross margins (favorable weather and customer growth) partially offset by higher operating expenses (primarily property taxes and depreciation). Additional information regarding this release can be found in the webcast presentation found at www.northwesternenergy.com/our-company/investor-relations/presentations-and-webcasts .\n\"Given the challenges we've seen on the regulatory front, we're happy to add 2017 to a history of delivering results within our announced expectations. Operationally, financially or otherwise - meeting the expectations of our customers, investors and regulators can only be accomplished with the absolute commitment of our nearly 1,600 employees,\" said Bob Rowe, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We have a busy regulatory calendar for 2018 - all items of consequence. We look forward to working with our regulators on implementation of the new federal tax law, early in 2018. This will be an opportunity to use these anticipated tax savings to benefit our customers and the long-term safety and reliability of our complex utility system.\"\nSummary Results\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTotal Revenues\n$\n344,548\n$\n330,590\n$\n1,305,652\n$\n1,257,247\nCost of Sales\n109,025\n107,690\n410,349\n400,973\nGross Margin (1)\n235,523\n222,900\n895,303\n856,274\nOperating, general and administrative\n78,743\n82,163\n305,137\n302,893\nProperty and other taxes\n44,094\n36,796\n162,614\n148,098\nDepreciation and depletion\n41,656\n39,785\n166,137\n159,336\nTotal Operating Expenses\n164,493\n158,744\n633,888\n610,327\nOperating Income\n71,030\n64,156\n261,415\n245,947\nInterest Expense\n(22,306)\n(22,991)\n(92,263)\n(94,970)\nOther Income\n2,506\n1,372\n6,919\n5,548\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n51,230\n42,537\n176,071\n156,525\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\n(3,336)\n1,594\n(13,368)\n7,647\nNet Income\n$\n47,894\n$\n44,131\n$\n162,703\n$\n164,172\nBasic: Average Shares Outstanding\n48,902\n48,329\n48,558\n48,299\nEarnings per Share - Basic\n$\n0.98\n$\n0.91\n$\n3.35\n$\n3.40\nDiluted: Average Shares Outstanding\n49,003\n48,502\n48,655\n47,643\nEarnings per Share - Diluted\n$\n0.98\n$\n0.91\n$\n3.34\n$\n3.39\nDividends Paid per Common Share\n$\n0.525\n$\n0.50\n$\n2.10\n$\n2.00\n(1) Gross Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for more information.\nSignificant Developments in 2017\nReceived proceeds of approximately $53.7 million after commissions and other fees from the sale of 888,938 common shares under our equity distribution agreement, and Refinanced $250 million of Montana First Mortgage Bonds, reducing the fixed interest rate from 6.34% to 4.03% and extending the maturity from 2019 to 2047.\nGross Margin\nConsolidated gross margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $895.4 million compared with $856.3 million for the same period in 2016. This $39.1 million increase was a result of a $30.9 million increase to items that have an impact on net income and $8.2 million increase to items that are offset in operating expenses and income tax expense with no impact to net income.\nConsolidated gross margin for items impacting net income increased $30.9 million, including:\n$15.7 million increase in electric retail volumes due primarily to colder winter and warmer summer weather in our Montana jurisdiction and customer growth, partly offset by cooler summer weather in our South Dakota jurisdiction and milder spring weather overall; $10.5 million increase in natural gas retail volumes due primarily to colder winter and spring weather and customer growth, partly offset by warmer summer weather; $9.5 million inclusion in our 2016 results of the MPSC disallowance of both replacement power costs from a 2013 outage at Colstrip Unit 4 and portfolio modeling costs; $1.8 million increase in our Montana gas rates effective September 1, 2017; $1.5 million inclusion in our 2016 results of a reduction in hydro generation rates due to the MPSC order in the hydro compliance filing; $1.2 million increase in South Dakota electric rates due to the timing of the change in customer rates in 2016; $0.6 million higher demand to transmit energy across our transmission lines due to market conditions and pricing; $0.4 million decrease in QF related supply costs based on actual QF pricing and output: and $3.9 million other miscellaneous increases.\nThese increases were partly offset by the inclusion in our 2016 results of $14.2 million of deferred revenue as a result of a MPSC final order in our tracker filings regarding prior period lost revenues.\nThe change in consolidated gross margin for items that had no impact on net income (due to offsets in operating expenses) represented a $8.2 million increase primarily due to the following:\n$6.7 million increase in revenues for property taxes included in trackers is offset by increased property tax expense; and $1.5 million increase in operating expenses included in our supply trackers is offset by an increase in operating, general and administrative expenses.\nOperating, General and Administrative Expenses\nConsolidated operating, general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $305.1 million compared with $302.9 million for the same period in 2016. The $2.2 million increase was primarily due to:\n$1.9 million higher bad debt expense due to an increase in revenues as a result of colder winter and warmer summer weather; $1.5 million higher operating expenses recovered through our supply trackers; and $1.2 million higher maintenance costs at our Dave Gates Generating Station and Colstrip Unit 4.\nThese increases were partly offset by:\n$1.5 million decrease in employee benefits due primarily to lower pension costs, offset in part by higher medical costs and more time spent by employees on maintenance projects (which are expensed) rather than capital projects; and $1.0 million decrease in insurance reserves primarily due to the amount recorded in 2016 related to the Billings, Montana refinery outage.\nProperty and Other Taxes\nProperty and other taxes were $162.6 million in 2017 as compared with $148.1 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to plant additions and higher estimated property valuations in Montana. Under Montana law, we are allowed to track the increases in the actual level of state and local taxes and fees and adjust our rates to recover the increase between rate cases less the amount allocated to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdictional customers and net of the associated income tax benefit. In January 2018, the MPSC issued an order in our 2017 filing reducing our recovery of these taxes by approximately $1.7 million by applying an alternate allocation methodology. This results in a lower allocation to our Montana electric retail customers and a higher property tax allocation to FERC transmission customers (we do not have a property tax tracker for FERC jurisdictional purposes).\nDepreciation and Depletion Expense\nDepreciation and depletion expense was $166.1 million in 2017 as compared with $159.3 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to plant additions.\nOperating Income\nConsolidated operating income in 2017 was $261.4 million, as compared with $245.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in gross margin as discussed above, offset in part by higher operating expenses.\nInterest Expense\nConsolidated interest expense in 2017 was $92.3 million, as compared with $95.0 million, in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the full year benefit of refinancing of debt in 2016.\nOther Income\nConsolidated other income in 2017 was $6.9 million as compared with $5.5 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher capitalization of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).\nIncome Tax\nConsolidated income tax expense in 2017 was $13.4 million as compared with an income tax benefit of $7.6 million in 2016. Our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 7.6% as compared with (4.9)% for the same period of 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $17.0 million due to the adoption of a tax accounting method change related to the costs to repair generation assets, which allowed us to take a current tax deduction for a significant amount of repair costs that were previously capitalized for tax purposes. Approximately $12.5 million of this deduction related to 2015 and prior tax years. This is reflected in the flow-through repairs deductions line due to the regulatory treatment. We currently expect our 2018 effective tax rate to range between 0% - 5%.\nThe following table summarizes the differences between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n$\n176.1\n$\n156.5\nIncome tax calculated at 35% Federal statutory rate\n61.6\n35.0\n%\n54.8\n35.0\n%\nPermanent or flow through adjustments:\nState income tax, net of federal provisions\n(3.3)\n(1.9)\n%\n(3.7)\n(2.4)\n%\nFlow through repairs deductions\n(30.5)\n(17.3)\n%\n(41.1)\n(26.3)\n%\nProduction tax credits\n(11.0)\n(6.3)\n%\n(10.9)\n(7.0)\n%\nPlant and depreciation of flow through items\n(2.2)\n(1.3)\n%\n(4.6)\n(2.9)\n%\nShare based compensation\n(0.4)\n(0.2)\n%\n(1.6)\n(1.1)\n%\nPrior year permanent return to accrual adjustments\n(0.6)\n(0.3)\n%\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n%\nOther, net\n(0.2)\n(0.1)\n%\n(0.4)\n(0.1)\n%\n(48.2)\n(27.4)\n%\n(62.4)\n(39.9)\n%\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n$\n13.4\n7.6\n%\n$\n(7.6)\n(4.9)\n%\nOur effective tax rate typically differs from the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to the regulatory impact of flowing through the federal and state tax benefit of repairs deductions, state tax benefit of accelerated tax depreciation deductions (including bonus depreciation when applicable) and production tax credits.\nNet Income\nConsolidated net income in 2017 was $162.7 million as compared with $164.2 million in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in our 2016 results of a $17.0 million income tax benefit due to the adoption of a tax accounting method change related to the costs to repair generation assets, and higher operating expenses as discussed above, offset in part by improved gross margin as a result of favorable weather, and to a lesser extent, by customer growth.\nReconciliation of Primary Changes from 2016 to 2017\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($millions, except EPS)\nPre-tax\nIncome\nNet\nIncome (1)\nDiluted\nEPS\n2016 reported\n$156.5\n$164.2\n$3.39\nGross Margin\nElectric retail volumes\n15.7\n9.7\n0.20\nNatural gas retail volumes\n10.5\n6.5\n0.13\n2016 MPSC disallowance\n9.5\n5.8\n0.12\nMontana natural gas rates\n1.8\n1.1\n0.02\n2016 Hydro generation rates\n1.5\n0.9\n0.02\nSouth Dakota generation rates\n1.2\n0.7\n0.01\nElectric transmission\n0.6\n0.4\n0.01\nElectric QF adjustment\n0.4\n0.2\n0.01\n2016 Lost revenue adjustment mechanism\n(14.2)\n(8.7)\n(0.18)\nOther\n3.9\n2.4\n0.05\nSubtotal: Margin Items Impacting Net Income\n30.9\n19.0\n0.39\nProperty taxes recovered in trackers\n6.7\n4.1\n0.08\nOperating expense recovered in trackers\n1.5\n0.9\n0.02\nSubtotal: Margin Items Not Impacting Net Income (2)\n8.2\n5.0\n0.10\nTotal Gross Margin\n39.1\n24.0\n0.49\nOG&A Expense\nBad debt expense\n(1.9)\n(1.2)\n(0.03)\nOperating expense recovered in trackers\n(1.5)\n(0.9)\n(0.01)\nMaintenance costs\n(1.2)\n(0.7)\n(0.01)\nEmployee benefit and compensation costs\n1.5\n0.9\n0.02\nInsurance reserves\n1.0\n0.6\n0.01\nOther\n(0.1)\n(0.1)\n(0.01)\nTotal OG&A Expense\n(2.2)\n(1.4)\n(0.03)\nOther items\nDepreciation and depletion expense\n(6.8)\n(4.2)\n(0.09)\nProperty and other taxes\n(14.5)\n(8.9)\n(0.18)\nInterest expense\n2.7\n1.7\n0.03\nOther income\n1.4\n0.9\n0.02\nPermanent and flow-through adjustments to income tax\n—\n(13.6)\n(0.28)\nImpact of higher share count\n—\n—\n(0.01)\nTotal Other items\n(17.2)\n(24.1)\n(0.51)\nTotal impact of above items\n19.6\n(1.5)\n(0.05)\n2017 reported\n$176.1\n$162.7\n$3.34\n(1) Income Tax Benefit (Expense) calculation on reconciling items assumes federal and state composite rate of 38.5%.\n(2) These items have offsets in operating expenses or income tax expenses that result in no impact to net income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total net liquidity was approximately $88.9 million, including $8.5 million of cash and $80.4 million of revolving credit facility availability. This compares to total net liquidity one year ago at December 31, 2016 of $104.3 million.\nDividend Declared\nNorthWestern's Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.55 per share (a 4.8% increase), payable March 30, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nSignificant Items Not Contemplated in Guidance\nA reconciliation of items not factored into our final 2017 and 2016 Non-GAAP Adjusted earnings guidance of $3.30 - $3.45 and $3.20 - $3.35 per diluted share, respectively, are summarized below.

The conference call will be webcast live on the Internet at www.northwesternenergy.com under the \"Our Company / Investor Relations / Presentations and Webcasts\" heading or by visiting www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1050/24037 . To participate, please go to the site at least 10 minutes in advance of the webcast to register. An archived webcast will be available shortly after the call and remain active for one year.\nA telephonic replay of the call will be available for one month, beginning at 6:00 p.m. Eastern time on February 13, 2018, at (888) 203-1112 access code 5682232.\nAbout NorthWestern Energy\nNorthWestern Corporation, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides electricity and / or natural gas to approximately 718,300 customers in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. More information on NorthWestern Energy is available on the company's Web site at www.northwesternenergy.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as other financial measures, such as Gross Margin and Adjusted Non-GAAP Diluted EPS, that are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Gross Margin (Revenues less Cost of Sales) is a non-GAAP financial measure due to the exclusion of depreciation and depletion from the measure. Gross Margin is used by us to determine whether we are collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from customers to allow recovery of operating costs. Adjusted Non-GAAP Diluted EPS is another non-GAAP measure. The Company believes the presentation of Adjusted Non-GAAP Diluted EPS is more representative of our normal earnings than the GAAP EPS due to the exclusion (or inclusion) of certain impacts that are not reflective of ongoing earnings.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP measures is intended to supplement investors' understanding of our financial performance and not to replace other GAAP measures as an indicator of actual operating performance. Our measures may not be comparable to other companies' similarly titled measures.\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, the information under \"Significant Items Not Contemplated in Guidance\" and \"2018 Earnings Guidance Affirmed\". Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" or \"will.\" These statements are based upon our current expectations and speak only as of the date hereof. Our actual future business and financial performance may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:\nadverse determinations by regulators, as well as potential adverse federal, state, or local legislation or regulation, including costs of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements, could have a material effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition; changes in availability of trade credit, creditworthiness of counterparties, usage, commodity prices, fuel supply costs or availability due to higher demand, shortages, weather conditions, transportation problems or other developments, may reduce revenues or may increase operating costs, each of which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations; unscheduled generation outages or forced reductions in output, maintenance or repairs, which may reduce revenues and increase cost of sales or may require additional capital expenditures or other increased operating costs; and adverse changes in general economic and competitive conditions in the U.S. financial markets and in our service territories.\nOur 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northwestern-reports-2017-financial-results-300597572.html\nSOURCE NorthWestern Corporation",
