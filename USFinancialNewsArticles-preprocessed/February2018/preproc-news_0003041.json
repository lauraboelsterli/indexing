Slideshow (2 Images) \nThey were also expected to meet students to discuss mental health - an issue that William and his brother Harry have campaigned on in the past. \nPrince William, second-in-line to the throne, is also a relative of Norway’s King Harald, as both descend from Britain’s Queen Victoria. \nBritain is Norway’s largest export market through its purchases of natural gas.
