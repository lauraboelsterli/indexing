    "text": "JERUSALEM, February 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nDARKSTAR VENTURES, INC . (OTC: DAVC) and Subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewal, announces the establishment of another building projects bringing the Company a 16 unit centrally located property with outstanding upper level waterfront views. The project includes 12 apartments, with 2 upper level penthouse apartments, for a total of 14 new dwellings.\nLocated just a short walk from the sea, this is expected to be one of the Company's most exciting ventures. \"We are very pleased to have obtained this project. According to recent estimated market values, this property has the potential to yield profits in the range $1,700,000, once the project has been completed,\" stated Avraham Bengio, Darkstar Ventures, Inc.\nThis agreement, following the Company's initial reconstruction project, represents a continually strengthening position for Bengio, whereas upon completion the Company can yield an advantageous rate of return, calculated to exceed 1.7 million dollars.\nTAMA 38, is a mutually advantageous Israeli construction program initiated for fortification of the building through the strengthening or rebuilding of older and compromised buildings. Developers are able to build additional levels above existing apartment buildings in exchange for needed improvements such as fortification, and the addition of features such as elevators, balconies, safe rooms or parking.\nBengio Urban Renewal, founded by veteran real-estate entrepreneurs and expert professionals in the construction field, specializes in the building reinforcement and reconstruction in Israel.\nEndeavors continue, and the Company is focused on preparations for the launch of projects under the Tama Classification, a National Outlined Plan encompassing 38 construction grants yielding rights to tenants whose buildings require fortification in order to meet current codes and updated standards. These rights are transferred to the developer contracted to build additional levels above existing apartments, enabling this new real estate to be sold for profit in the open market.\nForward-Looking Statements: Certain matters discussed in this press release may be forward-looking statements. Such matters involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, including the following: changes in economic conditions; general competitive factors; the Company's success in obtaining new customers; the Company's ability to execute its business model and strategic plans; the Company's success in integrating acquired entities and assets, and all the risks and related information described from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including the financial statements and related information contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and interim Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
