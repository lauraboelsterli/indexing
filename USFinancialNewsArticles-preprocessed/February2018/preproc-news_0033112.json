    "text": "Feb 12 (Reuters) - FMC Corp’s quarterly revenue jumped 42.3 percent as the U.S. agriculture chemical company benefited from the acquisition of DuPont’s crop protection unit.\nThe company’s net income soared to $531.1 million, or $3.94 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $16.4 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue rose to $979.6 million from $688.4 million.\nFMC has transformed itself into a major crop chemicals producer through buyouts. FMC, which expanded in Europe through its Cheminova acquisition in 2015, late last year bought DuPont’s crop chemicals portfolio.
