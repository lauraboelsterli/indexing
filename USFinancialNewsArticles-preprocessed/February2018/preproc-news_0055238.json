    "text": "(Adds Tencent, General Mills, Wilhelmsen Maritime)\nFeb 23 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 1430 GMT on Friday:\n** U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp said on Thursday a U.S. national security panel had blocked its $580-million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund, the latest such deal to be thwarted.\n** Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) has agreed to sell the bulk of its insurance business to Phoenix Group for 3.24 billion pounds ($4.5 billion), allowing it to focus on savings and investment products.\n** British insurer Aviva said it would sell its remaining Spanish businesses Cajamurcia Vida and Caja Granada Vida to Spain’s state-owned lender Bankia for 202 million euros ($248.1 million).\n** Tencent Holdings and JD.com will pay $140 million and $117 million respectively for minority stakes in a Chinese retail chain as China’s tech giants extend their battles in the retail space.\n** Cheerios cereal maker General Mills Inc will buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc for nearly $8 billion, seeking to tap burgeoning demand for natural pet food and offset falling sales for processed items.\n** The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said that it would file a lawsuit in a bid to stop Wilhelmsen Maritime Services’ from buying a smaller rival Drew Marine Group.
