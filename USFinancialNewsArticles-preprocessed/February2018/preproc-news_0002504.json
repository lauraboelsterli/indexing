While this momentum is not entirely evident from our financial results and is masked by the long-term decline of our cordless business, recent industry developments, design wins and customer engagements bolster our confidence that we are well-positioned for significant long term revenue growth and margin expansion.”\n“We are excited about our position and momentum in three dynamic industries: Unified Communications, Voice User Interface and IoT, where our new products play an instrumental role. This is evidenced by: 1) strong revenue growth of 31% in the VoIP segment to approximately $35 million in 2017, a market where DSP Group is emerging as a leader with many top tier customers, 2) numerous innovative product launches and product diversity in our SmartVoice segment whereby we capitalize on our long history and deep expertise in efficient voice processing to bring new capabilities to a nascent market, and 3) the growing ecosystem around our ULE technology, which is embraced by leading service providers and OEMs for its best in class characteristics which are ideal for wireless indoor connectivity. We expect the growth of these initiatives to outpace the decline of our legacy cordless telephone business in 2018. More importantly, each of those product segments is now on a trajectory to drive dynamic revenue growth and margin expansion in future years.”\nGAAP Results:\n2017 Fourth Quarter Results:\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $31.2 million, a decrease of 11% from revenues of $35.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Further, the Company believes it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with equity-based compensation are reflected in its statements of income.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements that qualify as “ ” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including Mr. Elyakim’s statements regarding (i) DSP Group having reached an inflection point in which the new product initiatives is gaining momentum and will be driving dynamic growth in the years ahead, (ii) the recent industry developments, design wins and customer engagements bolster the company’s confidence that it is well-positioned for solid revenue growth and margin expansion; (iii) optimism of the positive momentum and product traction in three dynamic industries: Unified Communications, Voice User Interface and IoT; (iv) the company emerging as a market leader in the Unified Communications market; (v) with many top tier customers, numerous new product launches and product diversity in its SmartVoice segment; (vi) the growing ecosystem around the company’s ULE offering the winning characteristics of wireless indoor IoT technology; (vii) the expectation that the growth of those initiatives to outpace the decline of the company’s legacy cordless telephone business in 2018; and (viii) each of those product segments is now on a trajectory to drive dynamic revenue growth and margin expansion in future years. SmartVoice segment being an important contributor to the company’s success in 2018, sales from new products will compose the majority of the company’s revenues in 2018 and drive revenue growth for the full year 2018, the anticipated gradual growth in the company’s new product initiatives and improved operational efficiencies to help drive gross margin expansion and revenue growth in 2018, as well as the expectation of revenue slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 due to a decrease in demand for the company's cordless telephony and HDClear products. The results from these statements may not actually arise as a result of various factors, including the market penetration of new products; unexpected delays in the commercial launch of new products, including in the mobile and office segments; slower than expected change in the nature of residential communications domain; DSP Group's ability to manage costs; DSP Group’s ability to develop and produce new products at competitive costs and in a timely manner and the ability of such products to achieve broad market acceptance; and general market demand for products that incorporate DSP Group’s technology in the market. These factors and other factors which may affect future operating results or DSP Group’s stock price are discussed under “RISK FACTORS” in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2016, as well as other reports DSP Group has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
