The 2018 outlook assumes AHS remains with the Company for the full year and excludes the impact of any costs related to the planned separation of AHS in the third-quarter 2018 and any potential acquisitions\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc . (NYSE: SERV), a leading provider of essential residential and commercial services, today announced unaudited fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter, the company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of five percent. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by eight percent organic growth at American Home Shield (“AHS”) and the impact of acquiring Landmark Home Warranty (“Landmark”) in November 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 net income was $306 million, or $2.26 per share, versus $31 million, or $0.23 per share, in the same period in 2016. Fourth-quarter net income was favorably impacted by a $271 million adjustment to deferred income taxes driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $135 million, a year-over-year decrease of $9 million, or seven percent, driven by an $11 million decline at Terminix. Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted net income was $48 million, or $0.35 per share versus $60 million, or $0.44 per share, for the same period in 2016.\n“In the fourth quarter, we executed on our strategies to deliver long-term growth by continuing to make much needed investments in our Terminix business, including strengthening our business leadership, enhancing process and systems capabilities, and empowering our technicians to significantly improve the customer experience we provide,” said chief executive officer Nik Varty. “At American Home Shield and the Franchise Services Group, strong revenue increases reflected our continued focus on growth through improving customer service.”\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nFor the full year, the company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of six percent. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by eight percent organic growth at AHS and the impact of acquiring both OneGuard Home Warranty (“OneGuard”) in June 2016 and Landmark. Full-year 2017 net income was $510 million, or $3.76 per share, versus full-year 2016 net income of $155 million, or $1.13 per share. Full-year 2017 net income was favorably impacted by the $271 million adjustment to deferred income taxes driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. The year-over-year comparison was also favorably impacted by full-year 2016 pre-tax income including charges for fumigation-related matters of $93 million and an insurance reserve adjustment of $23 million. Full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $678 million, a year-over-year increase of $11 million, or two percent, driven largely by increases at AHS and the Franchise Services Group of $40 million and $8 million, respectively, and mostly offset by a $41 million decline at Terminix, primarily due to business transformation initiatives, including investments in sales and marketing to drive growth and production labor to improve the customer experience. Full-year 2017 adjusted net income was $286 million, or $2.11 per share, versus full-year 2016 adjusted net income of $281 million, or $2.04 per share.\nVarty added, “We are making good progress on our strategic transformation plan at Terminix, where we believe our emphasis on customer service and technician empowerment will continue to create momentum in 2018. Overall, our business continues to benefit from strengthening our leadership team and driving greater accountability.\n“In addition, we remain on track with our previously announced plans to spin off American Home Shield in the third quarter of 2018. The planned spin-off will better position both AHS and ServiceMaster for the future, allowing them to pursue distinct strategies and growth opportunities,” Varty concluded.\nConsolidated Performance\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, $ millions 2017 2016 B/(W) 2017 2016 B/(W) Revenue $ 666 $ 633 $ 32 $ 2,912 $ 2,746 $ 165 YoY growth 5.1 % 6.0 % Gross Margin 294 288 5 1,360 1,298 62 % of revenue 44.1 % 45.5 % (1.4 ) pts 46.7 % 47.3 % (0.6 ) pts SG&A (182 ) (166 ) (16 ) (773 ) (711 ) (62 ) % of revenue 27.3 % 26.1 % (1.2 ) pts 26.6 % 25.9 % (0.7 ) pts Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 57 41 16 370 241 128 % of revenue 8.6 % 6.5 % 2.1 pts 12.7 % 8.8 % 3.9 pts Net Income 306 31 275 510 155 355 % of revenue 45.9 % 4.9 % 41.0 pts 17.5 % 5.6 % 11.9 pts Adjusted Net Income (1) 48 60 (12 ) 286 281 5 % of revenue 7.2 % 9.4 % (2.2 ) pts 9.8 % 10.2 % (0.4 ) pts Adjusted EBITDA (2) 135 144 (9 ) 678 667 11 % of revenue 20.3 % 22.8 % (2.5 ) pts 23.3 % 24.3 % (1.0 ) pts Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations 73 111 (38 ) 413 325 88 Free Cash Flow (3) 46 100 (54 ) 338 270 69 Segment Performance\nRevenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment and Corporate were as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Revenue Adjusted EBITDA Revenue Adjusted EBITDA $ millions 2017 B/(W) vs. PY 2017 B/(W) vs. PY 2017 B/(W) vs. PY 2017 B/(W) vs. PY Terminix $ 353 $ 4 $ 62 $ (11 ) $ 1,541 $ 18 $ 330 $ (41 ) YoY growth / % of revenue 1.0 % 17.4 % (3.4 ) pts 1.2 % 21.4 % (2.9 ) pts American Home Shield 257 23 51 — 1,157 137 260 40 YoY growth / % of revenue 10.0 % 19.7 % (1.8 ) pts 13.4 % 22.5 % 0.9 pts Franchise Services Group 55 5 22 1 212 12 87 8 YoY growth / % of revenue 11.0 % 40.5 % (2.3 ) pts 6.0 % 41.0 % 1.6 pts Corporate (4) — — 1 — 2 (1 ) 1 4 Total $ 666 $ 32 $ 135 $ (9 ) $ 2,912 $ 165 $ 678 $ 11 YoY growth / % of revenue 5.1 % 20.3 % (2.5 ) pts\n6.0 % 23.3 % (1.0 ) pts Reconciliations of net income to adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow, are set forth below in this press release.\nTerminix\nTerminix reported a one percent year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 as increases in core termite control and wildlife exclusion sales were offset by a decline in core pest control revenue, including the expected decline in revenue associated with the prior acquisition of Alterra Pest Control. Adjusting to remove the impact of Alterra customer attrition, revenue would have grown two percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 15 percent, or $11 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting an $8 million increase in sales and marketing costs, a $1 million increase in termite damage claims, a $1 million increase in insurance costs, $2 million increase in other costs and a $1 million increase in production labor costs associated with the company’s effort to improve safety, customer service and retention, offset, in part, by a $1 million increase in revenue conversion.\nFor the full year, Terminix reported a one percent year-over-year revenue increase as growth in core termite control and wildlife exclusion, insulation and mosquito sales were offset by a decline in core pest control revenue, including the expected $19 million decline in revenue associated with the prior acquisition of Alterra Pest Control. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma also negatively impacted 2017 third quarter revenue by $4 million as the result of 53 branches, primarily in Texas and Florida, being temporarily closed for a period of time in August and September. Adjusting to remove the impact of Alterra customer attrition, revenue would have grown two percent versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11 percent, or $41 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $20 million increase in sales and marketing costs, a $11 million increase in production labor costs associated with the company’s effort to improve safety, customer service and retention, a $10 million increase in termite damage claims, a $6 million increase in insurance costs, a $3 million increase in other costs and a $3 million impact due to the revenue loss caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, offset, in part by a $10 million increase in revenue conversion.\nAmerican Home Shield\nAmerican Home Shield reported a 10 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by new unit sales growth, improved price realization and the impact of the Landmark acquisition. AHS’s organic revenue growth was eight percent in the fourth quarter versus prior year. For the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA increased one percent versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $10 million increase from the conversion of higher organic revenue and a $1 million decrease in other costs, offset, in part, by an $8 million increase in claims costs due primarily to higher incidence rates, a $3 million increase in sales and marketing costs and a $1 million increase in call center costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by increased marketing spending to drive sales growth and the increase in customer care center service costs related to an investment to improve customer service levels.\nFor the full year, American Home Shield reported a 13 percent year-over-year revenue increase driven by an increase in new unit sales, improved price realization and the impact of the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions. AHS’s organic revenue growth was eight percent versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18 percent, or $40 million versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $47 million increase from the conversion of higher organic revenue, $12 million associated with the OneGuard and Landmark acquisitions and a $4 million decrease in other general and administrative costs, offset, in part, by an $8 million increase in claims costs, a $6 million increase in customer care center costs, a $5 million increase in sales and marketing costs and the non-recurring prior year investment gains of $3 million.\nFranchise Services Group\nThe Franchise Services Group reported an 11 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 driven by higher royalty fee revenue related to disaster restoration services and janitorial national accounts revenue, offset, in part, by a decrease in product sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased five percent, or $1 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $2 million increase in revenue conversion, offset, in part, by a $1 million increase in sales and marketing costs and a $1 million increase in general and administrative costs.\nFor the full year, the Franchise Services Group reported a six percent year-over-year revenue increase primarily driven by higher royalty fee revenue related to disaster restoration services and janitorial national accounts revenue, offset, in part, by a decrease in revenue from the Merry Maids branch conversions, which was completed in 2016. Excluding the Merry Maids branch conversions and a master distributor acquisition, revenue would have increased eight percent versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10 percent, or $8 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting an $8 million increase from the conversion of higher revenue, a $1 million decrease in other costs and a $1 million increase related to previously company-owned Merry Maid branches converted to franchises, offset, in part, by a $1 million increase in sales and marketing costs.\nCash Flow\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations increased to $413 million from $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided from operating activities in 2016 included $90 million in payments related to fumigation matters.\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations was $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used $13 million on business acquisitions compared to $121 million in the 2016 period.\nNet cash used for financing activities from continuing operations was $152 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used $85 million to purchase 2.2 million shares of company stock compared to $60 million to purchase 1.6 million shares of company stock in the 2016 period. Additionally, we used $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to purchase a portion of our 7.25% notes maturing in 2038.\nFree cash flow (3) was $338 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $270 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFull-Year 2018 Outlook\nThe 2018 outlook assumes AHS remains with the Company for the full year and excludes the impact of any costs related to the planned separation of AHS in the third quarter of 2018 and any potential acquisitions.\nThe company expects full-year 2018 revenue to range from $3,015 million to $3,045 million, or an increase of between four percent and five percent compared to 2017. Full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to range from $690 million to $705 million, or an increase of between two percent and four percent compared to 2017.\nThe company expects organic revenue growth at Terminix to range from one percent to two percent for full-year 2018 compared to prior year. The company expects high single-digit organic revenue growth at American Home Shield and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth at the Franchise Services Group for full-year 2018 compared to prior year.\nA reconciliation of the forward-looking 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook to net income is not being provided as the company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation.\nOther Matters\nAmerican Home Shield Spin-Off\nOn July 26, 2017, the company announced that it intends to separate its AHS business from its Terminix and Franchise Services Group businesses by means of a spin-off of the AHS business to company shareholders, resulting in two publicly traded companies. The spin-off would create two independent companies each with an enhanced strategic focus, simplified operating structure, distinct investment identity and strong financial profile. The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form 10, receipt of a favorable ruling from the IRS concerning certain tax matters and final approval by the company’s board of directors, and it is intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to the company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ServiceMaster chief executive officer Nik Varty and chief financial officer Tony DiLucente will remain with ServiceMaster following the separation of the AHS business.\nCopesan Services, Inc. Transaction\nOn February 26, 2018, ServiceMaster entered into an agreement to purchase and combine its Terminix national account pest control operations with Copesan Services, Inc., one of the largest national providers of commercial pest management in the country. This combination would significantly improve Terminix’s capabilities in commercial pest control as Copesan, under its brand, would provide us with significant expertise, reputation and processes for delivering pest management solutions to sophisticated commercial customers. The transaction is expected to close in the next 30 to 45 days, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and regulatory approval. This reiterates the strong commitment ServiceMaster has made to focus on, and grow, the Terminix commercial pest control business.\nFumigation-Related Matters\nAs previously disclosed, on January 20, 2017, the company entered into a plea agreement in connection with the investigation initiated by the United States Department of Justice related to the U.S. Virgin Islands matter. In 2017, we pled guilty to four misdemeanor charges. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the court sentenced us in this matter and, under the terms of such, we agreed to pay fines, community service and government costs totaling $11 million. We had previously recorded $10 million of charges for this matter as of December 31, 2016.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 23, 2016, the company’s board of directors authorized a three-year share repurchase program, under which the company may purchase up to $300 million of outstanding shares of common stock. No shares were repurchased during the fourth-quarter 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we have repurchased 3.9 million outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of $145 million under this program.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nThe company will discuss its fourth-quarter 2017 financial and operating results during a conference call at 8 a.m. central time (9 a.m. eastern time) today, February 27, 2018.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate operating performance and liquidity comparisons, as applicable, from period to period. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful for investors, analysts and other interested parties as they facilitate company-to-company operating performance and liquidity comparisons, as applicable, by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment, restructuring initiatives and equity-based, long-term incentive plans.",
