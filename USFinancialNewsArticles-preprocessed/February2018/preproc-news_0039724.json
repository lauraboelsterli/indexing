The precious metal could test the resistance of $1,384, and this is despite the fact that the Fed could change its stance towards a more hawkish monetary policy,\" Aslam said. \nThe minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve 's last policy meeting, held amid the equities tumble on Jan. 30-31, are due on Wednesday. Besides the outlook on rates, markets will be keen to see what the Fed makes of the gyrations in markets. \n\"When coupled with inflationary concerns heightening and a probable follow-up correction in equities markets around the corner, gold's safe-haven demand should continue to glitter,\" said Stephen Innes, APAC trading head at OANDA. show chapters 12:46 AM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 01:56 \nSafe-haven buying could also emerge as political tensions rise in Washington, ANZ analysts said in a research note. \nA 37-page indictment filed by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia denounced the allegations. \nHedge funds and money managers cut their net long positions in COMEX gold in the week to Feb. 13, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday. \nTrading is expected to be slower than usual this week due Lunar New Year celebrations in China. Monday is also a market holiday in the United States. \nSPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose 0.39 percent to 824.54 tonnes on Friday. \nAmong other precious metals, silver rose 0.1 percent to $16.68 an ounce. \nPlatinum was up 0.8 percent at $1,010 an ounce, while palladium rose 0.2 percent to $1,045.99 an ounce.
