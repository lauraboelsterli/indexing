(\"CB&I\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CBI) who held CB&I securities and have been harmed by CB&I and its board of directors' (the \"Board\") for alleged violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78n(a) and 78t(a) respectively, and United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-9 in connection with acquisition of CB&I by McDermott International, Inc. (\"McDermott\") through a merger transaction as alleged in detail herein (the \"Proposed Transaction\").\nUnder the terms of the agreement, CB&I stockholders will receive 2.47221 shares of McDermott common stock in exchange for each share of CB&I they own (the \"Merger Consideration\").

LLC (\"Goldman Sachs\") and Greenhill & Co., LLC (\"Greenhill,\" and together with Goldman Sachs \"McDermott's Financial Advisors\"), in support of their fairness opinions; and (vi) the background process leading to the Proposed Transaction.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than 60 days from today.
