    "text": "4 COMMENTS Three years ago, China’s Anbang Insurance Group was a symbol of the country’s rising clout in the investment world. It had bought New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel for $2 billion and was one of several fast-growing and deep-pocketed Chinese companies with ambitious plans to expand abroad.\nLast week, the Chinese government seized control of Anbang and charged its founder and chairman with economic crimes. This marked a turning point in a clampdown over what officials have called “irrational” investing, as Beijing tries to keep corporate and other debt from swamping the economy. Here’s what the takeover portends:\nChina Is Reining In Big Spenders In recent years, Anbang and other large conglomerates like HNA Group and Dalian Wanda Group have spent tens of billions of dollars on the likes of U.S. and European hotels, movie theaters, office towers and stakes in banks and asset managers. China, trying to stem capital outflows, has scrutinized borrowing arrangements used to fund these acquisitions.\nOne concern of authorities is that many have been funded with loans from domestic banks, exposing the financial sector to losses if assets fall in value. China last summer started investigating loans and guarantees banks had provided to conglomerates, putting a chill on deal activity.\nThe Big Anbang\nAnbang’s Rescue Is China’s Too-Big-to-Fail Moment (Feb. 26) Chinese Regulator Seizes Anbang Insurance, Owner of Waldorf Astoria (Feb. 23) China Has Its Own ‘Too Big to Fail’ List China’s only systemically important financial businesses on an international level, according to the Financial Stability Board—a global group of central bankers—are the country’s four largest banks and Ping An Insurance .\nBut by seizing control of Anbang Insurance Group, Chinese regulators have signaled that—at least domestically— the privately held insurer group is also too big to fail. A takeover to ensure its solvency, like the government’s 2015 stock-market intervention and other orchestrated moves to avoid debt blowups, shows Beijing isn’t taking chances with financial risk.\nBeijing Sees ‘Wealth’ Products as a Threat In just over a dozen years, Anbang transformed itself into one of the country’s bigger insurers—over $300 billion in assets—in part by attracting investors to short-term, high-yielding wealth products that compete for ordinary depositor savings.\nSuch products, commonly issued and sold by banks as well as insurers and other nonbank financial institutions, have in recent years become a large source of off-balance-sheet funding. The banking sector alone has issued more than $4 trillion worth.\nMany short-dated wealth and trust products, however, have been used to fund long-term and sometimes risky investments in illiquid assets such as real estate and commercial loans. Defaults so far have been few, but authorities are concerned because debt defaults in China tend to spark investor protests—threatening the social and economic stability that is part of the ruling Communist Party’s political legitimacy.\nTakeover Has Parallels With the U.S. Bailout of AIG Like the U.S. government’s rescue of American International Group Inc. during the 2008 global financial crisis, Beijing’s takeover of Anbang was meant to limit wider repercussions from an insurer’s risky financial endeavors.\nIn the AIG bailout, the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury provided loans to the insurer and took a majority stake in it, helping prevent losses at the many banks exposed to AIG through derivatives.\nWhile China’s insurance regulator will run Anbang for at least a year, its takeover so far hasn’t involved a capital infusion, and Anbang isn’t seen as being as large a systemic risk as AIG.\nIt does, however, own shares of many companies, including two Chinese banks in which it has large stakes. Anbang’s financial problems risked harming everyone who had bought its insurance policies and investment products.\nAs in the AIG case, the government support risks sending a dangerous signal to other large, highly indebted companies: If you run into financial trouble, authorities will step in to rescue you.\nThe Takeover Is About the Future, Not the Past Though the takeover seemed precipitous, Anbang has been in regulators’ crosshairs for more than a year. Under pressure, it began reducing offerings of its riskiest, high-yield products early last year. A team of regulators set up camp inside the insurer to supervise operations last June, around the time its brash founder and chairman, Wu Xiaohui, was detained on suspicion of economic crimes.\nMarkets are now watching for how the government honors its pledge to keep Anbang operating—and for the precedents it sets for disposing of other debt-addled companies. China’s financial regulatory regime is itself being reengineered, and officials now in charge of Anbang say they’ll use the next year restructuring the firm to find strategic shareholders who can bring in more capital.\n—Stella Yifan Xie contributed to this article.\nWrite to James T.
