    "text": "JAKARTA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Torrential rain has caused floods and landslides in satellite cities around the Indonesian capital, with authorities warning that floods could hit Jakarta later on Monday after being forced to open sluice gates on a major upstream reservoir.\nDramatic TV footage showed fast-running rivers of muddy water gushing down roads, bringing down trees and even some villas in the hilly areas around Jakarta.\nAuthorities were forced to release water from a reservoir upstream in the city of Bogor as water levels prompted the highest alert.\nThe national disaster management agency said at least four landslides had left an unknown number of people missing.\n“Some residents have been evacuated and the potential for rain in the greater Jakarta area remains high,” agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.\nHe added that police and military personnel were working with volunteers to deal with the impact of the floods.\nJakarta governor Anies Baswedan warned people on Monday that flood waters could reach the capital within hours.\n“I urge residents near the river...to be alert,” Baswedan told reporters.\nCity authorities have in the last few years sought to improve low-lying Jakarta’s vulnerability to flooding during the rainy season.\nMore than 50 people died in one of the capital’s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was innundated after canals overflowed.
