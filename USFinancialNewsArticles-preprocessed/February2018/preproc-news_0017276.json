    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif.,\neGain (NASDAQ:EGAN), a leading provider of cloud customer engagement solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Financial Highlights\nSaaS revenue was $7.7 million, up 24% year over year from Q2 2017. Total revenue, excluding legacy license revenue, was $15.3 million, up 13% year over year from Q2 2017. Recurring revenue was $12.6 million, up 14% year over year and 82% of total revenue. Recurring revenue gross margin was 75%, unchanged from Q2 2017. GAAP operating loss was $396,000, compared to $298,000 in Q2 2017, and non-GAAP operating income was $843,000, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $429,000 in Q2 2017. GAAP net loss was $788,000, or $(0.03) per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to a GAAP net loss of $1.0 million, or $(0.04) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for Q2 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $451,000, or $0.02 per share on a basic and diluted basis, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $322,000 or $(0.01) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for Q2 2017. Cash provided by operations was $2.6 million, compared to cash used in operations of $3.8 million in Q2 2017. Non-GAAP total deferred revenue was $68.4 million as of December 31, 2017, up 47% from $46.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Total cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, was $10.8 million, compared to $10.6 million as of June 30, 2017. The company paid down approximately $2.6 million in net debt during Q2 2018.\nAshu Roy, eGain CEO, commented, “We continue to execute well under our new SaaS revenue model, generating healthy sequential and year-over-year growth, and $2.6 million in cash from operations. We are pleased with the overall strength of our business and the customer activity we are seeing, which included a mixture of new and expansion opportunities and an increased number of customer migrations to the cloud during the quarter.”\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThese reported results include non-GAAP operating income/(loss) and non-GAAP net income/(loss) as supplemental information relating to our operating results. Non-GAAP operating income/(loss) is defined as operating income/(loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is defined as net income/(loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Recurring revenue is made up of SaaS revenue and legacy support revenue. SaaS revenue includes ratable revenue from cloud subscription, term and ratable licenses and associated support contracts. Legacy support is revenue associated with perpetual license arrangements the Company is no longer selling. Total deferred revenue includes both GAAP deferred revenue and non-GAAP unbilled deferred revenue that remains off balance sheet, collectively representing contractual commitments that have not been recognized as revenue. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. eGain’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. eGain believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the company’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and that it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Reconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. eGain urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company’s business.\nQuarterly Conference Call\neGain will discuss its quarterly results today via teleconference at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time.
