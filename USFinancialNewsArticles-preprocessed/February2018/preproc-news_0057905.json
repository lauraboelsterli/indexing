    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, February 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nMYM Nutraceuticals Inc., (CSE: MYM) (OTC: MYMMF) (the \"Company\" or \"MYM\") is pleased to announce it has closed its non-brokered private placement of 535,319 units at a price of $2.25 per unit for gross proceeds of $1,204,467.75 (the \"Private Placement\"). Insiders subscribed to 100,443 units for gross proceeds of $225,996.75. As a result, the Private Placement is considered to be a \"related party transaction\" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (\"MI 61-101\"). The transaction is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of any shares issued to or the consideration paid by such persons exceeded 25% of the Company's market capitalization. No commissions were paid in respect to the Private Placement.\nEach unit in the Private Placement is comprised of one common share and one transferable share purchase warrant, with each warrant exercisable into one additional common share at a price of $3.25 for a period of two years. The warrants are subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. The securities will be subject to a four-month-and-one-day hold period under securities laws.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement for general working capital and corporate purposes.\nAbout MYM Nutraceuticals Inc.\nMYM Nutraceuticals Inc. is an innovative company focused on acquiring Health Canada licenses to produce and sell high-end organic medicinal cannabis supplements and topical products.
