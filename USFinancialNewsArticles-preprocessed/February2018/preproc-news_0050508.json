    "text": "CHICAGO, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- \"With tobacco companies estimated to spend $25 million every day to addict new customers, the CDC's Línea de Ayuda is a critical tool to make sure our community knows the real costs of tobacco use, nicotine addiction, and how to get help to quit,\" said Esther Sciammarella, Executive Director of the Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition, a Chicago-based public health nonprofit established in 1991.\nOn February 22, 2018, CDC is airing Línea de Ayuda (Helpline), a telethon-style event on Chicago's Telemundo station WSNS-TV (Channel 44) between 5:00 and 9:00 pm local time. Línea de Ayuda will feature four 90-second spots with Angélica Vale, a Mexican American actress and singer known as \"Mexico's Sweetheart\". Ms. Vale covers critical information during these segments with Dr. Ralph Caraballo, CDC Chief Epidemiologist, about smoking-related illnesses, health benefits from quitting, and accessing free help to quit. Each segment directs callers to the Spanish-language Quitline, 1-855-DÉJELO-YA (1-800-QUIT-NOW), for support.\nThe Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition is promoting the Línea de Ayuda television events as a Lead Agency of the Nuestras Voces (Our Voices) Network, which works to reduce tobacco use and cancer incidence in Hispanic communities. Activities to support CDC's efforts include bilingual social media and individual cessation support through the National Alliance for Hispanic Health's (the Alliance) Su Familia Helpline.\n\"The information provided through the Línea de Ayuda campaign gives the tools and encouragement to smokers to make the decision to quit and others not to start. We are proud to support these efforts, including through the Alliance's Su Familia Helpline at 1-866-783-2645 where callers can get information in Spanish and English on quitting smoking, talking to a loved one about smoking, or connecting to health services in their communities,\" emphasized Mrs. Sciammarella.\nAbout Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition. The mission of the Chicago Hispanic Health Coalition is to improve the quality of life for all Hispanics by promoting healthy behaviors and environments. By coalition-building and direct action, we seek to empower the Hispanic community by providing a centralized forum for capacity building, communication, coordination, and networking among health and human service providers and consumers\nAbout the Nuestras Voces Network.
