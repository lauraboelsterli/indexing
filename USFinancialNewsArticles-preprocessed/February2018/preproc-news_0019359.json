    "text": "(Reuters) - A Vietnamese property tycoon who was sent home from Singapore to face charges of spilling official secrets will also be prosecuted for abusing power while on official duties, Vietnam’s police said on Wednesday.\nPhan Van Anh Vu, 42, had told his lawyers that he was also a senior officer in the secret police, but this has not been publicly confirmed by Vietnam’s security ministry.\nVu was arrested last month on his return from Singapore, which sent him home despite appeals that his life could be in danger.\nThe Ministry of Public Security said it had issued a prosecution order against Vu for “abusing position and power while performing official duty”. It also ordered his detention for four months.\nThe Communist country’s laws say abuse of power is an offense that applies to officials, including members of the security forces.\nReuters was unable to reach Vu for comment and it was not able to establish whether a lawyer was representing him in Vietnam.\nForeign lawyers representing Vu in his efforts to leave Singapore for Germany had Quote: d him and his family as saying he was a senior officer in the secret police.\nSingapore authorities said he had entered the country on a passport with a false identity while carrying another Vietnamese passport with his real identity and also had a third passport in his possession.\nEditing by Matthew Tostevin and Alison Williams\n ",
