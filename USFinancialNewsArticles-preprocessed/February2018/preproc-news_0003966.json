    "text": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - EnQuest Plc, a North Sea-focused oil producer, said it had agreed with BP Plc to manage the decommissioning of Thistle and Deveron fields, located 275 miles north-east of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom.\nEnQuest will get $30 million in cash as part of the deal for handling the process. EnQuest said its current estimate of its exposure to decommissioning costs is lower than the $30 million cash being received.
