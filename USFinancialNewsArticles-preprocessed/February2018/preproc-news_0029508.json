    "text": "TORTOLA, British Virgin Islands--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Juvenescence Limited (“Juvenescence”), a company focused on the development of therapeutics for ageing and the diseases of ageing, announced the appointment of Karim Hakimzadeh to its Board of Directors. The appointment increases the size of the Board of Directors to five members.\n“It’s a great privilege to serve on the board of a company in one of the most exciting fields in modern medicine,” said Karim. “Having followed the longevity space for a number of years, Juvenescence represents the most compelling opportunity I’ve seen yet to translate a hugely ambitious scientific undertaking into potentially life-extending therapeutics.”\n“Karim will be a strong addition to Juvenescence as we continue to build a diverse team of professionals with expertise in biotech, drug development, and finance” said Dr. Greg Bailey, the Chief Executive Officer of Juvenescence. “I have had the pleasure of looking at a number of projects with Karim, including Medivation and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, and I have been highly impressed by his foresight, diligence, and investment acumen. Juvenescence will benefit from his oversight and direction.”\nBackground on Karim Hakimzadeh\nKarim is an investor with a decade of experience backing transformative companies in technology and the life sciences. Since 2012, he has run a New York-based public market fund that has outperformed the S&P since inception. Recently, he has shifted focus to earlier stage ventures and intends to devote much of his investment activity going forward to the longevity space. Karim attended St Paul’s School in London. He has a degree in economics from Harvard University.\nAbout Juvenescence Limited\nJuvenescence Limited is a biotech company focused on therapies to increase healthy human longevity. It was founded in 2017 by Jim Mellon, Dr. Greg Bailey, Dr. Declan Doogan, Anthony Chow, and Alexander Pickett. The Juvenescence team are highly experienced drug developers, and serial entrepreneurs with a track record of success in life sciences and drug development. Juvenescence is focussed on developing therapeutics that alter ageing or age-related diseases.\nJuvenescence believes that recent advances in science have greatly improved our understanding of the biology of ageing and creates the opportunity to develop therapeutics now that can slow, halt or potentially reverse elements of ageing.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180214005577/en/\nAlexander Pickett\nJuvenescence Limited\nChief Operating Officer\n+1 617 652 0124\nalex@juvenescence.ltd\nSource: Juvenescence Limited",
