    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: SEAS), a leading theme park and entertainment company, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nHighlights\nFiscal 2017 total revenues were $1.26 billion, compared to $1.34 billion in fiscal 2016. Net loss was $202.4 million, which included an after-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $215.1 million, as compared to a net loss of $12.5 million in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA [1] was $300.8 million, or $5.8 million higher than the top end of the Company's most recent full year guidance range, compared to $332.0 million in fiscal 2016. Fourth quarter total revenues were $265.5 million, compared to $267.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss was $20.4 million, as compared to a net loss of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 trends showed improvement versus the first nine months of the year Fourth quarter attendance was down 2.7% from the prior year fourth quarter compared to full year 2017 attendance which was down 5.5% from prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 total revenue per capita was up 2.0% from the prior year fourth quarter compared to full year 2017 total revenue per capita which was down a modest 0.6% from prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was down $3.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. However, the fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA calculation does not reflect approximately $3.8 million of adjustments due to certain limitations in the Company's credit agreement [2] . In 2017, the Company helped rescue and rehabilitate over 2,100 animals and surpassed 31,000 total rescues over its history. Year-to-date 2018 trends are positive when compared to the prior year period with increases in season pass sales and total attendance, led by significant increases in both metrics at SeaWorld San Diego. Confident in 2018 On track to deliver $40 million of previously announced net cost savings by year-end 2018 and an additional $25 million of previously announced cost savings for 2018, a portion of which may be used to offset any potential cost pressures. One of the best new product line-ups in the Company's history with 15 new rides, attractions and events being introduced across the park portfolio. Most comprehensive marketing and communications strategy bolstered by the largest investment in such efforts in the Company's history.\n\"We are encouraged by the improvements we saw in the business in the fourth quarter,\" said John Reilly, Interim Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. \"Our fourth quarter results were favorably impacted by the continued strong reception of our Halloween and Christmas events. We saw positive trends from our 300-mile and in guests from many of our parks and we saw an increase in overall admission per capita and in-park per capita spending. We did continue to see some weakness from our international and U.S. domestic guests which we plan to specifically address with our 2018 sales and marketing initiatives.\"\n\"Looking ahead to 2018 we are excited to see positive trends,\" continued Reilly. \"Year-to-date attendance and season pass sales to date have increased year-over-year, led by our SeaWorld San Diego park which is rebounding from a difficult 2017. We have one of the most compelling line-ups of new rides, attractions or events across our parks that we have ever had. We are implementing new pricing and ticketing strategies combined with new sales and marketing initiatives that we believe will help drive attendance, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA across our parks. We also remain on track to deliver the previously announced $40 million in total net cost savings by the end of 2018 and the additional $25 million of previously announced cost savings. With our highly compelling product lineup, updated pricing strategies and aggressive marketing and advertising plans, we are confident that we are well-positioned to deliver strong financial performance in 2018.\"\n[1] This earnings release includes several metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). See \"Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section and the financial statement tables for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow and the reconciliation to their respective most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n[2] Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with the Company's Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Company's credit agreement. Due to limitations under the Company's credit agreement, the amount which the Company is able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for certain adjusting items is limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. Due to these credit agreement limitations, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation presented does not reflect $2.5 million of certain costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, under the terms of the Company's credit agreement, the Company is permitted to add back certain expenses on an after-tax basis only, and accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the fourth quarter of 2017 does not reflect approximately $1.3 million related to these items.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company hosted approximately 4.26 million guests, generated total revenues of $265.5 million, incurred a net loss of $20.4 million and generated Adjusted EBITDA of $54.7 million. Attendance in the fourth quarter was impacted by weakness in international and U.S. domestic market attendance (defined as guests outside of a 300-mile radius from the Company's parks), partially offset by an increase from 300-mile and in guests in certain markets due in part to the continued popularity of the Company's Halloween and Christmas events. Revenue was impacted by a modest decline in attendance largely offset by increased admission per capita (defined as admissions revenue divided by total attendance) and in-park per capita spending (defined as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance). Adjusted EBITDA was primarily impacted by the decline in revenue.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nVariance\n2017\n2016\n%\n(Unaudited, in millions, except per share and per capita\namounts)\nTotal revenues\n$\n265.5\n$\n267.6\n(0.8%)\nNet loss\n$\n(20.4)\n$\n(11.9)\n(71.7%)\nNet loss per share, diluted\n$\n(0.24)\n$\n(0.14)\n(70.2%)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n54.7\n$\n58.1\n(6.0%)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4.7\n$\n21.5\n(78.3%)\nAttendance\n4.26\n4.38\n(2.7%)\nTotal revenue per capita\n$\n62.32\n$\n61.12\n2.0%\nAdmission per capita\n$\n37.57\n$\n37.07\n1.3%\nIn-Park per capita spending\n$\n24.75\n$\n24.06\n2.9%\nFiscal 2017 Results\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company hosted 20.8 million guests, generated total revenues of $1.26 billion, incurred a net loss of $202.4 million, which included an after-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $215.1 million and generated Adjusted EBITDA of $300.8 million. Attendance for the year was negatively impacted by a decline in U.S. domestic and international attendance partially offset by an increase in attendance from guests within 300 miles of our parks in certain markets. Revenue was primarily impacted by a decline in attendance, partially offset by an increase in in-park per capita spending.

In addition, with our significant annual operating cash flow we continue to feel confident about our financial flexibility heading into 2018.\"\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate a company's financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation.\nManagement believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company's underlying operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of its executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA-related measures in the company's industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants.\nThe financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nAbout SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.\nSeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.

Includes non-cash equity compensation expense, which for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes approximately $9.0 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which vested on April 1, 2016.\n(b) Includes non-cash equity compensation expense, which for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $5.6 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which partially vested on May 8, 2017. Includes non-cash equity compensation expense, which for the year ended December 31, 2016, includes approximately $18.5 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which vested on April 1, 2016.\n(c) Reflects a non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to full impairment of goodwill for the Company's SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit during the second quarter of 2017.\n(d) For the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects restructuring and other related costs primarily related to $5.2 million of severance and other termination benefits associated with certain positions which were eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 Restructuring Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, reflects restructuring and other related costs primarily related to $8.9 million of severance and other employment expenses for positions eliminated in connection with the 2016 Restructuring Program.\n(e) For the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects primarily the write-off of $8.0 million in debt issuance costs on the Term B-5 Loans.\n(f) During the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company excluded potentially dilutive shares of approximately 4,950,000 and 4,795,000, respectively, from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company's net loss in those periods. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company excluded potentially dilutive shares of approximately 5,090,000 and 4,807,000, respectively, from the calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company's net loss during those periods.\n(g) Reflects non-cash equity compensation expenses associated with the grants of equity compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2017, includes $8.4 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares, a portion of which vested on May 8, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, includes $27.5 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which vested on April 1, 2016.\n(h) Reflects non-cash expenses related to miscellaneous asset write-offs, including $7.8 million associated with certain long-lived assets which were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2017 and $6.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 associated with the canceled Blue World Project, and non-cash losses on derivatives.\n(i) Reflects primarily certain business optimization and strategic initiative costs primarily consisting of (1) $0.1 million and $5.2 million related to the 2017 Restructuring Program in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $8.9 million related to the 2016 Restructuring Program in the three months and year ended December 31, 2016; (2) third party consulting and legal costs of $0.5 million and $4.8 million in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.9 million and $2.4 million of third party consulting and legal costs in the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively; and (3) net separation costs of $0.1 million and $0.6 million incurred in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, for certain positions eliminated not related to a formal restructuring program or cost saving initiative. For the year ended December 31, 2016, also includes $1.1 million of other severance and employment expenses incurred in 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA calculations presented in the table above do not reflect certain 2017 other business optimization costs incurred in 2017 due to limitations as described in footnote (m) below.\n(j) Reflects primarily product and intellectual property development costs incurred. The Adjusted EBITDA calculations presented in the table above do not reflect certain 2017 product and intellectual property development costs incurred in 2017 due to limitations as described in footnote (m) below. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, also includes approximately $0.9 million of costs incurred related to other strategic initiatives not subject to the limitations as described in footnote (m) below. Also includes state franchise taxes paid of approximately $0.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n(k) Reflects the impact of certain expenses incurred primarily related to legal matters during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 which the Company is permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. The credit agreement allows these items to be excluded on an after-tax basis only, and accordingly, these items are presented net of related taxes of approximately $1.3 million and $4.0 million in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the add-back related to these items by $0.4 million.\n(l) For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, reflects estimated cost savings related to the 2017 and 2016 Restructuring Programs. These estimated cost savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only that does not impact the Company's reported GAAP net (loss) income. Pursuant to the credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA reflects, subject to certain limitations, estimated cost savings resulting from certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. The credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities limits the amount of estimated cost savings that do not result from acquisitions or dispositions which may be reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for any applicable four consecutive fiscal quarters.\n(m) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing the Company's Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nFor covenant calculation purposes under the Company's credit agreement, in 2017, the amount which the Company is able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for other business optimization costs and certain other adjusting items, including restructuring costs and product and intellectual property development costs, is limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year (with certain unused amounts carried over from the prior fiscal year). Due to these limitations, the Adjusted EBITDA calculations presented in the table above do not reflect $2.5 million of business optimization and product and intellectual property development costs incurred in fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n(n) Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors, equity analysts and rating agencies as a liquidity measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate cash flow from business operations. Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements, which are significant. Free Cash Flow is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow as defined above may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Prior to the second quarter of 2016, the Company's definition of Free Cash Flow differed from the above. The Company changed the definition of Free Cash Flow to provide a more meaningful metric to investors.\n(o) Calculated as total revenues divided by attendance.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seaworld-entertainment-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2017-results-300604442.html\nSOURCE SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.",
