    "text": "FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday contradicted the White House claim that a security background investigation of Rob Porter was still ongoing when the presidential staff secretary quit last week amid domestic abuse allegations.\nWray told the Senate Intelligence Committee the FBI had issued a partial report on President Donald Trump 's staff secretary last March and completed its background check on Porter in late July.\nWray's statements contrast with deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah's claims last week that Porter's \"background investigation was ongoing, his clearance was never denied, and he resigned.\"\nShah also said the White House was not \"fully aware\" of claims Porter had abused his two ex-wives, Colbie Holderness and Jennifer Willoughby, until last week.\nThe White House has said Porter was operating under a temporary security clearance as a result of that delay in completing that background check.\nLater Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders claimed that there was no conflict between what Wray said and the Trump administration's version of events. \nReading a prepared statement, Sanders told reporters that although the White House Personnel Office received the FBI's final report in November, the office had not finished its own investigation by the time Porter resigned.\n\"The White House Personnel security office, staffed by career officials, received information last year in what they considered to be the final background investigation report in November,\" Sanders said.\n\"But they had not made a final recommendation for adjudication to the White House because the process was still ongoing when Porter resigned,\" Sanders said.\n\"In the view of the personnel security office, the FBI's July report required significant additional investigatory field work before the personnel security office could begin to evaluate the information for adjudication.\"\nSanders said her understanding, based on the \"best information\" available to her, was that chief of staff John Kelly was unaware of the FBI's repeated contact with the White House about the status of its background check of Porter. \n\nVarious reports say that senior Trump staff had known about the Porter allegations for months . Porter, 40, began working at the White House in mid-January 2017. He was even being considered for a promotion , possibly to a deputy chief of staff role, just before he resigned, CNN and",
