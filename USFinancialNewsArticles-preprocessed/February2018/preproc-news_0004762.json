    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., Feb. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Charter Communications, Inc. (along with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\" or \"Charter\") today reported financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. On May 18, 2016, Charter completed its transactions between the Company, Time Warner Cable Inc. (\"Legacy TWC\") and Charter Communications, Inc. (\"Legacy Charter\"), and Legacy Charter and Bright House Networks, LLC (\"Legacy Bright House\") (collectively, the \"Transactions\"). Pro forma 1 results give effect to the Transactions as if they had closed on January 1, 2015 and include the operations of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nKey highlights:\nIn the fourth quarter, total video, Internet and voice customers increased by 15,000, 300,000 and 53,000, respectively. Fourth quarter total residential and SMB customer relationships increased 206,000, compared to 243,000 during the fourth quarter of 2016, when excluding the impact of customer activity related to Legacy Bright House's seasonal customer plan in 2016. 2 Fourth quarter revenues of $10.6 billion grew 3.2%, as compared to the prior year period, driven by residential revenue growth of 4.0% and commercial revenue growth of 6.0%, partly offset by a decline in advertising revenue of 17.3%, due to lower political revenue. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA 3 of $4.0 billion grew 3.3% year-over-year, and 1.8% when excluding transition costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues rose to $41.6 billion, 3.9% higher than in 2016 on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $15.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 5.8% compared to 2016 on a pro forma basis. On an actual basis, full year 2017 revenues increased 43.4% and Adjusted EBITDA grew by 44.5%, driven primarily by the Transactions. Net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $454 million during the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a non-cash GAAP 3 tax benefit of $9.3 billion from a reduction in the deferred tax liability as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Federal tax reform\") by Congress in December, which reduced the Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $9.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion on a pro forma basis in 2016 and $3.5 billion on an actual basis in 2016. Fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion, and $2.4 billion when excluding transition capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures totaled $8.7 billion. When excluding transition capital, full year 2017 capital expenditures totaled $8.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, Charter purchased approximately 13.5 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $4.7 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Charter purchased approximately 38.2 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $13.2 billion.\n\"2017 was a transitional year for Charter. We accomplished our key goals of launching our pricing and packaging across our new company, and progressed as planned to unify our service delivery platform into a single entity from the multiple instances we inherited from our M&A transactions,\" said Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO of Charter Communications, Inc. \"In 2018, we remain focused on completing our service integration and launching new products to accelerate customer relationship, revenue and EBITDA growth.\"\n1\nSee Exhibit 99.1 in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 2016, which includes reconciliations of the pro forma information to actual information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016. See the \"Use of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Information\" section of this document for additional information.\n2\nIn the second quarter of 2017, Charter conformed the seasonal customer program in the Legacy Bright House footprint to Charter's program.

See footnotes to unaudited summary of operating statistics on page 6 of the addendum of this news release. The footnotes contain important disclosures regarding the definitions used for these operating statistics.\nAll percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Charter's residential customer relationships grew by 169,000, while fourth quarter 2016 customer relationships grew by 250,000, or 206,000 when adjusted for seasonal program changes made at Legacy Bright House. 1 Residential PSUs increased by 287,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, while fourth quarter 2016 PSUs increased by 345,000, or 213,000 when adjusted for the seasonal program changes at Legacy Bright House. As of December 31, 2017, Charter had 25.6 million residential customer relationships and 49.5 million residential PSUs.\nResidential video customers increased by 2,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017, while fourth quarter 2016 video customers decreased by 51,000, or 91,000 when adjusted for seasonal program changes made at Legacy Bright House. As of December 31, 2017, Charter had 16.5 million residential video customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Charter continued its all-digital efforts in the approximately 30% of Legacy TWC's footprint and 60% of Legacy Bright House's footprint that are not yet all-digital. All-digital allows Charter to offer more advanced products and services, and provides residential customers with two-way digital set-top boxes, which offer better video picture quality, an interactive programming guide and video on demand on all TV outlets in the home.\nCharter added 263,000 residential Internet customers in the fourth quarter of 2017, versus fourth quarter 2016 Internet customers additions of 357,000, or 303,000 when adjusted for seasonal program changes made at Legacy Bright House. Charter now offers minimum Internet speeds of at least 100 Mbps to 99% of its total footprint. As of December 31, 2017, 93% of Legacy Charter's residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provided speeds of 60 Mbps or more compared to 76% at Legacy TWC and 83% at Legacy Bright House.\nIn December, Charter began launching its Spectrum Internet Gig service (940 Mbps) in a number of markets including, New York City, Austin, Charlotte, Cincinnati and Oahu. The service, which uses DOCSIS 3.1 technology, is now available to approximately 9 million passings across Charter's footprint, with additional launches scheduled for 2018. Additionally, Charter is doubling minimum Internet speeds to 200 Mbps in a number of markets, at no additional cost to new and existing Spectrum Internet customers. As of December 31, 2017, Charter had 22.5 million residential Internet customers.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company added 22,000 residential voice customers, while fourth quarter 2016 voice customers grew by 39,000, or 1,000 when adjusted for seasonal program changes made at Legacy Bright House. As of December 31, 2017, Charter had 10.4 million residential voice customers.\nFourth quarter residential revenue per customer relationship totaled $110.21, and grew by 0.4% compared to the prior year period, as promotional rate step-ups and modest rate adjustments, were partially offset by continued single play Internet sell-in and the migration of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customers to higher-value Spectrum pricing and packaging.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, SMB customer relationships grew by 37,000, in line with growth of 37,000 during the fourth quarter of 2016. SMB PSUs increased 81,000, compared to 73,000 during the fourth quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, Charter had 1.6 million SMB customer relationships and 2.7 million SMB PSUs.\n1\nSee footnote j on page 6 of the addendum to this release for additional information regarding changes made to Legacy Bright House's seasonal customer program in the second quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

Excluding advertising, fourth quarter revenues increased 4.2% year-over-year.\nVideo revenues totaled $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.1% compared to prior year period. Video revenue growth was driven by annual and promotional rate adjustments, higher expanded basic video relationships and revenue allocation relating to the launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, partially offset by a decrease in limited basic video customers and equipment pricing over the last 12 months.\nInternet revenues grew 9.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, to $3.6 billion, driven by growth in Internet customers during the last year, promotional rolloff and revenue allocation relating to the launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House.\nVoice revenues totaled $587 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 18.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, as value-based pricing and revenue allocation relating to the launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, more than offset voice customer growth over the last twelve months.\nCommercial revenues rose to $1.5 billion, an increase of 6.0% over the prior year period, driven by SMB revenue growth of 4.5% and enterprise revenue growth of 8.3%. Fourth quarter commercial revenue growth was lower than fourth quarter commercial customer relationship growth, given the migration of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House commercial customers to more attractively priced Spectrum pricing and packaging for both SMB and enterprise services.\nFourth quarter advertising sales revenues of $419 million decreased 17.3% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by a decrease in political advertising sales.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nFourth quarter total operating costs and expenses increased by $199 million, or 3.1%, compared to the year-ago period.\nFourth quarter programming expense increased by $258 million, or 10.8% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting contractual programming increases, renewals and a growing base of expanded basic video customers. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by $12 million, or 2.3% year-over-year.\nCosts to service customers decreased by $9 million or 0.4% year-over-year, as a result of benefits from the combination of the three companies and improved productivity, partly offset by higher bad debt expense from higher new customer acquisition and revenue.\nMarketing expenses increased by $44 million, or 7.8% year-over-year due to higher sales and the implementation of Charter's selling tactics in the acquired footprints. Other expenses decreased by $24 million, or 2.7% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the elimination of duplicate costs following the Transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $4.0 billion grew by 3.3% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth and operating expense growth of 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively. Excluding transition costs of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $78 million in the prior year period, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.8% year-over-year.\nNet Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders\nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $454 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in net income was primarily driven by a GAAP tax benefit from a reduction in the deferred tax liability as a result of Federal tax reform, higher Adjusted EBITDA, a benefit from re-measurement of the Advance/Newhouse tax receivables agreement liability also due to Federal tax reform, and lower severance-related and transactions expenses, partly offset by a pension revaluation gain in the fourth quarter of 2016, higher depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher year-over-year interest expense.\nNet income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $39.66 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.69 during the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above and a 10.3% decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding versus the prior year period.\nCapital Expenditures\nProperty, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.9 billion during the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by an increase in CPE, scalable infrastructure and support capital spending. The increase in CPE spending was related to higher customer connect volumes and a higher set-top box placement rate per connect driven by the launch of Spectrum pricing and packaging in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, CPE related to Charter's all-digital initiative and early inventory purchases to operationally stage 2018 activity. The increase in scalable infrastructure was related to the timing of in-year spend and planned product improvements for video and Internet, including spending related to 2017 and 2018 DOCSIS 3.1 launches. Support capital increased due to higher vehicle, tools and test equipment purchases related to in-sourcing and in-year timing, capitalized labor associated with software development and transition-related spending. Transition capital expenditures accounted for $202 million of capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding transition-related expenditures, fourth quarter 2017 capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion, compared to $1.7 billion during the same period last year.\nCash Flow and Free Cash Flow\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $3.3 billion, compared to $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and lower severance-related expenses, partly offset by higher cash paid for interest and a smaller working capital benefit.\nFree cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1.2 billion, compared to $1.9 billion during the same period last year. The decrease was driven by higher capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the fourth quarter of 2016, partly offset by higher net cash flows from operating activities.\nLiquidity & Financing\nAs of December 31, 2017, total principal amount of debt was $69.0 billion and Charter's credit facilities provided approximately $3.6 billion of additional liquidity in excess of Charter's $621 million cash position.\nIn October, CCO Holdings, LLC and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. issued $500 million of 4.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023, and an additional $1.0 billion of 5.000% senior unsecured notes due 2028. The net proceeds will be used to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes, including buybacks of Charter Class A common stock or common units of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC.\nIn December, Charter Communications Operating, LLC amended and restated its Credit Agreement and repaid its term loans E, F, H and I and issued a new term loan B totaling $6.4 billion, with a maturity of 2025. Charter Operating also increased its term loan A by approximately $400 million to a total of $2.9 billion and increased the capacity of its revolving credit facility from $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion while reducing the applicable LIBOR margin on both the term loan A and revolving credit facility and extending the maturity of each to 2023 from 2021.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, Charter purchased approximately 13.5 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $4.7 billion.\nYear to Date Financial Results\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

On an actual basis, 2017 revenue grew 43.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by the Transactions.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOperating costs and expenses totaled $26.3 billion in 2017, an increase of $721 million, or 2.8% on a pro forma basis compared to the year-ago period, primarily driven by an increase in programming costs, partly offset by lower costs to service customers and other expenses. Transition costs accounted for $124 million and $156 million of total operating costs in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding transition costs, total operating expenses increased 3.0% year over year, on a pro forma basis. On an actual basis, 2017 operating costs and expenses increased 42.7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the Transactions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $15.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 5.8% compared to 2016 on a pro forma basis, reflecting revenue growth and operating costs and expenses growth of 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. Excluding transition-related expenses, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. On an actual basis, 2017 Adjusted EBITDA grew 44.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by the Transactions.\nNet Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders\nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $9.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.1 billion in 2016 on a pro forma basis. The year-over-year increase in net income on a pro forma basis was primarily related to a GAAP tax benefit from a reduction in the deferred tax liability as a result of Federal tax reform in December, higher Adjusted EBITDA and lower severance-related and transactions expenses, partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, a pension revaluation gain that benefited 2016, and higher interest expense. Net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $38.55 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.97 on a pro forma basis during the same period last year.\nOn an actual basis, net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $9.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.5 billion in 2016. The year-over-year increase in actual net income was primarily driven by a GAAP tax benefit from a reduction in the deferred tax liability as a result of Federal tax reform and higher income from operations, partly offset by a $3.3 billion tax benefit in 2016 resulting from a reduction in Legacy Charter's preexisting valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, a pension revaluation gain that benefited 2016, and higher interest expense in 2017. On an actual basis, net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $38.55 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17.05 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled $8.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.5 billion in 2016 on a pro forma basis. The increase was primarily the result of higher spending on CPE, support capital investments and line extensions. Transition related capital expenditures accounted for $489 million and $460 million of capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding transition-related expenses, capital expenditures totaled $8.2 billion in 2017, compared to $7.1 billion in 2016 on a pro forma basis. On an actual basis, capital expenditures increased to $8.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.3 billion in 2016, primarily driven by the Transactions.\nCash Flow & Free Cash Flow\nIn 2017, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $12.0 billion, compared to $8.0 billion in 2016. The year-over-year increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and lower severance-related expenses, partly offset by higher cash paid for interest, following the close of the Transactions.\nFree cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.1 billion, compared to $3.3 billion during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher cash flow from operating activities, partly offset by higher capital expenditures, following the close of the Transactions.\nShare Repurchases\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Charter purchased approximately 38.2 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $13.2 billion.\nConference Call\nCharter will host a conference call on Friday, February 2, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) related to the contents of this release.\nThe conference call will be webcast live via the Company's investor relations website at ir.charter.com .

A slide presentation to accompany the conference call and a trending schedule containing historical customer and financial data will also be available in the \"Financial Information\" section.\nUse of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Information\nThe company uses certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, in the Addendum to this release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other pension (benefits) costs, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.\nManagement and Charter's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by its operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. The Company's debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which were $271 million and $296 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were $1.1 billion and $930 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nPro forma results give effect to the Transactions as if they had closed on January 1, 2015 and include the operations of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due to the transformative nature of the Transactions, the Company believes that providing a discussion of its results of operations on a pro forma basis provides management and investors a more meaningful perspective on the Company's financial and operational performance and trends. The results of operations data on a pro forma basis are provided for illustrative purposes only and are based on available information and assumptions that Charter believes are reasonable and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of Charter would have been had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2015, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. Exhibit 99.1 in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on November 3, 2016 provides pro forma financial information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016 and a reconciliation of the pro forma financial information to the actual results of operations of the Company.\nAbout Charter\nCharter (NASDAQ: CHTR) is a leading broadband communications company and the second largest cable operator in the United States.

These methodologies differ and their differences may be material. Statistical reporting will be conformed over time to a single Charter reporting methodology.\nWe calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account. On that basis, at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, actual customers include approximately 245,800, 218,300 and 208,400 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 19,500, 20,300 and 15,500 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due and approximately 12,600, 12,000 and 8,000 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due.\n(b)\nPassings represent our estimate of the number of units, such as single family homes, apartment and condominium units and small and medium business and enterprise sites passed by our cable distribution network in the areas where we offer the service indicated. These estimates are based upon the information available at this time and are updated for all periods presented when new information becomes available.\n(c)\nPenetration represents residential and small and medium business customers as a percentage of estimated passings for the service indicated.\n(d)\nCustomer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing video, Internet and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units (\"MDUs\") and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU. Total customer relationships excludes enterprise customer relationships.\n(e)\nSingle play, double play and triple play customers represent customers that subscribe to one, two or three of Charter service offerings, respectively.\n(f)\nSingle play, double play and triple play penetration represents the number of residential single play, double play and triple play customers, respectively, as a percentage of residential customer relationships.\n(g)\nMonthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential video, Internet and voice quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter.\n(h)\nMonthly small and medium business revenue per customer is calculated as total small and medium business quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average small and medium business customer relationships during the respective quarter.\n(i)\nEnterprise PSUs represents the aggregate number of fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering at each customer location as an individual PSU.\n(j)\nIn the second quarter of 2017, Charter conformed the seasonal customer program in the Legacy Bright House footprint to Charter's program. Prior to the plan change, Legacy Bright House customers enrolling in the seasonal plan were charged a one-time fee and counted as customer disconnects, and as new connects, when moving off the seasonal plan. Under Charter's seasonal plan, residential customers pay a reduced monthly fee while the seasonal plan is active and remain reported as customers. Excluding the impact of customer activity related to Legacy Bright House's previous seasonal plan, residential customer relationships and video, Internet and voice net additions for the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been lower by 44,000, 40,000, 54,000 and 38,000, respectively, and residential customer relationships and video, Internet and voice PSUs at December, 2016 would have been higher by approximately 10,000, 8,000, 12,000 and 7,000, respectively.\nCHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
