The trio will include the largest ever iPhone, an upgraded handset the same size as the current iPhone X and a less expensive model with some of the flagship phoneâ€™s key features. The iPhone maker is already running production tests with suppliers and is expected to announce the new phones this fall. However, the plans could still change, the report said.
