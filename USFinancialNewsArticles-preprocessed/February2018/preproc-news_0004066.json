(NASDAQ: USAK), a leading capacity solutions provider, today announced its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, consolidated operating revenue was $123.3 million compared to $103.1 million for the prior year period. Base revenue, which excludes fuel surcharge revenue, was $110.1 million compared to $92.0 million for the 2016 period. The Company reported net income of $14.8 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of ($3.8) million, or ($0.48) per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law, which reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. This change required the Company to revalue its deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 at the new corporate income tax rate, which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense by approximately $12.0 million, or $1.49 per diluted share. Excluding the tax law reform impact, adjusted net income (a) was $2.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, representing a year-over-year improvement of $6.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share. The Company’s fourth quarter 2017 consolidated operating ratio was 95.5%, versus 104.5% in the fourth quarter 2016, representing a 900 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nPresident and CEO James Reed commented, “The fourth quarter adjusted results represent the third highest adjusted EPS for USA Truck in the last 10 years. When I, and other members of our new management team, joined the Company during the course of 2017, we committed to improved operational and financial results. We have now delivered on that commitment for the second consecutive quarter. We are proud of our people – especially our drivers and front-line employees – for their belief in our direction, commitment to our plan, and accountability in driving results. While these results help validate our leadership team’s strategy and execution, the quarter was not without its challenges. We continue to be impacted by this increasingly tight driver and independent contractor recruiting environment, and increasing cost pressures in our logistics business that could threaten margins. These will be our key focus areas throughout 2018, as we seek to further increase shareholder value.”\nTrucking: For the fourth quarter of 2017, Trucking operating revenue increased $13.8 million, or 19.8%, to $83.8 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to a 20.1% increase in base revenue per loaded mile. Trucking operating income was $3.5 million for the 2017 period and an adjusted operating ratio of 95.2%, compared to a ($6.2) million operating loss and an adjusted operating ratio of 109.8% for the 2016 period. This represents a $9.7 million year-over-year improvement in operating income and a 1,460 basis point improvement in adjusted operating ratio. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company increased its participation in seasonal peak freight within its established network over 2016 levels. This was a contributing factor to the significant increase in our base revenue per loaded mile and base revenue per seated tractor.\nWe remain intensely focused on improving Trucking profitability and driving operational improvements that we believe will help position us for long-term success. The following are specific areas of focus for our Trucking operations:\nYield improvements: Our base revenue per loaded mile increased 20.1% to $2.106 in 4Q17 from $1.754 in 4Q16 and a 13.5% increase sequentially over 3Q17. Approximately $0.17 of the year-over-year increase in base revenue per loaded mile for 4Q17 was driven by our increased participation in seasonal peak freight. The remaining $0.18 cents of the year-over-year increase in base revenue per loaded mile for 4Q17 was driven by the ongoing review of pricing and network strategies, customers, markets and lanes. Base revenue per seated tractor per week increased $487 per week, or 16.1% when compared to 4Q16, and $378 per week, or 12.1% when compared to 3Q17. Total miles per seated tractor per week decreased 58 miles per tractor, or 2.9%, when compared to 4Q16, but increased 8 miles per tractor, or 0.4%, sequentially over 3Q17. Deadhead percentage for 4Q17 increased 40 basis points when compared to 4Q16 and 140 basis points sequentially over 3Q17. These metrics were negatively impacted by the strategic decision to participate more extensively in higher margin seasonal peak business. Seated tractors: Our average unseated tractor percentage for 4Q17 was 5.5%, which represents a 380 basis point improvement year-over-year and a 100 basis point improvement sequentially. The average seated tractor count for 4Q17 was 1,588, which represented a 2.7% improvement over our 4Q16 average of 1,547. While the change in both unseated tractor percentage and total seated tractor count improved year-over-year on average for the quarter, each trended unfavorably throughout the quarter, as the driver and independent contractor markets continue to be challenging. We have implemented a variety of initiatives designed to help mitigate this industry-wide issue, and expect this to remain a significant area of focus in 2018.\nUSAT Logistics: USAT Logistics operational performance improved throughout 4Q17. Operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $39.5 million, representing a 19.0% year-over-year improvement, and a 4.5% improvement sequentially. Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 17.9% compared to 18.6% in 4Q16. A tightening spot market in the fourth quarter drove up purchased transportation costs, making it increasingly difficult to preserve margins. This was driven in part by the ELD implementation in mid-December that led carriers to raise rates preemptively.\nSegment Results\nThe following table includes key operating results and statistics by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, Trucking: 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating revenue (in thousands) $ 83,777 $ 69,953 $ 302,052 $ 294,526 Operating income (loss) (in thousands) (1) $ 3,498 $ (6,181 ) $ (9,667 ) $ (14,789 ) Operating ratio (2) 95.8 % 108.8 % 103.2 % 105.0 % Adjusted operating ratio (3) 95.2 % 109.8 % 103.4 % 103.5 % Total miles (in thousands) (4) 40,233 40,375 162,599 172,591 Deadhead percentage (5) 13.7 % 13.3 % 13.0 % 12.9 % Base revenue per loaded mile $ 2.106 $ 1.754 $ 1.865 $ 1.746 Average number of in-service tractors (6) 1,681 1,705 1,713 1,774 Average number of seated tractors (7) 1,588 1,547 1,592 1,674 Average miles per seated tractor per week 1,928 1,986 1,959 1,972 Base revenue per seated tractor per week $ 3,505 $ 3,018 $ 3,179 $ 2,998 Average loaded miles per trip 544 585 557 583 USAT Logistics: Operating revenue (in thousands) $ 39,493 $ 33,182 $ 144,481 $ 134,573 Operating income (in thousands) (1) $ 1,995 $ 1,543 $ 7,599 $ 7,273 Gross margin (in thousands) (8) $ 7,061 $ 6,164 $ 26,686 $ 25,645 Gross margin percentage (9) 17.9 % 18.6 % 18.5 % 19.1 % (1) Operating income (loss) is calculated by deducting operating expenses from operating revenue.\n(2) Operating ratio is calculated as operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue.\n(3) Adjusted operating ratio is calculated as operating expenses less restructuring, impairment and other costs, and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits, net of fuel surcharge revenue, as a percentage of operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue (a) .\n(4) Total miles include both loaded and empty miles.\n(5) Deadhead percentage is calculated by dividing empty miles into total miles.\n(6) Tractors include Company-operated tractors in service, plus tractors operated by independent contractors.\n(7) Seated tractors are those occupied by drivers.\n(8) Gross margin is calculated by deducting purchased transportation expense from USAT Logistics operating revenue.\n(9) Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by USAT Logistics operating revenue.\nThree Months Ended 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 Base revenue per loaded mile $ 2.106 $ 1.856 $ 1.762 $ 1.740 $ 1.754 Balance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, total debt and capital lease obligations was $107.5 million, our total debt and capital lease obligations, net of cash (“Net Debt”) (a) , was $107.4 million and total stockholders’ equity was $66.5 million.

To participate in the call, please dial 1-844-824-3828 (U.S./Canada) or 1-412-317-5138 (International). A live webcast of the conference call will be broadcast in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, www.usa-truck.com , under the “Events & Presentations” tab of the “Investor Relations” menu. For those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, the presentation materials and an audio replay of the call will be available at our website, www.usa-truck.com , under the “Events & Presentations” tab of the “Investor Relations” menu. A telephone replay of the call will also be available through February 9, 2018, and may be accessed by calling 1-877-344-7529 (U.S.), 1-855-669-9658 (Canada), or 1-412-317-0088 (International) and by referencing conference ID #10115759.\n(a) About Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to our GAAP results, this press release also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by the SEC. The terms base revenue, “Net Debt”, “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted operating ratio”, “Adjusted net income”, and “Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share”, as we define them, are not presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company defines Net Debt as total debt, including insurance premium financing and capital lease obligations, net of cash. The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, provision for income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash equity compensation, impairments on assets held for sale, and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits. Adjusted operating ratio is calculated as operating expenses less restructuring, impairment and other costs and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits, net of fuel surcharge revenue, as a percentage of operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue. Adjusted net income is defined as net income, excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share is defined as earnings (loss) per share plus the per-share impact of restructuring, impairment and other costs, and severance costs included in salaries, wages and employee benefits, less the per share tax impact of those adjustments using a statutory income tax rate. The per-share impact of each item is determined by dividing it by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. These financial measures supplement our GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business. We believe that using these measures improves comparability in analyzing our performance because they remove the impact of items from our operating results that, in our opinion, do not reflect our core operating performance. Management and the board of directors focus on Net Debt, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating ratio, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share as key measures of our performance, all of which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures and further discussed below. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors and other users because it provides them the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our core operating performance.\nNet Debt, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating ratio, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, cash flows from operating activities, operating margin ratio, diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. Although we believe that they improve comparability in analyzing our period to period performance, they could limit comparability to other companies in our industry if those companies define these measures differently. Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered measures of income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures on a supplemental basis.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and Regulation S-K, we have provided reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted operating ratio, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share to GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nFinancial information in this press release is preliminary and based upon information available to the Company as of the date of this press release.
