    "text": "ATLANTA, Leading Supply Chain and Omnichannel Commerce Solutions provider Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) today reported GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, of $0.36 compared to $0.42 in Q4 2016, on license revenue of $14.7 million, cloud subscriptions revenue of $3.2 million and total revenue of $144.1 million. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for Q4 2017 was $0.45 compared to $0.46 in Q4 2016.\n“Q4 and full-year 2017 marked a pivotal beginning to our cloud transformation. Deal volume and competitive win rates were strong with better than anticipated market enthusiasm for our recently launched Manhattan Active Omni Solution. Perpetual license sales and enterprise deal timelines, in contrast, saw delays as some pushed into 2018,” said Eddie Capel, president and chief executive officer of Manhattan Associates. “It’s encouraging to see the market demanding the cloud delivery model and validating Manhattan’s differentiation. We expect ongoing growth of our Manhattan Active cloud offerings as customers seek a cloud-first approach.”\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL SUMMARY:\nCertain line items in prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated statements of income due to the business transition to cloud subscriptions.

Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income. For further detail, please see note 8 in the supplemental financial information accompanying this press release.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nManhattan Associates provides the following revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance for the full year 2018:\nGuidance Range - 2018 Full Year ($'s in millions, except EPS) $ Range % Growth Range\nTotal revenue $ 546 $ 558 -8 % -6 %\n﻿Operating Margin:\nGAAP operating margin 20.0% 20.4% -11.2% -10.8% Equity-based compensation, net of tax 4.0% 3.9% Adjusted operating margin (1) 24.0% 24.3% -10.5% -10.2% Diluted earnings per share (EPS):\nGAAP EPS $ 1.23 $ 1.27 -27 % -24 % Equity-based compensation, net of tax 0.25 0.25\nAdjusted EPS (1) $ 1.48 $ 1.52 -21 % -19 % (1) Adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are Non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of equity-based compensation and acquisition-related costs, and the related income tax effects of both. Manhattan Associates currently intends to publish, in each quarterly earnings release, certain expectations with respect to future financial performance. Those statements, including the guidance provided above, are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially. Those statements, including the guidance provided above, do not reflect the potential impact of mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations that may be completed after the date of the release.\nManhattan Associates will make its earnings release and published expectations available on its website ( www.manh.com ). Following publication of this earnings release, any expectations with respect to future financial performance contained in this release, including the guidance above, should be considered historical only, and Manhattan Associates disclaims any obligation to update them.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company’s conference call regarding its fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, financial results will be held today, February 6, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Investors are invited to listen to a live webcast through the investor relations section of Manhattan Associates' website at www.manh.com .

The phone replay will be available for two weeks after the call, and the Internet webcast will be available until Manhattan Associates’ first quarter 2018 earnings release.\nGAAP VERSUS NON-GAAP PRESENTATION\nThe Company provides adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in this press release as additional information regarding the Company’s historical and projected operating results. These measures are not in accordance with – or alternatives to – GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share measures used by other companies. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ ability to understand and compare the Company’s results and guidance, because the measures provide supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of its business, as distinct from results that include items that are not indicative of ongoing operating results, and because the Company believes its peers typically publish similar non-GAAP measures. This release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Form 8-K earnings release filing for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax provision, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of equity-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and the amortization thereof, and a restructuring charge – all net of income tax effects, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts. Reconciliations of the Company’s GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP adjustments are included in the supplemental information attached to this release.\nABOUT MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES\nManhattan Associates is a technology leader in supply chain and omnichannel commerce.

Equity-based compensation is included in the following GAAP operating expense lines for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Cost of services $ 1,398 $ 819 $ 3,994 $ 3,794 Research and development 1,280 567 3,208 2,489 Sales and marketing 690 593 2,240 2,431 General and administrative 1,820 2,231 6,787 7,220 Total equity-based compensation $ 5,188 $ 4,210 $ 16,229 $ 15,934 (b) During the first quarter of 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. Under the new guidance, all excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statements on a prospective basis, rather than recorded in additional paid-in capital. The adjustment represents the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies of the stock awards vested during the period. Excess tax benefits (deficiencies) occur when the amount deductible for an award of equity instruments on our tax return is more (less) than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, respectively. As discussed above, we excluded equity-based compensation from adjusted non-GAAP results to be consistent with other companies in the software industry and for the other reasons explained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed the SEC. Therefore, we also excluded the related tax benefit (expense) generated upon their vesting.\n(c) Adjustments represent purchased intangibles amortization from a prior acquisition. Such amortization is excluded from adjusted results to facilitate comparison with our peers, to facilitate comparisons of the results of our core operations from period to period and for the other reasons explained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.\n(d) In May 2017, we eliminated about 100 positions due to the headwinds in the retail sector and to align our services capacity with demand. This action does not impair or alter our strategic investment plans in innovation and sales and marketing to increase market share and extend our competitive advantage. As a result of this initiative, we recorded a charge of approximately $2.9 million in 2017. The charge primarily consists of employee severance and employee transition and outplacement costs. We do not believe that the charge is a cost resulting from normal operating activities. Consequently, we have excluded this charge from adjusted non-GAAP results.\n(e) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a provisional net one-time tax of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 based on a reasonable estimate of the income tax effects, primarily from a tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets. As this was a one-time charge, we have excluded this charge from adjusted non-GAAP results. We continue to finalize the analysis of the tax reform provisions in 2018.\nMANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC.

We adopted the new revenue recognition standard, FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in the first quarter of 2018. The new standard provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects substantially all entities. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially adopting the standard recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Historical hardware sales prior to the adoption of ASC606 were recorded on a gross basis, as we were the principal in the transaction in accordance with ASC 605-45. Under the new standard, we are an agent in the transaction as we do not physically control the hardware which we sell, accordingly, we recognize our hardware revenue net of related cost which reduces both hardware revenue and cost of sales as compared to our accounting prior to 2018. We recognize and present our hardware revenue net of related cost under the new standard prospectively. For comparison purposes only, had we implemented ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, we would have presented hardware revenue net of expense in our 2016 and 2017 quarterly financial results below:\n2016 2017 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Full Year 1st Qtr 2nd Qtr 3rd Qtr 4th Qtr Full Year Presentation of Hardware Revenue - Pre ASC 606 adoption: Revenue Hardware Revenue $ 8,761 $ 9,554 $ 6,543 $ 9,070 $ 33,928 $ 7,559 $ 10,413 $ 13,540 $ 11,678 $ 43,190 Cost of Revenue Cost of Hardware (5,629 ) (7,103 ) (4,626 ) (6,068 ) (23,426 ) (5,370 ) (7,766 ) (10,653 ) (8,416 ) (32,205 ) Hardware Revenue, net $ 3,132 $ 2,451 $ 1,917 $ 3,002 $ 10,502 $ 2,189 $ 2,647 $ 2,887 $ 3,262 $ 10,985 Proforma Presentation of Hardware Revenue - Post ASC 606 Using Full Retrospective Method: Hardware Revenue $ 3,132 $ 2,451 $ 1,917 $ 3,002 $ 10,502 $ 2,189 $ 2,647 $ 2,887 $ 3,262 $ 10,985\nContact: Dennis Story Rick Fernandez Chief Financial Officer Senior Manager, Corporate Communications Manhattan Associates, Inc.
