    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese police arrested two men on Friday after several bullets were fired at the Tokyo headquarters of a group linked to North Korea, a spokesman and media said.\nThe men pulled up at the complex housing the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) in a van shortly before 4 a.m., before one of them fired multiple shots at the gate, media reported.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Police at the heavily guarded complex arrested the two, who media said had links to right-wing groups.\nJapan has strict gun laws and shootings, almost always gang-related, are extremely rare.\nTensions remain high between North Korea and Japan over the North’s nuclear program and its testing of several missiles in recent years, including two that flew over Japanese territory last year.\nAbout 500,000 ethnic Koreans live in Japan, many of them descended from the two million Koreans brought to Japan as forced labor during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonisation of the peninsula.\nReporting by Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ",
