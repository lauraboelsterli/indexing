    "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., PNM Resources (NYSE: PNM) today released the company's 2017 fourth quarter and year-end earnings results. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 include a $57.5 million charge for the impacts of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate on net deferred income tax assets primarily related to items not in regulated rates. In addition, management affirmed its recently revised consolidated ongoing earnings guidance of $1.82 to $1.92 per diluted share for 2018 and $2.04 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2019.\nPNM Resources (In millions, except EPS)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nYE 2017\nYE 2016\nGAAP net earnings (loss) attributable to PNM Resources\n($54.3)\n$24.8\n$79.9\n$116.8\nGAAP diluted EPS\n($0.68)\n$0.31\n$1.00\n$1.46\nOngoing net earnings\n$19.4\n$27.4\n$155.3\n$132.4\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$0.24\n$0.34\n$1.94\n$1.65\nSEGMENT REPORTING OF 2017 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END EARNINGS\nPNM – a vertically integrated electric utility in New Mexico with distribution, transmission and generation assets.\nPNM (In millions, except EPS)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nYE 2017\nYE 2016\nGAAP net earnings (loss) attributable to PNM Resources\n($32.2)\n$16.0\n$71.9\n$76.9\nGAAP diluted EPS\n($0.40)\n$0.20\n$0.90\n$0.96\nOngoing net earnings\n$12.8\n$18.4\n$118.4\n$91.4\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$0.16\n$0.23\n$1.48\n$1.14\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, PNM's GAAP and ongoing earnings were reduced by higher planned outage costs at the Four Corners Power Plant and Afton Generating Station, lower load, higher expected operations and maintenance costs to support business operations and depreciation expense from new capital investments. These reductions were partially offset by new third-party transmission contracts and increased AFUDC. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 also include a $29.6 million net charge for the impacts of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate on net deferred income tax assets primarily related to items not in regulated rates, in addition to a $27.0 million pre-tax regulatory disallowance primarily resulting from the general rate case final order granting a debt-only return on certain investments in the Four Corners Power Plant.\nTNMP – an electric transmission and distribution utility in Texas.\nTNMP (In millions, except EPS)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nYE 2017\nYE 2016\nGAAP net earnings attributable to PNM Resources\n$1.0\n$9.9\n$35.6\n$41.7\nGAAP diluted EPS\n$0.01\n$0.12\n$0.44\n$0.52\nOngoing net earnings\n$8.9\n$10.0\n$43.4\n$42.5\nOngoing diluted EPS\n$0.11\n$0.12\n$0.54\n$0.53\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, TNMP's GAAP and ongoing earnings were reduced by higher expected operations and maintenance costs to support business operations, and increased depreciation and property tax expenses resulting from additional capital investments. This was partially offset by increased transmission rate relief. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 also reflect a $7.9 million net charge for the impacts of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate on net deferred income tax assets primarily related to items not in regulated rates.\nCorporate and Other – a segment that reflects the PNM Resources holding company and other subsidiaries.\nCorporate and Other (In millions, except EPS)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nYE 2017\nYE 2016\nGAAP net earnings (loss) attributable to PNM Resources\n($23.2)\n($1.0)\n($27.6)\n($1.7)\nGAAP diluted EPS\n($0.29)\n($0.01)\n($0.34)\n($0.02)\nOngoing net earnings (loss)\n($2.2)\n($1.0)\n($6.5)\n($1.4)\nOngoing diluted EPS\n($0.03)\n($0.01)\n($0.08)\n($0.02)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Corporate and Other's GAAP and ongoing earnings were reduced by additional interest expense primarily related to higher short-term interest rates and borrowings. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 also reflect a $20.0 million net charge for the impacts of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate on net deferred income tax assets.\nFinancial materials are available at http://www.pnmresources.com/investors/results.cfm .\nFOURTH QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL: 11 A.M.

Readers are cautioned that all forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and estimates. PNMR, PNM, and TNMP assume no obligation to update this information. Because actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. PNMR's, PNM's, and TNMP's business, financial condition, cash flow, and operating results are influenced by many factors, which are often beyond their control, that can cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of risk factors and other important factors affecting forward-looking statements, please see the Company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which factors are specifically incorporated by reference herein.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Ongoing earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized impairments on available-for-sale securities, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share (or ongoing diluted earnings per share) to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-4.\nPNM Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSchedule 1\nReconciliation of GAAP to Ongoing Earnings\n(Preliminary and
