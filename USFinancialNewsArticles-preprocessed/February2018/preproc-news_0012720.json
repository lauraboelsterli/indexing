    "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Level 10 Construction today announced the promotion of four individuals to leadership positions in the organization. Sarah Larson, Steve Spiering and John Bunje were all promoted from Sr. Project Managers to Project Executives. Rob Leming was promoted from Sr. Estimator to Preconstruction Executive. Level 10 also recently added four talented individuals to its leadership team from outside the organization: two Project Executives, Stephen Coates and Steve Flint; and two Preconstruction Executives, Bob Zarubin and Tony Alcocer.\n\"In seven years, Level 10 Construction has grown into a billion-dollar company,\" says Level 10 President Dennis Giles. \"We are constructing buildings, but this is essentially a people business. Level 10 has been successful because we have been able to hire and retain employees who share our mission of 'building at the highest level,' a philosophy that focuses on people, process, and progress. The eight individuals we've added to our leadership team have great technical abilities, but also strong 'soft skills,' which include motivating teams to achieve the highest standards of excellence and ensuring our clients' 100% satisfaction and repeat business.\"\nBelow are the individuals who recently joined Level 10's leadership team or were promoted from within the organization:\nIn Sunnyvale:\nProject Executive - Sarah Larson has been in the construction industry 16 years.
