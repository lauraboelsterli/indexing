Financial Measures\nIn addition to the selected financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), we monitor other non-GAAP financial measures to manage our business, make planning decisions, allocate resources and as performance measures in our executive compensation plan. These key financial measures provide an additional view of our operational performance over the long term and provide useful information regarding how cash is generated and utilized in order to maintain and grow our business.\nThese financial measures also provide useful information by eliminating the effect of certain non-cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as well as certain significant items that are not representative of our business operations such as our initial public offering (IPO) transaction costs. They enhance investors' ability to review our business from the same perspective as the management and facilitate consistent period to period comparisons by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance.\nThe presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is to enhance the understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. It is not meant to be considered in isolation, superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nDefinition\nHow We Use The Measure\nNet Service Revenues\n• Sum of professional service revenues and Net Insurance Service Revenues, or total revenues less insurance costs.\n• Provides a comparable basis of revenues on a net basis. Professional service revenues are represented net of client payroll costs whereas insurance service revenues are presented gross of insurance costs for financial reporting purposes.\n• Acts as the basis to allocate resources to different functions and evaluates the effectiveness of our business strategies by each business function,\n• Provides a measure, among others, used in the determination of incentive compensation for management.\nNet Insurance Service Revenues\n• Insurance revenues less insurance costs.\n• Is a component of Net Service Revenues.\n• Provides a comparable basis of revenues on a net basis. Professional service revenues are represented net of client payroll costs whereas insurance service revenues are presented gross of insurance costs for financial reporting purposes. Promotes an understanding of our insurance services business by evaluating insurance service revenues net of our WSE related costs which are substantially pass-through for the benefit of our WSEs. Under GAAP, insurance service revenues and costs are recorded gross as we have latitude in establishing the price, service and supplier specifications.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n• Net income, excluding the effects of:\n- income tax provision,\n- interest expense,\n- depreciation,\n- amortization of intangible assets, and\n- stock-based compensation expense\n• Provides period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis and an understanding as to how our management evaluates the effectiveness of our business strategies by excluding certain non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization that have fluctuated significantly over the past five years, and stock-based compensation recognized based on the estimated fair values. We believe these charges are not directly resulting from our core operations or indicative of our ongoing operations.\n• Enhances comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects.\n• Provides a measure, among others, used in the determination of incentive compensation for management.\nAdjusted Net Income\n• Net income, excluding the effects of:\n- effective income tax rate (1) ,\n- stock-based compensation,\n- amortization of intangible assets,\n- non-cash interest expense (2) ,\n- debt prepayment premium, and\n- the income tax effect (at our effective tax rate (1) ) of these pre-tax adjustments.\n• Provides information to our stockholders and board of directors to understand how our management evaluates our business, to monitor and evaluate our operating results, and analyze profitability of our ongoing operations and trends on a consistent basis by excluding certain non-cash charges as described above, debt payment premiums and our secondary offering costs as these are not directly resulting from our core operations or indicative of our ongoing operations.\n(1)\nAs a result of a decrease in state income taxes from an increase in excludable income for state income tax purposes, we have adjusted our non-GAAP effective tax rate to 41% for 2017 from 43% for 2016. These non-GAAP effective tax rates exclude the income tax impact from stock-based compensation and changes in uncertain tax positions.\n(2)\nNon-cash interest expense represents amortization and write-off of our debt issuance costs.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of total revenues to Net Service Revenues:\nThree Months Ended\nChange\nYear Ended\nChange\nDecember 31,\n2017 vs. 2016\nDecember 31,\n2017 vs. 2016\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n$\n%\n2017\n2016\n$\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n848\n$\n811\n$\n37\n5\n%\n$\n3,275\n$\n3,060\n$\n215\n7\n%\nLess: Insurance costs\n644\n638\n6\n1\n2,466\n2,414\n52\n2\nNet Service Revenues\n$\n204\n$\n173\n$\n31\n18\n%\n$\n809\n$\n646\n$\n163\n25\n%\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of insurance service revenues to Net Insurance Service Revenues:\nThree Months Ended\nChange\nYear Ended\nChange\nDecember 31,\n2017 vs. 2016\nDecember 31,\n2017 vs. 2016\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n$\n%\n2017\n2016\n$\n%\nInsurance service revenues\n$\n731\n$\n697\n$\n34\n5\n%\n$\n2,817\n$\n2,613\n$\n204\n8\n%\nLess: Insurance costs\n644\n638\n6\n1\n2,466\n2,414\n52\n2\nNet Insurance Service Revenues\n$\n87\n$\n59\n$\n28\n48\n%\n$\n351\n$\n199\n$\n152\n76\n%\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n66\n$\n23\n$\n178\n$\n61\nProvision for income taxes\n(22)\n15\n22\n43\nStock-based compensation\n11\n6\n32\n26\nInterest expense and bank fees\n5\n5\n20\n20\nDepreciation\n8\n6\n28\n19\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1\n1\n5\n16\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n69\n$\n56\n$\n285\n$\n185\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (1)\n34\n%\n33\n%\n35\n%\n29\n%\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Service Revenues.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share - diluted:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n66\n$\n23\n$\n178\n$\n61\nEffective income tax rate adjustment\n(40)\n(1)\n(59)\n(1)\nStock-based compensation\n11\n6\n32\n26\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1\n1\n5\n16\nNon-cash interest expense\n—\n1\n2\n4\nIncome tax impact of pre-tax adjustments\n(5)\n(3)\n(16)\n(19)\nAdjusted Net Income\n$\n33\n$\n27\n$\n142\n$\n87\nGAAP Weighted average shares of common stock - diluted\n72\n71\n71\n72\nAdjusted Net Income per share - diluted\n$\n0.46\n$\n0.38\n$\n1.99\n$\n1.20\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trinet-reports-fourth-quarter--fiscal-year-2017-results-300605149.html\nSOURCE TriNet Group, Inc.",
