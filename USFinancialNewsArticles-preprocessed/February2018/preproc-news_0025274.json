    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aberdeen Income Credit Strategies Fund (NYSE: ACP) (the \"Fund\"), a closed-end fund, announced today that it will pay a distribution of US $0.12 per share on February 27, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of February 20, 2018.\nIn January 2019, a Form 1099-DIV will be sent to shareholders, which will state the amount and composition of distributions and provide information with respect to their appropriate tax treatment for the 2018 calendar year.\nThe Fund is managed and advised by Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited. The Fund's shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol \"ACP\".\nThe Fund changed its name from Avenue Income Credit Strategies Fund to Aberdeen Income Credit Strategies Fund effective December 1, 2017. Commencing with this February 2018 distribution, the record date and payable date for the Fund will change. Each monthly distribution will be declared on the seventh business day and will be payable on or around the last business day of the month, with the exception of the December distribution, which will be declared on the seventh business day of December and will be payable in January.\nYou should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution.\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.\nIf you wish to receive this information electronically, please contact InvestorRelations@aberdeenstandard.com\nhttp://www.aberdeenacp.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aberdeen-income-credit-strategies-fund-announces-monthly-distribution-300596595.html\nSOURCE Aberdeen Income Credit Strategies Fund",
