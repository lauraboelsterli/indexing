    "text": "Mika Zibanejad scored a power-play goal with 7:19 remaining in the third period as the New York Rangers beat the Calgary Flames 4-3 on Friday night at Madison Square Garden in New York.\nZibanejad netted his 16th goal when he took a brilliant cross-ice pass from J.T. Miller. Left unattended on the left side of the crease, Zibanejad lifted a shot over Mike Smith to give the Rangers their third one-goal lead of the game.\nZibanejad’s tally occurred exactly six minutes after Rick Nash tied the game at 3-3 by tucking in a shot off the right post for his 17th goal of the season.\nKevin Hayes also scored a power-play goal for the Rangers while Michael Grabner tallied on even strength as New York improved to 9-1-1 in its last 11 meetings with the Flames and beat Calgary for the sixth straight time on home ice.\nHenrik Lundqvist made 21 of his 28 saves in the second period fir the Rangers after entering the game for Ondrej Pavelec, who exited after 20 minutes due to a knee injury.\nBrett Kulak, Curtis Lazar and Matthew Tkachuk scored for the Flames, who saw a three-game winning streak stopped.\nSmith made 32 saves in net for the Flames.\nThe Rangers took a 1-0 lead 7:53 into the game thanks to some persistence from Hayes during a power play. Smith stopped a tip-in attempt and two backhand tries from Hayes, but on the fourth shot, he lifted a wrist shot over Smith’s stick.\nCalgary tied the game with 1:45 remaining in the period when Kulak joined the rush, took a pass from Micheal Ferland and fired a slap shot inside the left post.\nThe Flames had a goal overturned 4:53 into the second period when officials ruled Lazar pushed Lundqvist into the crease during a scramble. Calgary used its coach’s challenge, and the call was not overturned.\nGrabner was credited with his 22nd goal with 8:08 remaining in the second when his cross-ice pass intended for Hayes went off Ferland’s stick and re-directed under Smith’s pads to give New York a 2-1 lead\nLazar tied it by taking a long pass from Ryan Lomberg, racing by defensemen Anthony DeAngelo and Nick Holden and chipping a loose puck under Lundqvist, who was indecisive in playing the puck near the crease.\nThe Flames took a 3-2 lead into the third when Tkachuk deflected Dougie Hamilton’s point shot over Lundqvist during a power play with 93 seconds left in the second period.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
