(NASDAQ Capital Market: MAMS) (the \"Company\" or \"MAM\"), a leading global provider of on-premise and cloud-based business management solutions for the auto parts, tire and vertical distribution industries, announced the following financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") for its second fiscal quarter and six months ended December 31, 2017, through the filing on February 8, 2018 of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission:\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Six Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet revenues\n$\n8,500\n$\n7,382\n$\n17,138\n$\n15,444\nGross profit\n$\n4,501\n$\n3,888\n$\n9,332\n$\n8,632\nOperating income\n$\n823\n$\n402\n$\n2,350\n$\n1,769\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n$\n714\n$\n280\n$\n2,137\n$\n1,527\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(79)\n$\n250\n$\n1,035\n$\n1,463\nEarnings (loss) per share attributed to common stockholders – basic\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.09\n$\n0.12\nEarnings (loss) per share attributed to common stockholders – diluted\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.02\n$\n0.09\n$\n0.12\nWeighted average shares outstanding – basic\n11,825\n11,716\n11,820\n11,709\nWeighted average shares outstanding – diluted\n11,825\n11,813\n12,151\n11,805\nMichael Jamieson, MAM's President and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"The second quarter was another quarter of continued progress with our large, complex development projects highlighted by the first 'go live' of VAST Online at a Goodyear dealer location, which was followed by two additional locations in early January. We are incorporating feedback from these initial locations and making adjustments as we select and prepare for implementation at subsequent locations. We continue to be encouraged by the growing number of identified, new business opportunities, yet remain focused on successfully delivering on current business under contract to ensure customer satisfaction and protect the investments we have made in product development.\"\n\"Our financial results for the quarter, and year-to-date, were in-line with our expectations and reflect the positive impact that reshaping our business to a service model has had both on our earnings and cash generation,\" continued Jamieson. \"Our balance sheet remains strong with an increasing cash balance and lower debt outstanding driven by nearly $3.1 million in cash generated from operations during the first six months of fiscal year 2018, an increase of more than 9% compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2017.\"\nSecond Quarter Highlights:\nNet revenues of $8.5 million were up 15.1% compared to $7.4 million for the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 10.3% over the same period last year. Recurring revenues were 85.4% of total revenues compared to 85.3% of total revenues for the same period in the prior fiscal year. Total Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues increased 29.7% year-over-year and 4.8% sequentially from the prior quarter. Operating income was $823,000, or 9.7% of revenues, compared to $402,000, or 5.4% of revenues, for the same period last year. Net loss was $79,000 compared to net income of $250,000 in the same period last year. The net loss included $729,000 of nonrecurring income tax expense from the implementation of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). Adjusted EBITDA* was $1.1 million, or 12.9% of revenues, compared to $642,000, or 8.7% of revenues, for the same period last year.\nSecond Quarter Financial Results:\nNet revenues were $8.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.4 million for the same period last year, an increase of $1.1 million or 15.1%.\nOn a constant currency basis, revenues were up 10.3% over the same period in the prior fiscal year. Recurring revenue for the quarter was $7.3 million, or 85.4% of total revenue, an increase of $963,000 or 15.3%, over $6.3 million, or 85.3% of total revenue, for the second quarter last year. Sequentially, recurring revenue increased $172,000, or 2.4%, compared to $7.1 million, or 82% of total revenue, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Total Software as a Service (SaaS) revenue for the quarter was $2.7 million, an increase of $619,000, or 29.7%, year-over-year and an increase of $124,000, or 4.8%, sequentially when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in the SaaS revenue was primarily attributable to a 21.4% increase in Autowork Online (SaaS) revenue for the quarter to $1.6 million, and a 42.8% increase in Autopart Online (SaaS) revenue for the quarter to $1.2 million. Total Data as a Service (DaaS) revenue for the quarter was $2.4 million, an increase of $222,000, or 10.4%, year over year, and $24,000, or 1%, sequentially when compared to the fiscal first quarter of 2018.\nGross profit for the quarter was $4.5 million, or 53.0% of total revenue, an increase of $613,000 compared to $3.9 million, or 52.7% of total revenue, for the same period last year.\nOperating expenses for the quarter increased by $192,000 to $3.7 million, an increase of 5.5% compared to $3.5 million for the same period last year. An increase in Research and Development expenses to support growth was partially offset by lower Sales and Marketing expenses.\nOperating income for the quarter increased by $421,000, or 104.7%, to $823,000 compared to $402,000 for the same period last year.\nOther expense for the quarter decreased by $13,000, or 10.7%, to $109,000 compared to $122,000 for the same period last year.\nProvision for income taxes increased to $0.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 111%, for the quarter, as compared to $30,000, or an effective tax rate of 11%, for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the nonrecurring impact from the implementation of the Tax Act that resulted in a write-down of our net US federal deferred tax assets to the lower statutory tax rate and one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the current quarter, and a partial release of our valuation allowance last year.\nNet loss for the quarter was $79,000, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $250,000, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. The net loss for the quarter included $729,000, or $(0.06) per basic and diluted share, of additional income tax expense from the impact of the Tax Act.\nYear-to-Date Financial Results:\nNet revenues were $17.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $15.4 million for the same period last year, an increase of $1.7 million, or 11.0%.\nOn a constant currency basis, revenues were up 8.8% over the same period in the prior fiscal year. Recurring revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $14.3 million, or 83.7% of total revenue, an increase of $1.6 million, or 12.9%, compared to $12.7 million, or 82.3% of total revenue, for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. Total Software as a Service (SaaS) revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $5.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 29.3%, year-over-year. The increase in the SaaS revenue was primarily attributable to a 22.8% increase in Autowork Online (SaaS) revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2018 to $3.1 million, and a 39.7% increase in Autopart Online (SaaS) revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2018 to $2.2 million. Total Data as a Service (DaaS) revenue for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $4.7 million, an increase of $294,000, or 6.7%, when compared to the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nGross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $9.3 million, or 54.5% of total revenue, an increase of $700,000 compared to $8.6 million, or 55.9% of total revenue, for the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nOperating expenses for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased by $119,000 to $7.0 million, an increase of 1.7% compared to $6.9 million for the same period last year. An increase in Research and Development expenses to support growth was partially offset by lower Sales and Marketing expenses.\nOperating income for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased by $581,000, or 32.8%, to $2.4 million, compared to $1.8 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nOther expense for the first six months of fiscal 2018 decreased by $29,000, or 12.0%, to $213,000, compared to $242,000 for the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nProvision for income taxes increased to $1.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 52%, for the first six months of fiscal 2018, as compared to $64,000, or an effective tax rate of 4%, for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the implementation of the Tax Act that resulted in a write-down of our net US federal deferred tax assets to the lower statutory tax rate and one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the current fiscal year, and a partial release of our valuation allowance last fiscal year.\nNet income for the first six months of fiscal year 2018 was $1 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. The net income for the first six months of fiscal year 2018 included $729,000, or $(0.06) per basic and diluted share, of additional income tax expense from the impact of the Tax Act.\nBalance Sheet and Other Financial Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $2.8 million in cash after capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs of $8.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $7.6 million of debt outstanding under its $11.5 million credit facility. Stockholders' equity increased 17.2% from $9.7 million at June 30, 2017 to $11.3 million at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, there were 12.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act significantly revises the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering U. S. corporate income tax rates and the imposition of a territorial tax system with a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a lower U.S. statutory federal rate, from the previously 34%, to a blended rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we were required to revalue our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate in the period of enactment; accordingly, we recorded additional income tax expense of $0.7 million, which consisted of $0.5 million related to the write-down our net U.S. federal deferred tax asset to the lower statutory tax rate and $0.2 million for the one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company reaffirmed its expectations for fiscal year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA* in the range of $5.5 million to $6.0 million, on a constant currency basis.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for Friday, February 9, 2018, at 9 a.m. ET to review the results.
