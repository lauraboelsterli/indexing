The S&P 500 gained 9.51 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,740.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.49 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,258.92.\nA 4.5-percent gain since Monday by MSCI’s all-country world index and Nasdaq’s 6-percent gain since then have both indexes on course for their strongest week since December 2011.\nInvestors are trying to determine whether the market is in an overdue correction or the beginning of something worse, Arone said.\n“It looks like this week they’re comfortable about uncertainty and the risks that are associated with it, and stocks are moving higher based on fundamentals,” he said.\nU.S. Treasury prices rose as investors bought back bonds after a sell-off earlier in the week as investor jitters over rising inflation raised the possibility the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates at a faster pace than expected this year.\nBorrowing costs across the euro area fell, though the prospect of higher inflation and a move toward tighter monetary policy from major central banks weighed on sentiment across world bond markets.\nShort-dated bond yields in Germany, the euro zone’s benchmark bond issuer, have risen by about 7 basis points this week and are set for their biggest weekly rise in eight weeks.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 4/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8768 percent.\nThe dollar rose on the day but remained on track to post its biggest weekly loss in nine months as negative sentiment offset any support the greenback had from higher Treasury yields.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.61 percent, with the euro down 0.77 percent to $1.2409. The Japanese yen weakened 0.22 percent versus the greenback at 106.37 per dollar.\nOil prices rose, as the rebound in the global equities market and the dollar’s recent weakness supported their recovery from last week’s slide.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery rose 34 cents to settle at $61.68 a barrel. Brent rose settled up 51 cents at $64.84.\nU.S. April gold futures settled up $0.9, or 0.1 percent, at $1,356.20 per ounce.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski\n ",
