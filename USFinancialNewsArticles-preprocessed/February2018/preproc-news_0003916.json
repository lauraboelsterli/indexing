    "text": "February 4, 2018 / 4:48 AM / Updated an hour ago Aubameyang promises more after goal-scoring Arsenal debut Reuters Staff 1   Arsenal’s new signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has fired a warning to their Premier League rivals saying he has much more to offer after scoring on his debut in the 5-1 win over Everton on Saturday. \nMidfielder Aaron Ramsey scored a hat-trick while goals from striker Aubameyang and defender Laurent Koscielny sealed the win in a game that saw an attack-minded Arsenal flex their muscles in the first half. \n“Is there more to come from me? I think so,” Aubameyang, who struck 37 minutes into his first game for the club after signing from Borussia Dortmund last week, said after the match. \n“We won the game in the first half and the second was a bit different. We are all happy today.” \nArsenal remain sixth in the league, three points adrift of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who visit Liverpool on Sunday.   editing by Amlan Chakraborty",
