    "text": "NORTHLAKE, Texas, Feb. 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmer Bros. Co. (NASDAQ:FARM) (the \"Company\") today reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights:\nVolume of green coffee processed and sold increased by 4.6 million pounds, reaching 29.1 million pounds, an 18.7% increase over the prior year period; Gross profit increased $10.4 million to $65.5 million and gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 39.1% over the prior year period; Net loss was $18.8 million compared to net income of $20.1 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA was $12.9 million compared to $11.2 million in the prior year period;* SQF certification of new Northlake, Texas facility remains on track to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, with annual run-rate production levels of six million pounds expected by end of the fiscal year; Completed acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Boyd Coffee Company (“Boyd”) and began executing integration plan; and Deployed Smart Touch selling platform to over half of our routes, with complete deployment expected by the end of fiscal 2018.\n(*Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is reconciled to its corresponding GAAP measure at the end of this press release.)\nMike Keown, President and CEO stated, “We are pleased to have completed our acquisition of the Boyd business in October, which helped drive our volume and net sales in the second quarter. In addition to continuing to win new national accounts and modernizing our DSD channel-based sales strategy, we have significantly strengthened our platform for growth through our acquisitions of Boyd, West Coast Coffee and China Mist. We are expanding our distribution network, adding to our customer base and exploring new product categories, all of which help to position us for increasing production volumes through our existing roasting facilities. Looking forward, we remain confident in the Company’s growth potential and competitive position in the marketplace.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results:\nSelected Financial Data\nThe selected financial data presented below under the captions “Income statement data,” “Operating data” and “Balance sheet and other data” summarizes certain performance measures for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (unaudited).\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands, except per share data) Income statement data: Net sales $ 167,366 $ 139,025 $ 299,079 $ 269,513 Gross margin 39.1 % 39.6 % 38.3 % 39.4 % Income from operations $ 2,442 $ 35,910 $ 1,184 $ 38,415 Net (loss) income $ (18,768 ) $ 20,076 $ (19,746 ) $ 21,694 Net (loss) income per common share available to common stockholders—diluted $ (1.13 ) $ 1.20 $ (1.19 ) $ 1.30 Operating data: Coffee pounds 29,086 24,505 52,301 47,819 Non-GAAP net (loss) income $ (18,219 ) $ 2,011 $ (17,543 ) $ 5,398 Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share $ (1.09 ) $ 0.12 $ (1.05 ) $ 0.32 EBITDA $ 11,080 $ 39,091 $ 17,168 $ 47,192 EBITDA Margin 6.6 % 28.1 % 5.7 % 17.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 12,904 $ 11,153 $ 22,233 $ 22,165 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 7.7 % 8.0 % 7.4 % 8.2 % Balance sheet and other data: Capital expenditures excluding new facility $ 7,247 $ 10,124 $ 11,757 $ 13,359 Total capital expenditures $ 8,474 $ 24,097 $ 16,249 $ 48,647 Depreciation and amortization expense $ 8,077 $ 5,075 $ 15,330 $ 10,086 Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures; a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.\nVolume of green coffee processed and sold increased 18.7% for the quarter, with volume associated with the Boyd business acquired in October 2017 contributing approximately 16.5% of this total volume.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, green coffee pounds processed and sold through our DSD network were 9.9. million, or 34.0%, of total green coffee pounds processed and sold, while Direct Ship customers represented 18.7 million pounds, or 64.3%, of total green coffee pounds processed and sold. Distributor customers represented 0.5 million pounds, or 1.7%, of total green coffee pounds processed and sold.\nNet sales were $167.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 20.4%, or $28.4 million, over the prior year period. This increase compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by a $17.6 million increase in net sales of roast and ground coffee products, a $5.5 million increase in net sales of other beverages, a $3.7 million increase in net sales of culinary products, and a $0.8 million increase in net sales of frozen liquid coffee. These changes were primarily due to the addition of the Boyd business, which contributed $26.3 million to net sales, as well as the benefit of higher prices to our cost plus customers due to higher hedged cost of green coffee in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period.\nGross profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $10.4 million, or 18.9%, to $65.5 million from $55.1 million, and gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 39.1% from 39.6% in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the addition of the Boyd business. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the addition of the Boyd business carrying a slightly lower gross margin, higher manufacturing costs associated with the production operations in the our new Northlake, Texas facility, and the absence of the beneficial effect of the liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities in the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nOperating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $43.9 million, or 228.8%, to $63.1 million, or 37.7% of net sales, from $19.2 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses during the period was primarily due to the effect of the recognition of $37.4 million in net gain from the sale of the Torrance facility in the three months ended December 31, 2016, as well as a $10.2 million increase in selling expenses and a $0.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a $3.8 million decrease in restructuring and other transition expenses associated with the corporate relocation plan compared to the prior year period. The increases in selling expenses and general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were primarily driven by the addition of the Boyd business and West Coast Coffee which added approximately $9.4 million to operating expenses exclusive of their related depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration costs of $1.0 million, and an increase of $1.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by the absence of $3.7 million in non-recurring 2016 proxy contest expenses incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, income from operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.4 million, as compared to $35.9 million in the prior year period.\nTotal other expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.3 million, as compared to $2.4 million in the prior year period, a decrease of $2.1 million, primarily due to the liquidation of substantially all of our preferred stock portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to fund expenditures associated with our new facility, and lower mark-to-market losses on coffee-related derivative instruments, offset by higher interest expense due to an increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net losses on coffee-related derivative instruments were $0.2 million compared to net losses of $1.2 million in the same period of the prior year.\nIncome tax expense was $20.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $13.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of incremental tax expense related to the reduction in net deferred tax balances to reflect the reduction in our estimated annual effective tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effective December 22, 2017.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net loss was $18.8 million, or $1.13 per common share available to common stockholders, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to net income of $20.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted common share available to common stockholders, in the prior year period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nNon-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures; a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude acquisition and integration costs. Acquisition and integration costs include legal expenses, consulting expenses and internal costs associated with acquisitions and integration of those acquisitions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 acquisition and integration costs were significant and, we believe, excluding them will help investors to better understand our operating results and more accurately compare them across periods. We have not adjusted the historical presentation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because acquisition and integration costs in prior periods were not material to the Company’s results of operations.\nNon-GAAP net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $18.2 million, as compared to Non-GAAP net income of $2.0 million in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP net loss per diluted common share was $1.09 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to Non-GAAP net income per diluted common share of $0.12 in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $12.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to $11.2 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 7.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to 8.0% in the prior year period.\nAbout Farmer Bros.

net gains and losses from sales of assets; non-cash income tax expense (benefit), including the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses; non-cash interest expense accrued on the Torrance facility sale-leaseback financing obligation; acquisition and integration costs;\nand including the impact of:\nincome taxes on non-GAAP adjustments.\n“Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share” is defined as Non-GAAP net (loss) income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, inclusive of the dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.\n“EBITDA” is defined as net (loss) income excluding the impact of:\nincome taxes; interest expense; and depreciation and amortization expense.\n“EBITDA Margin” is defined as EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net (loss) income excluding the impact of:\nincome taxes; interest expense; (loss) income from short-term investments; depreciation and amortization expense; ESOP and share-based compensation expense; non-cash impairment losses; non-cash pension withdrawal expense; other similar non-cash expenses; restructuring and other transition expenses; net gains and losses from sales of assets; non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses; and acquisition and integration costs.\n“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales.\nRestructuring and other transition expenses are expenses that are directly attributable to (i) the corporate relocation plan, consisting primarily of employee retention and separation benefits, facility-related costs and other related costs such as travel, legal, consulting and other professional services; and (ii) beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the DSD restructuring plan, consisting primarily of severance, prorated bonuses for bonus eligible employees, contractual termination payments and outplacement services, and other related costs, including legal, recruiting, consulting, other professional services, and travel.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income and Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share (i) to exclude non-recurring expenses for legal and other professional services incurred in connection with the 2016 proxy contest that were in excess of the level of expenses normally incurred for an annual meeting of stockholders (\"2016 proxy contest-related expenses\") and non-cash interest expense accrued on the Torrance facility sale-leaseback financing obligation which has been included in the computation of the gain on sale upon conclusion of the leaseback arrangement, and (ii) to include income tax expense (benefit) on the non-GAAP adjustments based on the Company’s applicable marginal tax rate. We also modified Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude 2016 proxy contest-related expenses. These modifications to our non-GAAP financial measures were made because such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing operating results and adjusting for them will help investors with comparability of our results.\nBeginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and for all periods presented, we include EBITDA in our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and EBITDA Margin because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use these measures internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\nBeginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude (loss) income from our short-term investments because we believe excluding (loss) income generated from our investment portfolio is a measure more reflective of our operating results. The historical presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin was recast to be comparable to the current period presentation.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the calculation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to exclude acquisition and integration costs. Acquisition and integration costs include legal expenses, consulting expenses and internal costs associated with acquisitions and integration of those acquisitions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 acquisition and integration costs were significant and, we believe, excluding them will help investors to better understand our operating results and more accurately compare them across periods. We have not adjusted the historical presentation of Non-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because acquisition and integration costs in prior periods were not material to the Company’s results of operations.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company's ongoing operating performance. Further, management utilizes these measures, in addition to GAAP measures, when evaluating and comparing the Company's operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets.\nNon-GAAP net (loss) income, Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We do not intend for non-GAAP financial measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income to Non-GAAP net (loss) income and reported net (loss) income per common share—diluted to Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income, as reported $ (18,768 ) $ 20,076 $ (19,746 ) $ 21,694 Restructuring and other transition expenses 139 3,965 259 6,995 Net gain from sale of Torrance facility — (37,449 ) — (37,449 ) Net gains from sale of spice assets (395 ) (334 ) (545 ) (492 ) Net losses (gains) from sales of other assets 91 114 144 (1,439 ) Non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses — 3,719 — 4,990 Interest expense on sale-leaseback financing obligation — 371 — 681 Acquisition and integration costs 972 — 3,382 — Income tax (benefit) expense on non-GAAP adjustments (258 ) 11,549 (1,037 ) 10,418 Non-GAAP net (loss) income $ (18,219 ) $ 2,011 $ (17,543 ) $ 5,398 Net (loss) income per common share—diluted, as reported $ (1.12 ) $ 1.20 $ (1.18 ) $ 1.30 Impact of restructuring and other transition expenses $ 0.01 $ 0.24 $ 0.02 $ 0.42 Impact of net gain from sale of Torrance facility $ — $ (2.24 ) $ — $ (2.24 ) Impact of net gains from sale of spice assets $ (0.02 ) $ (0.02 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.03 ) Impact of net losses (gains) from sales of other assets $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ (0.09 ) Impact of non-recurring 2016 proxy contest-related expenses $ — $ 0.22 $ — $ 0.30 Impact of interest expense on sale-leaseback financing obligation $ — $ 0.02 $ — $ 0.04 Impact of acquisition and integration costs $ 0.06 $ — $ 0.20 $ — Impact of income tax (benefit) expense on non-GAAP adjustments $ (0.02 ) $ 0.69 $ (0.06 ) $ 0.62 Non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted common share $ (1.09 ) $ 0.12 $ (1.05 ) $ 0.32 Set forth below is a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income to EBITDA (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income, as reported $ (18,768 ) $ 20,076 $ (19,746 ) $ 21,694 Income tax expense 20,910 13,416 20,200 14,499 Interest expense 861 524 1,384 913 Depreciation and amortization expense 8,077 5,075 15,330 10,086 EBITDA $ 11,080 $ 39,091 $ 17,168 $ 47,192 EBITDA Margin 6.6 % 28.1 % 5.7 % 17.5 % Set forth below is a reconciliation of reported net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income, as reported $ (18,768 ) $ 20,076 $ (19,746 ) $ 21,694 Income tax expense 20,910 13,416 20,200 14,499 Interest expense 861 524 1,384 913 (Income) loss from short-term investments (21 ) 895 (19 ) 274 Depreciation and amortization expense 8,077 5,075 15,330 10,086 ESOP and share-based compensation expense 1,038 1,152 1,844 2,094 Restructuring and other transition expenses 139 3,965 259 6,995 Net gain from sale of Torrance facility — (37,449 ) — (37,449 ) Net gains from sale of spice assets (395 ) (334 ) (545 ) (492 ) Net losses (gains) from sales of other assets 91 114 144 (1,439 ) Non-recurring proxy contest-related expenses — 3,719 — 4,990 Acquisition and integration costs 972 — 3,382 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 12,904 $ 11,153 $ 22,233 $ 22,165 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 7.7 % 8.0 % 7.4 % 8.2 % Investor Contact:\nJean Young\nThe Piacente Group, Inc.\n212-481-2050\nfarmerbros@tpg-ir.com\nSource:Farmer Bros.
