    "text": "RABAT, Morocco (AP) — Uber is pulling out of Morocco — a decision the San Francisco-headquartered company says is linked to the North African country's failure to reform its strict transport rules.\nFor nearly three years, Uber has been operating illegally in Morocco — despite currently having 19,000 users in the country and over 300 drivers.\nIn a statement Uber said \"as long as there is no real reform ... we are forced to suspend our operations.\"\nUber drivers have often been targets of intimidation.\nVideos have captured Uber drivers in Casablanca surrounded by regular taxi drivers, awaiting the authorities, and in some instances the clashes have become violent.\nBouchaib Abdel Moughit of Casablanca's Taxi Union voiced relief at Uber's departure: \"For three years, they stole our living. The competition was unfair.\"",
