Total U.S. household debt was $13.15 trillion in the three months to December, up $193 billion from the prior three months. Debt levels were $402 billion higher than during the fourth quarter of 2016. The proportion of overall debt that was 90 days delinquent or more fell slightly to 2.3 percent from 2.4 percent.
