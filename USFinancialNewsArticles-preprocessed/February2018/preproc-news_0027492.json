    "text": "BUDAPEST, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Hungaryâ€™s future is strongly linked to capital-intensive economic growth, National Bank of Hungary managing director Barnabas Virag told a central bank conference on Monday.\nVirag, who is not a rate setter, also said Hungary would have to improve its competitiveness with higher spending on research and development.\nCompanies across eastern Europe are ramping up investment in automation to cope with a labour shortage that started after the 2008 financial crisis. The changes indicate a shift in the labour-intensive model of the former Communist satellite states, which have attracted foreign investment with tax incentives and labour costs that pale in comparison to those in the West.
