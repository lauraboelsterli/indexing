    "text": "ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Holzer & Holzer, LLC announces that it has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors in MiMedx Group Inc. (“MiMedx” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MDXG) who purchased MiMedx shares between March 7, 2013 and February 19, 2018. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.\nThe complaint alleges that MiMedx failed to disclose that the Company was engaged in a “channel-stuffing” scheme designed to inappropriately recognize revenue that had not yet been realized and, as a result, the Company’s financial statements were inaccurate and misleading.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 24, 2018 . If you wish to discuss your legal rights, you are encouraged to contact Corey D. Holzer, Esq. at cholzer@holzerlaw.com or by toll-free telephone at (888) 508-6832.
