    "text": "Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google \nAlphabet stock tanked more than 5% after it reported disappointing Q4 earnings, missing Wall Street expectations on the bottom line but beating on revenue estimates. Earnings per share: $9.70 vs $9.98 expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $32.32 billion vs $31.86 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \nAlphabet's overall revenues increased 24% year-over-year, driven by Google's swelling ads business, which posted $27.27 billion in revenue in Q4. \nAlphabet also announced that John Hennessy will be the company's new chairman. He's been a board member since 2004. \nGoogle's ads were getting clicked more than Wall Street expected year-over-year, and its cost per click, or how much advertisers pay, decreased just about in line with what was expected. Aggregate paid clicks : 43 percent increase year-over-year vs increase of 42.1 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates CPC : 14 percent year-over-year decline vs decline of 14.6 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates \nAlphabet breaks out the revenues and income for both Google and its \"Other Bets,\" like smart-home hardware maker Nest and healthcare company Verily. But it's Google's advertising business that still pumps out the profits. \nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates. Jillian D'Onfro Technology Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities ",
