Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter amounted to RMB60.0 million ($9.2 million), up 27.6% from RMB47.0 million in the prior year period.

General and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased to RMB56.9 million ($8.7 million) from RMB50.6 million in the prior year period as a result of higher share-based compensation expenses and account receivables write-off.

Simultaneously, Mr. Yuen Kam resigned from his positions as Chairman and director of the Board and as Chairman and member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the \"Nominating Committee\") of the Company, effective as of January 31, 2018. Following Mr. Kam's resignation, Ms. Ting Zheng, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, was appointed as the Chairperson of the Board and the Chairperson of the Nominating Committee. Mr. Mark Chen, one of the Company's existing independent non-executive directors, also joined as a new member of the Nominating Committee. On February 7, 2018, the Company announced that the Board had approved seeking shareholder approval regarding the change of the Company name from \"China Cord Blood Corporation\" to \"Global Cord Blood Corporation\" to better reflect the future development direction and business strategy of the Company. The Company plans to hold an extraordinary general meeting (\"EGM\") for shareholders to approve the name change at its Hong Kong office on 48/F, Bank of China Tower, 1 Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong, at 8:00 p.m. Hong Kong Time on March 16, 2018 (8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Daylight Time on March 16, 2018).

The Company reclassified 4,598 and 5,128 private cord blood units as donated cord blood units during the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2017 after the Company determined that the recoverability of these prior private cord blood banking subscribers was low. Therefore, the Company terminated their subscription services according to the subscription contracts and these units are being treated as if they were donated cord blood units and will be part of the Company's non-current inventories. Hence, the net accumulated subscriber base was 640,311 as of December 31, 2017.\n2 See exhibit 3 of this press release for a reconciliation of operating income to exclude the non-cash items related to the depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses to the comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\").\n3 The reported operating income for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 included the following:\n(i) Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 were RMB12.7 million and RMB12.7 million ($1.9 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 were RMB37.8 million and RMB37.8 million ($5.8 million); and\n(ii) As of December 31, 2017, a total of 7,300,000 restricted share units (\"RSU\") were issued and outstanding under the Company's RSU scheme, subject to certain performance conditions. Share-based compensation expenses related to this RSU scheme were RMB15.9 million and RMB19.8 million ($3.0 million) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. Share-based compensation expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 were RMB46.5 million and RMB36.4 million ($5.6 million).\n4 Out of 7,300,000 RSUs issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 7,080,000 ordinary shares (\"Shares\") were then issued and deposited into a trust sponsored and funded by the Company (\"Trust\"), and will be transferred to respective executives, directors and key employees (or their designated nominees) under the Company's RSU scheme when the performance conditions are met. The Trust facilitates the granting (and subsequent vesting) of incentive RSUs and holds such Shares for the benefit of such executives, directors and key employees as a class. Taking into account of such Shares, in addition to 113,524,742 outstanding shares (73,003,248 outstanding shares for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2016), basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share would be RMB0.67 and RMB0.58 ($0.09) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, and RMB1.07 and RMB1.73 ($0.27) for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGAAP results for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2017 include non-cash items related to the depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses. To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on U.S. GAAP basis, the Company has provided adjusted financial information excluding the impact of these items in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measure represents non-GAAP operating income. Such adjustment is a departure of U.S. GAAP; however, the Company's management believes that these adjusted measures provide investors with a better understanding of how the results relate to the Company's historical performance. Also, management uses non-GAAP operating income as a measurement tool for evaluating actual operating performance compared to budget and prior periods. These adjusted measures should not be considered an alternative to operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures are not necessarily comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company. A reconciliation of the adjustments to U.S. GAAP results appears in exhibit 3 accompanying this press release. This additional adjusted information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP financials. The adjusted financial information that the Company provides also may differ from the adjusted information provided by other companies.\nAbout China Cord Blood Corporation\nChina Cord Blood Corporation is the first and largest umbilical cord blood banking operator in China in terms of geographical coverage and the only cord blood banking operator with multiple licenses.
