    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Bolstered by substantial gains in earnings, record levels of capital and assets under management (AuM) and continuing its decade of industry-leading sales growth, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) today announced strong financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nMassMutual's net gain from operations before policyowner dividends and taxes – its primary earnings measure as a mutual company – rose 18 percent, to $1.85 billion in 2017. This increase, along with a doubling of the company's net income to $137 million, can be primarily attributed to a significant rise in net investment income and favorable underwriting experience. The company also enhanced its financial strength with record levels of statutory surplus and total adjusted capital, $15.7 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively 1 .\nAdditionally, MassMutual continued its industry-leading life insurance sales momentum, showing increased demand for its solutions to meet the needs of a growing number of underinsured Americans. Sales of whole life insurance 2 reached $678 million, an increase of more than $20 million, marking the 12th consecutive year of record sales, continuing a growth rate that has outpaced the industry over the past decade, and solidifying MassMutual's position as the number-one writer of whole life insurance in the U.S. 3 Further, total sales 2 of life insurance were $752 million, up from more than $710 million last year, bringing the overall amount of life insurance protection the company provides to nearly $670 billion.\nMassMutual also had strong contributions from its workplace and institutional businesses, which combined to post more than $20 billion in sales, up 13 percent, reflecting significant growth in its workplace whole life, defined contribution investment only and defined benefit products.\n\"Fueled by a surging market performance and an improving global economy, MassMutual maintained its unwavering focus on serving its policyowners and customers, which drove our exceptional financial results in 2017,\" said Roger Crandall, MassMutual Chairman, President and CEO. \"Our diverse mix of high-performing businesses, outstanding financial strength, expanded advisor force and ongoing investments in enhancing our digital experience, all enabled us to reach more Americans in greater numbers last year, helping them secure their future and protect the ones they love.\"\nThe strong performance of the company's domestic and international insurance, workplace and institutional businesses, as well as its global asset management firms – OppenheimerFunds, Inc. and Barings – amid favorable market conditions drove AuM to a record $771 billion 4 , up from $675 billion in 2016, while premium and other deposits rose 33 percent, to $58.9 billion.\nMassMutual's ability to provide value to its policyowners and customers and deliver on its commitments was further exemplified by more than $5 billion in benefits delivered in 2017, and its announcement of an estimated 2018 dividend payout of $1.6 billion to eligible participating policyowners – the 150 th consecutive year the company will be paying a dividend 5 .\n\"Our 2017 results reflect the strong operating fundamentals across MassMutual's businesses, as well as our ability to successfully execute our strategy,\" said Elizabeth Ward, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Actuary of MassMutual. \"Our long-term prudent investment approach enables MassMutual to not only endure domestic and global market fluctuations, but also positions us to consistently pay a competitive dividend and sustain among the highest financial ratings of any company in any industry 6 .\"\nCapping MassMutual's successful financial results in 2017, the company earned several accolades highlighting its commitment to diversity and inclusion, ethical leadership and excellent customer service.
