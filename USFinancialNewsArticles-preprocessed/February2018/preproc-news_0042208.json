(Nasdaq:NYMT) (“NYMT,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) today reported results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nSummary of Fourth Quarter 2017:\nNet income attributable to common stockholders of $24.6 million, or $0.22 per share (basic), and comprehensive income to common stockholders of $21.0 million, or $0.19 per share.

Purchased Agency-fixed rate RMBS for a gross purchase price of approximately $788.7 million. Declared fourth quarter dividend of $0.20 per common share that was paid on January 25, 2018.\nHighlights for Full Year 2017:\nNet income attributable to common stockholders in 2017 of $76.3 million, or $0.68 per share (basic). Net interest income of $58.0 million and portfolio net interest margin of 273 basis points. Delivered economic return of 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Declared aggregate 2017 dividends of $0.80 per common share. Issued $138.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes in a public offering resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $127.0 million. Purchased CMBS securities, including two first loss PO securities issued by Freddie Mac-sponsored multi-family K-Series securitizations, for an aggregate gross purchase price of approximately $171.2 million. Funded in aggregate $60.3 million of preferred equity investments in owners of multi-family properties. Sold distressed residential mortgage loans for aggregate proceeds of approximately $179.7 million resulting in a net realized gain, before income taxes, of approximately $28.0 million.\nManagement Overview\nSteven Mumma, NYMT's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “the Company had a good fourth quarter, generating $24.6 million in net income and delivering a 2.5% economic return. We benefited from continued credit spread tightening in our multi-family portfolio and solid execution in our distressed residential loan portfolio. The improved changes in credit spreads increased the valuation on our multi-family CMBS by $13.7 million, while our distressed residential loan strategy generated $6.2 million of realized gains on sales, before taxes, for the quarter, bringing the distressed residential loan portfolio’s contribution for the year to $28.0 million, up $11.3 million from the previous year.\nIn October, the Company completed a $135 million offering of its Series D Preferred Stock, which we believe will be accretive to our common stockholders. We invested approximately $52.3 million of the offering proceeds in structured multi-family property investments, with the balance of the proceeds invested in our Agency RMBS strategy. The Company was able to purchase a Freddie Mac K-Series first loss PO security and certain related IO securities for approximately $36.7 million in October, even though competition for credit assets continued to be very competitive. This is the second Freddie Mac K-Series investment we completed this year, bringing our 2017 investments in these securities to $102.1 million. The Company also expanded investment in its second lien program during the quarter, adding approximately $11.3 million of new loans. As mortgage rates rise, we expect this volume to increase further.\nWe expect to begin a non-QM first lien program during the first half of this year. We believe both the first lien non-QM and second lien programs will deliver more attractive returns in the current interest rate environment. The Company has approximately 78% of its capital allocated to credit strategies, which we believe will enable us to better manage the current interest rate environment. The Company is well positioned with liquidity and capital to continue to build its credit strategy into 2018.”\nCapital Allocation\nThe following tables set forth our allocated capital by investment type at December 31, 2017, our interest income and interest expense by investment type, and the weighted average yield, average cost of funds and portfolio net interest margin for our average interest earning assets (by investment type) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nCapital Allocation at December 31, 2017: Agency\nRMBS (1) Multi-\nFamily (2) Distressed\nResidential (3) Other (4) Total Carrying Value $ 1,169,535\n$ 816,805 $ 474,128 $ 140,325 $ 2,600,793 Liabilities Callable (928,823 ) (309,935 ) (161,277 ) (25,946 ) (1,425,981 ) Non-Callable — (29,164 ) (52,373 ) (115,308 ) (196,845 ) Convertible — — — (128,749 ) (128,749 ) Hedges (Net) (5) 10,763 — — — 10,763 Cash (6) 12,365 2,145 9,615 81,407 105,532 Goodwill — — — 25,222 25,222 Other 961 (4,651 ) 15,673 (26,717 ) (14,734 ) Net Capital Allocated $ 264,801 $ 475,200 $ 285,766 $ (49,766 ) $ 976,001 % of Capital Allocated 27.1 % 48.7 % 29.3 % (5.1 )% 100.0 % Net Interest Income- Three Months Ended December 31, 2017: Interest Income $ 6,083 $ 16,570 $ 4,424 $ 1,432 $ 28,509 Interest Expense (3,352 ) (3,358 ) (2,737 ) (4,022 ) (13,469 ) Net Interest Income (Expense) $ 2,731 $ 13,212 $ 1,687 $ (2,590 ) $ 15,040 Portfolio Net Interest Margin - Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Average Interest Earning Assets (7) $ 971,707 $ 596,701 $ 480,711 $ 126,447 $ 2,175,566 Weighted Average Yield on Interest Earning Assets (8) 2.50 % 11.11 % 3.68 % 4.53 % 5.24 % Less: Average Cost of Funds (9) (1.68 )% (4.49 )% (4.56 )% (3.22 )% (2.85 )% Portfolio Net Interest Margin (10) 0.82 % 6.62 % (0.88 )% 1.31 % 2.39 % (1) Includes Agency fixed-rate RMBS, Agency ARMs and Agency IOs.\n(2) The Company, through its ownership of certain securities, has determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Consolidated K-Series and has consolidated the Consolidated K-Series into the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Interest income amounts represent interest income earned by securities that are actually owned by the Company. A reconciliation of net capital allocated to and net interest income from multi-family investments is included below in “Additional Information.”\n(3) Includes $331.5 million of distressed residential mortgage loans, $36.9 million of distressed residential mortgage loans, at fair value and $101.9 million of Non-Agency RMBS.\n(4) Other includes $73.8 million of residential mortgage loans held in securitization trusts, $50.2 million of residential second mortgages, at fair value, $12.6 million of investments in unconsolidated entities and $3.5 million of mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage loans held for investment.

These deposits are included in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets in receivables and other assets.\n(7) Our Average Interest Earning Assets is calculated each quarter based on daily average amortized cost.\n(8) Our Weighted Average Yield on Interest Earning Assets was calculated by dividing our annualized interest income for the quarter by our Average Interest Earning Assets for the quarter.\n(9) Our Average Cost of Funds was calculated by dividing our annualized interest expense for the quarter by our average interest bearing liabilities, excluding our subordinated debentures and convertible notes, which generated interest expense of approximately $0.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the quarter. Our Average Cost of Funds includes interest expense on our interest rate swaps and amortization of premium on our swaptions.\n(10) Portfolio Net Interest Margin is the difference between our Weighted Average Yield on Interest Earning Assets and our Average Cost of Funds, excluding the weighted average cost of subordinated debentures and convertible notes.\nPrepayment History\nThe following table sets forth the actual constant prepayment rates (“CPR”) for selected asset classes, by quarter, for the quarterly periods indicated.\nQuarter Ended Agency\nFixed-Rate\nRMBS Agency\nARMs Agency\nIOs Residential\nSecuritizations December 31, 2017 6.3 % 12.9 % 17.8 % 22.1 % September 30, 2017 12.8 % 9.4 % 17.4 % 18.2 % June 30, 2017 9.6 % 16.5 % 17.5 % 16.8 % March 31, 2017 10.6 % 8.3 % 15.9 % 5.1 % December 31, 2016 12.3 % 21.7 % 19.4 % 11.1 % September 30, 2016 10.0 % 20.7 % 18.2 % 15.9 % June 30, 2016 10.2 % 17.6 % 15.6 % 17.8 % March 31, 2016 7.9 % 13.5 % 14.7 % 14.8 % Fourth Quarter Earnings Summary\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $24.6 million as compared to $24.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nWe generated net interest income of $15.0 million and a portfolio net interest margin of 239 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net interest income of $13.3 million and a portfolio net interest margin of 281 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The $1.7 million increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by an increase in average interest earning assets in our Agency RMBS and multi-family portfolios funded, in substantial part, by capital raised in our Series D Preferred Stock offering in October 2017. Our net interest margin decreased 42 basis points due primarily to an increase in the portion of our interest earning assets that are invested in Agency RMBS and a decline in net margin generated by our distressed residential portfolio.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recognized other income of $25.2 million as compared to other income of $24.9 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The increase in other income of $0.3 million is primarily driven by:\nAn increase in net unrealized gains on multi-family loans and debt held in securitization trusts of $11.3 million primarily due to tightening of credit spreads on our multi-family CMBS acquired during the year. A decrease in realized gains on investment securities and related hedges of $4.1 million due to reduced CMBS sales. A decrease in other income of $5.4 million, which is primarily due to income recognized from redemptions/payoffs of joint venture investments and a mezzanine loan during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 that was not replicated during the fourth quarter. A decrease in realized gains on distressed residential mortgage loans of $1.7 million resulting from lower sales activity during the fourth quarter.\nThe following table details the general and administrative expenses for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended General and Administrative Expenses December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 Salaries, benefits and directors’ compensation $ 2,415 $ 2,456 Base management and incentive fees 163 1,386 Other general and administrative expenses 1,747 1,786 Total general and administrative expenses $ 4,325 $ 5,628 The decrease in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter can be primarily attributed to a decrease in incentive fee expense on our distressed residential loan strategy due to lower sales activity during the fourth quarter.\nThe following table details the operating expenses related to our distressed residential mortgage loans and the operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Operating Expenses December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 Expenses related to distressed residential mortgage loans $ 2,064 $ 2,225 Expenses related to operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities 1,899 3,143 Total operating expenses $ 3,963 $ 5,368 During the third quarter of 2017, one of the multi-family apartment properties that are consolidated in the Company's financial statements in accordance with GAAP was reclassified from operating real estate held in consolidated variable interest entities to real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities. Accordingly, no depreciation and amortization expense was recognized in the fourth quarter, contributing to the decrease in total operating expenses of $1.4 million.\nThe results of operations applicable to the operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 are as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities $ 2,535 Expenses related to operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities (1,899 ) Net income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities 636 Net income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities attributable to non-controlling interest (238 ) Net income from operating real estate and real estate held for sale in consolidated variable interest entities attributable to Company's common stockholders $ 398 Analysis of Changes in Book Value\nThe following table analyzes the changes in book value of our common stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (amounts in thousands, except per share):\nQuarter Ended December 31, 2017 Amount Shares Per Share (1) Beginning Balance $ 677,053 111,854 $ 6.05 Common stock issuance, net 717 56 Preferred stock issuance, net 130,496 Preferred stock liquidation preference (135,000 ) Balance after share issuance activity 673,266 111,910 6.01 Dividends declared (22,382 ) (0.20 ) Net change in accumulated other comprehensive income: Hedges (19 ) — Investment securities (3,632 ) (0.03 ) Net income attributable to Company's common stockholders 24,632 0.22 Ending Balance $ 671,865 111,910 $ 6.00 (1) Outstanding shares used to calculate book value per share for the ending balance is based on outstanding shares as of December 31, 2017 of 111,909,909.\nConference Call\nOn Wednesday, February 21, 2018 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, New York Mortgage Trust's executive management is scheduled to host a conference call and audio webcast to discuss the Company’s financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.
