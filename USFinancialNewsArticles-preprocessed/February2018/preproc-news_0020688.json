(NYSE:NEWR), provider of real-time insights for software-driven businesses , today announced financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“In the third quarter, we achieved some fantastic milestones as we reduced our GAAP operating loss to $(8.0) million and achieved non-GAAP profitability for the first time in our history and a quarter earlier than expected,” said Lew Cirne, CEO and founder, New Relic. “Our strong results stem from continued strength in our Enterprise business and platform strategy, as the world’s most innovative companies turn to New Relic to help them accelerate their digital initiatives.”\nThird Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nRevenue of $91.8 million, growing 35% year-over-year, and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2018. GAAP loss from operations was $(8.0) million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $(13.9) million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP income from operations was $2.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a loss of $(4.9) million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP net loss per basic and diluted share was $(0.14) for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 based on 55.2 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to $(0.27) for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 based on 52.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net income per basic and diluted share was $0.05 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a loss of $(0.09) per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $233.0 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $227.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCustomer Highlights:\nPaid Business Accounts as of December 31, 2017 of over 16,600, compared to over 14,900 as of December 31, 2016. $100K+ Paid Business Accounts as of December 31, 2017 of 629, compared to 478 as of December 31, 2016. 52% of ARR from Enterprise Paid Business Accounts as of December 31, 2017, compared to 44% as of December 31, 2016. Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 of 125%, in-line with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. New or expanded customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included: 23andMe, American Eagle Outfitters, Ascend Learning, Barrick Gold Corp., Blackboard, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc., Caribou Coffee, Coupa Software, Cox Enterprises, Dominos Pizza Enterprises, John Lewis plc, McCormick & Company, House of Blues Entertainment, Ocado, Office Depot Europe B.V., Provident Financial plc, Publishers Clearing House, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Royal Schiphol Group, Shopify, U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc., West Corp. and Zipcar.\nThird Quarter & Recent Business Highlights:\nRanked on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500™, a ranking of the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies in North America. Announced new product capabilities, customer enablement, and best practice guidance for organizations leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) through their cloud journey. Hosted FutureStack Global Tour event in Sydney on October 24, with participation from Australia’s most innovative teams that build and run modern digital businesses and hands-on product training to prepare for New Relic APM certification.\nOutlook:\nNew Relic is initiating its outlook for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as updating its outlook for the full fiscal year 2018. New Relic has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP income (loss) from operations or non-GAAP net income (loss) per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measure as a result of uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation, lawsuit litigation expenses and employer payroll taxes on equity incentive plans. Accordingly, reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to New Relic’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook: Revenue between $95.0 million and $96.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of between 30% and 32%, respectively. Non-GAAP income from operations of between $2.0 million and $3.0 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share of between $0.04 and $0.05. This assumes 58.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Updated Full Year Fiscal 2018 Outlook: Revenue between $351.6 million and $353.1 million, representing year-over-year growth of between 33% and 34%, and an increase from prior guidance of between $346.5 million and $349.5 million that was issued on November 7, 2017. Non-GAAP loss from operations of between $(3.3) million and $(4.3) million, an improvement from prior guidance of between $(13.0) million and $(14.0) million that was issued on November 7, 2017. Non-GAAP net loss per basic share of between $(0.04) and $(0.06), an improvement from prior guidance of between $(0.21) and $(0.22) that was issued on November 7, 2017. This assumes 55.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding.\nConference Call Details:\nWhat: New Relic financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2018 and outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2018 When: February 6, 2018 at 2:00 P.M.

Copies of these documents may be obtained by visiting New Relic’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.newrelic.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nNew Relic assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNew Relic discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures in this release and the earnings call referencing this press release: non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and free cash flow. New Relic uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate New Relic’s financial performance. New Relic believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating its operational performance, as further discussed below. New Relic’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on New Relic’s reported financial results.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nNew Relic defines non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP sales and marketing, non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP general and administrative, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) as the respective GAAP balances, adjusted for: (1) stock-based compensation expense, (2) amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in software development costs, (3) the amortization of purchased intangibles, (4) the transaction costs related to acquisition, (5) lawsuit litigation expense, and (6) employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans, as applicable. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is calculated as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by weighted average shares used to compute net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders. New Relic defines free cash flow as GAAP cash from operations, minus capital expenditures, minus capitalized software.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing New Relic's operating performance due to the following factors:\nStock-based compensation and amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in software development costs: New Relic utilizes share-based compensation to attract and retain employees. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period. As a result, share-based compensation expenses vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in any particular period.\nAmortization of purchased intangibles and transaction costs related to acquisition. New Relic views amortization of purchased intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are evaluated for impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Similarly, New Relic views acquisition related expenses as events that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period.\nLawsuit litigation expense. New Relic may from time to time incur charges or benefits that are outside of the ordinary course of New Relic’s business related to litigation. New Relic believes it is useful to exclude such charges or benefits because it does not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operation of New Relic's business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the matter.\nEmployer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans. New Relic excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of New Relic's common stock at the time of vesting or exercise. As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period independent of the financial and operating performance of New Relic’s business.\nAdditionally, New Relic's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures and the capitalization of software development costs due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations.\nOperating Metrics\nNew Relic’s dollar-based net expansion rate compares its recurring subscription revenue from customers from one period to the next. It is increased when customers increase their use of New Relic’s products, use additional products, or upgrade to a higher subscription tier. New Relic’s dollar-based net expansion rate is reduced when customers decrease their use of New Relic’s products, use fewer products, or downgrade to a lower subscription tier.\nNew Relic's monthly recurring revenue represents the revenue that New Relic would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following month, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions. Similarly, annual recurring revenue represents the revenue that New Relic would contractually expect to receive from those customers over the following 12-month period, without any increase or reduction in any of their subscriptions.\nNew Relic defines the number of paid business accounts at the end of any particular period as the number of accounts at the end of the period as identified by a unique account identifier for which New Relic has recognized revenue on the last day of the period indicated. New Relic defines an enterprise paid business account as a paid business account that New Relic measures to have over 1,000 employees.\nNew Relic is a registered trademark of New Relic, Inc.\nAll product and company names herein may be trademarks of their registered owners.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (In thousands, except per share data;
