The weighted average (by rentable square feet) lease term for leases entered during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 5.1 years. Leasing concessions and capital commitments for new and renewal leases entered during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $5.6 million, or $2.11 per square foot, per lease year. GOV's leasing during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 included approximately 279,000 square feet entered with government tenants for a weighted average (by rentable square feet) lease term of 5.5 years, weighted average (by rentable square feet) rents that were 8.0% higher than prior rents for the same space and leasing concessions and capital commitments of $1.25 per square foot per weighted average lease year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, 94.2% of GOV’s total rentable square feet was leased, compared to 95.0% as of September 30, 2017 and 95.1% as of December 31, 2016.

FFO available for common shareholders is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is net income (loss) available for common shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization of consolidated properties and its proportionate share of the real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint venture properties and the difference between FFO attributable to an equity investment and equity in earnings of an equity investee but excluding impairment charges on and increases in the carrying value of real estate assets, any gain or loss on sale of real estate, as well as certain other adjustments currently not applicable to GOV. GOV's calculation of Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differs from Nareit's definition of FFO available for common shareholders because GOV includes Select Income REIT's, or SIR's, Normalized FFO attributable to GOV's equity investment in SIR (net of FFO attributable to GOV's equity investment in SIR), GOV includes business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being indicative of GOV's core operating performance and the uncertainty as to whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the calendar year and GOV excludes acquisition related costs expensed under GAAP, gains and losses on issuance of shares by SIR and gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt. GOV considers FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income (loss), net income (loss) available for GOV's common shareholders and operating income. GOV believes that FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders may facilitate a comparison of GOV's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders are among the factors considered by GOV's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to GOV's shareholders. Other factors include, but are not limited to, requirements to maintain GOV's qualification for taxation as a REIT, limitations in GOV's credit agreement and public debt covenants, the availability to GOV of debt and equity capital, GOV's expectation of its future capital requirements and operating performance, GOV's receipt of distributions from SIR and GOV's expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders or operating income as indicators of GOV's operating performance or as measures of GOV's liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders and operating income as presented in GOV's Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate FFO available for common shareholders and Normalized FFO available for common shareholders differently than GOV does.\nGovernment Properties Income Trust Calculation and Reconciliation of Consolidated Property Net Operating Income (NOI) and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI (1)\n(amounts in thousands) (unaudited)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Calculation of Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI (2) : Rental income (3) $ 107,170 $ 66,030 $ 316,532 $ 258,180 Property operating expenses (41,077 ) (26,091 ) (124,289 ) (102,262 ) Consolidated Property NOI 66,093 39,939 192,243 155,918 Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (2,467 ) (902 ) (5,582 ) (2,691 ) Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 901 355 2,764 1,457 Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) (484 ) (484 ) Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI $ 64,406 $ 39,271 $ 188,941 $ 154,200 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Available for Common Shareholders to Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI: Net income (loss) available for common shareholders $ (18,266 ) $ 12,065 $ 11,815 $ 57,843 Preferred units of limited partnership distributions 275 — 275 — Net income (loss) (17,991 ) 12,065 12,090 57,843 Gain on sale of real estate — — — (79 ) Income (loss) before gain on sale of real estate (17,991 ) 12,065 12,090 57,764 Income (loss) from discontinued operations — 160 (173 ) 589 Income (loss) from continuing operations (17,991 ) 12,225 11,917 58,353 Equity in earnings of investees (767 ) (7,516 ) (21,571 ) (35,518 ) Income tax expense 36 38 101 101 Net (gain) loss on issuance of shares by SIR — 2 (72 ) (86 ) (Gain) loss on early extinguishment of debt — — 1,715 (104 ) Interest expense 21,807 12,774 65,406 45,060 Interest income (119 ) (95 ) (1,962 ) (158 ) Dividend income (304 ) (304 ) (1,216 ) (971 ) Operating income 2,662 17,124 54,318 66,677 General and administrative 6,532 3,547 18,847 14,897 Acquisition related costs — 828 — 1,191 Loss on impairment of real estate 9,260 — 9,490 — Depreciation and amortization 47,639 18,440 109,588 73,153 Consolidated Property NOI 66,093 39,939 192,243 155,918 Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) (484 ) (484 ) Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 901 355 2,764 1,457 Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (2,467 ) (902 ) (5,582 ) (2,691 ) Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI $ 64,406 $ 39,271 $ 188,941 $ 154,200 Reconciliation of Consolidated Property NOI to Same Property NOI (5)(6) : Rental income $ 107,170 $ 66,030 $ 316,532 $ 258,180 Property operating expenses (41,077 ) (26,091 ) (124,289 ) (102,262 ) Consolidated Property NOI 66,093 39,939 192,243 155,918 Less: NOI of properties not included in same property results (26,114 ) (331 ) (40,422 ) (4,995 ) Same property NOI $ 39,979 $ 39,608 $ 151,821 $ 150,923 Calculation of Same Property Cash Basis NOI (5)(6) : Same property NOI $ 39,979 $ 39,608 $ 151,821 $ 150,923 Add: Lease value amortization included in rental income (3) 377 354 1,678 1,496 Less: Non-cash straight line rent adjustments included in rental income (3) (142 ) (879 ) (2,464 ) (2,362 ) Non-cash amortization included in property operating expenses (4) (121 ) (121 ) (483 ) (483 ) Same property Cash Basis NOI $ 40,093 $ 38,962 $ 150,552 $ 149,574 (1)\nGOV calculates Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI as shown above. The calculations of Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI exclude certain components of net income (loss) available for common shareholders in order to provide results that are more closely related to GOV's consolidated property level results of operations. GOV defines Consolidated Property NOI as consolidated income from its rental of real estate less its consolidated property operating expenses. Consolidated Property NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that GOV records as depreciation and amortization. GOV defines Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI as Consolidated Property NOI excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value amortization and non-cash amortization included in other operating expenses. GOV considers Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income (loss) available for common shareholders because they may help both investors and management to understand the operations of GOV's consolidated properties. GOV uses Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual and company wide consolidated property level performance, and GOV believes that Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI provide useful information to investors regarding GOV's results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of GOV's operating performance between periods and with other REITs. Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders or operating income as indicators of GOV's operating performance or as measures of its liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss), net income (loss) available for common shareholders and operating income as presented in GOV's Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate Consolidated Property NOI and Consolidated Property Cash Basis NOI differently than GOV does.\n(2)\nExcludes one property (one building) classified as discontinued operations which was sold on August 31, 2017.\n(3)\nGOV reports rental income on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases; as a result, rental income includes non-cash straight line rent adjustments. Rental income also includes expense reimbursements, tax escalations, parking revenues, service income and other fixed and variable charges paid to GOV by its tenants, as well as the net effect of non-cash amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities.\n(4)\nGOV recorded a liability for the amount by which the estimated fair value for accounting purposes exceeded the price GOV paid for its investment in RMR common stock in June 2015. A portion of this liability is being amortized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2035 as a reduction to property management fees expense, which is included in property operating expenses.\n(5)\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI are based on consolidated properties GOV owned as of December 31, 2017 and which it owned continuously since October 1, 2016.\n(6)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, same property NOI and same property Cash Basis NOI are based on consolidated properties GOV owned as of December 31, 2017 and which it owned continuously since January 1, 2016.\nGovernment Properties Income Trust Consolidated Balance Sheets (amounts in thousands, except share data) (unaudited) As of December 31, 2017 2016 ASSETS Real estate properties: Land $ 627,108 $ 267,855 Buildings and improvements 2,348,613 1,620,905 Total real estate properties, gross 2,975,721 1,888,760 Accumulated depreciation (341,848 ) (296,804 ) Total real estate properties, net 2,633,873 1,591,956 Equity investment in Select Income REIT 467,499 487,708 Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 50,202 — Assets of discontinued operations — 12,541 Acquired real estate leases, net 351,872 124,848 Cash and cash equivalents 16,569 29,941 Restricted cash 3,111 530 Rents receivable, net 61,429 48,458 Deferred leasing costs, net 22,977 21,079 Other assets, net 96,033 68,005 Total assets $ 3,703,565 $ 2,385,066 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Unsecured revolving credit facility $ 570,000 $ 160,000 Unsecured term loans, net 547,852 547,171 Senior unsecured notes, net 944,140 646,844 Mortgage notes payable, net 183,100 27,837 Liabilities of discontinued operations — 45 Accounts payable and other liabilities 89,440 54,019 Due to related persons 4,859 3,520 Assumed real estate lease obligations, net 13,635 10,626 Total liabilities 2,353,026 1,450,062 Commitments and contingencies Preferred units of limited partnership 20,496 — Shareholders’ equity: Common shares of beneficial interest, $.01 par value: 150,000,000 and 100,000,000 shares authorized, respectively, 99,145,921 and 71,177,906 shares issued and outstanding, respectively 991 712 Additional paid in capital 1,968,217 1,473,533 Cumulative net income 108,144 96,329 Cumulative other comprehensive income 60,427 26,957 Cumulative common distributions (807,736 ) (662,527 ) Total shareholders’ equity 1,330,043 935,004 Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 3,703,565 $ 2,385,066 A Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq.\nNo shareholder, Trustee or officer is personally liable for any act or obligation of the Trust.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226005451/en/\nGovernment Properties Income Trust\nChristopher Ranjitkar, 617-219-1410\nDirector, Investor Relations\nSource: Government Properties Income Trust",
