    "text": "Apple and these other notable stocks are already in a correction Stocks in correction territory include AT&T, General Motors and Macy's. Apple dropped roughly 4.5 percent Friday after falling short of Wall Street expectations in its latest earnings report on Thursday. Marlene Awaad | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook \nApple's stock hit correction territory Friday after falling more than 10 percent from its 52-week high, but the massive tech company isn't alone in its gloomy performance. \nDozens of other household companies are also down more than 10 percent from their own yearly highs. \nThe downtrend in many of these stocks was exacerbated Friday after the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 666, marking the index's sixth-largest points decline ever. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 fell more than 2 percent. \nOther companies currently in a correction include telecommunications giant AT&T , down 11 percent, automaker General Motors , down 12 percent, and retailer Macy's , down 27 percent.",
