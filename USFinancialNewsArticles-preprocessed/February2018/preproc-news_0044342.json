    "text": "SAN DIEGO, Feb. 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Shareholder Rights Law Firm Johnson Fistel, LLP announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers who purchased shares of the LJM Preservation and Growth Fund from February 28, 2015 through February 7, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for LJM investors under the federal securities laws.\nClass I: (NASDAQ: LJMIX)\nClass A: (NASDAQ: LJMAX)\nClass C: (NASDAQ: LJMCX)\nIf you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 10, 2018. If you wish to discuss this action, have any questions concerning this notice, or your rights or interests, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471. If you email, please include your phone number. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.\nAccording to the lawsuit, during the Class Period defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (1) LJM was not focused on capital preservation and left investors exposed to an unacceptably high risk of catastrophic losses; (2) LJM had not taken appropriate steps to preserve capital in down markets.\nAbout Johnson Fistel, LLP:\nJohnson Fistel, LLP is a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm with offices in California, New York and Georgia.
