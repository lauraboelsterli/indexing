    "text": "16 COMMENTS A base jean is selected to receive the laser design treatment. Levi Strauss invented blue jeans more than a century ago. Now, it is trying to automate the way they are made.\nThe brand’s parent company, LS & Co., plans to use lasers to create the holes, fraying and fading that give trendy jeans their worn look, a previously labor-intensive process that required garment workers to brush the fabric with sandpaper, rotary tools and chemicals. A laser can finish a pair of jeans in 90 seconds, compared with up to 20 minutes for hand-finishing.\nThe new technology will cut the production and distribution cycle in half, enabling the San Francisco-based company to better match supply with demand. The goal: reducing end-of-season markdowns. \nBart Sights, head of Levi’s Eureka Innovation Lab in San Francisco, stands over two similar pairs of jeans. The one on the left is 50 years old and the one on the right has been aged entirely by laser. Photo: Christie Hemm Klok for The Wall for The Wall Street Journal Garment makers are moving to automate their factories as wages, even in low-cost producing countries such as Bangladesh, creep higher. Laser technology has been around for roughly 15 years. But until now, denim distressed with lasers still required some form of hand finishing.\n“The difference with our approach is there will be no manual application,” said Bart Sights, the company’s vice president of technical innovation. \nThe lasers, which etch off layers of fiber, reduce the number of steps in denim manufacturing to three from as many as 20, he added. LS & Co. expects that almost all of Levi’s jeans will be made using the laser technology by 2020, a company spokeswoman said.\nAutomation is finally coming into fashion, with sewing robots that can produce clothes faster than human hands. In this episode of Moving Upstream, WSJ’s Jason Bellini takes a look at the latest technology and what it means for the 60 million people who work in the garment industry. Photo: Ismail Ferdous for The Wall Street Journal Levi Strauss, one of the biggest denim makers, had annual sales of $4.9 billion in its recently completed fiscal year, up 8% from the prior year. The company owns two factories, one in Plock, Poland, and the other in Cape Town, South Africa, but it produces the bulk of its goods at third-party factories around the world. It also has a small “Made in the USA” collection that is produced domestically.\nThe company partnered with Jeanologia, a Spanish technology company, to upgrade its existing laser technology, which will be rolled out by its suppliers in coming years. It also developed software that allows its designers to create the holes, whiskers and other detailing on a computer and send a digital prototype to factories with the push of a button. \nWith the automated system, the finishing is done after the denim is washed, which allows Levi Strauss to make last-minute style changes. Once the jeans go into production, they can arrive in warehouses in three months, down from six months.\nAnother benefit: The number of chemicals used in production will fall to a few dozen from 1,000.\nA manager in LS & Co.’s technical innovation department adjusts the design intended for the laser. Apparel International Inc., a Mexican supplier of Levi’s denim, has been testing the new method on a small percentage of its production. Its president, Oscar Gonzalez, said he expects the factory to scale up over the next two years and be fully manufacturing with the new technology by 2020.\nCurrently, about 15% of the Torreón factory’s 4,500 employees work in hand finishing. That number is expected to drop with the switch to fully automated lasers. But Mr. Gonzalez isn’t expecting wide-scale layoffs. “We’ll re-deploy people to other processes,” he said.\nEven with the automation, Levi Strauss has no plans in the near term to move production back to the U.S. on a wide scale. It has opened a finishing center in Las Vegas, but that facility, which employs roughly 50 people, is handling a “very small part of our global production,” said Liz O’Neill, the company’s chief supply-chain officer.\nVarious designs can be etched onto the same base jean, resulting in a very different finished look.
