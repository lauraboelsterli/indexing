    "text": "Reported earnings per share of $1.35 vs. $1.32 in 2016 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act results in $3.1 million charge in 2017 Invested a record $478 million to improve infrastructure systems Announces 2018 guidance range of $1.37 to $1.42 earnings per diluted common share\nBRYN MAWR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aqua America Inc. (NYSE: WTR) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2017, and announced its earnings guidance for 2018.\nFull-year 2017 Operating Results\nAqua reported total operating revenues of $809.5 million in 2017 compared to $819.9 million in the prior year. Regulated segment revenues increased to $804.9 million, compared to $800.1 million in 2016. Rates and surcharges, regulated growth and other items increased regulated revenue by approximately $14.4 million compared to 2016. A decrease in water consumption and market-based activities lowered revenue by $9.4 and $15.3 million, respectively.\nOperations and maintenance expenses were $287.2 million for 2017, compared to $304.9 million in 2016. Reduced market-based activities and lower production costs decreased operations and maintenance expenses by $21.9 million. Higher costs associated with regulated acquisitions and other expenses offset the reduction in expenses by $8.0 million.\nFor the full-year 2017, Aqua reported net income of $239.7 million, or $1.35 per share, compared to $234.2 million, or $1.32 per share, in 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enactment in December 2017 resulted in a non-cash charge to income tax expense of $3.1 million.\n“In 2017, Aqua continued to deliver on our long-term growth strategy by making significant investment in rehabilitating aged infrastructure and by building our pipeline of pending municipal acquisitions,” said Aqua America Chairman and CEO Christopher Franklin. “By focusing on the company’s core strengths, Aqua continues to be part of the solution to our nation’s deteriorating infrastructure, while also delivering long-term value to shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nRevenues increased to $203.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $196.8 million in the same quarter of 2016. Rates and surcharge revenue, consumption growth, regulated growth and other factors increased revenue by $8.8 million. Lower revenue from market-based activities offset the increase by $2.3 million.\nOperations and maintenance expenses were $79.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $77.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reduced market-based activities and lower production costs decreased operations and maintenance expenses by $6.0 million. Increasing costs associated with employee-related expenses, regulated acquisitions and other factors offset the reduction in expenses by $7.7 million.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Aqua reported net income of $53.5 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to $49.6 million, or $0.28 per share, in 2016. Reported results reflect the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which resulted in a non-cash charge to income tax expense of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn 2017, Aqua invested a record of $478 million to improve its infrastructure systems. The company expects to invest approximately $500 million in 2018 and approximately $1.4 billion from 2018 to 2020. The capital investments made to rehabilitate and expand the infrastructure of the communities Aqua serves are paramount to helping the company to protect and provide Earth’s most essential resource.\nDividend\nOn Feb. 5, 2018 Aqua America’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.2047 per share of common stock. This dividend is payable on March 1, 2018, to all shareholders of record on Feb. 16, 2018. The March dividend marks the 73rd year Aqua has paid a consecutive quarterly dividend.\nRate Activity\nIn 2017, Aqua America’s regulated subsidiaries received rate awards and infrastructure surcharges in Indiana, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia, estimated to increase annualized revenues by approximately $21.6 million.\nTo date in 2018, the company’s state subsidiaries in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio have received rate awards or infrastructure surcharges totaling $11.1 million. Additionally, the company currently has rate proceedings pending in Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia of $15.8 million. The timing and extent to which the rate increases might be granted can vary by the applicable regulatory agency, and the outcome of these filings are expected to consider the effects of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nAcquisition Growth in Regulated Operations\nIn 2017, the company invested $5.9 million to acquire four water and wastewater systems. Acquisitions added approximately 1,000 new customers to the company’s operating footprint. Coupled with organic growth, the company increased its customer base by 1 percent with 10,584 new customer connections. The company currently has six purchase agreements with municipal systems, which are expected to close in 2018 and represent more than 16,000 new customers. The company expects overall customer growth to be between 2 and 3 percent for 2018.\n“In 2017, we continued to build on our consistent record of serving more customers each year, which allows us greater economies of scale throughout our footprint. The six pending acquisitions along with organic growth would add more than 25,000 customers to our customer base in 2018,” said Franklin. “We remain very optimistic about the prospect of being a water and wastewater solution for an increasing number of customers.”\nFinancial Information\nAt year-end 2017, Aqua America’s weighted average cost of fixed-rate long-term debt was 4.36 percent and the company had $302 million available on its credit lines.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included a reduction to the corporate federal income tax rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, was signed into law. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, in accordance with accounting standards Aqua America revalued its deferred income tax assets and liabilities at the new 21 percent federal income tax rate. This revaluation resulted in the recognition of both regulatory liabilities, to the extent that the tax savings over time will be passed back to customers in utility customer rates, and a non-cash adjustment was recognized to record additional income tax expense of $3.1 million to the extent revalued deferred income taxes are not believed to be recoverable in utility customer rates.\n2018 Guidance Highlights\nAqua America has issued the following 2018 full-year guidance and expects to achieve the following results:\nEarnings per diluted common share of $1.37 to $1.42 Infrastructure investments of approximately $500 million in 2018 for communities served by Aqua Infrastructure investments of approximately $1.4 billion through 2020 in existing operations to improve and strengthen systems Total customer growth of between 2 and 3 percent Aqua Pennsylvania files a rate case in 2018 with resolution in 2019\n“Our 2018 guidance reflects the strong environment for growth that we are seeing as many municipalities recognize the benefits that can be attained by partnering with a large, professional water and wastewater provider,” Franklin said. “We expect this trend to continue as a result of the adoption of fair market value legislation and the national need for companies with our scale, expertise and capital to address the country’s pressing need for infrastucture improvements.”\nAqua America does not guarantee future results of any kind. Guidance is subject to risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those factors outlined in the “Forward Looking Statements” of this release and the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nEarnings and Guidance Event Information\nDate: Feb. 28, 2018\nTime: 12:15 p.m. EST\nWebcast and slide presentation link: http://ir.aquaamerica.com/events.cfm\nThe presentation will be webcast live so that interested parties may listen over the Internet by logging on to AquaAmerica.com and following the link for Investor Relations.
